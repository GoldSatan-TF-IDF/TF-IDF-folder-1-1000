jeffrey archer hell the first book in the prison diary series to foulweather friends invictus out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to pole i thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul in the fell clutch of circumstance i have not winced or cried aloud under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody but unbowed beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid it matters not how strait the gate how charged with punishments the scroll i am the master of my fate i am the captain of my soul william ernest henley volume one belmarsh hell day thursday july pm you are sentenced to four years mr justice potts stares down from the bench unable to hide his delight he orders me to be taken down a securicor man who was sitting beside me while the verdict was read out points towards a door on my left which has not been opened during the sevenweek trial i turn and glance at my wife mary seated at the back of the court head bowed ashenfaced a son on either side to comfort her im led downstairs to be met by a court official and thus i begin an endless process of formfilling name archer age weight lbs i tell him whats that in stones the prison officer demands st lbs i reply i only know because i weighed myself in the gym this morning thank you sir he says and asks me to sign on the bottom of the page another securicor man known by the prisoners as waterrats leads me down a long bleak creampainted bricked corridor to i know not where how long did he give you he asks matteroffactly four years i reply oh not too bad youll be out in two he responds as if discussing a fortnight on the costa del sol the officer comes to a halt unlocks a vast steel door and then ushers me into a cell the room is about ten feet by five the walls are still cream and there is a wooden bench running along the far end no clock no sense of time nothing to do except contemplate nothing to read except messages on the walls a key is turning in the lock and the heavy door swings open the securicor man has returned you have a visit from your legals he announces i am marched back down the long corridor barred gates are unlocked and locked every few paces then i am ushered into a room only slightly larger than the cell to find my silk nicholas purnell qc and his junior alex cameron awaiting me nick explains that four years means two and mr justice potts chose a custodial sentence aware that i would be unable to appeal to the parole board for early release of course they will appeal on my behalf as they feel potts has gone way over the top gilly gray qc an old friend had warned me the previous evening that as the jury had been out for five days and i had not entered the witness box to defend myself an appeal might not be received too favourably nick adds that in any case my appeal will not be considered before christmas as only short sentences are dealt with quickly nick goes on to tell me that belmarsh prison in woolwich will be my first destination at least its a modern jail he comments although he warns me that his abiding memory of the place was the constant noise so he feared i wouldnt sleep for the first few nights after a couple of weeks he feels confident i will be transferred to a category d prison an open prison probably ford or the isle of sheppey nick explains that he has to leave me and return to court no to make an application for compassionate leave so that i can attend my mothers funeral on saturday she died on the day the jury retired to consider their verdict and i am only thankful that she never heard me sentenced i thank nick and alex for all they have done and am then escorted back to my cell the vast iron door is slammed shut the prison officers dont have to lock it only unlock it as there is no handle on the inside i sit on the wooden bench to be reminded that jim dexter is inocent ok my mind is curiously blank as i try to take in what has happened and what will happen next the door is unlocked again about fifteen minutes later as far as i can judge and im taken to a signingout room to fill in yet another set of forms a large burly officer who only grunts takes away my money clip in cash my credit card and a fountain pen he places them in a plastic bag they are sealed before he asks where would you like them sent i give the officer marys name and our home address after ive signed two more forms in triplicate im handcuffed to an overweight woman of around five foot three a cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth they are obviously not anticipating any trouble she is wearing the official uniform of the prison service a white shirt black tie black trousers black shoes and black socks she accompanies me out of the building and on to an elongated white van not unlike a singledecker bus except that the windows are blacked out i am placed in what i could only describe as a cubicle known to the recidivists as a sweatbox and although i can see outside the waiting press cannot see me in any case they have no idea which cubicle im in cameras flash pointlessly in front of each window as we wait to move off another long wait before i hear a prisoner shout i think archers in this van eventually the vehicle jerks forward and moves slowly out of the old bailey courtyard on the first leg of a long circuitous journey to hmp belmarsh as we travel slowly through the streets of the city i spot an evening standard billboard already in place archer sent to jail it looks as if it was printed some time before the verdict i am well acquainted with the journey the van is taking through london as mary and i follow the same route home to cambridge on friday evenings except on this occasion we suddenly turn right off the main road and into a little backstreet to be greeted by another bevy of pressmen but like their colleagues at the old bailey all they can get is a photograph of a large white van with ten small black windows as we draw up to the entrance gate i see a sign declaring belmarsh prison some wag has put a line through the b and replaced it with an h not the most propitious of welcomes we drive through two highbarred gates that are electronically operated before the van comes to a halt in a courtyard surrounded by a thirtyfoot redbrick wall with razor wire looped along the top i once read that this is the only topsecurity prison in britain from which no one has ever escaped i look up at the wall and recall that the world record for the pole vault is ft in the door of the van is opened and we are let out one by one before being led off to a reception area and then herded into a large glass cell that holds about twenty people the authorities cant risk putting that many prisoners in the same room without being able to see exactly what were up to this will often be the first time codefendants have a chance to speak to each other since they were sentenced i sit on a bench on the far side of the wall and am joined by a tall welldressed goodlooking young pakistani who explains that he is not a prisoner but on remand i ask him what hes been charged with gbh grievous bodily harm i beat up my wife when i found her in bed with another man and now theyve banged me up in belmarsh because the trial cant begin until she gets back from greece where the two of them are on holiday i recall nick purnells parting words dont believe anything anyone tells you in prison and never discuss your case or your appeal archer yells a voice i leave the glass cell and return to reception where i am told to fill out another form name age height weight the prison officer behind the counter demands archer ft lbs whats that in stones he asks st lbs i tell him and he fills in yet another little square box right go next door archer where youll find my colleague waiting for you this time i am met by two officers one standing one sitting behind a desk the one behind the desk asks me to stand under an arc light and strip the two officers try to carry out the entire exercise as humanely as possible first i take off my jacket then my tie followed by my shirt aquascutum hilditch key and ysl says the officer who is standing up while the other writes this information down in the appropriate box the first officer then asks me to raise my arms above my head and turn a complete circle while a video camera attached to the wall whirrs away in the background my shirt is returned but they hold on to my house of commons cufflinks they hand back my jacket but not my tie i am then asked to slip off my shoes socks trousers and pants churchs aquascutum and calvin klein he announces i complete another circle and this time the officer asks me to lift the soles of my feet for inspection he explains that drugs are sometimes concealed under plasters i tell them ive never taken a drug in my life he shows no interest they return my pants trousers socks and shoes but not my leather belt is this yours he asks pointing to a yellow backpack on the table beside me no ive never seen it before i tell him he checks the label william archer he says sorry it must be my sons the officer pulls open the zip to reveal two shirts two pairs of pants a sweater a pair of casual shoes and a washbag containing everything i will need the washbag is immediately confiscated while the rest of the clothes are placed in a line on the counter the officer then hands me a large plastic bag with hmp belmarsh printed in dark blue letters supported by a crown everything has a logo nowadays while i transfer the possessions i am allowed to keep into the large plastic bag the officer tells me that the yellow backpack will be returned to my son at the governments expense i thank him he looks surprised another officer escorts me back to the glass cell while i cling onto my plastic bag this time i sit next to a different prisoner who tells me his name is ashmil hes from kosovo and still in the middle of his trial what are you charged with i enquire the illegal importing of immigrants he tells me and before i can offer any comment he adds theyre all political prisoners who would be in jail or worse if they were still in their own country it sounds like a wellrehearsed line what are you in for he asks archer rings out the same officious voice and i leave him to return to the reception area the doctor will see you now the desk officer says pointing to a green door behind him i dont know why im surprised to encounter a freshfaced young gp who rises from behind his desk the moment i walk in david haskins he announces and adds im sorry we have to meet in these circumstances i take a seat on the other side of the desk while he opens a drawer and produces yet another form do you smoke no drink no unless you count the occasional glass of red wine at dinner take any drugs no do you have any history of mental illness no have you ever tried to abuse yourself no he continues through a series of questions as if he were doing no more than filling in details for an insurance policy to which i continue to reply no no no no and no he ticks every box although i dont think its necessary he said looking down at the form im going to put you in the medical wing overnight before the governor decides which block to put you on i smile as the medical wing sounds to me like a more pleasant option he doesnt return the smile we shake hands and i go back to the glass cell i only have to wait for a few more moments before a young lady in prison uniform asks me to accompany her to the medical wing i grab my plastic bag and follow her we climb three floors of green iron steps before we reach our destination as i walk down the long corridor my heart sinks every person i come across seems to be in an advanced state of depression or suffering from some sort of mental illness why have they put me in here i demand but she doesnt reply i later learn that most firsttime offenders spend their first night in the medical centre because it is during your first twentyfour hours in prison that you are most likely to try and commit suicide ftnref people committed suicide in british prisons in of them were firsttime offenders over prisoners attempted hanging strangulation or suffocation in a rise of per cent over the figures im not as i thought i might be placed in a hospital ward but in another cell when the door slams behind me i begin to understand why one might contemplate suicide the cell measures five paces by three and this time the brick walls are painted a depressing mauve in one corner is a single bed with a rockhard mattress that could well be an army reject against the side wall opposite the bed is a small square steel table and a steel chair on the far wall next to the inchthick iron door is a steel washbasin and an open lavatory that has no lid and no flush i am determined not to use it ftnref there are no wooden items in the cell as firstnight prisoners often smash up everything on the wall behind the bed is a window encased with four thick iron bars painted black and caked in dirt no curtains no curtain rail stark cold and unwelcoming would be a generous description of my temporary residence on the medical wing no wonder the doctor didnt return my smile i am left alone in this bleak abode for over an hour by which time im beginning to experience a profound depression a key finally turns in the lock to allow another young woman to enter she is darkhaired short and slim dressed in a smart striped suit she shakes me warmly by the hand sits on the end of the bed and introduces herself as ms roberts the deputy governor she cant be a day over twentysix what am i doing here i ask im not a mass murderer most prisoners spend their first night on the medical wing she explains and we cant make any exceptions im afraid and especially not for you i dont say anything what is there to say one more form to complete she tells me thats if you still want to attend your mothers funeral on saturday ftnref nick purnell qc asked mr justice potts if i could be excused from the court to be with my mother he refused our request a second request was made at the beginning of the afternoon session which he reluctantly agreed to i reached my mothers bedside an hour before she died i can sense that ms roberts is trying hard to be understanding and considerate but i fear i am quite unable to hide my distress you will be moved onto an induction block tomorrow she assures me and just as soon as youve been categorized a b c or d well transfer you to another prison i have no doubt youll be category d no previous convictions and no history of violence she rises from the end of the bed every officer carries a large bunch of keys that jingle whenever they move ill see you again in the morning have you been able to make a phone call she asks as she bangs on the heavy door with the palm of her hand no i reply as the cell door is opened by a large west indian with an even larger smile then ill see what i can do she promises before stepping out into the corridor and slamming the door closed behind her i sit on the end of the bed and rummage through my plastic bag to discover that my elder son william has included amongst my permitted items a copy of david nivens the moons a balloon i flick open the cover to find a message hope you never have to read this dad but if you do chin up we love you and your appeal is on its way william xx james xx thank god for a family i adore and who still seem to care about me im not sure how i would have got through the last few weeks without them they made so many sacrifices to be with me for every day of the sevenweek trial there is a rap on the cell door and a steel grille that resembles a large letter box is pulled up to reveal the grinning west indian im lester he declares as he pushes through a pillow rock hard one pillow case mauve followed by one sheet green and one blanket brown i thank lester and then take some considerable time making the bed after all theres nothing else to do when ive completed the task i sit on the bed and start trying to read the moons a balloon but my mind continually wanders i manage about fifty pages often stopping to consider the jurys verdict and although i feel tired even exhausted i cant begin to think about sleep the promised phone call has not materialized so i finally turn off the fluorescent light that shines above the bed place my head on the rockhard pillow and despite the agonizing cries of the patients from the cells on either side of me i eventually fall asleep an hour later im woken again when the fluorescent light is switched back on the letter box reopens and two different eyes peer in at me a procedure that is repeated every hour on the hour to make sure i havent tried to take my own life the suicide watch i eventually fall asleep again and when i wake just after am i lie on my back in a straight line because both my ears are aching after hours on the rockhard pillow i think about the verdict and the fact that it had never crossed my mind even for a moment that the jury could find francis innocent and me guilty of the same charge how could we have conspired if one of us didnt realize a conspiracy was taking place they also appeared to accept the word of my former secretary angie peppiatt a woman who stole thousands of pounds from me while deceiving me and my family for years eventually i turn my mind to the future determined not to waste an hour i decide to write a daily diary of everything i experience while incarcerated at am i rise from my mean bed and rummage around in my plastic bag yes what i need is there and this time the authorities have not determined that it should be returned to sender thank god for a son who had the foresight to include amongst other necessities an a pad and six felttip pens two hours later i have completed the first draft of everything that has happened to me since i was sent to jail day friday july am i am woken officially my little trapdoor is opened and i am greeted by the same warm west indian grin which turns to a look of surprise when he sees me sitting at the table writing ive already been at work for nearly two hours youll be able to have a shower in a few minutes he announces ive already worked out that in prison a few minutes can be anything up to an hour so i go on writing anything you need he asks politely would it be possible to have some more writing paper not something im often asked for he admits but ill see what i can do lester returns half an hour later and this time the grin has turned into a shy smile he slips an a pad not unlike the type i always use through the little steel trap in return he asks me for six autographs only one to be personalized for his daughter michelle lester doesnt offer any explanation for why he needs the other five all to be penned on separate sheets of paper as no money can change hands in jail we return to thirteenthcentury england and rely on bartering i cant imagine what five jeffrey archer signatures are worth a packet of cigarettes perhaps but i am grateful for this trade because i have a feeling that being allowed to write in this hellhole may turn out to be the one salvation that will keep me sane while i wait for lester to return and escort me from my cell to a shower even a walk down a long drab corridor is something i am looking forward to i continue writing at last i hear a key turning and look up to see the heavy door swing open which brings its own small sense of freedom lester hands me a thin green towel a prison toothbrush and a tube of prison toothpaste before locking me back in i clean my teeth and my gums bleed for the first time in years it must be some physical reaction to what ive been put through during the past twentyfour hours i worry a little because during my interrupted night id promised myself that i must remain physically and mentally fit this according to the prison handbook left in every cell is nothing less than the management requires ftnref they also emphasize in the same booklet that belmarsh will not tolerate any form of bullying and they have a firm policy of no racial ethnic or religious discrimination after a night on the medical wing one of my first impressions is how many of the staff dressed in their smart clean black uniforms seem able to keep a smile on their face im sitting on my bed wondering what to expect next when my thoughts are interrupted by someone shouting from the other side of the block mornin jeff bet you didnt expect to find yourself in ere i look through my tiny window and across the yard to see a face staring at me from behind his own bars another grin im gordon he shouts see you in the exercise yard in about an hour am im let out of the cell and walk slowly down the corridor to enjoy my newfound freedom as lester escorts me to the shower room i feel i should let you know that in my apartment on the albert embankment perhaps the facility of which i am most proud is the shower room when i step out of it each morning i feel a new man ready to face the world belmarsh doesnt offer quite the same facilities or leave you with the same warm feeling the large stonefloored room has three small pressbutton showers that issue a trickle of water which is at best lukewarm the pressure lasts for about thirty seconds before you have to push the button again this means a shower takes twice as long as usual but as i am becoming aware in prison time is the one commodity that is in abundance lester escorts me back to my cell while i cling on to my small soaking towel he tells me not to lose sight of it because a towel has to last for seven days he slams the door closed am i lie on my bed staring up at the white ceiling until my thoughts are once again interrupted by a key turning in the lock i have no idea who it will be this time it turns out to be a plump lady dressed in a prison uniform who has something in common with the west indian barterer a warm smile she sits down on the end of my bed and hands me a form for the prison canteen she explains that if i can afford it i am allowed to spend twelve pounds fifty pence a week i must fill in the little boxes showing what i would like and then she will see that the order is left in my cell sometime later today i dont bother to enquire what sometime later means when she leaves i study the canteen list meticulously trying to identify what might be described as necessities i am horrified to discover that the first column on the list is dominated by several different types of tobacco and the second column by batteries think about it i study the form for some considerable time and even enjoy deciding how i will spend my twelve pounds fifty am a bell rings as if announcing the end of class the cell door is opened to allow me to join the other inmates and spend fortyfive minutes in the exercise yard im sure youve seen this activity portrayed in many films its not quite the same experience when you have to participate yourself before going down to the yard we all have to undergo another body search not unlike one you might go through at an airport we are then led down three flights of iron steps to an exercise yard at ground level i pace around the furlong square that is enclosed by a high redbrick wall with a closely mown threadbare lawn in the centre after a couple of rounds im joined by gordon the voice who greeted me this morning from the window on the other side of the block he turns out to be tall and slim with the build of an athlete he tells me without any prompting that he has already served eleven years of a fourteenyear sentence for murder this is the fifth prison theyve sent him to cant be for good behaviour is my first reaction ftnref it is not uncommon for a lifer to be moved from prison to prison so that they can never settle or gain the upper hand the author in me is curious to find out more about him but i dont have to ask any questions because he never stops talking which i later discover is a common trait among lifers gordon is due out in three years time and although dyslexic has taken an open university degree in english and is now studying for a law degree he also claims to have written a book of poetry which i seem to recall reading something about in the daily mail dont talk to me about the press he screeches like a tape recorder you cant switch off they always get it wrong they said i shot my lovers boyfriend when i found them in bed together and that he was an old etonian and he wasnt an old etonian i probe innocently yeah course he was said gordon but i didnt shoot him did i i stabbed him seventeen times i feel sick at this matteroffact revelation delivered with neither remorse nor irony gordon goes on to tell me that he was twenty at the time and had run away from home at the age of fourteen after being sexually abused i shuddered despite the sun beaming down on me i wonder just how long it will be before im not sickened by such confessions how long before i dont shudder how long before it becomes matteroffact commonplace as we continue our circumnavigation of the yard he points out ronnie biggs whos sitting on a bench in the far corner surrounded by geraniums theyve just planted those jeff says gordon they must have known you were comin again he doesnt laugh i glance across to see a sick old man with a tube coming out of his nose a man who doesnt look as if he has long to live another circuit before i ask gordon about a young west indian who has his face turned to the wall and hasnt moved an inch since i walked into the yard he killed his wife and young daughter says gordon hes tried to commit suicide three times since they locked him up and doesnt talk to no one i felt strangely compassionate for this double murderer as we pass him for a third time as we overtake another man who looks totally lost gordon whispers thats barry george whos just been done for killing jill dando i didnt tell him that jill was an old friend and we both hail from westonsupermare for the first time in my life i keep my counsel no one in here believes he did it says gordon including the screws i still make no comment however georges and my trial ran concurrently at the old bailey and i was surprised by how many senior lawyers and laymen told me they were disturbed by the verdict ill bet he gets off on appeal ftnref on july barry george lost his appeal gordon adds as another bell rings to indicate that our fortyfive minutes of freedom is up once again we are all searched before leaving the yard which puzzles me if we didnt have anything on us when we came in how could we have acquired anything while we were walking around the yard i feel sure there is a simple explanation i ask gordon theyve got to go through the whole procedure every time gordon explains as we climb back up the steps its the regulations when we reach the third floor we go our separate ways goodbye says gordon and we never meet again i read three days later in the sun that ronald biggs and i shook hands after gordon had introduced us am locked back up in my cell i continue to write only to hear the key turning before ive completed a full page its ms roberts the deputy governor i stand and offer her my little steel chair she smiles waves a hand and perches herself on the end of the bed she confirms that the arrangements for my visit to the parish church in grantchester to attend my mothers funeral have been sanctioned by the governor they have checked the police computer at scotland yard and as i have no previous convictions and no history of violence i am automatically a category d prisoner ftnref there are four categories of prisoner a b c d acat are violent and dangerous prisoners with the possible resources ie money to escape b are violent and dangerous but not always murderers ie gbh abh manslaughter or rape c the vast majority are repeat offenders or convicted of a serious nonviolent crime eg drugdealers d are usually first offence no history of violence often with short sentences and likely to conform to the system as they wish to return to society as quickly as possible which she explains is important because it means that during the funeral service the prison officers accompanying me need not wear a uniform and therefore i will not have to be handcuffed the press will be disappointed i tell her it wont stop them claiming you were she replies ms roberts goes on to tell me that i will be moved from the medical wing to block three sometime after lunch there is no point in asking her when exactly i spend the rest of the morning locked up in my cell writing sticking to a routine i have followed for the past twentyfive years two hours on two hours off though never before in such surroundings when i normally leave home for a writing session i go in search of somewhere that has a view of the ocean noon im let out of my cell to join a queue for lunch one look at whats on offer and i cant face it overcooked meat heaven knows from which animal mushy peas swimming in water and potatoes that oliver twist would have rejected i settle for a slice of bread and a tin cup of milk not a cup of tinned milk i sit at a nearby table finish lunch in three minutes and return to my cell i dont have to wait long before another woman officer appears to tell me that im being transferred to cell block three better known by the inmates as beirut i pack my plastic bag which takes another three minutes while she explains that beirut is on the other side of the prison anything must be better than the medical wing i venture yes i suppose it is a little better she says she hesitates but not that much better she escorts me along several linking corridors unlocking and locking even more barred gates before we arrive in beirut my appearance is greeted by cheers from several inmates i learn later that bets had been placed on which block i would end up in each of the four blocks serves a different purpose so it shouldnt have been difficult to work out that i would end up on three the induction block you remain in induction until they have assessed you like a plane circling above an airport waiting to be told which runway you can finally land on more of that later my new cell turns out to be slightly larger by inches and a little more humane but as the officer promised only just the walls are an easiertolivewith shade of green and this time the lavatory has a flush no need to pee in the washbasin any more the view remains consistent you just stare at another redbrick block which also shields all human life from the sun the long walk from the medical block across the prison to block three had itself served as a pleasant interlude but i feel sick at the thought of this becoming a way of life a teaboy or listener ftnref selected prisoners are invited to become listeners they are then trained by the samaritans so that they can assist fellow inmates who are finding prison hard to come to terms with especially those contemplating suicide called james is waiting outside my cell to greet me he has a kind face and reminds me of a prefect welcoming a new boy on his first day at school the only difference being that hes twenty years younger than i am james tells me that if i need any questions answered i should not hesitate to ask he advises me not to say anything to anyone prisoners or officers about my sentence or appeal or to discuss any subject i dont want to see in a national newspaper the following day he warns me that the other prisoners all believe theyre going to make a fortune by phoning the sun to let a journalist know what i had for lunch i thank him for the advice my qc has already proffered james passes over another rockhard pillow with a green pillowcase but this time im given two sheets and two blankets he also hands me a plastic plate a plastic bowl a plastic mug and a plastic knife and fork he then tells me the bad news england were all out for i frown but australia are for two he adds with a grin hes obviously heard about my love of cricket would you like a radio he asks then you can follow the ballbyball commentary i cannot hide my delight at the thought and he leaves me while i make up my new bed he returns a few minutes later with a battered black radio from i know not where ill see you later he says and disappears again i take a considerable time balancing the radio on the tiny brick window sill with the aerial poking out between the bars before i am able to tune into the familiar voice of christopher martinjenkins on test match special hes telling blowers that he needs a haircut this is followed by the more serious news that australia are now for and both the waugh brothers look set in their ways as its an offwriting period i lie down on the bed and listen to graham goochs groan as two catches are dropped in quick succession by the time a bell goes for supper australia are for and i suspect are on the way to another innings victory pm once again i reject the prison food and wonder how long it will be before i have to give in i return to my cell to find my purchases from the canteen list have been left on the end of my bed someone has entered my cell and left without my knowing is strangely my first reaction i pour a cup of buxton water into my plastic mug and remove the lid from a tube of pringles i eat and drink very slowly pm three hours later another bell rings all the cell doors are opened by prison officers and the inmates congregate on the ground floor for what is known as association this is the period when you mix with the other prisoners for one hour as i walk the longest route i can circumnavigate walking is now a luxury i discover what activities are on offer four black men wearing gold chains with crosses attached are sitting in one corner playing dominoes i discover later that all four of them are in for murder none of them appears particularly violent as they consider their next move i walk on to see two more inmates playing pool while others lounge around reading the sun by far the most popular paper in the prison if one is to judge on a simple head count at the far end of the room is a long queue for the two phones each waiting caller has a phonecard which they can use at any time during association im told i will receive one tomorrow everything is tomorrow i wonder if in a spanish jail everything is the day after tomorrow i stop and chat to someone who introduces himself as paul he tells me that hes in for vat fraud seven years and is explaining how he got caught when we are joined by a prison officer a long conversation follows during which the officer reveals that he also doesnt believe barry george killed jill dando why not i ask hes just too stupid the officer replies and in any case dando was killed with one shot which convinces me that the murder must have been carried out by a disciplined professional he goes on to tell us that he has been on the same spur as george for the past eighteen months and repeats i can tell you hes just not up to it pat murder reduced to manslaughter four years joins us and says he agrees pat recalls an incident that took place on prison sports day last year when barry george then on remand was running in the one hundred yards and fell over at thirty hes a bit of a pervert pat adds and perhaps he ought to be locked up but hes no murderer when i leave them to continue my walkabout i observe that we are penned in at both ends of the room by a floortoceiling steelmesh sheet everyone nods and smiles as i pass and some prisoners stop me and want to talk about their upcoming trials while others who are sending out cards need to know how to spell christine or suzanne most of them are friendly and address me as lord jeff yet another first i try to look cheerful when i remember that if my appeal fails the minimum time i will have to serve is two years i cant imagine how anyone with a life sentence can possibly cope its just a way of life says jack a fortyeightyearold who has spent the last twentytwo years in and out of different prisons my problem he adds is im no longer qualified to do anything when i get out the last person who told me that was a conservative member of parliament a few days before the last election he lost jack invites me to visit his cell on the ground floor im surprised to find three beds in a room not much larger than mine i thought he was about to comment on how lucky i was to have a single cell but no he simply indicates a large drawing attached to the wall what do you think that is jeff he demands no idea i reply does it tell you how many days months or years you still have to go before youre released no jack responds he then points below the washbasin where a small army of ants are congregating im a bit slow and still havent put two and two together each night jack goes on to explain the three of us organize ant races and thats the track a sort of ants ascot he adds with a laugh but whats the stake i enquire aware that no one is allowed to have any money inside a prison on saturday night the one whos won the most races during the week gets to choose which bed theyll sleep in for the next seven days i stare at the three beds on one side of the room up against the wall is a single bed while on the other side are bunk beds which does the winner choose youre fuckin ftnref i will only use foul language when its reported in speech which for most inmates is every sentence fuckin is the only adjective they ever bother with dumb jeff the top one of course that way youre farthest away from the ants and can be sure of a nights sleep what do the ants get i ask if they win they stay alive until the next race and if they lose we put them into tomorrows soup i think it was a joke another bell sounds and the officers immediately corral us back into our cells and slam the doors shut they will not be unlocked again until eight tomorrow morning a senior officer stops me as i am returning to my cell to tell me that the governor wants a word i follow him but have to halt every few yards as he unlocks and locks countless ironbarred gates before im shown into a comfortable room with a sofa two easy chairs and pictures on the wall mr peel the governor of block three rises and shakes my hand before motioning me to an easy chair he asks me how i am settling in i assure him that the medical wing isnt something id want to experience ever again block three i admit although dreadful is a slight improvement mr peel nods as if hes heard it all before he then explains that there are five governors at belmarsh and hes the one responsible for arranging my visit to grantchester to attend my mothers funeral he goes on to confirm that everything is in place but i must be ready to leave at seven oclock tomorrow morning im about to ask why seven oclock when the service isnt until eleven and the journey to grantchester usually takes about an hour when he rises from his place and adds ill see you again just as soon as youve returned from cambridge mr peel says goodnight but doesnt shake hands a second time i leave his office and try to find the way back to my cell as im unescorted i lose my way an officer quickly comes to my rescue and guides me back on the straight and narrow obviously confident that i wasnt trying to escape i couldnt find my way in let alone out i want to tell him pm once locked back up in my tiny room i return to the moons a balloon and read about david nivens first experience of sex and laugh yes laugh for the first time in days at eleven i turn off my light two west indians on the same floor are shouting through their cell windows but i can neither follow nor understand what they are saying ftnref this is a common experience in most jails and can go on all night they are known as window warriors they go on hollering at each other like a married couple who ought to get divorced i have no idea what time it was when i fell asleep day saturday july am i wake a few minutes after four but as i am not due to be picked up until seven i decide to write for a couple of hours i find im writing more slowly now that there are so few distractions in my life am an officer unlocks my cell door and introduces himself as george he asks me if i would like to have a shower my towel has been hanging over the end of my bed all night and is still damp but at least theyve supplied me with a bic razor so that i can set about getting rid of two days growth i consider cutting my throat but the thought of failure and the idea of having to return to the hospital wing is enough to put anyone off the experience of that medical wing must deter most prisoners from harming themselves because its not the easy option if you are sent back to the top floor youd better be ill or you will be by the time theyve finished with you i go off to have my shower im getting quite good at anticipating when to press the button so that the flow of water doesnt stop am are you ready george asks politely yes i say except that my black tie has been confiscated along with my cufflinks georges fellow officer hands me a black tie and a pair of cufflinks materialize i can only assume that they had anticipated my problem i point out to george that his black tie is smarter than mine possibly but mines a clipon he says otherwise id happily lend it to you a clipon i repeat in mock disdain prison regulations he explains no officer ever wears a tie as it puts him at risk of being strangled i learn something new every few minutes the two of them escort me to the front hall but not before weve passed through seven doublebolted floortoceiling barred gates when we reach the reception area i am once again stripsearched the officers carry out this exercise as humanely as possible though its still humiliating i am then taken out into the yard to find a white transit van awaiting me once inside im asked to sit in the seat farthest from the door george sits next to the door while his colleague slips into the spare seat directly behind him the tiny windows are covered with bars and blacked out i can see out though no one can see in i tell george that the press are going to be very frustrated there were a lot of them hanging round earlier this morning waiting for you he tells me but a highsecurity van left about an hour ago at full speed and they all chased after it theyll be halfway to nottingham before they realize youre not inside the electric gates slide open once again this time to let me out i know the journey to cambridge like the clichéd back of my hand because ive made it once sometimes twice a week for the past twenty years but this time i am taken on a route that i never knew existed and presume it can only be for security reasons i once remember john majors driver telling me that he knew twentytwo different routes from chequers to no and another twenty back to huntingdon and none of them was the most direct i find it a little stifling in the back of the van there is no contact with the driver in the front or the policeman sitting beside him because they are sealed off almost as if theyre in a separate vehicle i sense that george and his colleague are a little nervous i cant imagine why because i have no intention of trying to escape as i abhor any form of violence i learn later they are nervous because should anything go wrong theyll be blamed for it and something does go wrong when we reach the m the van remains at a steady fifty on the inside lane and i begin to feel sick cooped up in that armourplated compartment on wheels our first destination is the cambridge crematorium which is situated on the north side of the city so when we come off the motorway at exit thirteen im surprised to find that the driver turns left and starts going in the wrong direction we travel for a couple of miles towards royston before pulling into a large car park attached to the siemens building george explains that siemens is where they have agreed to liaise with the local police before travelling on to the crematorium one enterprising blackleatherclad motorcyclist journalist who spotted the van coming off the roundabout at exit thirteen has followed us to the siemens building he skids to a halt and immediately taps out some numbers on his mobile phone the policeman seated in the front makes it clear that he wants to be on the move before any of the bikers colleagues join him but as we have to wait for the local police before we can proceed were stuck it is of course unusual to have a cremation before the church service but the crematorium was free at am and the church not until midday the following day the press come up with a dozen reasons as to why the funeral had been conducted in this order from the police demanding it through to me wanting to fool them not one of them published the correct reason within minutes the police escort arrives and we are on our way when we drive into the crematorium there are over a hundred journalists and photographers waiting for us behind a barrier that has been erected by the police they must have been disappointed to see the white van disappear behind the back of the building where they slipped me in through the entrance usually reserved for the clergy peter walker an old friend and the former bishop of ely is waiting to greet us he guides me through to a little room where he will put on his robes and i will change into a new suit which my son william is bringing over from the old vicarage i will be only too happy to be rid of the clothes ive been wearing for the past few days the smell of prison is a perfume that even nicole kidman couldnt make fashionable the bishop takes me through the cremation service which he says will only last for about fifteen minutes he confirms that the main funeral service will be conducted in the parish church of st andrew and st mary in grantchester at twelve oclock a few minutes later my immediate family arrive via the front door and have to face the clicking cameras and the shouted questions mary is wearing an elegant black dress with a simple brooch that my mother left her in her will she is ashenfaced which was my last memory of her before i left the dock i begin to accept that this terrible ordeal may be even more taxing for my family who are trying so hard to carry on their daily lives while not letting the world know how they really feel when mary comes through to join me in the back i hold on to her for some time i then change into my new suit and go through to the chapel and join the rest of the family i greet each one of them before taking my place in the front row seated between william and mary i try hard to concentrate on the fact that we are all gathered together in memory of my mother lola but its hard to forget im a convict who in a few hours time will be back in prison am the bishop conducts the service with calm and quiet dignity and when the curtains are finally drawn around my mothers coffin mary and i walk forward and place a posy of heather next to the wreath mary leaves by the front door while i return to the back room where i am greeted by another old friend the two prison officers are surprised when inspector howell from the local constabulary says hello jeffrey sorry to see you in these circumstances i explain to them that when i was chairman of cambridge rugby club david was the st xv skipper and the best scrumhalf in the county how do you want to play it i ask david checks his watch the service at grantchester isnt for another hour so i suggest we park up at cantalupe farm and wait at the old vicarage until its time to leave for the church i glance at george to see if this meets with his approval im happy to fall in with whatever the local constabulary advise he says im then driven away to cantalupe farm in my armoured van where the owner antony pemberton has kindly allowed us to park mary and the boys travel separately in the family car we then all make our way by foot over to the old vicarage accompanied by only a couple of photographers as the rest of the press are massed outside st andrews they have all assumed that we would be travelling directly to the parish church we all wait around in the kitchen for a few moments while mary anne our housekeeper makes some tea pours a large glass of milk and cuts me a slice of chocolate cake i then ask george if i might be allowed to walk around the garden the old vicarage at grantchester circa was at the beginning of the last century the home of rupert brooke the beautiful garden has been tended for the past fifteen years by my wife and rachael the gardener between them theyve turned it from a jungle into a haven the trees and flowerbeds are exquisite and the walks to and from the river quite magnificent george and his colleague though never more than a few paces away remain out of earshot so mary and i are able to discuss my appeal she reveals an amazing piece of new evidence concerning mr justice potts that if substantiated could cause there to be a retrial mary then goes over the mistakes she thinks the judge made during the trial she is convinced that the appeal judges will at least reduce my fouryear sentence you dont seem pleased she adds as we walk along the bank of the river cam for the first time in my life i tell her i assume the worst so that if anything good happens ill be pleasantly surprised ive become a pessimist overnight we return from the river bank walk back towards the house and over a wooden bridge that spans lake oscar in reality its a large pond full of koi carp named after one of my wifes favourite cats who after five years of purring and pawing at the waters edge failed to catch a single fish after feeding our japanese and israeli immigrants we return to the house and prepare ourselves to face the press david howell says that he doesnt want me driven to the church in a police car and suggests that i accompany mary and the family on foot for the fourhundredyard walk from the old vicarage to the parish church the police and the prison officers were doing everything in their power to remember that the occasion is my mothers funeral am we leave by the front door to find a crowd of journalists photographers and cameramen waiting outside the gates i estimate their number to be about a hundred george later tells the governor over his mobile phone that its nearer two hundred my younger son james and his girlfriend talita lead the little party on the quartermile journey to the church they are followed by william and my adopted sister liz with mary and myself bringing up the rear the cameramen literally fall over each other as they try to get their shots while we make our way slowly up to the parish church one illmannered lout shouts questions at us so i turn and talk to mary he only gives up when he realizes none of us is going to grace him with a reply i find myself feeling bitter for the first time in my life when we reach the church door i am greeted by my cousin peter who is handing out copies of the order of service while his wife pat guides us to a pew in the front row im touched by how many of my mothers friends have travelled from all over the world to attend the little service from america canada and even australia not to mention many friends from the west country where she spent most of her life the order of service has been selected by mary and reveals so much about the thought and preparation my wife puts into everything she must have taken hours selecting the prayers hymns readings and music and she hits just the right note bishop walker once again officiates and my stepbrother david watson gives a moving address in which he recalls my mothers boundless energy love of learning and wicked sense of humour i read the final lesson revelation xxi verses and as i face the congregation wonder if ill manage to get the words out im relieved to discover that i dont have to spend those final moments with my mother accompanied by the press as they at least have had the courtesy to remain outside the service lasts for fifty minutes and is about the only time that day when i can concentrate on my mother and her memory not for the first time am i thankful that she didnt live to see me convicted and my thoughts turn to the sacrifices she made to ensure i had a decent education and was given as good a start as possible remembering that my father died leaving debts of around five hundred pounds and mother had to go out to work to make ends meet i tried in the later years to make life a little easier for her but i was never able to repay her properly the service ends with jesu joy of mans desiring and mary and i follow the bishop and the choir down the aisle when we reach the vestry george immediately joins us a member of the press has called belmarsh to ask why i was allowed to return to the old vicarage youll have to say your goodbyes here im afraid he tells us the governor has phoned to say you cant go back to the house i spend the next few minutes shaking hands with everyone who has attended the service and am particularly touched by the presence of donald and diana sinden who my mother adored after thanking the bishop my family join me as we begin the long slow walk back to the prison van parked at cantalupe farm i glance to my left as we pass the old vicarage this time the press become even more frantic they begin to holler out their questions like a repeater gun are you expecting to remain a lord do you hope to win your appeal do you want to say anything about your mother do you consider yourself a criminal after about a hundred yards or so they finally give up so mary and i chat about her forthcoming trip to strathclyde university where she will chair a summer school on solar energy the date has been in her diary for some months but she offers to cancel the trip and stay in london so she can visit me in belmarsh i wont hear of it as i need her to carry on as normal a life as possible she sighs the truth is i never want mary to see me in belmarsh when we reach the van i turn back to look at the old vicarage which i fear i wont be seeing again for some time i then hug my family one by one leaving mary to last i look across to see my driver david crann in tears the first time in fifteen years ive seen this former sas warrior show any vulnerability on the slow journey back to belmarsh i once again consider what the future holds for me and remain convinced i must above all things keep my mind alert and my body fit the writing of a daytoday diary seems to be my best chance for the former and a quick return to the gym the only hope for the latter pm within moments of arriving back at belmarsh im put through another stripsearch before being escorted to my cell on block three once again james the listener is waiting for me he has from somewhere somehow purloined a carton of milk a new razor ftnref youre allowed one bic razor a day and not until you hand in your old one will they supply you with a new one it was several days before i discovered why and two yes two towels he perches himself on the end of the bed and tells me there is a rumour that they are going to move me to another block on monday as beirut is only the induction wing whats the difference i ask if youre going to be here for a couple of weeks they have to decide which block to put you on while youre waiting to be transferred to a dcat i think youre going to block one says james so youll be with the lifers lifers i gasp but doesnt that mean ill be locked up all day and night no no says james the lifers have a much more relaxed regime than any other block because they keep their heads down and dont want to be a nuisance its the young ones who are on remand or doing short sentences that cause most of the trouble and therefore have to be locked up first its fascinating to discover how much of prison life is the exact opposite to what you would expect james then gives me the bad news hes going to be transferred to whitemoor prison tomorrow morning so i wont be seeing him again but he has already allocated another inmate called kevin to be my listener kevins a good guy he assures me even if he talks too much so if he goes on a bit just tell him to shut up before james leaves i cant resist asking him what hes in for smuggling drugs from holland he replies matteroffactly and you were caught redhanded how much were the drugs worth the police claimed a street value of million i can only imagine it must have been harley street adds james with a wry smile how much did you receive for doing the job five thousand pounds and your sentence six years and kevin i ask whats he in for oh he was on that dome jewellery caper driving one of the getaway boats trouble was he didnt get away james pauses by the way he says the staff tell me that you arent eating well thats not quite accurate i reply but i am living on a diet of bottled water kitkat and smiths crisps but as im only allowed to spend twelve pounds fifty a week im already running out of my meagre provisions dont worry he says youll be allowed another canteen list once theyve transferred you to a new wing so fill yours in tonight and kevin can hand it in first thing in the morning i smile at the mans ingenuity and see why the prison officers have made him a listener they obviously like lbj ftnref lyndon baines johnson the thirtysixth president of the united states feel its better to have him pissing out of the tent rather than pissing in james then changes the subject to the leadership of the conservative party he wants kenneth clarke to be the next leader and hes disappointed that michael portillo missed the cut by one vote because hes never heard of iain duncan smith why clarke i ask his brother was the governor of holloway and has the reputation of being a fair and decent man mr clarke strikes me as the same sort of bloke i have to agree with james feeling that hes summed up ken rather well pm james leaves when mr weedon appears by the door impatient to lock me back in im beginning to learn the names of the officers i check my watch its just after four thirty mr weedon explains that as its a saturday and theyre shortstaffed they wont be opening the door again until nine oclock the next morning as the cell door slams shut i reflect on the fact that for the next seventeen hours i will be left alone in a room nine feet by six pm i feel very low this is the worst period of the day you think of your family and what you might be doing at this time on a saturday evening james and i would have been watching the open golf from lytham st annes hoping against hope that colin montgomerie would at last win a major william might be reading a book by some obscure author id never heard of mary would probably be in the folly at the bottom of the garden working on volume two of her book molecular to global photosynthesis and around seven i would drive across to saffron walden to visit my mother and discuss with her who should lead the tory party my mother is dead james is in london with his girlfriend william is on his way back to new york mary is at the old vicarage alone and im locked up in jail pm its dark outside no curtains to cover my little cell window im exhausted i pick up one of my new towels fold it and place it across my pillow i lower my head onto the towel and sleep for ten hours day sunday july am i wake to find my tiny cell filled with sunlight i place my feet on the floor and can smell my own body i decide that the first thing i must do is have a long shave before even thinking about a writing session as soon as they unlock the door ill make a dash for the showers theres no plug in the basin so i decide to improvise and fill my plastic soup bowl with warm water and turn it into a shaving bowl ftnref i discovered later that you can buy a plug from the canteen for p but if you leave your cell door open for more than a minute it disappears the prison have supplied a stick of shaving soap an oldfashioned shaving brush i dont think its badger hair and a plastic bic razor not unlike the one youre given when travelling on british airways economy it takes me some time to build up any lather above the basin is a steelplated mirror measuring four inches square which reflects a blurred image of a tired bristly man after my shave in lukewarm water i feel a lot better even though ive cut myself several times i return to my chair behind the little square table and with my back to the window begin writing the sun is shining through the four panes of glass reproducing a shadow of the bars on the wall in front of me just in case i should forget where i am am the key turns in the lock and my cell door is pushed open i look up at an officer who has a puzzled expression on his face whats happened to your cell card he asks hes referring to a white card ftnref white cards denote church of england red cards roman catholic yellow muslim and green jewish this is to show any dietary needs and if you are attending a service when you should he locked upattached to my cell door stating my name archer dcat release date july th its been removed i explain ive had six of them in the past two days i think youll find theyve become something of a collectors item despite the absence of my card the officer allows me to go off to the shower room where i join a group of noisy prisoners who are looking forward to an afternoon visit from their families one of them a black guy called pat carries a clean freshlyironed white shirt on a hanger im full of admiration and ask how he managed it explaining that my children are coming to see me in a couple of days and id like to look my best ill send round my man to see you your lordship pat says with a grin hell take care of you i thank pat not quite sure if hes teasing me once ive completed another pressbutton shower ive almost mastered it and dried myself i return to my cell to have breakfast breakfast was handed to me last night in a plastic bag only moments after id rejected the evening meal i extract a very hardboiled egg from the bag before disposing of the rest of its contents in the plastic bucket under the sink while eating the egg white only avoiding the yolk i stare out of my window and watch the planes as they descend at regular sixtysecond intervals into city airport a pigeon joins me on the ledge but hes on the outside i retrieve a piece of stale bread from the bucket under the washbasin break it into small crumbs and drop them on the sill he rejects my offering coos and flies away am the cell is unlocked again this time for association and the duty officer asks me if i want to attend a church service not being utterly convinced there is a god i rarely go to church in grantchester despite the fact that my wife was for many years the choirmistress however on this occasion it will mean a long walk and fortyfive minutes in a far larger room than my cell so without hesitation i thank god and say yes rc or church of england the officer enquires c of e i reply then youll be on the second shift ill call you around straight after association am during association prison officers watch to see if you become part of a clique or gang and how you behave while in a group or if youre simply a loner im about to leave my cell only to find a queue of prisoners waiting at my door most of them want autographs so they can prove to their partners or girlfriends that they were on the same block as the notorious jeffrey archer when ive finished what can only be described as a signing session not unlike the ones i usually carry out at hatchards im joined by my new listener kevin he confirms that james was shipped out to whitemoor early this morning so what do you need jeffrey can i call you jeffrey of course what do i need i repeat how about a bowl of cornflakes with some real milk two eggs sunny side up bacon mushrooms and a cup of hot chocolate kevin laughs i can sort out some weetabix skimmed milk fresh bread anything else a decent razor some shampoo a bar of soap and a change of towels that may take a little longer he admits as everyone knows what im in for i ask the inevitable question i was part of the dome jewellery raid wasnt i he says as if everybody was what a sentence to deliver to an author how did you become involved i asked debt he explains and a measure of bad luck nick purnells words rang in my ears dont believe anything youre told in prison and never reveal to your fellow inmates any details of your own case debt i repeat yeah i owed a man thirteen hundred pounds and although i hadnt spoken to him for over a year he suddenly calls up out of the blue and demands to see me i dont interrupt the flow we met up at a pub in brighton where he told me he needed a speedboat and driver for a couple of hours and if i was willing to do it i could forget the debt when did he expect you to carry out the job i ask the next morning kevin replied i told him i couldnt consider it because id already got another job lined up what job i asked well my dad and ive got a couple of boats that we fish off the coast and they were both booked for the rest of the week then i want my money the man demanded so i wasnt left with a lot of choice you see i was skint at the time and anyway he had a reputation as a bit of a hard man and all he wanted me to do was transport four men from one side of the river to the other the whole exercise wouldnt take more than ten minutes one thousand three hundred pounds for ten minutes work you must have realized that there was a catch i was suspicious but had no idea what they were really up to so what happened next i took the boat as instructed up to bow creek moored it near the jetty a few hundred yards from the dome and waited suddenly all hell broke loose three police boats converged on me and within minutes i was surrounded by a dozen armed officers shouting at me to lie down on the deck with my hands above my head one of them said blimey its not him and i later discovered that id been brought in at the last minute to replace someone who had let the gang down but by then you must have known what they were up to nope he replied im thirtyfive years old and this is my first offence im not a criminal and after what my family and i have been put through i can tell you i wont be coming back to prison again i cant explain why i wanted to believe him it might have been his courteous manner or the way he talked about his wife and fourteenyearold son and he was certainly going to pay dearly for a foolish mistake one that he would regret for the rest of his life ftnref kevin meredith was tried and convicted at the old bailey on february for conspiracy to steal and sentenced to five years imprisonment archer collins davies edwards booms the voice of mr king an officer not given to subtlety as he continues to bellow out names until he comes to watts before adding c of e now i think well have to continue this conversation at some other time i suggest our lord calls and if he doesnt mr king certainly does i then join the other prisoners who are waiting on the middle landing to be escorted to the morning service am a crocodile of prisoners proceeds slowly along the polished linoleum floor until were stopped for another body search before entering the chapel why would they search us before going into a place of worship we file into a large hall where each worshipper is handed a bible i take my place in the second row next to a young black man who has his head bowed i glance around at what appears to be a full house the chaplain david his name is written in bold letters on a label attached to his wellworn jacket takes his place at the front of the chapel and calls for silence he is a man of about fortyfive stockily built with a pronounced limp and a stern smile he stares down at his congregation of murderers rapists burglars and wifebeaters not surprisingly it takes him a couple of minutes to bring such a flock to order while he goes about his task i continue to look around the room its square in shape and i would guess measures about twenty paces by twenty the outer walls are red brick and the room holds about two hundred plastic chairs in rows of twenty on the four walls there are paintings of christ and his disciples christ being carried to the tomb after being taken down from the cross the virgin mother with an angel the raising of lazarus and christ calming the storm directly behind the chaplain is a rock band their leader is a pretty darkhaired girl who has a guitar slung over her shoulder she is accompanied by five gospel singers all of whom have tiny microphones pinned to their lapels in front of the group is a man seated with his back to the congregation he is working a slide projector that flashes up on a white sheet hung in front of him the words of the first hymn when the chaplain finally gains silence achieved only after a threat that anyone caught talking would immediately be escorted back to their cell he begins the service by delivering three prayers all unsubtly spelling out the simple message of doing good by your neighbour he then turns to the girl with the guitar and gives her a slight bow her gentle voice rings out the melody of the first hymn more of a gospel message which is accompanied heartily by the black prisoners who make up well over half the congregation while the rest of us are a little more reserved the groups backing singers are all white and give as good as they get even when the clapping begins after the last verse has rung out we are all ready for the sermon and what a sermon it turns out to be the chaplains chosen theme is murder he then invites us to pick up our bibles which he describes as the biggest bestseller of all time and turn to the book of genesis he glances in my direction and winks and it all began with cain and abel he tells us because cain was the first murderer envious of his brothers success he gained revenge by killing him but god saw him do it and punished him for the rest of his life his next chosen example of a murderer was moses who he told us killed an egyptian and also thought hed got away with it but he hadnt because god had seen him so he too was punished for the rest of his life i dont remember that bit because i thought moses died peacefully in his bed aged now i want you to turn to the second book of samuel declares the chaplain not the first book the second book where youll find a king who was a murderer king david he killed uriah the hittite because he fancied his wife bathsheba he had uriah placed in the front line of the next battle to make sure he was killed so he could end up marrying bathsheba however god also saw what he was up to and punished him accordingly because god witnesses every murder and will punish anyone who breaks his commandments alleluia shout several of the congregation in the front three rows i later learnt from the deputy governor that at least half the congregation were murderers so the chaplain was well aware of the audience he was playing to after the sermon is over the gospel singers sing a quiet reprise while the chaplain asks if all those who are willing to put their trust in god might like to come forward and sign the pledge a queue begins to form in front of david and he blesses them one by one once they are back in their seats we sing the last hymn before receiving the chaplains final blessing as we file out i thank the reverend before being searched but what could possibly change hands during the service when theyve already searched us before we came in i find out a week later we are then escorted back to our cells and locked up once again noon at midday were let out for sunday lunch there are four different dishes on offer turkey beef ham and stew as i am unable to tell which is which i settle for some grated cheese and two slices of unmargarined bread before returning to my cell to sit at my little table and slowly nibble my cheese sandwich once ive finished lunch which takes all of five minutes i start writing again i continue uninterrupted for a couple of hours until kevin returns clutching a plastic bag of goodies two weetabix a carton of milk two small green apples a bar of soap and his biggest triumph to date two packets of cup a soup minestrone and mushroom i dont leave him in any doubt how grateful i am before settling down to a plastic bowl of weetabix soaked in milk the same bowl id used to shave in earlier this morning pm its not until after four has struck that i am allowed to leave the cell again and join the other prisoners for fortyfive minutes in the exercise yard i quickly learn that you take any and every opportunity from religion to work to exercise to make sure you get out of your cell once again were searched before being allowed to go into the yard most of the inmates dont bother to walk but simply congregate in groups and sunbathe while lounging up against the fence just a few of us stride purposefully round i walk briskly because im already missing my daily visit to the gym i notice that several prisoners are wearing the latest nike or reebok trainers its the one fashion statement they are allowed to make one of the inmates joins me and shyly offers ten pages of a manuscript and asks if i would be willing to read them he tells me that he writes three pages a day and hopes to finish the work by the time hes released in december i read the ten pages as i walk he is clearly quite well educated as the sentences are grammatically correct and he has a good command of language i congratulate him on the piece wish him well and even admit that i am carrying out the same exercise myself one or two others join me to discuss their legal problems but as i have little knowledge of the law i am unable to answer any of their questions i hear my name called out on the tannoy and return to the officer at the gate mr peel wants to see you the officer says without explanation and this time doesnt bother to search me as i am escorted to a little office in the centre of the spur another form needs to be filled in as james had phoned asking if he can visit me on friday do you want to see him he asks of course i do i reply they dont all want to mr peel remarks as he fills out the form when he has completed the task he asks how i am settling in not well i admit being locked up for seventeen hoursbut im sure youve heard it all before mr peel begins to talk about his job and the problems the prison service is going through hes been a prison officer for ten years and his basic pay is still only which with overtime at an hour maximum allowed nine hours a week he can push up to i didnt tell him that its less than i pay my secretary he then explains that his partner is also a prison officer and she carries out her full overtime stint which means they end up with a year between them but dont see a lot of each other after getting his message across he changes the subject back to belmarsh this is only a reception prison he explains if youre convicted and not on remand we move you to another prison as quickly as possible but im sorry to say we see the same old faces returning again and again they arent all bad you know in fact if it wasnt for drugs particularly heroin sixty per cent of them wouldnt even be here sixty per cent i repeat yes most of them are in for petty theft to pay for their drug habit or are part of the drug culture and can they still get hold of drugs in prison oh yes youll have noticed how rudimentary the searches are thats because prison regulations dont permit us to do any more we know where theyre hiding the drugs and every method they use to bring them in but because of the human rights act were not always allowed to carry out a thorough enough search some of them are even willing to swallow plastic packets full of heroin theyre so desperate but if the packet were to burst theyll die within hours he says one prisoner died that way last month but youd be surprised how many of them are still willing to risk it did you hear the fire alarm go off last night yes it woke me i told him it was a heroin addict whod set fire to his cell by the time i got there he was cutting his wrist with a razor because he wanted to suffer even more pain to help take his mind off the craving we whisked him off to the medical wing but there wasnt much they could do except patch him up hell go through exactly the same trauma again tonight so well just have to mount a suicide watch and check his cell every fifteen minutes a horn sounds to announce that the exercise period is over i suppose youd better get back to your cell he says if you werent writing a book i cant imagine what the authorities imagine will be gained by sending you here pm i return to my cell and continue writing until supper when my door is unlocked again i go down to the hotplate on the ground floor i settle for a thermos of hot water an apple and a plastic bag containing tomorrows breakfast back in my cell i munch a packet of crisps and with the aid of half the hot water in the thermos make a cup a soup mushroom the cell door is slammed shut at five thirty and will not be opened again until nine thirty tomorrow morning by which time i will have used the other half of the water from the thermos to take a shave in the same bowl as i eat the soup i spend the next couple of hours following the open golf on radio live david duval an american wins his first open to see his name inscribed on the silver claret jug colin montgomery and ian woosnam put up a spirited fight but are not around at the seventysecond hole i flick over to radio to hear steve norris vicechairman of the conservative party in charge of womens affairs telling the world he always knew i was a bad man in the election among party members for candidate for mayor of london i defeated mr norris by per cent to per cent i turn the radio off and read a couple of chapters of the moons a balloon which takes mr niven to sandhurst before being commissioned into the kings own highlanders i rest my head on the rockhard pillow and despite the prisoners shouting from cell to cell and loud rap music coming from every corner of the block i somehow fall asleep day monday july am the sun is shining through the bars of my window on what must be a glorious summer day ive been incarcerated in a cell five paces by three for twelve and a half hours and will not be let out again until midday eighteen and a half hours of solitary confinement there is a child of seventeen in the cell below me who has been charged with shoplifting his first offence not even convicted and he is being locked up for eighteen and a half hours unable to speak to anyone this is great britain in the twentyfirst century not turkey not nigeria not kosovo but britain i can hear the rightwingers assuring us that it will be characterbuilding and teach the lad a lesson what stupidity its far more likely that he will become antagonistic towards authority and once hes released turn to a life of crime this same young man will now be spending at least a fortnight with murderers rapists burglars and drug addicts are these the best tutors he can learn from noon i am visited by a charming lady who spotted me sitting in church on sunday i end up asking her more questions than she asks me it turns out that she visits every prisoner who signs the pledge i fear i didnt and any inmate who attends chapel for the first time she gives each prisoner a bible and will sit and listen to their problems for hours she kindly answers all my questions when she leaves i pick up my plastic tray plastic bowl plastic plate plastic knife fork and spoon leave my cell to walk down to the hotplate for lunch ftnref in prison the morning meal breakfast is usually taken between and the midday meal is called dinner and the evening meal tea in belmarsh the following days breakfast is given to you in a plastic bag when you go down to the hotplate for tea the night before one look at whats on offer and once again i return to my cell emptyhanded an old lag on his way back to the top floor tells me that belmarsh has the worst grub of any jail in britain as hes been a resident of seven prisons during the past twenty years i take his word for it an officer slams my cell door closed it will not open again until four oclock ive had precisely twelve minutes of freedom during the last twentytwo and a half hours pm after another four hours im let out for association during this blessed release i stop to glance at the tv in the centre of the room thats surrounded by a dozen prisoners theyre watching a cowboy film starring ray milland who plays the sheriff normally i would flick to another channel but today its the selection of the majority so i hang in there for ten minutes before finally giving up and moving on to the dominoes table an irishman joins me and asks if i can spare him a minute hes about five feet eight with two scars etched across his face one above his left eyebrow short the stitches still showing and another down his right cheek long and red the latter i suspect is the more recent despite this disfigurement he has that soft lilt of his countrymen that i can never resist im up in court next week he says what for i ask youd rather not know he replies but all i want to find out is once im in court am i allowed to defend myself yes i tell him but would it be better to give my side of the story to a barrister and then let him brief the jury i consider this for a moment because during my sevenweek trial i gained some experience of the legal profession on balance i tell him i would take advantage of any legal expertise on offer rather than rely on your own cunning he nods and slips away i dread meeting up with this sharp intelligent irishman at some later date to be told that his barrister was a fool i stroll back across the room to see how the film is progressing being a western a gunfight to end all gunfights is just about to take place when the officer on duty shouts back to your cells a groan goes up but to be fair to the duty officer hes seated at the far end of the room and has no idea that the film only has another five minutes to run the good guys win ray milland gets the girl and the baddies are all blown away i tell the audience assembled round the tv youve seen it before asks one of the inmates no you stupid fucker says another we always lose have you ever known it end any other way once locked back in my cell after the fortyfiveminute break i pour myself a glass of buxton water eat a packet of smiths crisps and nibble away at an apple having finished my fiveminute nonprison meal i clean my teeth and settle down to another two hours of writing ive written about a thousand words when i hear a key turning in the lock always a welcome distraction because as ive mentioned before an open door gives you a feeling of freedom and the possibility that you might even be allowed to escape for a few minutes im greeted by a lady in civilian clothes who wears the inevitable badge in her case librarian good afternoon i say as i rise from my place and smile she looks surprised if a prisoner asks you to sign a book could you in future say no she says without bothering to introduce herself i look puzzled after all ive been asked to sign books for the past twentyfive years its just that they are all library books she continues and theyre being stolen theyve now become like tobacco and phonecards a trading item for drugs and are worth double with your signature i assure her i will not sign another library book she nods and slams the door closed i continue writing aware that the next opportunity for a break will come when we have the allocated fortyfive minutes for afternoon exercise im already becoming used to the routine of the door opening lining up to be searched and then being released into the yard ive written about another two thousand words before the door opens again having gone through the ritual i stroll around the large square accompanied by vincent burglary and another man called mark driving offence who supports arsenal one circuit and i discover that the only way to stop mark boring me to death about his favourite football team is to agree with him that arsenal despite manchester uniteds recent record is the best team in england desperate for a change of subject i point to a sad figure walking in front of us the only prisoner in the yard who looks older than me poor old thing says vincent he shouldnt be here but hes whats known as a bag man nowhere to go so he ends up in prison but what was his crime i ask nothing if the truth be known every few weeks he throws a brick through a shop window and then hangs around until the police turn up to arrest him why would he do that i ask because hes got nowhere to go and at least while hes inside the poor old sod is guaranteed a bed and three meals a day but surely the police have worked that out by now i suggest yes of course they have so they advise the magistrate to bind him over but hes even found a way round that because the moment the magistrate fails to sentence him he shouts out at the top of his voice youre a stupid old fucker and im going to throw a brick through your window tonight so see you again tomorrow that assures him at least another six weeks inside which is exactly what he was hoping for in the first place hes been sentenced seventythree times in the past thirty years but never for more than three months the problem is that the system doesnt know what to do with him a young black man runs past me to the jeers of those lolling up against the perimeter fence he is not put off and if anything runs a little faster hes lean and fit and looks like a quartermiler i watch him only to be reminded that my planned summer holiday at the world athletics championships in edmonton with michael beloff has been exchanged for three weeks in belmarsh lets get moving whispers vincent we want to avoid that one at any cost he adds pointing to a lone prisoner walking a few paces ahead of us vincent doesnt speak again until weve overtaken him and are out of earshot he then answers my unasked question hes a double murderer his wife and her boyfriend vincent goes on to describe how he killed them both i found the details so horrific that i must confess i didnt feel able to include vincents words in this diary until six months after id left belmarsh if youre at all squeamish avoid reading the next three paragraphs this is vincents verbatim description that bastard returned home unexpectedly in the middle of the day to find his wife making love to another man the man tried to escape out of the bedroom window but was knocked out with one punch he then tied the two of them next to each other on the bed before going down to the kitchen he returned a few minutes later holding a serrated carving knife with a seveninch blade during the next hour he stabbed the lover eleven times making sure he was still alive before finally cutting off his balls once the man had died he climbed on the bed and raped his wife who was still tied up next to her dead lover at the last moment he came all over the dead mans face he then climbed off the bed and stared at his hysterical wife he waited for some time before inserting the carving knife deep into her vagina he then pulled the blade slowly up through her body during the trial he told the jury that hed killed her to prove how much he loved her he was sentenced to life with no prospect of parole just remember to avoid him at any cost says vincent hed slit your throat for a halfounce of tobacco and as hes going to spend the rest of his life in here nothing can be added to his sentence whatever he gets up to i feel sure hes just the sort of fellow mr justice potts was hoping id bump into the hooter blasts out the unsubtle indication that our fortyfive minutes is up we are called in block by block so that we can return to our individual cells in smaller groups as im on block three i have to hang around and wait to be called when they call two i notice that the double murderer is striding purposefully towards me i bow my head hoping he wont notice but when i look up again i see hes staring directly at me and still heading in my direction i look towards the four officers standing by the gate who stiffen while the group of black men up against the fence stare impassively on the double murderer comes to a halt a few paces in front of me can i speak to you he asks yes of course i reply trying to sound as if we were casual acquaintances at a garden party its just that i would like to say how much i enjoy your books particularly the prodigal daughter ive been in here for eleven years and ive read everything youve written i just wanted to let you know im speechless and by the way he adds if you want that bitch of a secretary bumped off ill be happy to arrange it for you i really thought i was going to be sick as i watched him disappear through the gate thank god into another block pm im only locked up for a couple of hours before the bell goes for supper i pick up my tray and grab a tin of fruit that was donated by james my first listener the night before he was transferred to whitemoor when i join the hotplate queue i ask vincent if he has a tin opener he points to an opener attached to the wall on the far side of the room but youre not allowed to open anything before youve collected your grub i notice that hes holding a tin of shiphams spam ill swap you half my tin of fruit for half your spam agreed he says ill bring it up to your cell as soon as ive collected my meal once again i cant find anything at the hotplate that looks even vaguely edible and settle for a couple of potatoes you ought to go for the vegetarian option says a voice i look round to see pat mary wont be pleased when she finds out youre not eating and lets face it the vegetarian option is one of the few things they cant make a complete mess of i take pats advice and select a vegetable fritter as we pass the end of the counter another plastic bag containing tomorrows breakfast is handed to me by the way says pat pointing to the man who has just served me thats peter the press hell wash and iron that shirt for you thank you pat i say and turning back to peter add my children are coming to visit tomorrow and i want to look my best for them ill make you look as if youve just stepped out of savile row peter says ill stop by your cell and pick up the shirt once ive finished serving breakfast i move on and collect a thermos flask of hot water from another prisoner half for a cup a soup half for shaving as i climb the yellow iron steps back to cell on the second floor i overhear mark the arsenal supporter having a word with mr tuck the officer on duty hes pointing out very courteously that there are no ethnic representatives among those selected to be listeners teaboys or servers behind the hotplate despite the fact that they make up over per cent of the prison population mr tuck who strikes me as a fair man nods his agreement and says hell have a word with the governor whether he did or not i have no way of knowing ftnref the reason mark feels so strongly is because teaboys listeners and hotplate workers spend far longer out of their cells than the rest of us so its a real privilege when i arrive back on the second floor vincent is already waiting for me i pour half my fruit into his bowl while he cuts his spam into two forking over the larger portion which i place on the plate next to my vegetable fritter and two potatoes he also gives me a white tshirt which im wearing as i write these words the cell doors are left open for about ten minutes during which time peter the press arrives and takes away my dirty white shirt a pair of pants and socks ill have them back to you first thing tomorrow squire he promises and is gone before i can thank him and ask what he would like in return my final visitor for the day is kevin my listener who tells me theres a rumour that im going to be moved to block one tomorrow where the regime is a little bit more relaxed and not quite as noisy im sorry to learn this as im beginning to make a few friends kevin james pat vincent peter and mark and am starting to get the hang of how block three works kevin sits on the end of the bed and chats as james had warned me he would but i welcome the company not to mention the fact that while a listener is in the room the door has to be left open kevin had a visit this afternoon from his wife and children he tells me his fourteenyearold is now taller than he is and his nineyearold cant understand why he doesnt come home at night mr gilford the duty officer hovers at my cell door a hint that even though kevin is a listener its perhaps time for him to move on i ask mr gilford if i can empty the remains of my meal in the dustbin at the end of the landing only one bite taken from the fritter he nods the moment i return the cell door is slammed shut i sit on the end of the bed and begin to go through my letters just over a hundred in the first post and not one of them condemning me amazing how the british people do not reflect the views of the press ive kept every letter just in case my lawyers want to inspect them three members of parliament david faber john gummer and peter lilley and two members of the lords bertie denham and robin ferrers are among those early writers one former minister not only says how sorry he is to learn that im in jail but adds that mr justice pottss summingup was a travesty of justice and the sentence inexplicable i begin to make a mental list of my real friends day tuesday july am i seem to have settled back into my usual sleep pattern i wake around am rise at six and begin my first twohour writing session just as i would if i were in the tranquillity of my own home i continue to write uninterrupted until eight i make extensive notes on what has taken place during the day and then the following morning i pen the full script which usually comes to about three thousand words i also scribble a note whenever i overhear a casual remark or a piece of information that might be forgotten only moments later i am just about to shave a process i now take some considerable time over not just because i have time but also because i dont want to be cut to ribbons by my prison razor when there is a bang on the cell door my tiny window is flicked open and ms newsome shouts archer youre being moved to house block one get your things ready i should have realized by now that such a warning would be followed by at least a twohour wait but inexperience causes me to abandon any attempt to shave and quickly gather together my belongings my only concern is that my children may be visiting me this afternoon and i wouldnt want them to see me unshaven i gather everything together and as if i were returning home at the end of a holiday i find i have far more possessions than i started out with by the time i have stuffed everything into my large hm prisons plastic bag i begin to feel apprehensive about moving off beirut to the lifers wing am my cell door is thrown open again and i join a dozen or so prisoners who are also being transferred to block one i recognize one or two of them from the exercise yard they cant resist a chorus of good morning jeff how was your breakfast my lord and we must be off to the posh block if youre coming with us kevin slips into the back of the line to tell me that my white shirt has been washed and pressed by peter and hell have it sent over to block one this afternoon but ill have to make out a new provisions list as each house block has its own canteen the walk across to my new cell via several long corridors is accompanied by the usual opening and closing ceremony of doublebarred gates every few yards and when we finally arrive we are herded into the inevitable waiting room ive never been much good at waiting weve only been standing around for a few minutes when a young officer mr aveling opens the door and says archer mr loughnane wants to see you about reallocation ive only just arrived theyre letting you out shouts one of the prisoners ask if i can share a cell with you darling shouts another dont pay more than the going rate offers a third prison humour mr aveling escorts me across the corridor to a large more comfortable room by the standards ive become used to during the past few days and introduces me to mr loughnane and mr gates i take a seat opposite them on the other side of the desk more formfilling im afraid says mr loughnane almost apologetically how are you settling in he asks i now accept this as the standard opening to any conversation with an officer i havent met before im fine except for having to be locked up in such a confined space for so many hours were you at public school mr gates asks yes i reply wondering why he asked this non sequitur its just that we find public school boys settle in far more quickly than your average prisoner i dont know whether to laugh or cry to be honest he continues ive already filled in most of the boxes about whether you can read or write if youre on any drugs and how often youve been to jail i can also confirm that you have been allocated category d status and will therefore be moved to an open prison in the near future like immediately near future has a different meaning in prison mr loughnane explains that first they have to locate a prison that has a vacancy and once that has been confirmed there will be the added problem of transport i raise an eyebrow thats always one of our biggest headaches mr loughnane explains group organize all the transport between prisons and we have to fit in with their timetable he then asks do you know any category d prisons you would like to be considered for the only open prison ive ever heard of is ford i tell him and the one piece of information ive picked up from a former prisoner is that they have a good library yes they do confirms mr gates checking the prisons handbook on the table in front of him as if it were a relais chateaux guide well give them a call later this morning and check if they have any spaces available i thank them both before being escorted back to the waiting room have they fixed you up with the riverside suite asks one prisoner no i reply but they did promise i wouldnt have to share a cell with you this feeble effort is greeted by clapping and cheers which i later learn was because id stood up to a man who had blown his brothers head off im glad i was told this later because let me assure you if id known at the time i would have kept my mouth shut the door is opened again and this time mr aveling tells me that the senior officer on the block wants to see me this is greeted by more jeers and applause be careful jeff he thinks youre after his job im led to an even more comfortable room with chairs a desk and even pictures on the walls to be greeted by four officers three men and one woman mr marsland the most senior officer present two pips on his epaulettes ftnref one pip is a senior officer two pips a principal officer confirms the rumour that as i wont be staying long he has put me on the lifers spur i was obviously unable to mask my horror at the very idea because he quickly reassures me youll find its the most settled wing in the prison as most of the inmates have sentences ranging between twelve and twentyfive years and all they want is an easy life otherwise theyll never be considered for transfer to a b or ccat let alone parole yet again exactly the opposite of what one might imagine and we also have a request says mr marsland looking down at a sheet of paper mrs williamson is running a creativewriting course and wonders if you would be willing to address her class of course i will i said how many normally attend because its you we think theyll be record numbers says mrs williamson so it could be as many as twelve i havent addressed an audience of twelve since i was the glc candidate for romford thirty years ago one problem has arisen continues mr marsland im afraid there are no single cells available on the lifers spur at the moment so youll have to share my heart sinks will i end up with a murderer a rapist or a drug addict or a combination of all three but well try to find you a sensible cellmate he concludes before standing to signal that the interview is over i return to the waiting room and only have to hang around for a few more minutes before we are taken off to our new cells once again ive been put on the top floor i think this must be for security reasons cell is a little larger than cell where i last resided but far from double the size remembering that it has to accommodate two prisoners it measures seven paces by four rather than five by three and up against the far wall directly in front of the lavatory is a small bunk bed which one would more normally associate with a nursery my roommate turns out to be terry terry the writer he is the one who approached me in the yard and asked if i would read his manuscript hes been selected to join me because he doesnt smoke a rarity amongst inmates and its a prison regulation that if you dont smoke they cant make you share a cell with someone who does the authorities assumed i would be aware of this rule i wasnt terry as i have already mentioned is halfway through writing a novel and seems pleased to discover who his cellmate will be i find out later why and its not because he wants me to help him with his syntax terry is outwardly courteous and friendly and despite my continually asking him to call me jeffrey he goes on addressing me as mr archer we agree that he will have the top bunk and i the bottom on account of my advanced years i quickly discover that hes very tidy happy to make both beds sweep the floor and regularly empty our little plastic bucket i begin to unpack my cellophane bag and store my possessions in the tiny cupboard above my bed once weve both finished unpacking i explain to terry that i write for six hours a day and hope he will understand if i dont speak to him during those set twohour periods he seems delighted with this arrangement explaining that he wants to get on with his own novel im about to ask how its progressing when the door is opened and were joined by a prison officer who has intercepted my freshly ironed white shirt the officer begins by apologizing before explaining that he will have to confiscate my white shirt because if i were to wear it i might be mistaken for a member of the prison staff this is the white shirt that id had washed and ironed by peter the press so that i could look smart for will and jamess visit im now down to one blue shirt and one tshirt borrowed he places my white shirt in yet another plastic bag for which i have to sign yet another form he assures me that it will be returned as soon as i have completed my sentence noon after a second session of writing the cell door is opened and we are let out for association i join the lifers on the ground floor which has an identical layout to house block three the lifers murderers plus a handful of abh and gbh ftnref actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm to make up the numbers range in age from nineteen to fifty and view me with considerable suspicion not only because im a conservative millionaire but far worse i will only be with them for a few days before im dispatched to an open prison something they wont experience for at least another ten years it will take a far greater effort to break down the barriers with this particular group than the young fledgeling criminals of house block three as i stroll around i stop to glance at the tv a man of about my age is watching errol flynn and david niven in the blackandwhite version of the charge of the light brigade i take a seat next to him im david he says you havent shaved today i confess my sin and explain that i was in the process of doing so when an officer told me i would be moving understood said david but i have to tell you jeffrey youre too old for designer stubble all the lifers shave he tells me youve got to cling on to whatever dignity you can in a hellhole like this he adds and a warm shower and a good shave are probably the best way to start the day david goes on chatting during the film as if it was nothing more than background muzak he apologizes for not having read any of my novels assuring me that his wife has enjoyed all of them but he only finds time to read whenever hes in jail i resist asking the obvious question what are you reading at the moment i enquire ackroyds life of dickens he replies and as if he senses my incredulity adds mr micawber what a character bit like my father to be honest always in debt now remind me what was his christian name wilkins i reply just testing jeffrey just testing actually i tried to get one of your books out of the library the other day but theyve removed them all from the shelves a diabolical liberty thats what id call it i told them i wanted to read it not steal the bloody thing i begin to notice how few prisoners use bad language in front of me one of the other inmates who has been watching the tv leans across and asks me if the storys true i can just about recall tennysons poem of the gallant six hundred and im fairly certain errol flynn didnt ride through the enemy lines and thrust a sword into the heart of their leader of course he did says david it was in his contract on this occasion we do get to see the closing titles because the duty officer has checked what time the film finishes he prefers not to have thirty or forty disenchanted lifers on his hands at five were invited to return to our cells for lockup this invitation takes the form of an officer bellowing at the top of his voice on arrival i find another letters waiting for me on the bottom bunk all of them have been opened as per prison regulations to check they do not contain any drugs razor blades or money reading every one of them kills another couple of hours while youre banged up im beginning to think in prison jargon the public seems genuinely concerned about my plight many of them comment on the judges summingup and the harshness of the sentence while others point out that bank robbers paedophiles and even those charged with manslaughter often get off with a two or threeyear sentence the recurring theme is what does mr justice potts have against you i confess i dont know the answer to that question but what cannot be denied is that i asked my barrister nick purnell on the third fourth and seventh days of the trial to speak to the judge privately in chambers about his obvious prejudice and request a retrial however my silk advised against this approach on the grounds that it would only turn the whole trial into an allout battle between the two of us lest you might think i am making this all up conveniently after the event i also confided my fears to the honourable michael beloff qc gilbert gray qc and johnnie nutting qc during the trial it wasnt until the second hour that i came across a letter demanding that i should apologize to all those i had let down the next letter in the pile is from mary i read it again and again she begins by remarking that she couldnt remember when she had last written to me she reminds me that she is off to strathclyde university this morning to chair the summer school on solar energy accompanied by the worlds press and my son will thank god for will hes been a tower of strength at the end of the week she flies to dresden to attend another conference and is hoping to be back in time to visit me at belmarsh on sunday morning i miss her and the children of course i do but above anything i hope it wont be too long before the press become bored with me and allow mary to carry on with her life when i come to the end of the letters terry helps me put them into four large brown envelopes so they can be sent on to alison my pa in order that everyone who has taken the trouble to write receives a reply while terry is helping me he begins to tell me his life story and how he ended up being in jail hes not a lifer which is perhaps another reason they asked him if he was willing to share a cell with me terry has been in prison twice graduating via borstal and a remand centre he began sniffing solvents as a child before moving on to cannabis by the age of twelve his first offence was robbing a local newsagent because he needed money for his drug habit he was sentenced to two years and served one his second charge was for robbing a jewellers in margate of worth of goods for which he hoped to make around from a london fence the police caught him redhanded his words and he was sentenced to five years he was twentytwo at the time and served three and a half years of that sentence before being released terry had only been out for seven months when he robbed an opticians designer goods cartier calvin klein and christian dior stolen to order this time he was paid in cash but arrested a week later the fingerprints on the shop window he put his fist through matched his leaving the police with only one suspect the judge sentenced him to another five years terry hopes to be released in december of this year prison he claims has weaned him off drugs and hes only thankful that hes never tried heroin terry is nobodys fool and i only hope that when he gets out he will not return for a third time he swears he wont but a prison officer tells me that twothirds of repeat offenders are back inside within twelve months we have our regulars just like any blackpool hotel except we dont charge for bed and breakfast terry is telling me about his mother when suddenly there is a wild commotion of screaming and shouting that reverberates throughout the entire block its the first time im glad that my cell door is locked the prisoners in block one are yelling at a man who is being escorted to the medical centre on the far side of the yard i remember it well whats all that about i ask as i stare out of our cell window hes a nonce terry explains nonce prison slang for a nonsense merchant a paedophile if hed been on this block we would have jugged him long ago jugged him a jug of boiling hot water terry explains mixed with a bag of sugar to form a syrup two cons would hold him down while the liquid is poured slowly over his face my god that must be horrific first the skin peels off your face and then the sugar dissolves so you end up disfigured for the rest of your life no more than he deserves terry adds have you ever witnessed that i ask three times he replies matteroffactly one nonce one drug dealer and once over an argument about someone who hadnt returned a twopound phonecard he pauses before adding if they were to put him on this block hed be dead within twentyfour hours im terrified so i can only wonder what sort of fear they live in the moment the prisoner disappears into the medical centre the shouting and yelling stops pm the cell door is at last unlocked and we are allowed out into the exercise yard on my first circuit about two hundred yards im joined by a young prisoner come to think of it everyone is young except for me and david his name is nick and if it werent for his crooked front teeth and broken nose he would be a goodlooking man hes been in prison for the past fourteen years and hes only thirtythree but he hopes to be out in four years time as long as he can beat his latest rap your latest rap i repeat yeah theyve been trying to pin arson on me after what i got up to in durham but theyve got no proof that i set fire to my cell so theyll have to drop the charge hes joined by another lifer who has just completed four of his eighteen years there seems to be a completely different attitude among the lifers they often say dont bother to count the first six years they acknowledge they wont be out next week next month or even next year and have settled for a long spell of prison life most of them treat me with respect and dont indulge in clever or snide remarks on the next circuit im joined by mike armed robbery who tells me that he listened to ted francis and max clifford on the radio last night and adds that the boys just cant wait for one of them to be sent to prison we dont like people who stitch up their mates especially for money i stick assiduously to nick purnells advice and make no comment when i return to the cell terry is about to go down for supper i tell him i just cant face it but he begs me to join him because tonight its pineapple upsidedown pudding and thats his favourite i join him and go through the ritual of selecting a couple of burnt mushrooms in order to lay my hands on an extra upsidedown pudding by the time i get back to the cell terry is sweeping the room and cleaning the washbasin ive been lucky to be shacked up with someone who is so tidy and hates anything to be out of place terry sits on the bed munching his meal while i read through what ive penned that day once terrys finished he washes his plate knife fork and spoon before stacking them neatly on the floor in the corner i continue reading my script while he picks up a bible he turns to the book of hebrews which i confess i have never read and studies quietly for the next hour once ive completed my work for the day i return to reading the moons a balloon which i put down just after ten when war has been declared the pillows are a little softer than those on block three for which i am grateful day wednesday july am fuck off cries a voice so loud it wakes me its a few moments before i realize that its terry shouting in his sleep he mumbles something else which i cant quite decipher before he wakes with a start he climbs out of bed almost as if hes unaware theres someone in the bunk below him i dont stir but open my eyes and watch carefully im not frightened although terry has a past record of violence ive never seen any sign of it in fact despite the use of bad language in his novel he never swears in front of me at least not when hes awake terry walks slowly over to the wall and places his head in the corner like a cat who thinks hes about to die he doesnt move for some time then turns picks up a towel by the basin sits down on the plastic chair and buries his head in the towel desperate and depressed i try to imagine what must be going through his tortured mind he slowly raises his head and stares at me as if suddenly remembering that hes not alone sorry mr archer he says did i wake you its not important i reply do you want to talk about it its a recurring nightmare he says but for some unexplainable reason its been worse for the past couple of weeks when i was a kid he pauses no doubt considering whether to confide in me my stepfather used to beat me and my mum with a leather strap and ive suddenly started having nightmares about it all these years later how old were you at the time i ask about six but it carried on until i was sixteen when my mum died how did your mother die i ask after all she cant have been that old its all a bit of a mystery terry says quietly all i know for certain is that they found her body in the front room by the grate and then my stepfather buggered off to brighton with my stepsister i have a feeling that terry knows only too well what and who caused his mothers death but he isnt yet willing to impart that information after all hes well aware im writing a daily diary so what happened to you when he disappeared off to brighton i was taken into care followed by borstal remand home and finally jail a different sort of education to yours how can those of us who have had a comparatively normal upbringing begin to understand what this young man has been through is going through sorry he repeats and then climbs back onto the top bunk and is asleep again within minutes i climb out of bed clean my teeth rub a cold flannel over my face and then settle down to write for the first session of the day at this early hour all the other prisoners are asleep or at least i assume they are because not a sound is coming from the surrounding cells even the earlymorning patrol of barking alsatians doesnt distract me any longer in london i live near a railway track that winds its way into waterloo but i am never woken by the latenight or earlymorning trains in prison its rap music inmates hollering at each other and alsatians that dont disturb a lifers dreams once ive completed my twohour session i begin the lengthy process of shaving although my life is beginning to fall into a senseless routine i hope to at least break it up today by going to the gym ive put my name down for the am to am session this morning as im already missing my daily exercise am just after nine the cell door is opened and my weekly twelve pounds fifty pence worth of canteen provisions are passed over to me by a lady in a white coat i thank her but she doesnt respond i sit on the end of my bed unpack each item one by one i settle down to enjoy a bowl of cornflakes swimming in fresh milk this is the meal i would normally have in my kitchen at home an hour before going to the gym im used to a disciplined wellordered life but its no longer selfdiscipline because someone else is giving the orders am im pacing up and down the cell waiting for the gym call when a voice bellows out from below gym is cancelled my heart sinks and i stare out of the barred window wondering why when the door is eventually opened for association derek known as del boy who runs the hotplate and seems to have a free rein of the block appears outside my door why was gym cancelled i ask a con has got out onto the roof via a skylight in the gym he explains result gym closed until further notice and will not open again until security has doublechecked every possible exit and the authorities consider it a safe area again he grins enjoying his role as the prison oracle anything else i can help you with del boy enquires bottled water and an a writing pad i reply theyll be with you before the hour has chimed squire ive already learnt not to ask what myriad of deals will have to be carried out to achieve this simple request james had warned me on my first day about the prison term doublebubble meaning certain favours have to be repaid twice over during association yesterday evening i witnessed derek cut a rolledup cigarette in half and then pass it over to another prisoner this was on a tuesday and the hapless inmate knew he wouldnt be able to repay the debt until today when he would have his next canteen but his craving was so great that he accepted knowing that he would have to give del boy a whole cigarette in return or he could never hope to strike up another bargain with him or anyone else for that matter am it must have been a few minutes after eleven when my cell door is yanked open again to reveal mr loughnane just the sight of him lifts my spirits he tells me that he has spoken to his opposite number at ford open prison who will have to refer the matter to the governor as he doesnt have the authority to make the final decision how long do you expect that will take i ask couple of days at the most hell probably come back to me on friday and when he does ill be in touch with group this simple transaction would take the average businessman a couple of hours at most for the first time in years im having to move at someone elses pace pm we are all sent off to work im down on the register under workshops where i will have to pack breakfast bags that will eventually end up in other prisons my salary will be p an hour new labours minimumwage policy hasnt quite trickled down to convicted felons the truth is were captive labour im about to join the chain gang when another prison officer mr young asks me to wait behind until the others have left for the work area he returns a few minutes later to tell me that ive received so much registered mail they have decided to take me to it rather than bring the stack to me another long walk in a different direction even more opening and closing of barred gates by which time i have learnt that mr young has been in the prison service for eleven years his annual basic pay is and its quite hard if not impossible to find somewhere to live in london on that salary when we arrive at reception two other officers are standing behind a counter in front of rows and rows of cluttered wooden shelves mr pearson removes thirtytwo registered letters and parcels from a shelf behind him and places them on the counter he starts to open them one by one in front of me another prison regulation the two officers then make a little pile of bibles and books and another of gifts which they eventually place in a plastic bag and once ive signed the requisite form hand them all across to me peach says mr pearson and another prisoner steps forward to have a parcel opened in front of him its a pair of the latest nike trainers which have been sent in by his girlfriend both clutching onto our plastic bags we accompany mr young back to block one on the way i apologize to peach i never did find out his first name for keeping him waiting no problem he says you kept me out of my cell for nearly an hour mr young continues to tell us about some of the other problems the prison service is facing we are onto staff benefits and shiftwork when an alarm goes off and officers appear running towards us from every direction mr young quickly unlocks the nearest waiting room and bundles peach and myself inside locking the door firmly behind us we stare through the windows as officers continue rushing past us but we have no way of finding out why a few moments later a prisoner held down by three officers and surrounded by others is dragged off past us in the opposite direction one of the officers is pushing the prisoners head down while another keeps his legs bent so that when he passes us he leaves an impression of a marionette controlled by invisible strings peach tells me that its known as being bent up or twisted up and is part of the process of control and restraint control and restraint the prisoner will be dragged into a strip cell and held down while his clothes are cut off with a pair of scissors hes then put in wrist locks before they bend his legs behind his back finally they put a belt around his waist that has handcuffs on each side making it impossible for him to move his arms or legs and then what theyll take him off to segregation peach explains hell be put into a single cell that consists of a metal sink metal table and metal chair all fixed to the wall so he cant smash anything up how long will they leave him there about ten days peach replies have you ever been in segregation i ask no he says firmly i want to get out of this place as quickly as possible and thats the easiest way to be sure your sentence is lengthened once the commotion has died down mr young returns to unlock the door and we continue our journey back to the cells as if nothing had happened each block has four spurs which run off from the centre like a maltese cross in the middle of the cross is an octangular glass office known as the bubble which is situated on the centre of the three floors from this vantage point the staff can control any problems that might arise as we pass the bubble i ask the duty officer what happened one of the prisoners he explains has used threatening and abusive language when addressing a woman officer he adds no further detail to this meagre piece of information once back in my cell terry tells me that the prisoner will be put on report and be up in front of the governor tomorrow morning he also confirms that hell probably end up with ten days in solitary have you ever been in segregation i ask him three times he admits but i was younger then and can tell you i dont recommend it even as an experience for your diary by the way he adds ive just phoned my dad the daily express have been onto him offering a grand for a photo of me the con jeffrey has to live with and theyve offered him another thousand if hell give them all the details of my past criminal record he told them to bugger off but he says they just wont go away they sounded disappointed when he told them i wasnt a murderer you will be by the time the sunday editions come out i promise him pm another officer opens the door to tell us that our afternoon association will be cut short because the prison staff are holding a meeting terry tells the officer who passes on this information that any staff meeting should be held when we are banged up not during association he makes a fair point but all the officer says is its not my decision and slams the door pm what is almost impossible to describe in its full horror is the time you spend banged up so please do not consider this diary to be a running commentary because i would only ask you to think about the endless hours in between heaven knows what that does to lifers who can see no end to their incarceration and do not have the privilege of being able to occupy their time writing in my particular case there is hope a word you hear prisoners using all the time they hope that theyll win their case have their sentence cut be let out on parole or just be moved to a single cell for me as a category d prisoner i simply hope to be transferred to ford open prison as soon as possible but god knows what a lifer hopes for and i resolve to try and find out during the next few days pm association at last the cell door is opened for an extended period of time fortyfive minutes when i walk down to join the other inmates on the ground floor paul murder hands me a book of firstclass stamps and asks for nothing in return he either has no one to write to or perhaps cant write i hear youre having a postage problem is all he says and walks away i do not explain that my pa is dealing with all my letters and therefore i have no postage problem because it would only belittle such a thoughtful gesture during association i notice that the high barred gates at the end of the room lead onto a larger outer area which has its own television pool table and more comfortable chairs but im not permitted to enter this hallowed territory as you can only leave the restricted area if youre an enhanced prisoner there are three levels of prisoner basic standard and enhanced every inmate begins their sentence as standard in the middle this leaves you the chance to go up or down and that decision depends solely on your behaviour someone who wishes to take on more responsibility like being a listener a teaboy or a cleaner will quickly be promoted to enhanced status and enjoy the privileges that go with it however anyone who attacks a prison officer or is caught taking drugs will be downgraded to basic and these things matter when it comes to your standard of living in prison and later when the authorities consider your parole and possible early release terry my cellmate hates authority and refuses to go along with the system so spends his life bobbing up and down between basic and standard derek del boy bicknell on the other hand took advantage of the system and quickly became enhanced but then he is bright and well capable of taking on responsibility he already has the free run of the ground floor and in fact never seems to be in his cell i hope by now you have a picture in your mind of del boy because hes a sixfoot twentystone west indian who wears a thin gold chain around his neck a thicker one around his right wrist and sports the latest designer watch he also wears a fashionable tracksuit and nike shoes come to think of it im the only prisoner who still wears a shirt but if i were to remain here for any length of time i would also end up wearing a tracksuit pm supper called tea is being served so i return to my cell to collect my plastic tray and plate tonight its egg and bacon and im just too hungry to say no the egg has a solid yolk and the greasy bacon is fatty curling and inedible i drink a mug of highland spring water a trade for two autographs on birthday cards and finish the meal with a bowl of cup a soup minestrone p at the next election no one will be able to accuse me of not knowing the price of goods in the supermarket not to mention their true value terry cleans our utensils before we return to association on the ground floor where i find del boy running a card school at the other end of the room why am i not surprised he beckons me to join them the game is made up of four lifers who are playing kaluki i watch a couple of hands while trying to keep an eye on the phone queue as im hoping to speak to mary she should have returned from her day at strathclyde university and be back in her hotel by now you will have realized that she cant call me paul murder and stamps announces he needs to phone his girlfriend and suggests i take over his hand while he joins the queue jeffs got to be an improvement on you says derek as paul rises to depart i lose the first hand badly survive the second and win the third thankfully before del boy starts dealing the fourth paul returns his lordships not bad says derek not bad at all im slowly being accepted the queue for the two phones doesnt seem to diminish so i spend some time talking to a young lifer called michael murder hes very paleskinned extremely thin and covered in tattoos with needle tracks up and down his arms he invites me into his cell and shows me a picture of his wife and child by the time michael is released from prison his eightmonthold daughter will have left school probably be married and have children of her own in fact this twentytwoyearold boy may well be a grandfather by the time hes released when i leave michaels cell to rejoin the others i spot ms roberts the deputy governor who came to visit me when i was on the medical wing she is surrounded by lifers ms roberts has a real gift for putting these desperate men at ease i finally give up and join the phone queue aware that we are fast approaching lockup when at last i make the one spare phone out of two a lifer who is on the other line leans over to warn me that any conversations made on these phones are taperecorded by the police i thank him but cant imagine what they would find of interest eavesdropping on a chat with my wife a hotel operator answers the call and puts me through to her room the phone rings and rings pm i return to my cell to be faced with another mountain of mail terry helps by taking them out of their envelopes before placing them in piles cards on one side letters on the other while i continue to go over the script ive written that day terry asks if he can keep one or two of the cards as a memento only if they hve no address i tell him as its still my intention to reply to every one of them once ive finished correcting my daily script i turn my attention to the letters like my life they are falling into a pattern of their own some offering condolences on my mothers death others kindness and support many continue to comment on mr justice pottss summingup and the harshness of the sentence i am bound to admit they bring back ones faith in ones fellow menand women alison my pa has written to say that i am receiving even more correspondence by every post at home and she confirms that they are also running at three hundred to one in support i hand one of the letters up to terry its from his cousin whos read in the papers that were sharing a cell terry tells me that hes serving a life sentence in parkhurst for murder my cellmate adds they havent spoken to each other for years and it was only a couple of hours ago i was feeling low because i havent managed to speak to mary today day thursday july am ive slept for seven hours when i wake i begin to think about my first week in prison the longest week of my life for the first time i consider the future and what it holds for me will i have to follow the path of two of my heroes emma hamilton and oscar wilde and choose to live a secluded life abroad unable to enjoy the society that has been so much a part of my very existence will i be able to visit old haunts the national theatre lords le caprice the tate gallery the ugc cinema in fulham road or even walk down the street without peoples only thought being theres the man who went to jail for perjury i cant explain to every one of them that i didnt get a fair trial its so unlike me to be introspective or pessimistic but when youre locked up in a cell seven paces by four for hour upon hour every day you begin to wonder if anyone out there even knows youre still alive am mr highland a young officer unlocks my cell door and tells me i have a legal visit at ten thirty i ask if i might be allowed to take a shower and wash my hair no he says use the washbasin only the second officer to be offhand since ive arrived i explain that its quite hard to have a shower in a washbasin he tells me that ive got an attitude problem and says that if i go on like this hell have to put me on report it feels like being back at school at the wrong end of your life i shave and clean myself up as best i can before being escorted to yet another part of the building so that i can meet up with my lawyers i am deposited in a room about eight foot by eight with windows in all four walls even lawyers have been known to bring in drugs for their clients theres a large oblong table in the centre of the room with six chairs around it a few moments later im joined by nick purnell qc and his junior alex cameron who are accompanied by my solicitor ramona mehta nick takes me slowly through the process of appeal against conviction and sentence hes fairly pessimistic about conviction despite there being a considerable amount of evidence of the judges bias when summing up but he says only those in the court room will remember the emphasis and exaggeration potts put on certain words when he addressed the jury the judge continually reminded the jurors that i hadnt given evidence and holding up mrs peppiatts small diary not my large office diary repeatedly remarked that no one has denied this is a real diary he didnt point out to the jury however that even if that diary had appeared in the original trial it wouldnt have made any material difference on the subject of sentence nick purnell is more confident as several leading members of the bar have made it clear that they consider four years to be not only harsh but unjust and the public seem to be universally in agreement with the professionals reduction of sentence can make a great difference because any conviction of four years or more requires a decision by the parole board before you can be set free any sentence of less than four years even by one day means you are automatically released after serving half your sentence assuming youve been a model prisoner youre also eligible for tagging which knocks off another two months when you are restricted to your chosen place of residence between the hours of seven pm and seven am the following morning ftnref for example if my sentence was reduced by one year from four to three i would end up only serving sixteen months and be released on november whereas with a fouryear sentence the earliest i could hope to be released would be july we go on to discuss whether this is the right time to issue a writ against emma nicholson for hinting that the millions of pounds i helped raise for the kurds didnt reach them with the twisted implication that some of the money must therefore have ended up in my pocket nick points out that sir nicholas young the chief executive of the red cross has come to my defence and even the evening standard is saying i have no case to answer alex tells me that several articles are now being written in support of my position including one by trevor kavanagh in the sun he also points out that the daily telegraph had a tilt at max hastings i tell nick that i want to issue a writ against ted francis to recover the i loaned him and for claiming that over twenty years ago hed seen a nigerian prostitute climbing out of my bedroom window this is quite an achievement as francis and i stayed at different hotels and my room was on the top floor i do hope the poor girl was a member of the lagos mountain rescue team my legal team understand my anger but want to wait until the dust has settled i reluctantly agree but remain unconvinced i cant help remembering that when i complained to nick about mr justice pottss prejudiced attitude during the pretrial hearings and the trial itself he advised me against raising the matter with the judge in chambers saying it would only exacerbate the problem on the hour i leave them to return to their world while i am escorted back to mine noon i take one look at what theyre offering at the hotplate for lunch and return to my cell with an empty plastic plate i add a packet of crisps to my opened tin of spam before pouring myself a mug of cranberry juice topped up with highland spring my supplies are already running low pm mr weedon comes to my cell to let me know that i have a personal visit at three oclock who i enquire he checks his list william and james archer i am about to suggest it might have been more considerate of someone to warn me yesterday rather than tell me a few minutes before my sons are due to arrive however as mr highland has already threatened to place me on report for such insolence i decide to keep my counsel pm over eighty prisoners from all four blocks are streaming towards the visitors area on the long walk to the other side of the building i come across some inmates from my short stay on house block three its rather like meeting up with old school chums how are you what have you been up to have you met up with when we arrive in the waiting area the search is far more rigorous than usual del boy had already warned me that this is the one time the staff are nervous about the transfer of money drugs blades knives even guns and anything else that might be passed from a relation or family friend on to a prisoner i am pleased to discover that my own search is fairly cursory after the search i am asked to place a yellow sash over my shoulder so i look like a child about to go on a bike ride this is to indicate that im a prisoner so that i cant stroll out with my sons once the visit is over im bound to say that i find this tiny act humiliating im then ushered into a room about the size of a large gymnasium chairs are set out in five long rows marked a to e i report to a desk that is raised three or four feet above the ground and another officer checks his list and then tells me to go to c all the prisoners sit on the righthand side opposite their visitors who sit on the left there is a small low table in between us which is screwed to the floor and is meant to keep you apart there is also a balcony above us that overlooks the whole room with even more officers staring down on the proceedings to see if they can spot anything being passed across the tables below them they are assisted by several cctv cameras a notice on the walls states that the tapes can be used as evidence for a further prosecution and in capitals adds this applies to both prisoners and their visitors i walk down three rows to find william sitting on his own he jumps up and gives me a big hug and im reminded just how much ive missed him james he tells me is at the canteen purchasing my favourite beverage he appears a few minutes later carrying a tray of diet cokes and several kitkats the boys laugh when i pull all three cokes towards my side of the table and make no attempt to offer them even a stick of the kitkat will begins by telling me about marys visit to strathclyde university where she made a short statement to the press before delivering her lecture she began by remarking that it was the largest turnout she had ever managed for a lecture on quantum solarenergy conversion will is not surprised to learn that i have received over a thousand letters and cards in the first few days at belmarsh and he tells me there are almost three times that number back at the flat support is coming in from every quarter james adds including thoughtful statements from john major and george carey alison has had a list typed up my younger son continues but they wouldnt allow me to bring anything into the visits room so ill have it posted on to you tomorrow this news gives me such a lift and makes me feel guilty that i had ever doubted my friends would stand by me i alert the two boys to the fact that i am writing a daytoday diary and will need to see my agent jonathan lloyd my publisher victoria barnsley and my editor robert lacey fairly soon but as i am only allowed one personal visit every two weeks i dont want to see anyone other than the family until ive been moved to an open prison will tells me that hes already booked himself in for two weeks time but hopes i will have been transferred to somewhere like ford long before then because ive not been reading any newspapers or listening to the news as im heartily sick of inaccurate stories about myself and what im up to at belmarsh jamie brings me up to date on the battle for the tory party leadership he reports that the polls clearly indicate that the people who deserted the conservatives at the last election want ken clarke while the party membership favours iain duncan smith i like and admire both men though neither is a close friend however it doesnt take a massive intellect to work out that if we hope to win the next election or at least make a large enough dent in the governments majority to ensure that opinion formers believe we can win the following election it might be wise to take some notice of the electorates views as to who should be our leader i consider dropping ken a note but realize it may not help his cause will goes on to tell me that michael beloff qc gilbert gray qc and johnnie nutting qc are in regular touch with my legal team gilly wondered if pottss animosity had been aimed at nick purnell as its the talk of the bar that he lost his temper with nick on several occasions during the pretrial and trial itself but never once in front of the jury no i tell them it was nothing to do with nick it was entirely personal im momentarily distracted by an attractive young woman sitting directly in front of me in row b a prisoner with his back to me is leaning across the table and kissing her i remember being told by kevin that this was the most common way of passing drugs i watch more carefully and decide this is about sex pure animal sex and has nothing to do with drugs james tells me about the film he and nod nadhim zahawi a kurdish friend enjoyed on sunday evening rush hour which in normal circumstances i would have seen with them dont worry he adds were keeping a list of all the films you would have enjoyed so that you can eventually see them on video i dont like the sound of the word eventually i talk to will about when he expects to return to america and continue with his work as a documentary cameraman he tells me that he will remain in england while his mother is so unsettled and feels in such need of him how lucky i am to be blessed with such a family an announcement is made over the tannoy to inform us that all visitors must now leave have we really had an hour together all round the room a great deal of kissing commences before friends and family reluctantly depart the prisoners have to remain in their places until the last visitor has been signed out and left the room i spend my time glancing up and down the rows the man whose kiss had been so overtly sexual now has his head bowed in his hands i wonder just how long his sentence is and what age he and his girlfriend will be by the time hes released from prison when the last visitor has left we all file back out of the room once again my search is fairly cursory i never discover what the other prisoners are put through though del boy tells me later that if theyve picked up anything suspicious on the video camera its a full stripsearch plus sniffer dogs on the way back to my cell a block three prisoner tells me he will be going home next month having completed his sentence he adds that he had a visit from his wife who is sticking by him but if hes ever sentenced again shes made it clear that shell leave him im only a few yards from my cell door when mr weedon tells me that the education officer wants to see me i turn round and he escorts me up to the middle floor the education officer is dressed in a smart brown suit he stands up when i enter the room and shakes me by the hand my names peter farrell he says i see youve put yourself down for education yes i confirm i was rather hoping it would give me a chance to use the library yes it will says mr farrell but i wonder if i could ask you to assist us with those prisoners who are learning to read and write as im rather shortstaffed at the moment of course i reply youll get a pound an hour he adds with a grin we talk for some time about the fact that there are a number of bright people among the prisoners especially the lifers some of whom would be quite capable of sitting for an open university degree my biggest problem he explains is that while the inmates can earn ten to twelve pounds a week in the workshops dropping teabags jam and sugar into plastic containers they only receive six pounds fifty a week if they sign up for education so i often lose out on some potentially able students for the sake of tobacco money my god there are going to be some speeches i will have to make should i ever return to the house of lords there is a knock on the door and mr marsland the senior officer comes in to warn me that its almost time for my talk to the lifers on creative writing pm the lecture is set up in one of the waiting rooms and is attended by twelve prisoners serving life sentences plus two officers to keep an eye on proceedings there are two types of life sentence mandatory and discretionary but all that matters to a lifer is the tariff that has been set by the judge at their trial i begin my talk by telling the lifers that i didnt take up writing until i was thirtyfour after leaving parliament and facing bankruptcy so i try to assure them that you can begin a new career at any age proust i remind them said we all end up doing the thing were second best at once ive finished my short talk the first two questions fired at me are about writing a novel but i quickly discover that the other inmates mostly want to know how i feel about life behind bars and what changes i would make ive only been inside for eight days i keep reminding them i try valiantly to parry their questions but mr marsland and his deputy soon have to come to my rescue when the subject changes to how the prison is run and in particular their complaints about lockup times food no ice ftnref incell electricity for television and wages these all seem to be fair questions though nothing to do with writing the officers try to answer their queries without prevarication and both have so obviously given considerable thought to inmates problems they often sympathize but appear to have their hands tied by regulations bureaucracy and lack of money one prisoner called tony who seems not only to be bright but to have a real grasp of figures discusses the million budget that belmarsh enjoys right down to how much it costs to feed a prisoner every day i will never forget the answer to that question is allocated for three meals per prisoner per day then the caterers must be making a pound a day off every one of us tony retorts the meeting goes on well beyond the scheduled hour and its some time before one of the prisoners billy little who hails from glasgow actually asks another question about writing do i use my novels to expound any particular political prejudice no i reply firmly otherwise id have very few readers billy is a leftwinger by upbringing and persuasion and argues his case well he finds a great deal of pleasure in giving me a hard time and making me feel ill at ease with the other prisoners by the end of a heated exchange he is at least listening to my point of view on the way back to the cells billy tells me hes written a short story and some poetry he asks if i would be willing to read them and offer an opinion a sentence i usually dread when im on the outside he nips into his cell on the ground floor extracts some sheets of paper from a file and passes them over to me i leave him to find derek del boy bicknell waiting for me outside he warns me that terry my cellmate has been talking to the press and to be wary of saying anything to him talking to the press yeah the screws caught him on the phone to the sun im told that the going rate for an exclusive with anyone who has shared a cell with you is five grand i thank derek and assure him i havent discussed my case or anything of importance with terry and never would when i return to my cell i find terry looking shamefaced he confirms that he has spoken to the sun and theyre keen to know when im being moved to ford youll be on the front page tomorrow i warn him no no i didnt tell them anything he insists i try not to laugh as i settle down to read through another three hundred letters that have been opened by the censor and left on the end of my bed i cant believe hes had the time to read many if any of them when ive finished the last one i lie back on my bed and reluctantly pick up billy littles twelvepage essay i turn the first page i cannot believe what im reading he has such command of language insight and that rare gift of making the mundane interesting that i finish every word before switching off the light a few minutes after ten i have a feeling that youre going to hear a lot more about this man and not just from me day friday july am i am woken in the middle of the night by rap music blasting out from a cell on the other side of the block i cant imagine what it must be like if youre trying to sleep in the next cell or even worse in the bunk below im told that rap music is the biggest single cause of fights breaking out in prison im not surprised i had to wait until it was turned off before i could get back to sleep i didnt wake again until eight minutes past six amazingly terry can sleep through anything am i write for two hours and as soon as ive completed the first draft of what happened yesterday i strip down to my underpants put a towel round my waist and place another one on the end of the bed with a bar of soap and a bottle of shampoo next to it my cell door is opened at eight twentythree im out of the starting gate like a thoroughbred sprint along the corridor and into the shower room three of the four showers are already occupied by faster men than i however i still manage to capture the fourth stall and once ive taken a long pressbutton shower i feel clean for the first time in days when i return to my cell terry is still fast asleep and even a prison officer unlocking the door doesnt disturb him the new officer introduces himself as ray marcus and explains that he works in the censors department and is the other half of june stelfox who took care of my correspondence on house block three his job is to check every item of mail a prisoner is sent to make sure that theyre not receiving anything that is against the regulations razor blades drugs money or even food to be fair although the censors open every letter they dont read them ray is carrying a registered package which he slits open in front of me and extracts a bible the eleventh in nine days like the others i donate it to the chapel he then asks if he can help in any way with my mail problem ray as he prefers to be called is courteous and seems almost embarrassed by the fact that im not allowed to open my own post i tell him not to worry because i havent opened my own post for years i hand over three large brown envelopes containing all the letters ive received the day before plus the first week pages of my handwritten script together with twelve firstclass stamps i ask if they can all be sent back to my pa alison so that she can carry on as if i was on holiday or abroad he readily agrees but points out that as senior censor he is entitled to read anything that i am sending out thats fine by me i tell him id rather wait until its published he says with a grin after all ive read everything else youve written when he leaves he doesnt close my door as if he knows what a difference this simple gesture makes to a man who will be locked up for twentytwo hours every day this privilege lasts only for a few minutes before another officer strolling by slams it shut but i am grateful nevertheless am breakfast a bowl of cornflakes with uht milk from a carton that has been open and not seen a fridge for the past twentyfour hours wonderful am another officer arrives to announce that the chaplain would like to see me glorious escape he escorts me to the chapel no search this time where david powe is waiting for me he is wearing the same pale beige jacket grey flannel trousers and probably the same dog collar as he did when he conducted the service on sunday he is literally down at heel we chat about how im settling in doesnt everyone and then go on to discuss the fact that his sermon on cain and abel made it into private eye he chuckles obviously enjoying the notoriety david then talks about his wife whos the headmistress of a local primary school and has written two books for harpercollins on religion they have two children one aged thirteen and the other sixteen when he talks about his parish the other prisoners it doesnt take me long to realize that hes a deeply committed christian despite his doubting and doubtful flock of murderers rapists and drug addicts however he is delighted to hear that my cellmate terry reads the bible every day i confess to having never read hebrews david asks me about my own religious commitment and i tell him that when i was the conservative candidate for mayor of london i became aware of how many religions were being practised in the capital and if there was a god he had a lot of disparate groups representing him on earth he points out that in belmarsh there are over a hundred muslims another hundred roman catholics but that the majority of inmates are still c of e what about the jews i ask him only one or two that i know of he replies their family upbringing and sense of community is so strong that they rarely end up in the courts or prison when the hour is up everything seems to have an allocated time he blesses me and tells me that he hopes to see me back in church on sunday as its the biggest cell in the prison he most certainly will am mr weedon is waiting at the chapel door sorry barred gate to escort me back to my cell he says that mr marsland wants to see me again does this mean that they know when ill be leaving belmarsh and where ill be going i ask mr weedon but receive no response when i arrive at mr marslands office mr loughnane and mr gates are also present they all look grim my heart sinks and i now understand why mr weedon felt unable to answer my question mr marsland says that ford open prison have turned down my application because they feel they cant handle the press interest so the whole matter has been moved to a higher level for a moment i wonder if i will ever get out of this hellhole he adds hoping it will act as a sweetener that he plans to move me into a single cell because fossett terry was caught phoning the sun i can see that youre disappointed about ford he adds but well let you know where youll be going and when just as soon as they tell us i get up to leave i wonder if youd be willing to give another talk on creative writing asks mr marsland after your last effort several other prisoners have told us that they want to hear you speak why dont i just do an eightweek course i reply as it seems were going to be stuck with each other for the foreseeable future i immediately feel guilty about my sarcasm after all it isnt their fault that the governor of ford hasnt got the guts to try and handle a tricky problem perhaps he or she should read the human rights act and learn that this is not a fair reason to turn down my request pm a woman officer unlocks the cell door a cigarette hanging from her mouth ftnref i the director general of prisons martin narey has since issued a directive that officers should not smoke when on duty and tells terry he has a visitor terry cant believe it and tries to think who it could be his father rarely speaks to him his mother is dead his brother is dying of aids hes lost touch with his sister and his cousins in jail for murder he climbs down from the top bunk smiles for the first time in days and happily troops out into the corridor while im locked back in i take advantage of terrys absence and begin writing the second draft of yesterdays diary pm terry returns to the cell an hour later dejected a mistake must have been made because there turned out to be no visitor they left him in the waiting room for over an hour while the other prisoners enjoyed the company of their family or friends i sometimes forget how lucky i am pm association as i leave my cell and walk along the top landing derek jones a young doublestrike prisoner says he wants to show me something and invites me back to his cell he is one of those inmates whose tariff is openended and although his case comes up for review by the parole board in he isnt confident that they will release him i hear youre writing a book he says but are you interested in things they dont know about out there he asks staring through his barred window i nod then ill tell you something they dont even know about in here he points to a large stereo in the corner of the room probably the one that kept me awake last night it resembles a spaceship thats my most valuable possession in the world he says i dont interrupt but ive got a problem i still say nothing it runs on batteries cause i havent got any ice ice why would you need ice for a ghetto blaster in cell electricity he says laughing ah i see have you any idea how much batteries cost no i tell him a time and then theyre only good for twelve hours so i wouldnt be able to afford any tobacco if i had to buy new batteries every week i still havent worked out where all this is leading but i never have to buy any batteries do i dont you i say no he replies and then goes to a shelf behind his bed and extracts a biro he flicks off the little cap on the bottom and pulls out the refill which has a coil of thin wire wrapped around it he continues first i make an earth by scraping off a little paint from the water pipe behind my bed then i take off the plastic cover from the strip light on the ceiling and attach the other end of the wire to the little box inside the light derek can tell that im just about following this cunning subterfuge when he adds dont worry about the details jeff ive drawn you a diagram that way he says i get an uninterrupted supply of electricity at her majestys expense my immediate reaction is why isnt he on the outside doing a proper job i thank him and assure derek the story will get a mention in my story what do i get out of it he asks because when i leave this place all i have to my name other than that stereo is the ninety quid discharge money they give you ftnref inmates are given when leaving prison if they are of nfa no fixed abode if they have somewhere to live they can go back on social security after a fortnight i assure derek that my publishers will pay him a fee for the use of the diagram if it appears in the book we shake on it pm mr weedon returns to tell me that i am being moved to a single cell terry immediately becomes petulant and starts shouting that hed been promised a single cell even before id arrived and you would have got one fossett mr weedon replies if you hadnt phoned the press and grassed on your cellmate for a few quid terry continues to harangue the officer and i can only wonder how long he will last with such a short fuse once he returns to the outside world i gather up my possessions and move across from cell to on the other side of the corridor my fourth move in nine days taal a sixfoot fourinch ghanaian who was convicted of murdering a man in peckham despite claiming that he was in brighton with his girlfriend at the time returns to his old bunk in cell i feel bad about depriving taal of his private cell and it becomes yet another reason i want to move to a dcat prison as soon as possible so that he can have his single cell back i spend an hour filling up my cellophane bag carrying it across the corridor emptying it then rearranging my belongings in cell i have just completed this task when my new cell door is opened and im ordered to go down to the hotplate for supper pm i once again settle for the vegetarian option although paul murder and stamps who ticks off each name on a clipboard at the hotplate tells me that the chicken is passable i risk it hes wrong again i wont give him a third chance during association i spend half an hour with billy little murder in his cell going over his work he tells me he has at least another twenty years to serve as his tariff is openended so i advise him to start writing a novel even a trilogy he looks doubtful hes not a man whos ever put much faith in the word of a conservative theres a knock on the cell door and a massive giant of a man ambles into the room looking like a secondrow forward in search of a scrum i noticed him on the first day as he stood alone in the far corner of the room staring silently through me he was hard to miss at over six foot weighing around twentyone stone hes never said a word to me since my arrival on the spur and i confess to being a little apprehensive about him even frightened hes known as fletch hes come to let me know that terry is no longer complaining about my being moved into a single cell because he accepts that by phoning the sun he was out of order but he has since been warned that one of the sunday papers is going to run a story about him hitting a woman over the head with a snooker ball wrapped in a sock one of the many things prisoners will not tolerate is anyone attacking a woman terry has told fletch that hes terrified that some of the inmates will beat him up once the story is published ftnref beatings up hammerings usually take place in the shower room which is why some prisoners dont wash from one year to the next the reason the shower room is the preferred place for retribution is because its on the top floor at the end of a long corridor more than four prisoners are allowed to congregate at any one time and any excess noise is usually ignored as exuberance fletch is letting it be known that he doesnt want any trouble even though he accepts that the lad was stupid to have talked to the press in the first place fletch looks at me and says i must be the only person on the spur who hasnt spoken to you but then i hate everything you stand for dont take it personally he adds and then leaves without another word billy tells me that fletch is one of the most respected prisoners on the spur and to my surprise a listener dont worry about him he adds because i can tell you that one of the reasons we have so little trouble on this wing is because he was a bouncer for a london nightclub before he ended up in here last year he singlehandedly stopped a riot over the state of the food the screws could never have contained the problem on their own and they know it i leave billy and return to association to play a couple of hands of kaluki with del boy murder colin gbh and paul murder seventyfive years between them i win the first hand and lose the second by points its been that sort of a day just as im about to return to my cell for lockup ms roberts appears on the floor terry rushes across to her and begins an animated conversation she does her best to calm him down when he is placated enough to move on i ask her if shes had a call from my solicitor yes she replies and ill have a word with you first thing in the morning i hope youll feel its good news i dont press her for any details because several other prisoners have formed a queue as they also wish to speak to the deputy governor before lockup pm it has as i have already stated been an up and down sort of day but i feel a little better after ms roberts comments what will she have to tell me tomorrow for the next couple of hours i go through another hundred letters that the censor has left on my bed the pattern is now firmly set but there is one letter in particular that amuses me i am writing to give you my full support as i suspect that no one else is bothering to do so at the present time i smile because ms buxton of northants reminds me just how fortunate i am to have so many people willing to fight my corner i only have to think about terrys phantom visitor to realize just how lucky i am day saturday july am i wake in a cold sweat having had the strangest dream im back at oxford in the sixties where i win the university crosscountry trials which would automatically ensure that i was awarded a blue and a place in the team against cambridge as i ran the one hundred yards in my youth this scenario seems somewhat unlikely but it gets worse im disqualified and the race is awarded to the man who came second when the cup is presented to him i lose my temper with the judges the judges are david coleman and the late ron pickering two of the most decent men god ever put on earth they tell me they had to disqualify me because they just didnt believe i could possibly have won no doubt the prison psychiatrist will have a theory am i dont begin writing immediately as i consider the task i have set myself over the past few days a close study of lifers on spur one there are fiftytwo men serving life sentences ftnref on june there were inmates serving life sentences on june this figure had risen by per cent to per cent of them male of whom were convicted murderers its important to remember that murderers are different to other criminals for over per cent its a first offence and when they are released they never commit another crime its equally true to say that the other per cent are professional criminals who do not deserve a moment of your sympathy ive now held long conversations with about twenty of them and have come to the conclusion that they fall roughly into two categories this is of course an oversimplification as each individual is both complex and unique the first group consist of those who insist it wasnt me guv it was all a stitch up they didnt even find the murder weapon but because of my previous record i fitted neatly into the required police profile the other group hold their hands in the air and admit to a moment of madness which they will eternally regret and accept they must pay the penalty the law demands one or two even add its no more than i deserve my natural sense of justice makes me worry about the first group are they all liars or is there anyone on this spur serving a life sentence who is in fact innocent but more of that later am saturdays differ from every other day of the week because youre not supplied with a plastic bag containing breakfast the night before when you queue for supper at am your cell door is opened and you go down to the canteen for a cooked breakfast egg beans and chips i accept the egg and beans and wonder how many saturdays it will be before im willing to add the chips am im given the choice of taking exercise in the yard or remaining bangedup in my cell i sign up for exercise on the first two circuits of the yard im joined by a group of drug dealers who ask me if i need anything from marijuana to crack cocaine to heroin it takes them some time to accept that ive never taken a drug in my life and dont intend to start now we do a lot of business with your lot one of them adds casually i would like to have replied and i hope you rot in jail for the rest of your life but didnt have the guts the next inmate to join me is a hotgospeller who hopes that while im in belmarsh ill discover christ i explain that i consider ones religion to be a personal and private matter but thank him for his concern he isnt quite that easy to shake off and sticks with me for five more circuits unlike a visit from a jehovahs witness theres no way of slamming the front door i hope to manage a few circuits on my own so i can think for a moment but no such luck because im joined by a couple of east end tearaways who want my opinion on their upcoming court case i warn them that my knowledge of the law is fairly sketchy so perhaps im the wrong person to approach one of them becomes abusive and for the first time since arriving at belmarsh im frightened and fearful for my own safety paul has already warned me that there might well be the odd prisoner who would stick a knife in me just to get himself on the front pages and impress his girlfriend within moments billy little and fletch are strolling a pace behind me obviously having sensed the possible danger and although the two young hooligans are not from our spur one look at fletch and they are unlikely to try anything the tearaways peel off but i have a feeling they will hang around and bide their time perhaps it would be wise for me to avoid the exercise yard for a couple of days im finally joined by a charming young black prisoner who wants to tell me about his drumming problem it takes another couple of circuits before i realize that he doesnt play in a rock band drumming is simply slang for burglary i consider this particular experience a bit of a watershed if you didnt know what drumming was before you began reading this diary youre probably as naive as i am if you did these scribblings may well be commonplace noon lunch i am now a fully fledged vegetarian outside of prison i founded a club known as vaf and vop which many of my friends have become members of after sending a donation to the brompton hospital ftnref i am an admirer of the eminent heart surgeon sir magdi yacoub and any donation you give will assist his current research vaf is vegetarian at functions i have long believed that it is impossible even in the bestrun establishments to prepare three hundred steaks as each customer would wish them cooked so i always order the vegetarian alternative because i know it will have been individually prepared vop stands for vegetarian on planes i suspect many of you are already members of this club and if you are pay up and send your five pounds to the brompton hospital immediately i am now adding vip to my list and can only hope that none of you ever qualify for membership pm the cell door is opened and i am told that ms roberts wants to see me i feel my heart pounding as i try to recall her exact words the previous evening when i join her in a room just off the bubble she immediately confirms that my solicitors have been in touch and she has told them that she wants me out of belmarsh as quickly as possible she adds that they moved barry george murder of jill dando this morning and im due out next however she has just received a phone call from a chief inspector in the metropolitan police to warn her that they have received a letter from the baroness emma nicholson demanding an inquiry into what happened to the million i raised for the kurds i assure ms roberts that i was in no way involved with the receiving or distribution of any monies for the kurds as that was entirely the responsibility of the red cross she nods if the police confirm that they will not be following up ms nicholsons inquiry then we should have you out of belmarsh and off to a dcat by the end of the week as i have always in the past believed in justice i assume that the police will quickly confirm that i was not involved in any way ms roberts goes on to confirm that ford my first choice is unwilling to take me because of the publicity problem but she hopes to discuss some alternatives with me on monday ms roberts suggests that as my next lecture is coming up on thursday i should be released from my cell from nine in the morning until five in the afternoon so i can prepare for the talk in the library where i will have access to reference books she knows only too well that i can give this talk without a moments preparation but unlike the baroness nicholson she is concerned about what im going through pm association during the saturday afternoon break i go down to the ground floor hoping to watch some cricket on the tv but i have to settle for horse racing as a large number of prisoners are already sitting round the set intent on following the king george and queen elizabeth stakes at epsom the sport of kings has never been one of those pastimes that ive taken a great deal of interest in ive long accepted george bernard shaws maxim on horse racing that its nothing more than a plot between the upper classes and the lower classes to fleece the middle classes i turn away from the television and see a slight rather anaemiclooking young man standing alone in the corner hes wearing a raspberrycoloured tracksuit the official garb of prisoners who do not have their own clothes ive not come across him before but he looks a most unlikely murderer i stroll across to join fletch who i feel confident will know exactly who he is hes got twentyone days for shoplifting fletch tells me and has a mental age of about eleven he pauses they should never have sent him to belmarsh in the first place then why put him on the lifers wing i ask for his own protection says fletch he was attacked in the yard during exercise this afternoon and some other cons continued to bully him when he returned to block two hes only got nine more days left to serve so theyve put him in my cell now i understand why there are two beds in fletchs cell as i suspect this is not an unusual solution for someone in distress one of the phones becomes free a rare occurrence so i take advantage of it and call mary in grantchester shes full of news including the fact that the former head of the prison service sir david ramsbotham has written to the times saying it was inappropriate to send me to prison community service would have been far more worthwhile she tells me she also has a sackful of letters talking about the iniquity of the judges summingup not to mention the sentence and shes beginning to wonder if there might be the possibility of a retrial i think not mr justice potts has retired and the last thing the establishment would want to do is embarrass him after thirtyseven years of marriage i know mary so well that i can hear the strain of the last few weeks in her voice i recall ms roberts words the first time we met it can be just as traumatic for your immediate family on the outside as it is for you on the inside my twopound bt phonecard is about to run out but not before i tell her that shes a veritable portia and i am no brutus the moment i put the phone down i find another lifer colin gbh standing by my side he wants to have a word about his application to do an external degree at ruskin college oxford i have already had several chats with colin and he makes an interesting case study in his youth hes now thirtyfive he was a complete wastrel and tearaway which included a period of being a professional football hooligan in fact he has written a fascinating piece on the subject in which he now admits that he is ashamed of what he got up to colin has been in and out of jail for most of his adult life and even when hes inside he feels it is nothing less than his duty to take the occasional swing at a prison officer this always ends with a spell in segregation and time being added to his sentence on one occasion he even lost a couple of teeth which you cant miss whenever he grins thats history he tells me because he now has a purpose he wants to leave prison with a degree and qualifications that will ensure he gets a real job there is no doubt about his ability colin is articulate and bright and having read his essays and literary criticism i have no doubt that if he wants to sit for a degree its well within his grasp and this is a man who couldnt read or write before he entered prison i have a real go at him assuring him that hes clever enough to take a degree and to get on with it i start pummelling him on the chest as if he was a punch bag he beams over to the duty officer seated behind the desk at the far end of the room mr king this prisoner is bullying me says colin in a plaintive voice the officer smiles what have you been saying to him archer i repeat the conversation word for word quite agree with you archer he says and returns to reading the sun pm supper vegetarian fingers overcooked and greasy peas that are glued together and a plastic mug of highland spring p pm ive just finished checking over my script for the day when my cell door is opened by an officer fletch is standing in the doorway and asks if he can join me for a moment which i welcome he takes a seat on the end of the bed and i offer him a mug of blackcurrant juice fletch reminds me that hes a listener and adds that hes there if i need him the listeners who are they how do i contact them how do i know i can trust them listeners are inmates just as you are who have been trained by the samaritans in both suicide awareness and befriending skills you can talk to a listener about anything in complete confidence just as you would a samaritan everything you say is treated with confidentiality listeners are rarely shocked and you dont have to be suicidal to talk to one if you have any worries or concerns however great or small they are there for you if you have concerns about a friend or cellmate and feel unable to approach a member of the spur staff or healthcare team then please tell a listener in confidence it is not grassing and it may save a life listeners are easy to contact their names are displayed on orange cards on their cell doors and on most notice boards throughout the houseblocks or ask any member of the spur staff listeners are all bound by a code of confidentiality that doesnt only run from houseblock to houseblock but also through a great number of prisons throughout the country any breach of that confidentiality would cause irreparable damage to the benefits achieved and because of this code listeners are now as firmly established as your cell door he then begins to explain the role of listeners and how they came into existence after a fifteenyearold boy hanged himself in a cardiff jail some ten years ago he passes me a single sheet of paper that explains their guidelines among fletchs responsibilities is to spot potential bullies and perhaps more important potential victims as most victims are too frightened to give you a name because they fear revenge at a later date either inside or outside of prison i ask him to share some examples with me he tells me that there are two heroin addicts on the spur and although he wont name them its hard not to notice that a couple of the younger lifers on the ground floor have needle tracks up and down their arms one of them is only nineteen and has tried to take his own life twice first with an overdose and then later when he attempted to cut his wrist with a razor we got there just in time says fletch after that the boy was billeted with me for five weeks fletch feels its also vitally important to have a good working relationship with the prison staff he doesnt call them screws or kangaroos otherwise the system just cant work he admits there will always be an impenetrable barrier which he describes as the iron door but he has done his best to break this down by forming a prison committee of three inmates and three officers who meet once a month to discuss each others problems he says with some considerable pride that there hasnt been a serious incident on his spur for the past eight months he then tells me a story about an occasion when he was released from prison some years ago for a previous offence he decided to call into his bank and cash a cheque he climbed the steps stood outside the bank and waited for someone to open the door for him he looks up from the end of the bed at the closed cell door you see it doesnt have a handle on our side so you always have to wait for someone to open it after so long in prison id simply forgotten how to open a door fletch goes on to tell me that being a listener gives him a reason for getting up each day but like all of us he has his own problems hes thirtyseven and will be my age sixtyone when he is eventually released the truth is that ill never see the outside world again he pauses ill die in prison he pauses again i just havent decided when fletch has unwittingly made me his listener day sunday july am sundays are not a good day in prison because you spend so much time locked up in your cell when you ask why the officers simply say its because were shortstaffed i can at least use six of those hours writing many of the lifers have longterm projects some of which i have already mentioned one is writing a book another taking a degree a third is a dedicated listener in fact although i may have to spend most of today locked up in my cell fletch billy tony paul andy and del boy all have responsible jobs which allow them to roam around the block virtually unrestricted this makes sense because if a prisoner has a long sentence they may feel they have nothing to lose by causing trouble but once youve given them privileges and not being locked up all day is unquestionably a privilege theyre unlikely to want to give up that freedom easily am i shave using a bic razor supplied by hmp they give you a new razor every day and it is a punishable offence to be found with two of them in your cell so every evening just before lockup you trade in your old one for a new one as soon as the cell door is opened i make a dash for the shower but four young west indians get there before me one of them dennis gbh has the largest bag of toiletries i have ever seen its filled with several types of deodorant and aftershave lotions he is a tall wellbuilt goodlooking guy who rarely misses a gym session when i tease him about the contents of his bag dennis simply replies youve got to be locked up for a long time jeff before you can build up such a collection on twelvefifty a week another of them eventually emerges from his shower stall and comments about my not having flipflops on my feet quickest way to get verrucas he warns me make sure mary sends you in a pair as quickly as possible having repeatedly to push the button with the palm of one hand while you soap yourself with the other is a new skill i have nearly mastered however when it comes to washing your hair you suddenly need three hands i wish i were an octopus when im finally dry my three small thin green prison towels are all soaking i should only have one but thanks to del boyi return to my cell and because im so clean im made painfully aware of the prison smell if youve ever travelled on a train for twenty hours and then slept in a station waiting room for the next eight youre halfway there once ive put back on yesterdays clothes i pour myself another bowl of cornflakes i think i can make the packet last for seven helpings before ill need to order another one i hear my name being bellowed out by an officer on the ground floor but decide to finish my cornflakes before reporting to him first signs of rebellion when i do report mr bentley tells me that theres a parcel for me in reception this time no one escorts me on the journey or bothers to search me when i arrive the parcel turns out to be a plastic bag full of clothes sent in by mary two shirts five tshirts seven pairs of pants seven pairs of socks two pairs of gym shorts a tracksuit and two sweaters the precise allocation that prison regulations permit once back in my cell i discard my twodayold pants and socks to put on a fresh set of clothes and now not only feel clean but almost human i spend a considerable time arranging the rest of my clothes in the little cupboard above my bed and as it has no shelves this becomes something of a challenge ftnref this picture of my cell was drawn by derek jones i was not allowed to take a photograph of it once ive completed the exercise i sit on the end of the bed and wait to be called for church am my name is among several others bellowed out by the officer at the front desk on the ground floor followed by the single word church all those wishing to attend the service report to the middle landing and wait by the barred gate near the bubble waiting in prison for your next activity is not unlike hanging around for the next bus it might come along in a few moments or you may have to wait for half an hour usually the latter while im standing there fletch joins me on the secondfloor landing to warn me that theres an article in the news of the world suggesting that im lording it over the other prisoners apparently i roam around in the unrestricted areas in a white shirt watching tv while all the other prisoners are locked up he says that although everyone on the spur knows its a joke the rest of the block three other spurs do not fletch advises me to avoid the exercise yard today as someone might want to make something of it the more attentive readers will recall that my white shirt was taken away from me last week because i could be mistaken for an officer my feeble attempt to watch cricket on tv ended in having to follow the progress of the king george and queen elizabeth stakes and by now all of you know how many hours ive been locked in my cell how the news of the world can get every fact wrong surprises even me the heavy barred gate on the middle floor is eventually opened and i join prisoners from the other three spurs who wish to attend the morning service although everyone is searched they now hardly bother with me the process has become not unlike going through a customs check at heathrow there are two searchers on duty this morning one male and one female officer i notice the queue to be searched by the woman is longer than the one for the man one of the lifers whispers they cant add anything to your sentence for what youre thinking when i enter the chapel i return to my place in the second row this time the congregation is almost per cent black despite the population of the prison being around fiftyfifty the service is conducted by a white officer from the salvation army and his small band of singers are also all white when i next see mr powe i must remember to tell him how many churches not so far away from belmarsh have magnificent black choirs and amazing preachers who encourage you to cry alleluia something else i learnt when i was candidate for mayor this week i notice that the congregation is roughly split in two with a sort of demarcation zone about halfway back the prisoners seated in the first eight rows have only one purpose to follow every line in the bible that the chaplain refers to to sing at the top of their voices and participate fully in the spirit of the service the back nine rows show scant interest in proceedings and i observe that they have formed smaller groups of two three or four their heads bowed deep in conversation i assume theyre friends from different spurs and find the service one of the few opportunities to meet up chat and pass on messages quite possibly even drugs if they are willing to go through a fairly humiliating process ftnref drugs are often packed into a condom and then pushed up the rectum transferring them in the back pew of the chapel cant be a pleasant experience the chaplains text this sunday comes from the gospel of st john and concentrates in particular on the prodigal son last week it was cain and abel i can only assume that next week it will be honour among thieves the chaplain tells his flock that he is only going to speak to them for five minutes and then addresses us for twelve but to be fair he was quite regularly interrupted with cries of alleluia and bless us lord the chaplains theme is that if you leave the bosom of your family try to make it alone and things go wrong it doesnt mean that your father wont welcome you back if you are willing to admit youve made mistakes many of those in the front four rows start jumping up and down and cheering after the service is over and we have all been searched again im escorted back to house block one but not before several inmates from block three come across to say hello remember mark kevin and dave im brought up to date with all of their hopes and expectations as we slowly make our way back to our separate blocks no one moves quickly in prison because its just another excuse to spend more time out of your cell as i pass the desk at the end of my spur i spot a pile of sunday newspapers the news of the world is by far the most popular followed by the sunday mirror but there is also quite a large order for the sunday times when i return to my cell i find my room has been swept and tidied and my bed made up with clean sheets im puzzled because there was nothing in the prison handbook about room service i find out later that taal ghanaian murder lifer wants to thank me for helping him write a letter to his mother returning favours is far more commonplace in prison than it is outside noon lunch grated cheese a tomato a green apple and a mug of highland spring im running out of water and will in future have to order more bottles of highland spring and less chocolate from the canteen after lunch i sit down to write the second draft of this mornings script as i wont be let out again until four and then only for fortyfive minutes i clean my glasses and notice that without thinking ive begun to split my double kleenex tissue so that i can make the maximum use of both sheets pm association during the hour break i dont join the others in the yard for exercise because of the news of the world article which means ill be stuck inside all day i cant remember the last time i remained indoors for twentyfour hours i join fletch murder in his cell along with billy murder and tony marijuana only escaped to paris theyre discussing in great detail an article in the sunday times about paedophiles and i find myself listening intently because on this subject as in many others concerning what goes on in prison i recall lord longfords words dont assume all prisoners have fixed views i feel on safer ground when the discussion turns to the tory party leadership only tony who reads the times can be described as a committed liberalist most of the others if they are anything are new labour ftnref convicted prisoners members of the house of lords and certified lunatics are ineligible to vote i now qualify in two of the three categories they all agree that ken clarke is a decent enough sort of bloke pint at the local and all that and not interested in his appearance but they know very little about iain duncan smith other than he comes from the right wing of the party and therefore has to be their enemy i suggest that its never quite that simple ids has clear views on most issues and they shouldnt just label him in that clichéd way hes a complex and thoughtful man his father i remind them was a second world war hero flying spitfires against the germans and winning the dso and bar they like that i suspect if we were at war now his son would be doing exactly the same thing but he has the same instincts as ann widdecombe says fletch bang em up and throw away the key that may well be the case but dont forget ann is supporting ken clarke despite his views on europe that doesnt add up says billy politics is like prison i suggest you mustnt assume anything as the exact opposite often turns out to be the reality pm back to your cells bellows a voice i leave the lifers and return to my cell on the top floor to be incarcerated until nine tomorrow morning sixteen hours think about it sixteen hours thats the length of time you will spend between rising in the morning and going to bed at night just as i arrive at my door another lifer doug hands me an envelope its from a prisoner on block two he says he evidently told you all about it yesterday when you were in the exercise yard i throw the envelope on the bed and switch on the radio to be reminded that its the hottest day of the year i open my little window to its furthest extent six inches to let in whatever breeze there is but i still feel myself sweating as i sit at my desk checking over the days script i glance up at the cupboard behind my bed grateful for the clean clothes that mary sent in this morning pm supper i cant face the hotplate despite tonys recommendation of spam fritter so i have another portion of grated cheese open a small tin of coleslaw p and disaster finish the last drop of my last bottle of highland spring thank heavens that its canteen tomorrow and im allowed to spend another during the early evening i go over my manuscript and as there are no letters to deal with i turn my attention to the envelope that was handed to doug in the yard it turns out to be a tv script for a thirtyminute pilot set in a womens prison its somehow been smuggled out of holloway and into belmarsh no wonder its easy to get hold of drugs the writer has a good ear for prison language and allows you an interesting insight into life in a womens prison but i fear cell block h and bad girls have already done this theme to death its fascinating to spot the immediate differences in a womens prison to belmarsh not least the searching procedure the fact that lesbianism is far more prevalent in female prisons than homosexuality is in male establishments and if you can believe it the level of violence is higher they dont bother waiting until youre in the shower before they throw the first punch anywhere at any time will do its a long hot evening and i have visits from del boy paul fletch and finally tony tony hotplate marijuana only escaped to paris started life as a bcat prisoner and was transferred after three and a half years to ford open first offence no history of violence after eight blameless months they allowed him out on a town visit so he happily set off for bognor regis but after four visits to that seaside resort during the next four months he became somewhat bored with the cold deserted beach and the limited shopping centre thats when he decided there were other towns hed like to visit on his day off when they let him out the following month he took the boattrain to paris the prison authorities were not amused it was only when he moved on to spain two years later that they finally caught up with him and he was arrested after spending sixteen months in a spanish jail waiting to be deported canteen fifty pounds a week and no bangup until nine they sent him back to the uk tony now resides in this highsecurity double acategory prison from where no one has ever escaped and will remain put until he has completed his full sentence twelve years no time was added to his sentence but there will be no remission half off for good behaviour and he certainly wont be considered for an open prison again this fiftyfouryearold somehow keeps smiling and even manages to tell his story with selfdeprecating humour tony leaves me with a copy of the sunday mirror although its not a paper im in the habit of reading i am at least able to bring myself up to date on the county cricket scores not to mention who among the fighting fit will find a place in the england team for the third test against australia on thursday my beloved somerset are in second place in the county championship and doing well in their current fixture against glamorgan on the england front the mirrors cricket correspondent is suggesting its time to bring back tufnell i did an auction for phil during his testimonial year and although hes not always popular with the selectors the packed banqueting hall at the dorchester proved the regard in which he is held by the middlesex supporters it seems that thorpe hussain vaughan and croft are all injured and will not make the starting line while a reluctant atherton will be called on once again to skipper the side it doesnt seem to improve his batting meanwhile australia fields the same team that so roundly defeated us at lords i always thought it was the visiting side that was meant to have injury problems i finally finish the moons a balloon which left me with the distinct feeling that mr niven must have lived a charmed life i only met him once and that was at a literary luncheon in yorkshire where he was on the circuit with bring on the empty horses the sequel to the book ive just finished reading it was an occasion i shall never forget because the other author was james herriot of it shouldnt happen to a vet fame i was there to launch my first effort not a penny more not a penny less and was naturally delighted to be among such illustrious company after the speeches had concluded the authors were each escorted to a table so that they could sign copies of their books mr nivens queue stretched across the diningroom floor and out of the front door while mr herriots fans were almost as legion in my case i didnt have a single customer when the signing was over mr niven graciously came across to my table purchased a copy of penny and told me he would read it on the flight back to los angeles the following day he turned out to be one of the three people who paid for the book a generous gesture which many people have since told me was typical but imagine my surprise when a few days later i received a handwritten letter from the bel air hotel dear jeffrey much enjoyed penny have no doubt it will sell even more copies than horses by the time youre my age yours ever david pm bang on ten the rap music begins blasting out gunshot to the head pussyboy gets dead gunshot to the head pussyboy gets dead gunshot to the head pussyboy gets dead gunshot to the head pussyboy gets dead gunshot to the head pussyboy gets dead gunshot to the head pussyboy gets dead have you ever stopped at a traffic light to find yourself next to an open car with its radio full on do you then allow the offending driver to accelerate away imagine being in a cell with the music blasting out on both sides of you but you cant accelerate away day monday july am overslept but then woken by the alsatians off on their morning rounds they are every bit as reliable as an alarm clock but not as cheerful or optimistic as a cockerel i put on a tracksuit sit down at my desk and write for two hours am a bowl of cornflakes with uht milk plus the added luxury of a banana which del boy has smuggled out of the canteen i sit on the end of the bed and wait to see what fate has in store for me am im told i must report to the workshops despite putting my name down for education another long trek to a different part of the building this time were escorted into a large square room about the same size as the chapel but with whitewashed unadorned brick walls the first person i recognize is fletch who is seated next to a prison officer behind a trestle table at the top of the room hes obviously the works manager the work room has five rows of tables each about thirty feet in length with prisoners seated on both sides making up a chain gang my group consists of four inmates whose purpose is to fill a small plastic bag with all the ingredients necessary to make a cup of tea in the centre of the table placed between us are large plastic buckets heaped with small packets at the bottom end of the table sits a silent serb who places four sachets of sugar in each bag and then pushes his contribution across the table to a lebanese man who adds three sachets of milk he then passes the bag on to an inmate from essex who drops in three teabags before its passed over to me my job is to seal up the bag and drop it in the large open bucket at my end of the table every fifteen minutes or so another prisoner whose name i never discover comes and empties the bucket this mindnumbing exercise continues for approximately two hours for which i will be credited with two pounds in my canteen account the serb sugar who sits at the other end of the table is i would guess around thirty hes unwilling to discuss anything except the fate of expresident milošević and the fact that he isnt cooperating with the european court in the hague he will not talk about his crime or the length of his sentence ali the lebanese man powdered milk who sits opposite me is more forthcoming hes been found guilty of breach of trust ali tells me that he worked for a wellknown creditcard company and after several years was promoted to manager of a london branch during that time he became infatuated with an american lady who could best be described as highmaintenance and used to the sort of lifestyle he couldnt afford ali began to borrow his words money from the company safe each night he would then take her to a casino where they would have a free meal before he began working the tables if he won he would put the money back in the safe the next morning if he lost he would borrow even more the following evening one night he won and returned every penny the following day by the time his girlfriend had dumped him and flown back to the states ali had borrowed he decided to come clean and report the whole incident to his boss assuring the company that it was his intention to repay every penny ali then sold his house cashed in his lifeinsurance policy pawned a few valuables and reimbursed the company in full he was later arrested charged with breach of trust and last friday sent down for eighteen months he will probably end up serving seven months and is due to be transferred to ford dcat next week he is fiftythree an intelligent and articulate man who accepts that he will never be able to work in this country again he plans to go to america or return to the lebanon where he hopes to begin a new life my former secretary angie peppiatt the crowns main witness in my case admitted to the same offence breach of trust while giving evidence at my trial in her case she wasnt able to explain how thousands of pounds went missing other than to smile at the judge and say i have done things i am ashamed of but it was the culture of the time i have recently asked my solicitor to place the full details in the hands of the police and see if she is subject to the same rigorous inquiry as i was you may well know the answer by the time this book is published the essex man teabags sitting next to ali boasts to anyone who cares to listen that he is a professional gangster who specializes in robbing banks the gang consists of his brotherinlaw a friend and himself he tells me they make a very profitable living but expect to spend at least half of their working lives in jail he and ali could not be more different the prisoner who turns up every fifteen minutes to empty the large bucket at the end of the table doesnt hang around so i cant discover much about him other than hes twentythree this is his first offence his case hasnt come before the court yet and hes hoping to get off if he doesnt he tells me hell use the time to study for an open university history degree i dont think he realizes that hes just admitted that hes guilty a hooter blasts to indicate that the one hundred and twenty minutes are finally up we are all escorted back to our separate spurs and banged up again until lunch noon lunch whats on offer is so bad that i have to settle for a small tin of heinz potato salad p and three mcvities biscuits p as i return from the hotplate i see andy leaning up against the fence that divides the spur from the canteen area he pushes a bottle of highland spring through a triangle of wire mesh the high point of my day pm the chaplain david powe makes an unscheduled visit to my cell hes wearing his dog collar the same beige coat the same dark grey trousers and the same shoes as he has at the previous meetings i can only conclude that he must be paid even less than the prison officers hes kept his promise and got hold of some drawing paper for derek jones who cant afford more than one pad a week the chaplain goes on to tell me that he and his family will be off on holiday for the next three weeks and just in case he doesnt see me again he would like to wish me luck with my appeal and hopes ill be sent in the near future to somewhere a little less foreboding than belmarsh before he leaves i read to him my description of the service he conducted last week he chuckles at the cain and abel reference a man able to laugh at himself he leaves me a few moments later to go in search of derek and hand over the drawing pads it was some hours later that i felt racked with guilt by the thought he must have paid for the paper out of his own pocket pm my door is unlocked by ms taylor who enters the cell carrying what looks like a tuning fork she goes over to my window and taps the four bars one by one just want to make sure you havent loosened them or tried to replace them she explains wouldnt want you to escape would we im puzzled by ms taylors words because its a sheer drop of some seventy feet from the third floor down to the exercise yard and then you would still have to climb over a thirtyfivefoot wall topped with razor wire to escape houdini would have been stretched to consider such a feat i later learn that theres another thirtyfivefoot wall beyond that not to mention a few dozen alsatians who dont respond to the command sit rover i can only conclude its in the prison manual under the heading tasks to be carried out once a day once a week once a year once in a lifetime ftnref i checked later it is in the prison regulations under locks bolts and bars pm ive put my name down for the gym again as im now desperate to get some exercise when an officer hollers out gym im first in the queue that congregates on the middle floor when the gate is opened im informed by the duty gym instructor that only eight prisoners can participate from any one spur and my name was the twelfth to be registered the low point of my day i return to the ground floor and watch the first half of a humphrey bogart blackandwhite movie where bogey is a sea dog who plays a major part in winning the war in the north atlantic however we are all sent back to our cells at five so i never discover if it was the germans or the americans who won the last war pm i have an unscheduled visit from two senior officers mr scanell and mr green to be fair most meetings in prison are unscheduled after all no one calls in advance to fix an appointment with your diary secretary they are concerned that i am no longer going out into the yard during the afternoon to take advantage of fortyfive minutes of fresh air and exercise theyve heard a rumour that on my last outing i was threatened by another prisoner and for that reason ive remained in my cell they ask me if this is true and if so am i able to supply them with any details of those who threatened me i tell them exactly what took place in the yard but add that i am unwilling to name or describe the young tearaway involved they leave twenty minutes later with several pages of their report sheet left blank i ask tony what would have happened if id told them the name of the two culprits they would have been transferred to another prison later today tony replied wouldnt it be easier for them to transfer me i suggest good heavens no said tony that would demand a degree of lateral thinking not to mention common sense pm supper vegetable stew and a lollipop the lollipop was superb pm fletch visits my cell and tries to convince me that its my duty to name the cons who threatened me in the yard because if i dont it wont be long before theyre doing exactly the same thing to someone less able to take care of themselves he makes a fair point but i suggest what the headlines would be the following day if i had given the officers the names archer beaten up in yard archer demands extra protection understaffed prison service doing overtime to protect archer archer reports prisoner to screw no thank you i tell fletch id rather sit in my cell and write he sighs and before leaving hands me his copy of the daily telegraph its a luxury to have a seventytwopage paper even if it is yesterdays i devour every page the lead story is a poll conducted for the telegraph by yougovcom showing that although iain duncan smith is running behind ken clarke in the national polls he is comfortably ahead with the party membership it seems to be a nowin situation for the conservatives the only person who must be laughing all the way to the voting booth is tony blair pm i have a visit from paul a teaboy which is why hes allowed to roam around while the rest of us are banged up he says he has something to tell me so i pick up my pad sit on the end of the bed and listen paul is about six foot one a couple of hundred pounds and looks as if he could take care of himself in a scrap he begins by telling me that hes just been released from a drugrehabilitation course at the princess diana centre in norfolk its taken them eight months to wean him off his heroin addiction i immediately enquire if he now considers himself cured paul just sits there in silence and avoids answering my question its obviously not what he came to talk to me about he then explains that during his rehab he was made to write a long selfassessment piece and asks if i will read it but he insists that no one else on the spur must find out its contents i wouldnt bother you with it he adds if it were not for the fact that several prisoners on this spur have had similar experiences and theyre not necessarily the ones you might expect he leaves without another word if you were to come across paul at your local you would assume he was a middleclass successful businessman hes in jail for creditcard fraud hes intelligent articulate and charming in fact he doesnt look any different to the rest of us but then why should he he just doesnt want anyone to know about his past and im not talking about his criminal past as soon as my cell door is closed i begin to read the selfassessment piece that is written in his own hand he had a happy upbringing until the age of six when his parents divorced two years later his mother remarried after that he and his brothers were regularly thrashed by their stepfather the only person he put any trust in was an uncle who befriended him and turned out to be a paedophile his next revelation i would not consider for a plot in a novel because it turns out that his uncle is now locked up on house block two convicted of indecent assault on an underaged youth the two men can see each other through the wire mesh across the yard during the afternoon exercise period paul doesnt know what he would do if he were ever to come face to face with his uncle at no time in his exposition does he offer this as an excuse for his crime but he points out that child abuse is a common symptom among those serving longterm sentences i find this quite difficult to come to terms with having had such a relaxed and carefree upbringing myself but i decide to ask fletch if paul is a telling the truth b correct in his overall assessment when i did eventually ask fletch i was shocked by his reply ftnref i this sentence was added two weeks after i had written the original script pm after ive read through pauls piece a second time i turn to the latest bunch of letters just over a hundred which keep my spirits up until i switch on the nine oclock news on radio to discover that there are still no plans to move me from this hellhole pm i start to read john grishams the partner and manage seven chapters before turning the light off just after midnight i cant believe it no rap music day tuesday july am woke up before the alsatians this morning ive finally worked out why they make so much noise its because they are being fed on the same food as the prisoners write for two hours am i finish the box of cornflakes and the last drop of uht milk hopeful that my canteen order will materialize at some time later today i get dressed i can move another notch up on my belt i must have lost several pounds but have no other way of confirming this am when my cell door is opened i dont join the other prisoners to go to the workshop as i have an appointment with the education assessor judy fitt known amongst the prisoners as misfit a joke she must be heartily sick of when ms fitt arrives the officer on the front desk calls for me or to be more accurate bellows out my name as im on the top landing and they never move from the ground floor unless they have to i go down to meet her judy is a short could lose a few pounds blonde of about forty with a happy optimistic smile i pick up two chairs from the pile by the tv and place them under the window at the end of the room i think shes surprised that i insist on carrying her chair once seated she takes me through all the education curriculum has to offer from teaching reading and writing skills through to taking a degree her enthusiasm leaves me in no doubt that judy is another public servant dedicated to her job she also suggests that in my case i could learn to cook draw or even after all these years of avoiding it discover how to use a computer that would impress mary i remind judy that im only expecting to be at belmarsh for a few more days and would like to use my time to teach other prisoners to read and write judy considers this suggestion but would prefer i gave a creativewriting course as there are several inmates working on books poems and essays who will have dozens of unanswered questions i agree to her request and aware of my escape plan judy suggests i ought to give my first lesson tomorrow morning she pauses looking a little embarrassed but first i have to enrol you in the education department she passes me over yet more forms can you complete these tests and let me have them back later today so that i can process them in a matter of hours ill try to have them completed by the end of the morning she laughs it wont take you that long i return to my cell and as i have nothing to do for the thirty minutes before lunch begin to fill in the little boxes headed education test ive selected some random examples english spell these words correctly wos befor wer gril migt siad affer maths a b how much change do you get from if you spend what is pm on a twentyfour hour clock how much time is there between and what is of if biscuit costs p are are and are which is the better buy i complete the six pages of questions and return them to ms fitt via billy little murder who has an education class this afternoon noon lunch provisions have not yet arrived from the canteen half a portion of macaroni cheese and a mug of highland spring have you noticed im beginning to eat prison food pm my cell door is opened and im told ms roberts wants to see me i am accompanied to the governors office by mr weedon i dont bother to ask him why because he wont know and even if he does he wouldnt tell me only moments later i discover that ms roberts has nothing but bad news to impart and none of it caused by the staff at belmarsh my category d status has been raised to c because the police say they have been left with no choice but to follow up baroness nicholsons allegations and open a full inquiry into what happened to the money raised for the kurds as if that wasnt enough the ccat prison ive been allocated to is on the isle of wight how much further away do they want me to be from my family the raising of my status ms roberts explains is based on the fear that while a further inquiry is going on i might try to escape scotland yard obviously has a sense of humour how far do they imagine i could get before someone spotted me ms roberts informs me that i can appeal against both decisions and if i do the authorities have agreed to make an assessment by thursday she points out that the isle of wight is a long way from my residence in cambridge and its the responsibility of the home office to house a prisoner as close to his home as possible if thats the case im only surprised theyre not sending me to the shetland isles she promises to have a word with my solicitor and explain my rights to them if it were not for ms roberts and ramona mehta i would probably be locked up in perpetual solitary confinement i cannot express forcibly enough my anger at emma nicholson especially after my years of work for the kurds one call to sir nicholas young at the red cross and all her questions as to the role i played in the simple truth campaign could have been answered she preferred to contact the press ms roberts points out that as my lawyers are due to visit me at two oclock perhaps i should be making a move i thank her baroness nicholson could learn a great deal from this twentysixyearold woman pm i join alex cameron and ramona mehta in the visitors area this time weve been allocated a room not much bigger than my cell but there is a difference on three sides it has large windows when youre behind bars day and night you notice windows before they go on to my appeal against conviction and sentence i raise three other subjects on which i require legal advice first whether the baroness has stepped over the mark the lawyers fear she may have worded everything so carefully as to guarantee maximum publicity for herself without actually accusing me of anything in particular i point out that i am only too happy to cooperate with any police inquiry and the sooner the better the simple truth campaign was organized by the red cross and the treasurer at the time will confirm that i had no involvement whatsoever with the collecting or distributing of any monies ramona points out that several red cross officials past and present have already come out publicly confirming this i then tell my lawyers the story of ali stolen and returned but now doing an eighteenmonth sentence for breach of trust i ask that the police be reminded that mrs peppiatt admitted in the witness box to doublebilling stealing a car taking her children on a free holiday to corfu buying presents for mistresses that didnt exist and claiming expenses for meals with phantom individuals can i hope that the cps will treat her to the same rigorous inspection as ali and i have been put through third i remind them that ted francis the man who sold his story to the news of the world for fourteen thousand pounds still owes me twelve thousand id like it back the lawyers promise to follow up all these matters however they consider the reinstatement of my dcat and making sure i dont have to go to the isle of wight their first priorities i ask ramona to take the next five days of what ive written and hand the script over to alison for typing up ramona leaves our little room to ask the duty officer if he will allow this he turns down her request alex suggests i hold onto the script until ive been transferred to a less securityconscious prison he also advises me that it would be unwise to think of publishing anything until after my appeal has been considered i warn them that if i lose my appeal and continue to keep up my present output for the entire sentence ill end up writing a million words on the hour an officer appears to warn us that our time is up ramona leaves promising to deal with the problems of my dcat and the isle of wight immediately while im waiting to be escorted back to block one i get into conversation with a greek cypriot called nazraf who is on remand awaiting trial hes been charged with detaining his wife in a motorcar i had no idea there was such a charge i repeat his story here with the usual government health warning nazraf tells me that he locked his wife in the car for her own safety because he was at the time transferring a large sum of cash from his place of work to a local bank hes in the restaurant business and for several years has been very successful making an annual profit of around he adds with some considerable passion that he still loves his wife and would prefer a reconciliation but she has already filed for divorce nazraf comes across as a bright intelligent man so i have to ask him why he isnt out on bail he explains that the court demanded a sum of to be put up by at least four different people and he didnt want his friends or business associates to know that he was in any trouble he had always assumed that the moment he was sent to jail his wife would come to her senses and drop the charges that was five weeks ago and she hasnt budged the trial takes place in midseptember this is all i could find out before we were released from the waiting room to continue on our separate paths i to block one nazraf to block four his final destination also puzzles me because block four usually houses terrorists or extremely highsecurity risks id like to meet nazraf again but i have a feeling i never will pm supper provisions have arrived from the canteen and been left in a plastic bag on the end of my bed i settle down to a plate of tinned spam a bar of cadburys fruit and nut two mcvities digestive biscuits and finally a mug of blackcurrant juice topped up with evian water what more could a man ask for pm association i am asked to join a group of more mature prisoners at sixtyone i am by far the oldest if not the most mature for their weekly committee meeting in fletchs cell other attendees include tony marijuana only billy murder colin gbh and paul murder like any wellrun board meeting we have a chairman fletch and an agenda first we discuss the hours we are permitted to be out of our cells and how mr marsland has made conditions more bearable since he became the senior officer fletch considers that relations between the two parties who live on different sides of the iron barrier are far more tenable even amicable than at any time in the past colin is still complaining about a particular warder who i havent yet come across according to colin he treats the prisoners like scum and will put you on report if you as much as blink in front of him hes evidently proud of the fact that hes put more people on report than any other officer and that tells you all you need to know about him colin suggests i decide to observe this man from a distance and see if colins complaint is justified most of the officers make an effort to keep a lid on things preferring a calm atmosphere only too aware that lifers moods swing from despair to hope and back to despair again in moments this can in the hands of an unthinking officer lead to violence colin i fear is quick to wrath and doesnt need to take another step backwards just as things are going a little better for him the next subject the committee discuss is prison finance tony reports that the governor hazel banks has been given a bonus of for bringing belmarsh prison costs down by four hundred thousand hardly something a free enterprise merchant like myself could grumble about however paul feels the money would have been better spent on inmates education and putting electricity into the cells i have no idea if these figures are accurate but tony confirms that he checked them in sir david ramsbothams head of the prison service annual review when the meeting breaks up derek del boy bicknell murder interesting that he has not been invited to join the committee meeting asks if he could have a private word with me ive got something for you to read he says i walk across the ground floor from cell to cell after hes offered me a selection of paperbacks i discover the real reason he wishes to see me he wants to discuss his appeal and produces a letter from his solicitor the main grounds for his appeal appear to be that his former solicitor advised him not to go into the witness box when he wanted to he subsequently sacked the solicitor and his qc he has since appointed a new legal team to advise him but hes not yet chosen a qc imagine my surprise when i discover one of his grounds for appeal is that he is unable to read or write and therefore never properly understood what his rights were i look up at a shelf full of books above his bed you cant read no but dont tell anyone you see ive never really needed to as a car salesman this is a prisoner who carries a great deal of responsibility on the spur hes a listener and number one on the hotplate i earlier described him as a man who could run a private company and i have not changed my mind del boy brings to mind somerset maughams moving short story the bell ringer however its still going to be a disadvantage for him not to be able to study his legal papers i begin to wonder how many other prisoners fall into the same category and worse just wont admit it i go over the grounds of appeal with del boy line by line he listens intently but cant make any notes pm lockup is called so i return to my cell to face delighted to face another pile of letters left on my bed by ray the censor i realize the stack will be even greater tomorrow when the papers inform their readers that i will not be going to an open prison after emma nicholson has dropped her i was only doing my duty barb into an already boiling cauldron ive now fallen into a routine much as i had in the outside world the big difference is that i have little or no control over when i can and cannot write so i fit my hours round the prison timetable immediately after evening lockup is designated for reading letters break followed by going over my manuscript break reading the book of the week break undress go to bed break try to ignore the inevitable rap music impossible every time i finish the days script i wonder if there will be anything new to say tomorrow however im still on such a steep learning curve ive nowhere near reached that dizzy height but i confess i now want to leave belmarsh for pastures new and pastures is the key word i long to walk in green fields and taste fresh air billy lifer writer scholar tells me it will be better once ive settled somewhere and dont have to spend my energy wondering when and where i will be for the rest of my sentence hes been at belmarsh for two years and seven months and still doesnt know where hes destined for tony marijuana only escaped from open prison warns me that wherever i go ill be quickly bored if i dont have a project to work on thankfully writing these diaries has solved that problem but for how long day wednesday august am a long hot sleepless night the rap music went on until about four in the morning so i was only able to doze off for the odd few minutes when it finally ceased a row broke out between someone called mitchell who i think was in the cell above the music and another prisoner called vaz who owned the stereo below it didnt take long to learn what mitchell planned to do to vaz just as soon as his cell door was opened their language bore a faint resemblance to the dialogue in a martin amis novel but without any of his style or panache am breakfast among my canteen selections is a packet of cereal called variety eight different cereals in little boxes i start off with something called coco pops not bad but its still almost impossible to beat good old kelloggs cornflakes am the morning papers are delivered to the duty officer theyre full of stories confirming that my status has been changed from dcat to ccat because of emma nicholsons accusations am ms labersham arrives and actually knocks politely on my cell door as if i were capable of opening it she unlocks the iron barrier and tells me that she has come to escort me to my creativewriting class im taken to a smokefilled waiting room with no chairs just a table well thats one way of guaranteeing a standing ovation moments later a trickle of prisoners appear each carrying his own plastic chair once the nine of them are settled ms labersham reminds everyone that its a twohour session she suggests that i should speak for about an hour and then open it up for a general discussion ive never spoken for an hour in my life its usually thirty minutes forty at the most before i take questions on this occasion i speak for just over forty minutes explaining how i took up writing at the age of thirtyfour after leaving parliament with debts of and facing bankruptcy the last time i gave this speech was at a conference in las vegas as the principal guest of a us hotel group they flew me over first class gave me a suite of rooms and sent me home with a cheque for today im addressing nine belmarsh inmates and ms labersham has confirmed that my prison account will be credited with a bottle of highland spring and a tube of toothpaste when ive finished my talk i am surprised how lively the discussion is that follows one of the prisoners michael aged twentyone murder wants to talk about becoming a song writer a subject about which i know very little i dont feel i can tell him that a lyricist is as different to a novelist as a brain surgeon is from a gynaecologist michael wants me to read out his latest effort its already forty verses in length i offer you one no room but to leave you call out calling for me to come back but all you can hear is the sound of your own voice calling out my name michael heard yesterday that the judge had given him a tariff of eighteen years at least its not telephone numbers he says telephone numbers nine hundred and ninetynine years he replies when i finish reading michaels work the group discuss it before terry burglary former cellmate reads three pages of his novel which he hopes to have finished by the time they release him in december the group spend some time debating the use of bad language in a novel does it tell you anything about the character the author is writing about does it distract from the narrative they go on to discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of terrys story they dont pull any punches tony marijuana only then tells the group that he is writing a textbook on quantum mechanics which has been a hobby of his for many years he explains that his efforts will add nothing to the genre his word but as a project it keeps him occupied for many hours the final rendering is one of billy littles poems its in a different

discuss when well get together again the matter that most concerns the group is whether it should be during association time or considered as an education class on this they are equally divided and i wonder if they will ever meet again noon lunch i open a tin of ham p extract half of it to which i add two hardboiled potatoes prison issue during the afternoon i devour three digestive biscuits and swig nearly a whole bottle of evian if i continue at this rate ill be out of water by saturday and like so many prisoners facing the problem of doublebubble do you recall del boy cutting a cigarette in half and expecting a whole one back the following day pm my appeals against change of status and being sent to the isle of wight are brought round to my cell for signing ms taylor says that the deputy governor wants the forms returned to her office as soon as possible i read slowly through the twopage legal document making only one small emendation i sign on the dotted line but remain convinced that the home office has already made up its mind and there is nothing i can do about it the golden rule seems to be it mustnt look as if archers getting special treatment even if hes being treated unjustly pm my cell door is opened by mr bentley who tells me that i must report to reception as there are several parcels for me to collect when i leave the spur i am not searched for the first time and the duty officer simply points to the end of the corridor and says my colleague will guide you its taken them two weeks to feel confident that i have no interest in escaping or dealing in drugs actually if you tried to escape from belmarsh and the roof is the furthest anyone has managed youd need an architects plan the whole building is a maze even if you work here i imagine it would take several weeks before you could confidently find your way around sometimes i wonder how the prison officers find their way out at night at the end of every corridor a barred gate is opened and i am ushered through it none of the gatekeepers seem to be surprised that im unaccompanied i finally arrive outside the little cubbyhole called reception the doors are pulled open to reveal mr pearson and mr leech good afternoon sir mr pearson says and then quickly corrects himself archer im afraid we only have fourteen registered parcels for you this week he begins to remove them one by one from the shelves behind him half an hour later i am the proud owner of four more bibles three copies of the new testament and a prayer book i retain one copy of the new testament which is leatherbound as i feel terry would appreciate it i suggest to mr leech that the rest should be sent to mr powe at the chapel the other packages consist of three novels two scripts and a proposal of marriage from a blonde woman of about fifty who adds that if i dont fancy her she has a daughter of twentyfour photo enclosed ive considered printing her dear geoffrey sic letter and photograph but my solicitors have advised against it when theyve opened the final package on the shelf i point to a box of tissues and ask are those also mine by any chance mr pearson looks at mr leech and says i think they are he passes across two boxes of tissues making the whole expedition worthwhile mr pearson accompanies me i say accompanies because i didnt get the feeling of being escorted back to my cell en route he tells me that the prison was built ten years ago by a canadian architect and its all rightangles it might have been more sensible he mutters to have consulted serving prison officers and then we could have pointed out the problems staff and inmates come up against every day before i can offer an opinion i find myself locked back in my cell pm ive only been in my cell for a few minutes when mr weedon reappears bearing a slip of paper its a movement schedule confirming my worst fears i will be transferred to the isle of wight sometime during the week of august it is as i thought the home office have made up their minds and are unwilling to take any personal needs into consideration i sink onto my bed depressed i am helpless and theres nothing i can do about it pm im writing the second draft of todays script when the alarm bell goes off i can hear running feet raised voices and the scurrying of prison officers i look out of my barred window but can see nothing but an empty yard i gaze through the fourbynineinch slit in my door and quickly realize that the commotion is not on our spur ill have to wait for association before i can find out what happened pm association once again i fail to get on the gym rota and suspect its the same eight inmates who are preselected every day and i havent been a member of the club long enough to qualify lets hope they have a bigger gym on the isle of wight when i reach the ground floor i see that fletch is placed strategically in one corner as he is at the beginning of every association in case anyone needs to seek his help or advice i slip across and have a word what was all the noise about i ask a fight broke out on block two any details yes some con called vaz has been playing rap music all night and the man in the cell above him hasnt slept for three days he has my sympathy i tell fletch they didnt come face to face until this afternoon continues fletch when mitchell who was in the cell above not only laid out vaz with one punch but set fire to his cell and ended up jumping on top of his stereo fletch paused it was one of those rare occasions when the prison staff took their time to reach the scene of the crime after all theyd received several complaints during the week from other prisoners concerning the vaz attitude problem what happened to the other guy mitchell said fletch officially banged up in segregation but theyll be moving him to another wing tomorrow after all as i explained to mr marsland he was doing no more than representing the views of the majority of inmates another insight into how prison politics work with fletch acting as the residents spokesman billy little murder asks me if i can join him in his cell to discuss a paper hes writing on globalization he wants to discuss the bbc its role and responsibility as a public broadcaster he produces a graph to show how its viewing figures dropped by per cent between and and another per cent between and i tell billy that i suspect greg dyke the new director general having spent his working life in commercial television will want to reverse that trend the beneficiaries billy goes on to tell me giving detailed statistics are sky digital and the other digital tv stations their graphs have a steady upward trend i ask billy when he will have completed his degree course he removes a sheet of paper from a file below the window september he replies and then what i ask i may take your advice and write a novel ive no idea if i can do it but the judge certainly gave me enough time to find out i cant always pick up every word this glaswegian utters but im deciphering a few more syllables each day ive decided to ask alison to send him a copy of vikram seths a suitable boy i consider its exactly the type of work billy would appreciate especially as it was mr seths first novel so hell discover what hes up against when i leave him the pool table is occupied the queue for the two telephones is perpetual and the afternoon film is carry on camping i return to my cell door unlocked and continue writing pm supper i risk a vegetable fritter and two prison potatoes three mistakes i continue to drink my bottled water as if i have an endless supply the temperature today is doublebubble is fast looming and ill need to see del boy fairly soon if i am to survive as i move down the hotplate andy murder slips two chocolate icecreams onto my tray put one in your pocket he whispers now i discover what the word treat really means del boy is standing at the other end of the counter in his role as number one hotplate man an official title as i pass the custard pie i ask if we could meet up later he nods he can smell when someones in trouble as a listener derek is allowed to visit any cell if another inmate needs to discuss a personal problem and i have a personal problem im running out of water pm i settle down to go over my script for the day before turning to the post the pattern continues unabated but to my surprise few mention the kurds paul creditcard fraud told me when i was queuing up at the canteen that the times had made it clear that i had no involvement with the collecting or distributing of any monies that had been the responsibility of the red cross however there was one letter in the pile that didnt fall into any of the usual slots i have now been locked up in a category a highsecurity prison for two weeks which i share with thirtytwo murderers and seventeen other lifers mainly convicted of attempted murder or manslaughter ive lost my mother who i adored ive been incarcerated on the word of a man who colluded with the news of the world to set me up and by a woman who is a selfconfessed thief and im about to be sent to the isle of wight a ccat prison because of the word of baroness nicholson so i confess i had to chuckle a rare event recently when i received the following missive chans optometrist mr j archer belmarsh house belmarsh south east london mr kenneth chan bsc mcoptom high street leeonsolent hampshire po da dear mr archer i am sorry to trouble you the reason i write to you is because one of my patients like your spectacles the rimless pair you wore when you went to the funeral i would be most grateful if you can let me know the brand the model number the colour and the size of the frame all these information should be printed on the sides of the frame your reply will be appreciated thank you for your attention high street leeonsolent hampshire po da telephone pm my cell door is unlocked by an officer and del boy is allowed to join me his smile is as wide as ever as he strolls in looking like a rent collector visiting someone who doesnt always pay on time he takes a seat on the end of the bed for some time we discuss his upcoming appeal and the fact that he cannot read or write it transpires that he can make out the odd word if he concentrates but can only sign his name ive never needed much more he explains im a barrow boy not a banker he makes a fair point because were you to close your eyes and listen to him speak although hes quite unable to hide his cockney upbringing you certainly wouldnt know he was black he promises to take reading lessons just as soon as i depart for the isle of wight im not convinced hell ever find out which floor the education department is on until the curriculum includes doublebubble now how can i help he asks because im the man well if youre the man derek im running out of water among other things no problem he replies and what are the other things id like three bottles of highland spring two packets of mcvities chocolate biscuits and a tube of toothpaste no problem he repeats theyll be delivered to your cell in the morning squire and no doublebubble no doublebubble he hesitates as long as you agree never to say anything because if anyone found out it wouldnt do my reputation any good no problem i hear myself saying on the outside in that world i have vacated a handful of people can make things happen the secret is to know that handful of people its no different on the inside derek del boy bicknell is a natural chief whip fletch the leader of the opposition billy secretary of state for education tony chancellor of the exchequer paul home secretary and colin secretary of state for defence wherever you are in whatever circumstances leadership will always emerge block one spur one houses thirtytwo murderers seventeen lifers and without realizing it has formed an inmates cabinet nothing on paper nothing official but it works after derek departs i settle down on my bed to finish john grishams the partner its too long but what a storyteller pm i put my head on the pillow i can scarcely believe it no more rap music well done mitchell day thursday august am a full nights sleep for the first time i can hear the cars on the road in the distance i write for two hours interrupted only by the occasional bark of an alsatian am breakfast frosties and longlife milk second day am association i remind derek of my acute watershortage problem now down to half a bottle its all under control he claims i line up with the other prisoners for the gym derek jones gbh artist spots me on the middle corridor and tells me that he did a spell at camphill on the isle of wight i quiz him and discover that it has a fully equipped gym one of the best in the country by that he means in prisons but he adds alarmingly that its full of shitheads and scum young tearaways who think of themselves as gangsters because theyve robbed some old lady no one on the spur understands why youre being sent there i panic desert the queue for the gym run upstairs grab my phonecard rush back down and call alison first i warn her no time for pleasantries when you only have twenty units on your weekly card that the next five days of the script are on their way and to let ramona know when they have arrived so she can confirm this on her next legal visit i then ask to be put through to james my younger son has assumed the role of joint head of the household in charge of finance while williams responsibility is to take care of his mother i dont lose a moments sleep wondering if theyre up to it i quickly tell jamie about the isle of wight and the loss of my dcat status calm down dad he says weve been working on little else for the past fortyeight hours i know how you must feel being so out of touch but were on the case ramona spoke to the home office last night and theyre hinting that its unlikely that there will even be an inquiry into the kurdish matter no one is taking nicholsons accusations seriously even the tabloids have ignored her yes but these things still take time meanwhile ive been issued with a movement order the same source james continues is hinting that youre more likely to end up in the home counties but theyre still working on it i check my phonecard ive already used six units anything else i ask i want to save as many units as possible for mary on sunday yes i need your authority to transfer some dollars into your sterling account the pound has been off for the past couple of days thats fine by me i tell him by the way he says lots of people are talking about the judges summingup so chin up bye dad i put the phone down to find i have used seven of my twenty units i leave james to worry about the currency market while i concentrate on trying to get my hands on a bottle of highland spring i check my watch no point in returning to the gym queue so i settle for a shower you forget how dirty you are until you discover how clean you can be am the officer on the front desk bellows out exercise which once again i avoid its out there in the yard with no shade i elect to sit in my cell writing with the tiny window as wide open as i can force it when ive completed ten pages of script i switch on the test match the game is only an hour old and england are for noon lunch i pick up my tray and walk down to the hotplate but cant find a single item i would offer an emaciated dog i leave with a piece of buttered bread and an apple back in my cell i tuck into the other half of my tin of princes ham two more mcvities digestive biscuits and a mug of water i try to convince myself that del boy is the man and he will deliver in the nick of time because theres only two inches left in the bottle have you ever had to measure how much water is left in a bottle pm an officer appears outside my cell door and orders me to report to the workshop which im not enthusiastic about after all my application for education must surely have been processed by now when i arrive at the bubble on the centre floor to join the other prisoners im searched before having my name ticked off we are then escorted down a long corridor to our different destinations workshop and education when we reach the end of the corridor prisoners destined for the workshop turn left those with higher things on their mind right i turn right when i arrive at education i walk past a set of classrooms with about six or seven prisoners in each a couple of prison officers are lounging around in one corner while a lady sitting behind a desk on the landing crosses off the names of inmates before allocating them to different classrooms i come to a halt in front of her archer i tell her she checks down the list but cant find my name she looks puzzled picks up a phone and quickly discovers that i ought to be in the workshop but ms fitt told me i would be processed for education immediately strange word immediately she says i dont think anyone at belmarsh has looked up its meaning in the dictionary and until they do im afraid youll have to report to the workshops i cant imagine what the words until they do mean i retrace my steps walking as slowly as i can in the direction of the workshops and find i am the last to arrive this time im put on the end of the chain gang a punishment for being the last to turn up my new intellectually challenging job is to place two small packets of margarine one sachet of raspberry jam and one of coffee into a plastic bag before its sealed up and taken away for use in another prison the young man opposite me who is sealing up the bags and then dropping them into a large cardboard box looks like a wrestler hes about five foot ten early twenties wears a spotless white tshirt and smart designer jeans his heavily muscled arms are bronzed so its not difficult to work out that he hasnt been in belmarsh that long the answer to that question turns out to be three weeks he tells me that his name is peter hes married with one child and runs his own company what do you do i ask im a builder when a prisoner says im something and not i used to be something then you can almost be certain that their sentence is short or theyre on remand peter goes on to tell me that he and his brother run a small building company that specializes in buying dilapidated houses in upandcoming areas of essex they renovate the houses and then sell them on last year between them they were able to earn around two thousand pounds a week but that was before peter was arrested he comes across as a hardworking decent sort of man so whats he doing in belmarsh i ask myself who can he possibly have murdered his brother perhaps he answers that question without my having to enquire i was caught driving my brothers van without a licence my brother usually does the driving but he was off sick for the day so i took his building tools from the work site to my home and for that the judge sentenced me to six weeks in jail let me make it clear i have no objection to the sentence but its madness to have sent this man to belmarsh i do hope that the home secretary mr blunkett who i know from personal dealings when john major was prime minister to be a decent caring man will read the next page carefully are you in a cell on your own i enquire no im locked up with two other prisoners what are they in for ones on a charge of murder awaiting his trial the others a convicted drug dealer that cant be much fun i say trying to make light of it are you still with me home secretary its hell peter replies i havent slept for more than a few minutes since the night they sent me here i just cant be sure what either of them might get up to i can handle myself but the two men im sharing a cell with are professional criminals are you still paying attention home secretary and worse he adds one of them offered me a thousand pounds to beat up a witness before his trial begins oh my god i hear myself say and hes putting more and more pressure on me each day of course i wouldnt consider such an idea but ive still got another three weeks to go and im beginning to fear that i might not be safe even when i get out home secretary this hardworking family man is fearful for his own safety is that what youre hoping to achieve for someone whos been caught driving without a licence ive received over a thousand letters of support since i arrived a belmarsh and even at sixtyone i have found prison a difficult experience to come to terms with peter is twentythree with his whole life ahead of him hundreds of people are being sent to this category a topsecurity prison who should never be here but what can i do about it i can hear the home secretary asking one of his officials classify anyone who is arrested as a b c or d before their trial begins not after then if theyre dcat firsttime offenders with no record of violence they can if convicted be sent direct to an open prison that way they wont have to share cells with murderers drug dealers or professional criminals and dont listen to officials when they tell you it cant be done sack them and do it i was allocated dcat status within twentyfour hours because of my mothers funeral so i know it can be done home secretary you are doing irreparable damage to decent peoples lives and you have no right to do so while im trying to take in peters plight the pile of plastic bags has grown into a mountain in front of me another prisoner who i hadnt noticed before obviously an old lag slots quickly into the one position that ensures the chain moves back into full swing this place is more about retribution than rehabilitation wouldnt you say jeffrey what is it about the irish that always makes you relax and feel youve known them all your life i nod my agreement he smiles and introduces himself as william keane before i repeat what william told me during the next couple of hours i must warn you that i havent a clue how much of his tale can be authenticated but if only half of it is true god help the prime minister the home secretary the secretary of state for health and the education secretary william was born in limerick the home of the blarney stone son of a prize fighter ireland must be the last country on earth that still has prize fighters and a local beauty william is a handsome man mrs keane produced seven sons and five daughters now williams accent is quite difficult to follow so i often have to ask him to repeat whole sentences his present home is a few hundred yards from the prison so family visits are not a problem its the family thats the problem one of them the youngster as william describes him is on the far bench marmalade and jam sachets and at some point william tells me all seven brothers and one sister were in jail at the same time serving sentences between them of one hundred and twelve years i can only feel sorry for their mother william is completing a tenyear sentence for drug dealing and has only twelve weeks left to serve you notice he doesnt say three months because three months would mean thirteen weeks hes actually quite fearful about how the world will have changed when in october he steps out of prison for the first time in a decade he flatters me a natural pastime for the irish by saying hes read all my books as it seems half the leading criminals in england have during his time in six prisons hes a postgraduate on such establishments william has taken a degree and read over four hundred books i only point this out to make you aware that we are not dealing with a fool he adds his condolences over my mothers death and asks how the police and prison staff dealt with me when it came to the funeral i tell him that they couldnt have been more thoughtful and considerate not like my brothers funeral he says not only were the whole family in handcuffs but they had helicopters circling overhead there were more police by the graveside than mourners but in my case i pointed out no one thought i would try to escape houdini couldnt have escaped from that bunch william retorts what puzzles me about william is that if the rest of the family are as bright and charismatic as he is why dont they combine their talents and energy and do something worthwhile rather than settling for a life of crime drugs he replies matteroffactly once youre hooked you can never earn enough to satisfy the craving so you end up becoming either a thief or a pusher and i have to admit william adds im lazy ive watched him carefully since hes joined the chain and the one thing he is not is lazy he has filled more plastic bags than peter and me put together i point this out to him well when i say lazy jeffrey i mean lazy about settling down to a ninetofive job when you can pick up a couple of grand a week selling drugs so will you go back to the drug scene once youre released i dont want to he says im thirtyfive and one things for certain i dont need to come back inside he hesitates but i just dont know if im strongwilled enough to stay away from drugs or the quick rewards that are guaranteed when you sell them how much are we talking about i ask and which drugs in particular heroin he says is the biggest moneyspinner a joey even after an explanation im still not quite sure what a joey is has come down in price from one hundred pounds to forty since ive been in prison ten years which is a clear indication how the market has grown and some people need as many as ten joeys a day when i first came into prison william continues cocaine was the designer drug today its heroin and its often your lot who are on it he says looking directly at me but ive never taken a drug in my life i tell him i dont even smoke i knew that the moment you walked in he said how can you be so sure the first thing i check is the pallor of the skin not bad for sixtyone he says displaying that irish charm again then i look at the nose followed by the lips and finally the arms and its clear youre not a potential customer but id be willing to bet theres something you need del boy to supply you with bottled water still preferably highland spring how many bottles do you order from the canteen four maybe five a week dont let the screws find out why not i pay for them because while cannabis and cocaine remain in your bloodstream for a month heroin can be flushed out in twentyfour hours if it wasnt you jeffrey the screws would assume you were a heroin addict trying to show up negative whenever you were called in for a mandatory drug test and its all the fault of ann widdecombe how can it possibly be ann widdecombes fault because it was widdecombe who first brought in the mdt that single decision has turned some cannabis smokers into heroin addicts thats quite a quantum leap i suggest and some accusation no says william it was inevitable and it only happened because widdecombe knew nothing about the drug culture in prisons how could she neither did you before you were sent to belmarsh and worse no one seems to have explained the problem to blunkett either because both are indirectly responsible for an unnecessary rise in heroin addicts and even in some cases their deaths hold on i say thats accusing blunkett and widdecombe of manslaughter and cannot be either fair or accurate when you take an mdt they test you for marijuana cannabis cocaine crack cocaine and heroin continues william ignoring my comment its a urine test and your sample is sent to an independent laboratory and then returned to the prison a week later with the result im with you so far marijuana can show up in urine for as long as twentyeight days you may well have smoked a joint three weeks ago even forgotten about it but it will still come up as positive on an mdt which is not the case with heroin because if you drink pints of water immediately after taking the drug you can clear any trace of heroin out of your system within twentyfour hours which means you wont test positive pay attention home secretary if the test comes back positive for marijuana the governor can add twentyeight days to your sentence and take away all your privileges twentyeight days for one joint says william so in prison some marijuana smokers who are on short sentences turn to heroin as an alternative because theres less chance of their sentence being lengthened result they often leave prison as heroin addicts having never touched a hard drug on the outside fact a percentage of them die within weeks of being released why because the heroin in prison is considerably weaker compared with the gear you can get on the out which causes them to overdose when they inject the same amount this is a direct result of government legislation so what would you do about it i ask the mandatory drug test should be for class a and b drugs only heroin cocaine not for marijuana ftnref since this was written the home secretary has downgraded cannabismarijuana to class c classification this simple decision would cut down the desire to experiment with heroin among twenty per cent of the prison population and would also save countless lives if any your officials are stupid enough to suggest this isnt true home secretary tell them not to rely simply on statistics but to spend a few weeks in prison where theyll quickly find out the truth i presume however it is true that drugs are the direct cause of our prisons being so overcrowded yes but its a myth that heroin is the main cause of street crime crack cocaine is just as much of a problem for the police i dont interrupt crack cocaine william continues is for crackheads and is far more dangerous than heroin if you take cocaine you are immediately satisfied and can be on a high after only one dose and as you come off it you may well fall asleep if you take crack cocaine once youve run out of your supply youll do anything to get your hands on some more to prolong the experience its the crackcocaine addicts that rob old ladies of their handbags and young girls of their mobile phones not heroin addicts theyre more likely to beg borrow or shoplift the problem the government hasnt acknowledged is that britain is now the crackcocaine capital of europe and if you want to set up an award for european drugs city of the year you wouldnt have to look any further than bradford that city would win first prize year in and year out do you have a solution to the problem i ask we should go down the swiss route william suggests they register addicts who can report to a doctor and immediately become part of a detox programme and get their fix of methadone or subitrex the swiss recently held a referendum on the issue and the public voted overwhelmingly in favour of the registration of drug addicts and tackling the problem headon result street crime has fallen by per cent well what do you know mr blunkett do you also want to learn about the national health detox programme asks william i nod if youre a heroin addict on the out and report your addiction to a local gp it will take you eight to ten weeks to get yourself registered however if you commit a crime and are sent to prison you dont have to wait because youll be put on a detox programme the following morning william pauses ive known addicts whove committed a crime simply to ensure they get themselves into prison and onto detox overnight what about that home secretary and worse william continues most of the addicts on the out who go as far as getting themselves registered fail to turn up ten weeks later to begin the course because by then theyve either lost interest or are too far gone to care enter the secretary of state for health william looks around the room at the fifty or so workers packing their little plastic bags i can tell you every one in this room whos on drugs even the gear theyre on and it often only takes a glance and youd be surprised how many of your friends on the out even one or two of those who have been condemning you recently are among them taking cannabis can hardly be described as a major crime i suggest my bet is it will be decriminalized in the not too distant future im not talking about cannabis jeffrey the biggest crisis the government is facing today is the rapid growth of heroin addicts i can name three lords two members of parliament and two television personalities who are on class a drugs i know because a member of my family has been supplying them for years he names all of them two i already knew about but the other five come as a surprise in theory they should all be in jail along with you he adds check on all the young criminals coming into prison and youll begin to understand its a problem that few people especially the politicians seem willing to face up to on your own spur alone he continues five of the lifers are on heroin and still getting the skag delivered to them every week how do they manage that i ask mainly during visits he says mouth backside ears even secreted in a womans hair because of the human rights act prison searches are fairly cursory but this is a double a category highsecurity prison i remind him thats not a problem if youre desperate enough and theres nothing more desperate than a heroin addict even when hes locked up in the segregation block but how i press him dont forget that most acats are also remand prisons and so have prisoners coming in and out every day if the new young criminals didnt already know it wouldnt take them long to discover the economics of supply and demand especially when such large sums of money are involved a gram of heroin a joey may be worth forty pounds on the street but in here it can be split up into five bags and sold for a couple of hundred at those prices some prisoners are willing to risk swallowing a bag of heroin just before theyre taken down then they simply have to wait to retrieve it after all theres a toilet in every cell and he adds my brother rory can swallow a lump of heroin the size of a small eraser five hundred pounds in value hold it in his throat and still carry on a conversation as soon as hes safely back in his cell he coughs it up but despite your brothers unusual skill i point out if as you suggest sixty per cent of inmates are on drugs youll need more than the odd prisoner whos willing to swallow a packet of heroin to satisfy the demand true said william so stay alert during visits jeffrey and youll notice how much transferring of drugs is done by kissing and whenever you see a baby dangling on its mothers knee you can be sure the little offsprings nappy will be full of drugs thats how the visitor gets it into prison the kissing is how its transferred from visitor to inmate and there are still a dozen or more ways of getting the gear in depending on which prison youre sent to if you ever spot someone coming into jail wearing an adidas tracksuit look carefully at the three stripes if you unstitch just one of them you can fill it with five hundred pounds worth of heroin my only thought is that i have an adidas tracksuit in my cell my brother michael continues william discovered that in some prisons waterstones have the book franchise so a friend of his would select an obscure title fill the spine with drugs and then ask waterstones to donate the book to the prison library once it had been placed on the shelf michael would take it out amazing how much heroin you can get into the spine of james joyces ulysses but in my last nick william continues the suns pagethree girl was the most popular method of getting the skag in until the screws caught on the pagethree girl you do know what a pagethree girl is dont you jeffrey i nod most a and bcat prisons allow an inmate to order a morning paper from the local newsagent continues william and because youre locked up for twentytwo hours a day they even deliver them to your cell one enterprising dealer on the out supplied the entire prisons needs by sprinkling any orders all over the pagethree girl in the sun he would then cut out another copy of the same photograph and seal it carefully over her twin making a thin bag of heroin he ended up supplying a grands worth of heroin a day to one prison with an officer unwittingly delivering his wares to the customer direct he was making far more with his builtin customers than he could ever hope to make on the out but how did he get paid oh jeffrey youre so green on every spur on every block in every prison youll find a dealer who has a supplier on the outside and hell know your needs within hours of your being locked up but that doesnt answer my question you make an order with your spur dealer continues william say a gram of heroin a day he then tells you the name and address of his supplier and you select someone on the out to handle the payments no standing orders you understand just cash in your case you could have your supply delivered under the scarfe cartoon in the sunday times i laugh or under the stamps on one of those large brown envelopes you receive every day youd be surprised how much cocaine you can deposit under four postage stamps you watch the screws when the post arrives in the morning they always run a thumb over the stamps but you can get a lot more in via the envelope but they always slit the envelopes open and look inside i didnt say inside said william you may have noticed that down the righthand side of most brown envelopes theres a flap which if you lift carefully you can fill with heroin and then seal back down again i know a man who has motor magazine sent in every week but its under the flap of the brown envelope that hes getting his weekly fix as soon as the buzzer goes im going to have to run back to my cell and write all this down i tell him how do you write your books william enquires with a felttip pen lift the cap off the bottom and you can get about fifty pounds worth of crack cocaine stuffed in there which is why the screws make you buy any writing implements direct from the canteen keep going i say having long ago given up sealing any plastic bags but somehow william manages to do that job for me as well the most outrageous transfer ive ever seen was a twentysevenstone con who hid the drugs under the folds of his skin because he knew no officer would want to check but they must have machines to do the checking for them yes they do in fact vast sums have been spent on the most sophisticated machinery but they only identify razor blades guns knives even ammunition but not organic substances for that they have to rely on dogs and a nappy full of urine will put even the keenest bloodhound off the scent so visits are the most common way of bringing in drugs yes but dont assume that lawyers priests or prison officers are above being carriers because when they turn up for legal and religious visits or in the case of officers for work they are rarely searched in some cases lawyers are paid their fees from drugs delivered to their clients and when it comes to letters if theyre legal documents the envelope has to be opened in front of you and the screws are not allowed to read the contents and while youre standing in front of a screw hes less likely to check under the stamps or the side flaps by the way theres a legal shop in fleet street that is innocently supplying envelopes with the words legal document strictly private and confidential printed on the top lefthand corner several drug dealers have a monthly supply of such envelopes and the only time they ever see a court is when they are standing in the dock you also mentioned priests yes i knew a sikh giani priest at gartree who used to give his blessing once a week in a prisoners cell from where he supplied the entire sikh community with drugs how did he manage that they were secreted in his turban did you know that a turban can be eighteen feet of material you can tuck an awful lot of drugs in there william pauses though in his case one of his flock grassed on him and he ended up doing a sevenyear bird and prison officers screws are paid around three hundred pounds a week and can pick up another thirteen pounds an hour overtime think about it a halfdozen joeys of heroin and they can double their wages i knew a member of the kitchen staff at my last prison who brought the stuff in once a week in his backpack but he would have been liable to a random search at any time true william replied and they did regularly search his backpack but not the shoulder straps but if they get caught they end up on the other side of the bars for a long stretch weve got a couple in here right now but theyll shift them out to dcats before it becomes common knowledge he pauses for their own safety but the championship says william like any good storyteller holding the best until last goes to harry the amateur referee from devon by now william has a captive audience as all the workers on our table have stopped depositing their wares into little plastic bags as they hang on his every word harry continues william used to visit his local prison once a week to referee a football match his contact was the goalkeeper and at the end of each game both men would return to the changing room take off their boots and put on trainers they would then leave carrying the other persons boots there was enough heroin packed into the referees hollow studs for him to buy a country cottage after only a couple of seasons and remember every match has to be played at home there are no away fixtures for prisoners however the silly man got greedy and started filling up the football as well hes currently serving a tenyear sentence in bristol so where does the dealer get his supplies from i ask william as the hands of the clock edge nearer and nearer towards twelve and i am fearful we may never meet again theyre picked up for him by mules mules the dealer often recruits university students who are already hooked probably by him hell then send them on an allexpensespaid holiday to thailand pakistan or even colombia and give them an extra thousand pounds if they can smuggle a kilo of heroin through customs how big is a kilo a bag of sugar and whats it worth the dealer passes on that kilo for around to sellers known as soldiers the soldiers then add baking powder and brick dust until they have four kilos which they sell on in grams or joeys ftnref a joey is about the size of two aspirins for forty pounds a time to their customers a top soldier can make a profit of seventy to a hundred thousand pounds a month and dont forget jeff its cash so they wont end up paying any tax and with that kind of profit there are a lot of punters out there willing to take the risk the heroin on sale at kings cross or piccadilly william continues will usually be about four to seven per cent pure the heroin that the mule brings back from an allexpensespaid holiday could be as high as per cent pure by the way he adds if the soldiers didnt dilute their wares cut the smack theyd kill off most of their customers within a week how many heroin addicts are there in this country i ask around a quarter of a million william replies so its big business and how many of those a buzzer goes to alert the prison staff that the work period is over and in a few moments we will be escorted back to our cells william says its nice to have met you jeffrey give my regards to your wife a truly remarkable woman sorry about the judge strange that he preferred to believe the word of someone who admitted in court to being a thief but whatever you do keep writing the books because however long you live theres always going to be a keane in jail william offers me one final piece of advice before we part i know youve been attending chapel on sundays but try the rcs this week father kevin preaches a fine sermon and youll like him i walk back to my cell delighted to have missed education having spent two hours being educated on the route march back to my cell im joined by ali breach of trust stole from his employer gave it all back who has also received his movement order he will be going to springhill on monday a dcat he asks where im heading i cant be sure i tell him im down for the isle of wight sometime next week but ive appealed against the move cant blame you by the way did you notice how peaceful the workshop was this afternoon ali asks i didnt see any difference from the last time i was there no the whole atmosphere changed the moment you walked into the room the prison officers and even the inmates stop swearing and a lot more work gets done i cant believe that oh yes says ali they all know youre writing a book and you might mention them by name not yours i remind him youre still referred to as ali youre only the second person who wants their identity kept a secret once we reach the apex that divides blocks one and two we go our separate ways i wish him well as soon as im back in my cell i grab a mcvities biscuit and pour out my last mug of water leaving only a dribble in the bottom of the bottle im about to discover if del boy is the man i turn on the radio england are all out for i drown my sorrows in the last cup of water before starting on what i expect to be an extended writing session im fearful of forgetting even a line of william keanes monologue pm supper vegetable pie and beans i turn the radio back on to follow the cricket australia are without loss chasing a total of shall i continue writing or be a masochist i decide to go on listening for a few more minutes in the next over slater is bowled and by the time the cell door is opened for association two hours later australia are for with only gilchrist among the recognized batsmen still left at the crease pm association i go in search of del boy like a helpless addict desperate for a fix i find him sitting on his bed head bowed looking mournful he bends down and slowly pulls out from under his bed a large brownpaper bag and like a conjuror produces three bottles of highland spring and two packets of mcvities chocolate i repeat chocolate biscuits he is unquestionably the man i cuddle him get off me he says pushing me away if anyone saw you doing that id never be able to show my face in the east end again i laugh thank him and carry off his spoils to my cell i pour myself a mug of water and am munching a chocolate biscuit when theres a knock on the cell door i look up to see my nextdoor neighbour richard standing in the doorway i feel his eyes boring into me the fuckin mirror he says almost in a shout have been round to our fuckin house and are pestering my fuckin mum im sorry to hear that i say but why are they doing that just because im in the next fuckin cell to you he says plaintively i nod my understanding they say youre going to describe me in your fuckin book as a vicious criminal and they fear for your fuckin safety do you think im fuckin vicious youve given me no reason to believe so i reply well now theyre threatening my fuckin mum telling her that if she doesnt supply a fuckin photo of me theyll make it worse how i asked by telling their fuckin readers what i did im afraid you must phone your mother and explain to her that theyll do that in any case by the way what are you in for murder he replies but it wasnt my fuckin fault why what happened i was out drinking with the boys at my fuckin local and when we left the fuckin pub we came face to face with a bunch of fuckin aussie backpackers who accused us of stealing their fuckin wallets i promise you jeff id never seen the fuckin bastards before in my life so what happened next well one of em had a fuckin knife and when my mate punched him he dropped the fuckin thing on the pavement i grabbed it and when another of them came for me i fuckin stabbed him it was only fuckin selfdefence and he died from one stab not exactly he hesitates the coroner said there were seven stab wounds but i was so fuckin tanked up that i cant remember a fuckin thing about it he pauses so make sure you tell your fuckin readers that im not a vicious criminal ftnref almost all of the prisoners have stopped swearing in front of me once richard returns to his cell i go back over william keanes words before turning to the latest round of letters still running at over a hundred a day when ive finished them i start reading a new book the day after tomorrow recommended by del boy somewhat ironic its over seven hundred pages a length that would normally put me off but not in my present circumstances ive only read a few pages when theres a knock on the cell door its paul creditcard fraud theyre transferring him tomorrow morning back to the drugrehab centre in norfolk so we may never meet again he shakes hands as if we were business associates and then leaves without another word i place my head on a pillow that no longer feels rockhard and reflect on the day i cant help thinking that hurling red balls at australians is on balance preferable to sticking knives into them day friday august am silent night woken by the alsatians at am should have been up in any case write for two hours am breakfast rice krispies longlife milk and an orange am avoid the workshop its not compulsory to do more than three sessions a week continue writing noon turn on cricket to hear cmj telling me that australia are all out for giving them a lead of only five runs on the first innings england are still in with a fighting chance pm lunch the rule for lunch and supper called dinner and tea is that you fill in a meal slip the day before and drop it in a plastic box on the ground floor the menus for the week are posted on a board so you can always select in advance if you fail to fill in the slip as i regularly do youre automatically given a a is always the vegetarian option b today is panfried fish thats spent more time swimming in oil than the sea c is steak and kidney pie you cant see inside it so avoid at all costs puddings semolina or an apple perhaps this is the time to remind you that each prisoner has spent on them for three meals a day when i leave my cell plastic tray and plastic plate in hand i join a queue of six prisoners at the hotplate the next six inmates are not allowed to join the queue until the previous six have been served this is to avoid a long queue and fighting breaking out over the food at the righthand end of the hotplate sits paul murder who checks your name and announces fossett c pugh b clarke b etc when he ticks my name off the six men behind the counter who are all dressed in long white coats white headgear and wear thin rubber gloves for handling the potatoes or bread go into a huddle because they know by now theres a fiftyfifty chance i wont want anything and will return to my cell emptyhanded tony marijuana only escaped to paris has recently got into the habit of selecting my meal for me today he suggests the steak and kidney pie slightly underdone the cauliflower au gratin with duchesse potatoes or my lord you could settle for the creamy vegetable pie the servers humour has reached the stage of cutting one potato in quarters and placing a diced carrot on top and then depositing it in the centre of my plastic plate mind you if theres chocolate icecream or a lollipop del boy always makes sure i end up with two i never ate puddings before i went to prison but today tony tells me theres a special on the menu shepherds pie now i am a world expert on shepherds pie as it has for the past twenty years been the main dish at my christmas party ive eaten shepherds pie at the ivy the savoy and even club in new york but i have never seen anything like belmarshs version of that particular dish the meat if it is meat is glued to the potato and then deposited on your plastic plate in one large blob resembling a turner prize entry if submitted i feel confident it would be shortlisted tony adds i do apologize my lord but were out of krug however belmarsh has a rare vintage tap water with added bromide i settle for creamy vegetable pie an unripe apple and a glass of highland spring p pm an officer comes to pick me up and escort me to the deputy governors office once again i feel like an errant schoolboy who is off to visit the headmaster once again the headmaster is half my age mr leader introduces himself and tells me he has some good news and some bad news he begins by explaining that because emma nicholson wrote to scotland yard demanding an inquiry into the collecting and distribution of funds raised for the kurds i will have to remain a ccat prisoner and will not be reinstated as a dcat until the police have completed their investigation on the word of one vengeful woman i have to suffer further injustice the good news he tells me is that i will not be going to camphill on the isle of wight but will be sent to elmer in kent and as soon as my dcat has been reinstated i will move on to springhill i complain bitterly about the first decision but quickly come to realize that mr leader isnt going to budge he even accuses me of having an attitude when i attempt to enter a debate on the subject he wouldnt last very long in the house of commons it wasnt my fault he claims it was the polices decision to instigate an inquiry pm association david life imprisonment possession of a gun is the only person watching the cricket on television i pull up a chair and join him its raining so theyre showing the highlights of the first two innings i almost forget my worries despite the fact that if i was on the out i wouldnt be watching the replay i would be at the ground sitting under an umbrella pm i skip supper and continue writing which causes a riot or near riot i didnt realize that paul has to tick off every name from the four spurs and if the ticks dont tally with the number of prisoners the authorities assume someone has escaped the truth is that ive only tried to escape supper mr weedon arrives outside my cell i look up from my desk and put down my pen you havent had any supper archer he says no i just couldnt face it thats a reportable offence what not eating i ask in disbelief yes the governor will want to know if youre on hunger strike i never thought of that i said will it get me out of here no it will get you back on the hospital wing anything but that what do i have to do eat something i pick up my plastic plate and go downstairs paul and the whole hotplate team are waiting and greet me with a round of applause with added cries of good evening my lord your usual table i select one boiled potato have my name ticked off and return to my cell the system feels safe again the rebel has conformed pm i have a visit from tony marijuana only escaped to france and he asks if id like to join him in his cell on the second floor as if he were inviting a colleague to pop into his office for a chat about the latest sales figures when you enter a prisoners cell you immediately gain an impression of the type of person they are fletch has books and pamphlets strewn all over the place that will assist new prisoners to get through their first few days del boy has tobacco phonecards and food and only he knows what else under the bed as hes the spurs insider dealer billys shelves are packed with academic books and files relating to his degree course paul has a wall covered in nude pictures mostly chinese and michael only has photos of his family mainly of his wife and sixmonthold child tony is a mature man fiftyfour and his shelves are littered with books on quantum mechanics a lifelong hobby on his bed is a copy of todays times which when he has read it will be passed on to billy reading a paper a day late when you have an eighteenyear sentence is somehow not that important in a corner of the room is a large stack of old copies of the financial times i already have a feeling tonys story is going to be a little different he tells me that he comes from a middleclass family had a good upbringing and a happy childhood his father was a senior manager with a top lifeassurance fund and his mother a housewife he attended the local grammar school where he obtained twelve olevels four alevels and an slevel and was offered a place at london university but his father wanted him to be an actuary within a year of qualifying he knew that wasnt how he wanted to spend his life and decided to open a butchers shop with an old school friend he married his friends sister and they have two children a daughter who recently took a firstclass honours degree at bristol and a son who is sixteen and as i write boarding at a wellknown public school by the age of thirty tony had become fed up with the hours a butcher has to endure at the slaughterhouse by three every morning and then not closing the shop until six at night he sold out at the age of thirtyfive and having more than enough money decided to retire within weeks he was bored so he invested in a jaguar dealership and proceeded to make a second fortune during the thatcher years once again he sold out once again determined to retire because he was seeing so little of his family and his wife was threatening to leave him but it wasnt too long before he needed to find something to occupy his time so he bought a rundown pub in the east end tony thought this would be a distracting hobby until he ended up with fourteen pubs and a wife whom he hardly saw he sold out once more having parted from his wife he found himself a new partner a woman of thirtyseven who ran her own family business tony was fortyfive at the time he moved in with her and quickly discovered that the family business was drugs the family concentrated on marijuana and wouldnt touch anything hard theres more than a large enough market out there not to bother with hard drugs he assures me tony made it clear from the start that he had no interest in drugs and was wealthy enough not to have anything to do with the family business the problem of living with this lady he explained was that he quickly discovered how incompetently the family firm was being run so he began to pass on to his partner some simple business maxims as the months went by he found that he was becoming more and more embroiled until he ended up as titular md the following year they tripled their profits meat cars pubs jeffrey he said marijuana is no different for me it was just another business that needed to be run properly i shouldnt have become involved he admits but i was bored and annoyed by how incompetent her and her family were and to be fair she was good in bed now here is the real rub tony was sentenced to twelve years for a crime he didnt commit but he does admit quite openly that they could have nailed him for a similar crime several times over he was apparently visiting a house he owned to collect the rent from a tenant who had failed to pay a penny for the past six months when the police burst in they found a fiftykilo package of marijuana hidden in a cupboard under the stairs and charged him with being a supplier he actually knew nothing about that particular stash and was innocent of the charges laid against him but guilty of several other similar offences so he doesnt complain and accepts his punishment very british after tony had served three and a half years they moved him to ford open a dcat prison from where he visited paris as already recorded in this diary he then moved on to mijas in spain and found a job as an engineer but a friend shafted him a sort of ted francis he says so i was arrested and spent sixteen months in a spanish jail while my extradition papers were being sorted out they finally sent me back to belmarsh where i will remain until ive completed my sentence he reminds me that no one has ever escaped from belmarsh but what happened to the girl i ask she got the house all my money and has never been charged with any offence he smiles and doesnt appear to be bitter about it i can always make money again he says that wont be a problem and i feel sure there will be other women tony is being considered for parole at the present time but doesnt get on well with his probation officer he claims she doesnt appreciate his sense of humour he warns me to make sure i treat whoever they allocate to my case with respect because this single individual can be the deciding factor as to whether you should be released or remain locked up in prison so what will you do once you are released i ask he smiles and extracts a file secreted at the back of his cupboard im going to sell agricultural equipment to the senegalese he produces sheet after sheet of financial forecasts on senegals agricultural requirements along with grants the british government will advance to help subsidize that particular industry i wouldnt be surprised if you make a fourth fortune i tell him after studying the papers only women will stop me he says i do love them so lockup is bellowed from the ground floor i thank tony for his company leave his office and return to my cell pm i check over my script for the day and then spend a couple of hours reading my mail if people go on sending me bibles and prayer books ill be able to open a religious bookshop i try to find out the closeofplay cricket score but have to settle for any questions ken clarke is very forthright about the iniquity of my sentence which is brave remembering hes standing for the leadership of the tory party pm still no rap music so for two nights running i sleep soundly day saturday august am woke several times during the night not caused by any noise but simply because i drank too much water yesterday cup a soup chicken p oxo p and a bottle of highland spring p still i dont have to go that far for the lavatory the alsatians wake me again just after six write for two hours am on a saturday morning you are not only allowed to leave your cell but you also get a cooked breakfast egg beans and chips i still avoid the chips tony selects two fried eggs and the most recently heated beans for me they taste good am association i seek out fletch to check over the script i wrote yesterday on drugs he verifies everything william keane has told me and then adds have you heard of china white no i reply wondering if its wedgwood or royal doulton china white was a shipment of pure heroin from the golden triangle that turned up in glasgow a couple of years ago it was so pure per cent that fifteen registered addicts died within days of injecting it and then the stuff began to spread south killing users right across the country all prison governors sent out official warnings to inmates telling them to weaken any dosage of heroin they had recently been supplied with come to my cell and ill show you some literature on the subject back in his cell fletch checks through some papers in a file marked drugs he then hands over several pamphlets and postcards that are given to all suspected drug takers the day they enter prison it was the first time id seen any of this material they include the detox handbook a users guide to getting off opiates second edition the methadone handbook fifth edition cannabis ninth edition a pamphlet on hiv hepatitis b and c along with six coloured cards injecting and infections illustrated cannabis marijuana puff blow draw weed shit hash spliff tackle wacky ganja acid and magic mushrooms mushies shrooms lsd amphetamines speed wizz uppers billy amph sulphate ecstasy e doves disco biscuits echoes hug drug burgers fantasy cocaine coke charlie snow c heroin smack gear brown horse junk scag jack there are several slang names for each drug according to which part of the country you live in the misuse of drugs act divides illegal drugs into three classes and provides for maximum penalties of between two and fourteen years fletch tells me that we have our own heroin dealer on the spur and he knows exactly who his customers are there are fiftyeight prisoners on our spur and eleven of them are or have been on heroin and fortyone of them are currently taking drugs hmp belmarsh governors notice to inmates no possible batch of contaminated heroin at risk of causing severe systemic sepsis in injecting drug users all inmates will be aware that possession or use of any controlled drug is an offence against prison discipline however any inmate who chooses to ignore this should be aware of possible health risks associated with injecting drugs it is possible that parts of a batch of heroin which may have been responsible for a number of deaths in scotland ireland and various parts of england last year may be circulating on the drugs market again any inmate who injects drugs is therefore placing himself at extreme risk im about to leave when i see five roses on his window sill fletch is obviously a man who likes to have flowers in his room i look at the little bunch more closely he makes the petals out of bread and the raindrop effect on the red petals are grains of sugar he paints them with a brush made up of hairs that have fallen out of a shaving brush they are attached to the end of a pencil with the aid of a rubber band he finally produces the colour by using a wet brush and applying it to the end of a red crayon hes made six of these bread roses and planted them in a bread roll as hes not allowed a flower pot because when broken it could be used as a weapon why wont they let you have a paintbox i ask no boxes or tins are allowed in belmarsh he explains because they can also be turned into a weapon and weapons are a massive problem for the screws they have to allow you a new bic razor every day otherwise all the cons would be unshaven last month a con glued two bic razor blades to the end of a toothbrush caught someone in the shower and left him with a scar across his face that no plastic surgeon will be able to disguise whenever you open a can of anything fletch continues you have to tip the contents out onto a plate and pass the empty can back to an officer as you could cut someones throat with the serrated edge of the lid however fletch adds there are still many other ways a determined prisoner can make himself a weapon i dont interrupt his flow for example he continues you could hit someone over the head with your steel thermos flask you could pour the hot water from your thermos over another prisoner you could remove one of the iron struts from under your bed and youd have a crude knife ive even seen someones throat cut with a sharpened phonecard fletch picks up his plastic lavatory brush one prisoner quite recently used his razor supply to shave down the handle nine inches in length so that he turned his bog brush into a sword and then in the middle of the night stabbed his cellmate to death but that would only ensure that he remained in prison for the rest of his life i reminded him he already had a life sentence said fletch without emotion if a prisoner is determined to kill his cellmate or even another prisoner its all too easy because once youre banged up the screws cant spend all night checking whats taking place on the other side of the iron door only two weeks ago i would have been appalled horrified disgusted by this matteroffact conversation am i already becoming anaesthetized numbed by anything other than the most horrific when i leave fletchs cell colin football hooligan is waiting to see me he hands me a copy of his rewritten critique on frank mccourts latest book tis as well as a poem that hes written colin offers me a banana not my usual fee for editing but a fair exchange in the circumstances i return to my cell and immediately commit to paper everything fletch has told me noon lunch tony has selected a jacket potato covered in grated cheese i eat his offering slowly while listening to the cricket on the radio england have already collapsed and were all out for in their second innings leaving australia to chase a total of to win the match and retain the ashes i leave the radio on kidding myself that if gough and caddick make an early breakthrough we could be in with a chance wrong again pm exercise i havent been out of the building for three days and decide i must get some fresh air after being searched i step out into the yard and immediately spot the two tearaways who threatened me the last time i took some exercise theyre perched up against the wire at the far end of the yard skulking i glance behind to find billy and colin are tracking me billy adds the helpful comment you need a haircut jeffrey hes right im joined on the walk by peter fabri who is all smiles hes out on monday to be reunited with his wife and sixweekold child as i have been writing about him this morning i check over my facts you were offered a thousand pounds to beat up a witness in a trial due to be heard at the bailey in the near future even thats changed since i last saw you said peter hes now offering me forty thousand to bump off the witness he told me that hes made a profit of two hundred thousand on the crime for which hes been charged so he reckons its worth forty to have the only witness snuffed out you know says peter i think if i was in this place for another fortnight hed be offering me a hundred grand home secretary i hope youre still paying attention peter remains with me for three more circuits of the yard before he returns to his friends three other prisoners with sentences of six weeks or less i continue walking and notice that billy and colin have been replaced by paul and del boy i spot fletch standing in the far corner he likes corners because from such a vantage point he can view his private domain it becomes clear he has a protection rota working on my behalf and i feel sure the officers loitering on the far side of the yard are only too aware of what hes up to i pass william keane leaning against the wire fence chatting to his brother he jumps up and runs across to join me paul and del boy immediately take a pace forward and only relax when i put my arm round williams shoulder after all i havent let anyone know which one of those sitting round the perimeter is the cause of problem once again i use the time to check the facts that william told me in the workshop he corrects a couple of errors on the price of cocaine and once again explains how pure heroin is dilutedcut before becoming a joey or bags when he has completed this explanation i ask him what he intends to do when hes released in twelve weeks time salvage he says salvage i repeat thinking this must have something to do with shipping yes im going to buy old cars patch them up see that they get their mot certificate and then sell them on the estates round here can you make an honest living doing that i ask i hope so jeffrey he says because im getting too old thirtyfive for this game in any case theres enough of my family costing the government a thousand pounds a week without me adding to the taxpayers burden mind you he adds if they had let me out last week i might have ended up murdering someone i stop in my tracks and paul and del boy almost collide into the back of me my brothers just told me he points to the other side of the yard where a tall darkhaired young man is leaning up against the fence that my sister brinie was kidnapped last week and repeatedly raped and as most of the family are in jail theres not a lot we can do about it im speechless the bastards been arrested so we must hope that the judge gets it right this time he pauses but for his sake lets hope he doesnt end up in the same prison as one of my brothers mind you he adds dont bet on that because the odds are quite short as we turn the corner he points up to a tower block in the distance thats where another of my brothers patrick fell to his death have you noticed that mrs keane has named all her sons after saints or kings youll remember that was the occasion when the whole family attended his funeral along with half the metropolitan police he pauses theyre now saying he might have been pushed ill find out more as soon as i get out of here and if he was what hope has this man of remaining on the outside i ask myself i found out a few months later when i met up with yet another brother ftnref this sentence was added while i was editing volume one and had finally been transferred to a dcat as of today october william keane is still on the out when william slips off to rejoin his brother i notice that del boy and paul have been replaced by tony and david david fiftyfive in possession of a gun is overweight out of shape and finding it difficult to keep up with me the next person to join me is a young bright fulloflife west indian whose story i will not repeat as it is the mirror image of peter fabris he too has no intention of even going through an amber light once they release him from belmarsh however he admits that hes learnt a lot more about crime than he knew before he came into prison hes also been introduced to drugs in the cell he shares with two other inmates im clean man he says rubbing his hands together but one of the guys in my cell whos due out next week has tried heroin for the first time hes hooked now man i tell you hes hooked are you still paying attention home secretary i pass the tearaways who havent moved an inch for the past forty minutes and have to satisfy themselves with malevolent stares i feel confident that they arent going to risk anything this time at four oclock were called back in block by block several prisoners who are leaving next week including peter offered forty thousand to murder a witness denzil come and see me when im a star and liam do i need a barrister or should i represent myself come across to shake hands and wish me luck i pray that they never see the inside of belmarsh again pm when i arrive back in my cell theres another stack of letters waiting for me on my bed three stacks to be accurate i start reading its turned out to be most helpful that the censor has to open every one im particularly touched by a letter freddie forsyth sent to the daily telegraph about the length of my sentence and the money ive raised for charity the editor did not publish it pm last call for supper spur one is always let out first and called back last because most of the inmates are lifers who will spend more time inside than anyone else on the block its prison logic and works because the turnover on the other three spurs is between per cent and per cent a week so no one thinks of complaining i stroll down to the hotplate but only so that my name can be ticked off pick up a thermos of hot water and return to my cell i make myself a cup a soup tomato p and eat a mars bar p and a prison apple as i continue to read todays letters pm i pick up colins critique of frank mccourts tis the improvement is marked since i read his first effort he has now sorted out how much of the story he should reveal before he offers his critical opinion this is obviously a man who once you tell him something is able to respond immediately i then turn my attention to his poem education belmarsh open the labyrinths of time blow out the cobwebs and past life of crime full of knowledge held within the mind is truly a wonderful thing it can be educated it can be evolved without education can the problems be solved while locked away there is plenty to see they entrap the body but your mind is still free to wonder the universe and grow like a tree so go to the library and pick up a book watch your mind grow while other cons look its not down to them to make you move so go ahead read and your mind will improve colin kitto may house block hmp belmarsh this poem reveals a lot about the man where hes going and where hes come from i feel sure that before he completes his sentence he will have that degree from ruskin college and dont forget this is a man who couldnt read or write before he came into prison there is a polite knock on the door and i look up to see one of the officers peering through my little oblong window he asks if i would be willing to sign autographs for his two daughters joanna and stephanie they both enjoy your books he explains before adding though i must admit ive never read one he doesnt unlock the cell door just pushes two pieces of paper underneath this puzzles me i later learn that an officer cannot unlock a cell door if he is not on duty once he has retrieved them he adds ill be off for the first part of next week so if i dont see you again good luck with your appeal pm i begin reading a book of short stories that had been left on a table by the tv on the ground floor its titled the fallen and the author john mackenna is someone ive not read before hes no storyteller as so often the irish are but oh dont i wish i could write as lyrically as he does pm i finish reading john mackenna in one sitting on the end of the bed what assured confident prose with an intimate feel for his countrymen and his country i conclude that god gave the irish the gift of language and threw in some potatoes as an afterthought day sunday august am another good nights sleep yesterday i wrote for six hours three sessions of two read for three including my letters and slept for eight out there where you are five hours sleep was always enough in truth the writing is an attempt to fill the day and night with nonstop activity i feel sorry for the prisoners who have to occupy those same hours and cannot read or write am breakfast egg and beans on toast two mornings in a row i dont grumble ive always liked egg and beans am i hear the officer on duty holler up from his desk rcs i press the buzzer which switches on a red light outside my door known as room service to indicate that i wish to attend chapel no one comes to unlock the door when they yell a second time i press the buzzer again but still no one responds after they call a third time i start banging on my door but to no avail although i am not a roman catholic after william keanes recommendation i would have liked to hear father kevin preach am mr cousins finally appears to explain that as i am not a roman catholic the officer on duty assumed my name had been put on the wrong list and transferred me back to c of e i curse under my breath as i dont want to be put on report a curse for me is damn or blast you can always go next week he says just be sure you give us enough notice i was rather hoping that i wont be with you next week i tell him he smiles i can see he accepts that his colleague has made a mistake so i decide this might be a good opportunity to ask about the drug problem as seen from the other side of the iron barrier to my surprise mr cousins is frank almost enthusiastic about passing on his views mr cousins doesnt try to pretend that there isnt a drug problem in prisons only a fool would he also admits that because of the casual way officers have to conduct their searches its not that difficult to transfer drugs from spur to spur block to block and even across a table during family visits not many officers he tells me would relish the idea of having to use rubber gloves to search up prisoners backsides three or four times a day and even if we did go to that extreme the inmates would simply swallow the drugs which would only cause even more problems but he continues we still do everything in our power to prevent and cure and weve even had a few successes he pauses but not that many when a prisoner enters belmarsh he has an mdt this takes the form of a urine sample which is all very well until it comes to heroin a substance that can be flushed through the body within twentyfour hours most other drugs leave some signs in the blood or urine for at least four weeks on the day they enter prison per cent of inmates show positive signs of being on drugs and even with the twentyfourhour proviso per cent indicate of heroin if mr cousins had revealed these figures to me only three weeks ago he would have left me staggered by the enormity of the problem already i have come to accept such revelations as part of everyday prison life our biggest success rate continues mr cousins is among those prisoners coming up for parole because towards the end of their sentence they have to report regularly to the voluntary drug testing centre theres one in every prison to prove they are no longer dependent on drugs which will be entered on their report and can play a part in shortening their sentence what we dont know he adds is how many of them go straight back on drugs the moment theyre released but in recent years weve taken a more positive step to stamp out the problem in we set up a dedicated search team known as the ghostbusters who can move in at any time without warning and search individual cells even whole spurs or blocks this team of officers was specifically formed following the ira escape from whitemoor prison in but after all the terrorists were sent back to ulster following the good friday agreement the unit switched their concentration from terrorism to the misuse of illegal substances theyve had remarkable success in uncovering large amounts of drugs and charging offenders but he reflects i have to admit the percentage of drug takers still hasnt fallen and i speak as someone who was once a member of the dst mind you he adds its just possible that standing still is in itself an achievement i hear the first bellow from downstairs for c of e and thank mr cousins for his tutorial and his candour am i report to the middle floor and join those prisoners who wish to attend the morning service we line up and are put through the usual search before being escorted to the chapel malcolm salvation army officer is surprised to see me as i had told him yesterday that i intended to go and hear father kevin preach before i take my seat in the second row i give him the precised version of how i ended up back in his flock no backing group this week just taped music which makes malcolms job all the more difficult especially when it comes to stopping the chattering in the back six rows my eyes settle on a couple of lebanese drug dealers sitting in the far corner at the back they are deep in conversation i know that theyre from different spurs so they obviously use this weekly get together to exchange information on their clients every time i turn to observe them their heads are bowed but not in prayer the sermon this week is taken from luke its the one about the ninetynine sheep who are safely locked up in the pen while the shepherd goes off in search of the one thats strayed malcolm faces a congregation of over two hundred that have strayed and most of them have absolutely no intention of returning to the pen but he somehow battles on working assiduously on the first six rows with whom he is having some success towards the end of the service his wife reads a lesson and after the blessing malcolm asks his congregation if they would like to come forward and sign the pledge at least forty prisoners rise from their places and begin to walk forward they are individually blessed before signing the register they look to me like the same forty who offered themselves up for salvation last week but i am still in no doubt that malcolm and his wife are performing a worthwhile mission noon lunch i settle for more beans on toast an apple and a mug of water i suppose i should have stated the obvious at some point namely that alcohol is forbidden which is no great loss to me as i rarely drink more than a glass of red wine in the evening pm association i run downstairs phonecard in hand thirteen units left for mary a long queue has already formed behind the two payphones one of the disadvantages of living on the top floor i turn my attention to the large tv in the middle of the room several prisoners are watching the sunday afternoon film with tom hanks and geena davis its the story of a womens baseball team set up in when because of the outbreak of the second world war the mens teams had to be disbanded i turn my head every few moments but the queue doesnt seem to diminish so i go on watching the film several prisoners join me during the next halfhour del boy murder to tell me hes somehow purloined a copy of the weekly menu for my diary fletch murder wants to come to my cell at six and read something to me i ask if he could make it seven as ill still be writing at six suits me he says im not going anywhere prison humour tony marijauna only escaped to paris then leans across and asks if the identification of one of his girlfriends could be removed from yesterdays script i agree and make a note of her name i spot billy murder and recommend the book of short stories by john mackenna but he walks on past me without a word i suppose by now i shouldnt be surprised by anything dennis gbh large bag of toiletries taps me on the shoulder he starts to tell me about the visit of his son on his first birthday and how he cant wait to get out and be with his wife and children join the club miah murder whos the spur hair cutter known not surprisingly as sweeny todd says he can fit me in at seven tomorrow evening i thank him explaining that i must have my hair cut before mary and the boys come to visit me on thursday when i glance round the queue for the phone is down to three i leave mr hanks and ms davis and take my place at the back just as i reach the front another prisoner barges in front of me as hes a double murderer and his right hand has hate tatooed on his four fingers i decide not to mention that i thought i was next in line ten minutes later he slams down the phone and walks away effing and blinding i slowly dial the cambridge number to be reminded that i only have thirteen units left on my card mary answers she sounds cheerful and is full of news the trip to dresden went well and while she was abroad she felt her life was getting back to normal perhaps because the german tabloids arent quite that obsessed with my incarceration william accompanied her and was a tower of strength while james stayed behind to manage the shop ten units left mary tells me that following emma nicholsons letter the police are hinting that they may not even carry out an inquiry i explain that despite this ive been reassigned to ccat status and would like my dcat back as quickly as possible she assures me that ramona and james are working on it seven units left i tell her how many letters i have been receiving every day and she counters by saying that shes getting so many at home and in london that there just arent enough hours to answer them all shes designed an allpurpose reply so that she can get on with her own work five units left mary adds that not only are my friends remaining constant but shes had a dozen offers to join them on their yachts or in their holiday homes and one even on safari ive always known we had foulweather friends but both of us have been touched by the publics overwhelming support three units left i let her know that ive already written over forty thousand words of the diary but cant be sure what my regular readers will make of it mary says shes looking forward to reading an early draft and will give me a candid view she is incapable of doing anything else one unit left we begin our goodbyes and she reminds me i will be seeing her and the boys on thursday something to look forward to do you know how much i all units used up i hear a click and the phone goes dead as i walk away i hear the words lockup bellowed out from just behind me as reliable as big ben if not as melodious it has to be five oclock pm supper i go down to the hotplate and have my name ticked off by paul prisoners do a sevenday week with no holidays or bank holidays and pick up a thermos flask of hot water and a chocolate ice cream back in my cell i make a cup a soup mushroom p eat another mars bar p and enjoy a chocolate icecream prison rations pm im washing my plastic plate in the basin when theres a knock on the door the cell door is pulled open by an officer to reveal the massive frame of fletch standing in the doorway i had quite forgotten he was coming to read something to me i smile welcome i say like the spider to the fly the first thing i notice is that hes clutching a small green notebook not unlike the type we used to write our essays in at school after a brief chat about which prison im likely to be sent to and his opinion of mr leader the deputy governor he turns to the real purpose of his visit i wonder if i might be allowed to read something to you he asks of course i reply not sure if its to be an essay a poem or even the first chapter of a novel i settle on the bed while fletch sits in the plastic chair prisoners are only allowed one chair per cell he places the little lined book on my desk opens it at the first page and begins to read if i had the descriptive powers of greene and the narrative drive of hemingway i still could not do justice to the emotions i went through during the next twenty minutes revulsion anger sympathy incredulity and finally inadequacy fletch turns another page tears welling up in his eyes as he forces himself to resurrect the demons of his past by the time he comes to the last page this giant of a man is a quivering wreck and of all the emotions i can summon up to express my true feelings anger prevails when fletch closes the little green book we both remain silent for some time once im calm enough to speak i thank him for the confidence he has shown in allowing me to share such a terrible secret ive never allowed anyone in belmarsh to read this he says tapping the little green book but perhaps now you can appreciate why i wont be appealing against my sentence i dont need the whole world to know what ive been through he adds in a whisper so it will go with me to my grave i nod my understanding and promise to keep his confidence pm i cant sleep what fletch has read to me could not have been made up its so dreadful that it has to be true i sleep for a few minutes and then wake again fletch has tried to put the past behind him by devoting his time and energy to being a listener helping others by sharing his room with a bullied prisoner a drug addict or someone likely to be a victim of sexual abuse i fall asleep i wake again its pitch black outside my little cell window and i begin to feel that fletch could give an even greater service if his story were more widely known and the truth exposed then people like me who have led such naive and sheltered lives could surely have the blinkers lifted from their eyes i decide as soon as they let me out of my cell that i will tell him that ive changed my mind im going to suggest that he could do far more good by revealing what actually happened to him than by remaining silent in all i think ive woken five or six times during the night my thoughts always returning to fletch but one comment he made above all others burns in my mind fifty per cent of prisoners in belmarsh can tell you variations of the same story jeffrey my case is not unique i decide i must use whatever persuasive powers i possess to get him to agree to publish without reservation everything in that little green book day monday august am ive spent a sleepless night i rise early and write for two hours when ive finished i pace around my cell aware that if only i had held onto fletchs little green notebook i could have spent the time considering his words in greater detail am i know ive eaten a bowl of corn pops from my variety pack because i can see the little empty box in the wastepaper bin but i cant remember when i go on pacing am an officer opens the cell door i rush down to the ground floor only to discover that fletch is always let out at eight so that he can go straight to the workshops and have everything set up and ready before the other prisoners arrive because of the length of his sentence its a real job for him hes the works manager and can earn up to forty pounds a week i could go along to the workshops but with seventy or eighty other prisoners hanging around i wouldnt be able to hold a private conversation with him tony tells me fletch will be back for dinner at twelve when hell have an hour off before returning to the workshops at one ill have to wait when i return to my cell i find a letter has been pushed under my door its from billy little murder he apologizes for being offhand with me during association the previous evening august is always a bad month for him he explains and hes not very good company for a number of reasons i last saw my son in august my favourite gran died in august the heinous act of murder that i committed took place on august as you can imagine i have a lot on my mind i cant begin to imagine which i admit when i reply to his letter he continues during this period i tend to spend a long time inside myself this could give an impression to those who dont know me of being ignorant and unapproachable for this i apologise by this time tomorrow youll be sunning it up by the pool or thats how springhill will feel in comparison to hellmarsh in a way youve been lucky to have spent only a short period here a period in which youve brought the normal inertia of prison to life over the last three weeks you will have felt the resentment of other prisoners who feel strongly that equality should be practised even in prisons you no doubt recall the gilbert and sullivan quote from the gondoliers when everybody is somebody then nobody is anybody i think what im trying to say is that your status friendliness and willingness to help and advise others has not gone unnoticed by those who are destined to spend a great deal longer incarcerated for this i thank you and for your inspiration to press me to think more seriously about my writing i would like to take you up on your offer to keep in touch and in particular to check over my first novel ill be resident here for another month or two or three before they move me onto a first stage lifer main centre billy has been at belmarsh for two years and seven months ill let you know my address once ive settled my number is at the bottom of this letter you are primus inter pares yours billy bx i sit down at my table and reply immediately noon when fletch arrives back from the workshops he finds me waiting by his cell door he steps inside and invites me to join him ftnref you never enter someone elses cell unless invited to do so i ask if i might be allowed to borrow his notebook so that i can consider more carefully the piece he read to me the previous evening he hesitates for a moment then goes to a shelf above his bed burrows around and extracts the little green notebook he hands it over without comment i grab an apple for lunch and return to my cell reading fletchs story is no less painful i go over it three times before pacing up and down my problem will be getting him to agree to publish his words in this diary pm mr bentley opens my cell door to let me know that the deputy governor wishes to see me as i am escorted to mr leaders office i can only wonder what bad news he will have to impart this time am i to be sent to parkhurst or brixton or have they settled on dartmoor when the deputy governors door is opened i am greeted with a warm smile mr leaders demeanour and manner are completely different from our last meeting he is welcoming and friendly which leads me to hope that he is the bearer of better news he tells me that he has just heard from the home office that i will not be going to camphill on the isle of wight or elmer in kent but wayland i frown ive never heard of wayland its in norfolk he tells me ccat and very relaxed ive already spoken to the governor he adds and only one other member of my staff is aware of your destination i take this as a broad hint that it might be wise not to tell anyone else on the spur of my destination unless i want to be accompanied throughout the entire journey by the national press i nod and realize why he has taken the unusual step of seeing me alone im about to ask him a question when he answers it we plan to move you on thursday only three more days at hellmarsh is my first reaction and after asking him several more questions i thank him and return to my cell unescorted i spend the next hour considering every word mr leader has said i recall asking him which he would rather be going to wayland or the isle of wight wayland hed replied without hesitation in prison its necessary to fight each battle day by day if youre eventually going to win the war first it was getting off the medical centre and onto block three then was escaping block three beirut and being moved to block one to live among a more mature group of prisoners next was being transferred from belmarsh to a ccat prison now i shall be pressing to regain my dcat status so that i can leave wayland as quickly as possible for an open prison but thats tomorrows battle several prisoners have take each day as it comes scrawled on their walls pm i try to write but so much has already happened today that i find it hard to concentrate i munch a bar of cadburys fruit and nut p and drink a mug of evian p topped up with robinsons blackcurrant juice p pm supper i catch fletch in the queue for the hotplate and he agrees to join me in my cell at seven miah murder is cutting my hair at seven i tell him so could we make it seven fifteen i cant afford to miss the appointment as im still hoping for a visit from my wife on thursday pm association i sit patiently in a chair on number landing waiting for miah he doesnt turn up on time to cut my hair so i return to my cell and wait for fletch he does arrive on time and takes a seat on the end of the bed he doesnt bother with any preamble you can include my piece in your book if you want to he says and if you do lets hope it does some good i tell him that if a national newspaper serializes the diary then his words will be read by millions of people and the politicians will have to finally stop pretending that it isnt happening or they will simply be guilty by association we begin to go through the script line by line filling in details such as names times and places so that the casual reader can properly follow the sequence of events tony marijuana only joins us a few minutes later it turns out that hes the only other person to have read the piece and it also becomes clear that it was on his advice that fletch decided not only to write about his experiences but to allow a wider audience to read them theres a knock on the door its miah murder he apologizes about missing his appointment to cut my hair but hes only just finished his spell on the hotplate he explains that he cant fit me in tomorrow because of his work schedule but he could cut my hair during association on wednesday i warn him that if he fails to keep the appointment on wednesday ill kill him as my wife is coming to visit me on thursday and i must look my best miah laughs bows and leaves us ill kill him i said it without thinking and to a convicted murderer miah is ft in and i doubt if he weighs ten stone the man he murdered was ft in and weighed pounds strange world im living in fletch tony and i continue to go over the script and when weve completed the task fletch stands up and shakes me by the hand to show the deal has been agreed pm for the next two hours i transcribe out fletchs words adding to the script only when he has given me specific details background or names by the time ive completed the last sentence im even more angry than i was when he read the piece to me last night pm i lie awake in my thin hard prison bed my head resting on my thinner harder prison pillow and wonder how decent normal people will react to fletchs story for here is a man of whom any one of us might say there but for the grace of god go i these are the words of the prisoner known as fletch murder life imprisonment minimum sentence twentytwo years my name is ftnref i presented fletchs original script to my publisher in full names and places have been necessarily omitted from the final text i am thirtyeight years old and serving a life sentence for a murder i did not commit but i only wish i had my whole life has been a fuckup from the start i was born in morriston in wales and although i loved my family i have only had six real relationships in my life or as real as i felt they could be the sort of relationship you want to rush home to and regret leaving in the morning when you return to work i met my wife when i was seventeen and even today would happily die for her we had a twentyyear relationship though both of us had other lovers during that time of the six relationships ive had two have been with men which is where the complication begins because of years of sexual abuse i suffered during my childhood i have never really enjoyed sex whether it be with a man or a woman even today i detest sexual contact and accept that it is what has caused the breakup of my relationships i was always able to perform and perform it was but in truth it was nothing more than a chore and i gained no gratification from it i never felt able to tell my wife the truth about my past despite the twenty years wed shared together its so easy to claim youve been abused and shift the blame onto someone else its so easy to claim you couldnt prevent it and its also virtually impossible to prove it the truth is that i had no idea that what i was experiencing wasnt the norm wasnt every child going through this my childhood ended at the age of nine when i was sent to a home overnight i became a plaything for those who were employed to care for me those in power they even managed to secure a place of safety order from a court so i couldnt be moved and they could carry on abusing me during the s corporal punishment was common in childrens homes for some of the staff it was simply the way they got their kicks first they caned little boys until they screamed and then they buggered us until we were senseless not until then did they stop nine other children from that home can confirm this statement two are married with children of their own two are gay five are in jail two of the five in jail are serving life sentences for murder after a time the abuse becomes a form of love and affection because if you didnt want to be caned or belted with a strap you give in and quickly accept the alternative sexual abuse by the age of twelve i knew more about perversion and violence than any one of you reading this have ever read about or even seen in films let alone experienced by the age of twelve i had been abused by the staff at my home in local social workers care staff and a probation officer all of these professions attract paedophiles and although they are in the minority they are well aware of each other and they network together and most frightening of all they protect each other i know a child who was articulate enough by the age of fourteen to tell the authorities what he was being put through so they just moved him around the country from home to home before anyone could begin an investigation while other paedophiles carried on abusing him at the age of thirteen i ran away and made my way towhen i reached i began sleeping rough in it was there that i first met a man called who offered me somewhere to sleep that night he got me drunk not too difficult when youre only thirteen he raped me and after that began renting me out to likeminded men whenever you read in the tabloid press about rent boys for sale dont assume that they do it by choice or even that theyre paid they are often locked up and controlled like any other prostitute and have little or no say in what happens to their life controlled me for about six months bringing to the flat judges schoolmasters police officers politicians and other upstanding citizens who are the backbone of our country i can tell you of birthmarks wounds and peculiarities for almost every one of these men one night in the west end when i was still thirteen i was arrested by the police while was trying to sell me to a customer i was collected from the nick by a social worker who took me to a childrens home in the home was run by a magistrate for the next fourteen days he buggered me night and day before issuing a court order that i should be returned to my original childrens home where it was back to caning and systematic abuse after a couple of months i was transferred to a hospital for emotionally disturbed children once again the staff abused me and this time they had a more effective weapon than caning they threatened to apply est electric shock treatment should i try to resist i ran away again returning to and have lived there ever since i was only fourteen at the time and soon caught up with me this time he installed me in the flat of a friend where seven or eight men would bugger me on a daily basis one or two liked to whip me with a belt while others punched me this could be before during or after having sex when they eventually stopped they occasionally left a small present money or gift on my pillow this wasnt much use because i never got out of the flat unless i was accompanied by by the age of fifteen i was sniffing glue regularly getting drunk and having sex with countless men but it didnt hurt any more i felt nothing it was all just part of my daily life this life if thats what you can call it continued for another four years during which time i was photographed for porn magazines and appeared in porn films by the age of eighteen i no longer served any purpose for these men so i was thrown out onto the street and left to fend for myself that was when i committed my first crime burglary of a department store lillywhites i was arrested and sent to borstal for six months when i was released i continued with a life of crime i wasnt exactly trained for anything else by now i was six foot one and weighed pounds so didnt find it difficult to get a job in security which is so often on the fringes of crime in at the age of eighteen i met my future wife who had no idea what my real job was or that for twelve years i had been sexually abused during the next five years we had two sons and twelve years later in we decided to get married i was already earning a good living as a criminal and everything went well until i was arrested in for dss fraud i had been making false claims in several names for several years to the tune of million for which i received a three year sentence which caused my marriage to be put off during my time in jail i began by letter and telephone to let my wife know that i had for sometime been involved in a life of crime but it wasnt until i was released that i revealed to her any details of the sexual abuse i had been put through her reaction was immediate and hostile she was disgusted and reviled and said she couldnt understand why i hadnt reported these men to the authorities what authorities were there for me to report to i was only nine years old when it all began after all it was the authorities who were buggering me i told her and by the age of eighteen when i was no longer of any use to them they threw me out onto the streets she couldnt come to terms with it so i was rejected once again and this time it was by someone i cared for which made it far worse she described me as a filthy person who allowed dirty old men to rape me because i wanted love and affection there was no way i could begin to make her understand by being open and honest i had lost the one person i truly loved my life had been ruined by these evil men and now they had even robbed me of my wife and two children all i now wanted was to kill the five monsters who were responsible and then die in the hands of the police there were five paedophiles who had taken away my life so i planned to take away theirs i quickly discovered that two of them had already died so there were only three left for me to deal with their names were and i carefully planned how i would kill them and then later die in the hands of the police i drove down toand kidnapped and brought him back to leaving him at my flat with three friends who agreed to guard him while i returned to the coast to pick up i then planned to go ontoand collect and bring them both back to i arrived back inat onethirty in the afternoon when s next door neighbour told me that i had just missed him i phonedto warn them that i would be late because i couldnt risk grabbing him in broad daylight it was then that they told me the news they had already killed i was enraged ive always been a cold person emotionally but i cried on the journey back to london because i had wanted to kill myself i had needed to cleanse myself of these three evil men and all i had now was a dead body on my hands and three terrified associates i drove back to breaking the speed limit most of the way on arrival i cleaned all the fingerprints from my flat and told the others that i would deal with and in my own way that was when the police burst in twentyfour armed officers pinned the three of us to the ground handcuffed and arrested me i discovered later that had already phoned the police and told them he feared for his life i gave my solicitor all the details and he said that because i was in hastings at the time of s death they wouldnt charge me with murder but they could charge me with conspiracy to murder they charged me with murder and i was sentenced to a minimum of twentytwo years yes i am doing a twentytwo year sentence for a crime i didnt commit i only wish i had and i also wish i had killed and at the same time i am now a listener at belmarsh and feel useful for the first time in my life i know ive saved one life and hopefully helped many others my demons still haunt me of course they do but i somehow keep them at bay i wont complete my twentytwo year sentence but i will choose the time and manner of my death ftnref fletch subsequently attempted to commit suicide on january its only shame that prevents me from contacting anyone i know a feeling of worthlessness a dirty little rent boy that allowed older men to use beat and abuse him because he needed to be loved and no longer cared what happened to him how can i ever expect my wife my children or my family to understand i hope by telling this story i may save someone else from the horror ive been put through so that that person will never be visited by the same demons and worse will not end up in jail on a charge of murder pm i go to bed asking myself should the man known as fletch have to spend the rest of his life in jail if the answer is yes dont we perhaps have some responsibility to the next generation to ensure that there arent other children whose lives will end by the age of nine day tuesday august am i have a better nights sleep perhaps fletchs allowing his story to be committed to paper has helped i write for two hours am breakfast frosties and the last dribble from the second carton of longlife milk not quite enough left to soak my cereal canteen provisions due in today and as im leaving on thursday i will be able to repay all my bubbles del boy water and biscuits tony mars bar and colin stamps twelve firstclass am association i am strolling around the ground floor when i notice that one of the prisoners joseph murder is playing pool hes by far the best player on the spur and occasionally clears the table this morning hes missing simple shots that even i would sink i lean against the wall and watch him more carefully he has that distant look on his face so common among lifers when the match is over and the cues have been passed on to waiting inmates i comment on his standard of play i think the word i select is rubbish ive got something on my mind jeff he says still distant anything i can help with i ask no thanks its a family matter am i see that my name is chalked up on the board for a legal visit from my solicitor tony mortonhooper over the years i have found that professional relationships fall into two categories the ones that remain professional and the ones when you become friends tony falls firmly into the second category we have a mutual love of athletics he has represented many track stars over the years and despite a considerable age difference we relax in each others company we meet up in one of those small rooms where i come in from one side and am locked in and moments later he enters by a door on the opposite side and is also locked in the first thing i notice is that tony is wearing a thick yellow rubber band around his wrist it will allow him to eventually escape but for the next hour he is also incarcerated tony begins by telling me that wayland prison is certain to be a far more relaxed regime than belmarsh and as good a place as any to be until i am reinstated as a category d prisoner i ask tony what the latest is on that subject its all good news he tells me the media have worked out that you have nothing to answer and weve been through your files and they show the matter was raised in parliament in when lynda chalker was overseas development minister and she gave a robust reply she also wrote you a long letter on the subject at the time he slides both the letter and the parliamentary reply across the table was ms nicholson an mp then i ask she most certainly was says tony and more importantly a full investigation was carried out by the foreign office so were sending all the relevant papers to the police and pointing out that a second inquiry would be an irresponsible waste of public money so can i sue her for libel i ask not yet he replies i talked to the police yesterday and although they will not release a copy of the letter she sent to them they made it clear that the accusations were such that they had no choice but to follow them up if we issue a writ will she have to release that letter yes it would automatically become part of the evidence then we must have grounds to sue her not yet tony repeats lets wait for the police to drop their inquiry before we take any further action and that could be quite soon as radio s today programme have been in touch with mary their research team are also convinced that you have no case to answer and they want her to appear on the programme of course they do i say because all theyll want to talk to her about is my appeal as long as she doesnt discuss the case while an appeal is pending im in favour of her doing the interview she could of course quote from lynda chalkers letter and the parliamentary reply i suggest why not says tony but lets proceed slowly step by step not something im good at i admit i prefer proceeding quickly leap by leap tony then removes some papers from his briefcase and tells me that the appeal will be officially lodged tomorrow i have to sign an agreement to appeal against sentence and another against conviction tony would give me a fiftyfifty chance of having the verdict overturned if it were not for the archer factor if you werent involved it would be thrown out without a second thought there wouldnt even have been a trial in the first place he puts the odds even higher on getting the sentence reduced mr justice pottss comment that mine was the worst example of perjury he had ever known has been greeted by the legal profession with raised eyebrows ftnref f since the court case dr susan edwards associate dean of buckingham law school has researched every perjury case during the last ten years we then turn to the subject of the prison diary of which i have now completed fifty thousand words and i warn him that its going to come as a shock to most of my regular readers he asks how im getting the script through to alison remembering this is the tightestsecurity prison in europe i remind him that i am still receiving two to three hundred letters a day and the censors allow me to turn them round and send them back to my office the following morning so another ten handwritten pages arent causing the censor any concern which reminds me i continue could you ask james to wear a cheap watch the next time he visits me and then i can exchange my longines i hadnt for a moment imagined i would end up in prison so i was wearing my favourite watch on the day of the verdict and after twenty years id be sorry if it was stolen james has hankered after it for some time and has already asked me to leave it to him in my will mercenary brat will can have the rest of the estate as long as i can have the watch james insists longines have stopped making that particular slim model nevertheless william had agreed to the deal as he considers the overall arrangement very satisfactory i think youd better wait until youve left belmarsh before you start swapping watches advises tony and then only when you can be sure that the regulations are a little more relaxed we complete all legal matters and as he cant escape until the hour is up we turn our thoughts to the world athletics championships in edmonton where i had hoped to be spending my summer holiday with michael beloff ftnref michael beloff qc is an olympic judge and is allowed to take a guest to the world championships his wife judith has never shown much interest in watching halfnaked men running around a track so weve been a regular item at such events for the past thirty yearson the circuit were known as jack lemmon and walter matthau tony tells me the fantastic news that jonathan edwards has taken the gold in the triple jump he won easily tony adds clearing nearly eighteen metres hes so relaxed since his gold in sydney that i doubt if he will be beaten before the next olympics at athens in and even mr justice potts wont be able to stop you being there to witness that when the prison officer returns to open the door on tonys side of the room i leave him in no doubt that the number one priority is sorting out the kurdish debacle so that my dcat can be reinstated as quickly as possible i also add that i do not require any lawyers to travel to norfolk at vast expense they can relay messages through mary whos as bright as any of them tony smiles agrees and shakes hands he has the hands of a heavyweight boxer and i suspect hed survive well in prison they release him but as i dont have a yellow band around my wrist i slump back into the seat on the other side of the table and wait noon in the lunch queue always a great place to catch up on the gossip fletch briefs me on josephs problem i now understand why he couldnt pot a ball on the pool table this morning when i reach the hotplate tony recommends the spaghetti vegetarian which is disguised to look like bolognaise au gratin i suggest of course my lord liam fetch his lordship the grated parmesan a small plastic packet of grated cheese is produced from under the hotplate opened in front of the duty officer and sprinkled over my spaghetti this is greeted with a huge round of applause from the prisoners and laughter from the officers in a lifers day this is an event back in my cell i enjoy the dish but then it is my twentieth day on prison rations ive been able to take another notch in on my belt so i reckon ive lost about half a stone pm when the cell door is opened again i dash down to the middle level already dressed in my gym kit and keep running on the spot by the barred gate this time i am ticked off the select list of eight from our spur after a search followed by a route march to another part of the building ive never been to before we arrive in a changing room where we are all supplied with a light blue singlet and dark blue shorts this i assume is just in case any prisoner has spent time at both oxford and cambridge the gym is divided into two sections the larger room is the size of a basketball court where twelve of the prisoners play sixaside football we currently have one former arsenal and brentford player residing at belmarsh there is also a weightlifting room about a third of the size of the basketball court where fortyseven sweaty tattooed rippling muscled youths pump iron so that when they get out of here they will be even more capable of causing grievous bodily harm the room is so packed that you cant move more than a few feet without bumping into someone there are two running machines two rowing machines and two step machines in which the younger prisoners show scant interest i do a sixminute warmup on the running machine at five miles an hour which affords me an excellent view of whats going on in the centre of the room the fortyseven fit young men are pumping weights not a pretty sight especially as most of them are simply on an ego trip to establish their status among the other prisoners on the block i wonder how many of them have worked out that fletch tony billy and del boy carry the most influence on our spur and not one of them would be able to locate the gym once ive completed metres on the rower in nine minutes i move on to some light weighttraining before doing another ten minutes on the running machine at eight miles an hour while im running i begin to notice that many of the lifers have a poor posture their backs are not straight and they swing their shoulders when lifting heavy weights rather than use their arm muscles properly the two officers in charge cant do much more than keep an eye on whats going on in both rooms it would be far more sensible to have three sessions of gym each day with fewer bodies present then the coach would be able to fulfil a more worthwhile role than just acting as a babysitter i put this suggestion to one of the officers and once again they fall back on staff shortages after ten minutes on the running machine i return to the weights before ending on the step machine when the officer bellows out last five minutes i move on to stretching exercises and complete in one hour exactly the same programme as i would have gone through in the basement gym of my london flat the only difference is that there there wouldnt be a murderer in sight back in the changing room i feel ive done well until dennis former arsenal and brentford player joins me and reports that hes scored six goals i congratulate him and ask him if its true that hes been selected to captain belmarsh for the annual fixture against holloway this brings far more laughter and cheers than it deserves although half the prisoners immediately volunteer to play in goal no thank you says dennis ive got enough women problems as it is but you told me that youd had a good visit on sunday when your wife and child came to see you one of my wives corrects dennis and one of my children how many others do you have i ask three of both he admits but thats bigamy i say or possibly trigamy get a life jeff im not married to any of them there are no fathers hanging around with shotguns nowadays theyre all partners not wives like a company chairman i have several shareholders thank god im banged up in here at the moment he adds because if they called an agm i wouldnt want to have to explain why they wont be getting a dividend this year its clear that none of the other prisoners listening to this conversation consider it at all unusual let alone reprehensible heaven knows what britain will be like in fifty years time if everyone has three wives but doesnt bother to actually marry any of them when i return to my cell i find my canteen order waiting for me on the bed i drink mug after mug of water followed by two kitkats before going off to have a shower pm association my first assignment is to return a bottle of water to del boy highland spring before searching out tony to hand over a mars bar followed by colin twelve firstclass stamps having cleared my debts bubbles no one charges me double bubble i join the other prisoners seated around the television theyre watching the world athletics championships an officer called mr hughes brings me up to date on progress so far after the first day of the decathlon macey is leading by one point and is preparing for his heat in the metre hurdles which is the first event of the second day i tell mr hughes that edmonton was where i had originally planned to spend my summer holiday i see that there are a lot of empty seats in the stands says mr hughes but i find it hard to believe that theyre all now in prison just as macey goes to his blocks i spot joseph standing in the corner a man who prefers the centre of the room i leave the world athletics championships for a moment to join him any news of your son i ask no he looks surprised that ive found out about his problem ive phoned his mother who says that hes under arrest and shes trying to get in touch with the british consul theyve got him banged up in a local jail what are prisons like in cyprus he asks ive no idea i tell him until they sent me to belmarsh i didnt know what they were like in england just be thankful its not turkey whats he been charged with nothing they found him asleep in a house where some locals had been smoking cannabis but theyve warned him he could end up with a sevenyear sentence not if he was asleep surely i suggest how old is he eighteen and what makes it worse while im stuck in here i cant do anything about it my wife says shell phone the governor the moment she hears anything good luck i say and return to the athletics mr hughes tells me i missed macey he came second in his heat in a new personal best you cant ask for more than a pb from any athlete says roger black the bbc commentator and adds stay with us because its going to be an exciting day here in edmonton lockup shouts the officer behind the desk at the other end of the room i politely point out to the officer that roger black has told us we must stay with him mr black is there and im here comes back the immediate reply so its lockup archer pm supper i am now in possession of two tins of princes ham p so i take one down to the hotplate to have it opened tony adds two carefully selected potatoes which makes a veritable feast when accompanied by a mug of blackcurrant juice after supper i return to work on my script when suddenly the door is opened by an officer i have never seen before good evening he says i know youll be off soon so i wonder if youd be kind enough to sign this book for my wife the bookshop told me that it was your latest i would be happy to do so i tell him but its not mine its been written by geoffrey archer i spell my name with a j its a problem weve both had for years he looks a little surprised and then says ill take it back and get it changed see you at the same time tomorrow once ive finished todays script i read three letters alison has handed over to tony mortonhooper one of them is from victoria barnsley the chairman of my publisher harpercollins saying that she is looking forward to reading in the lap of the gods and goes on to let me know that adrian bourne who has taken care of me since eddie bell the former chairman left the company will be taking early retirement ill miss them both as they have played such an important role in my publishing career the second letter is from my young researcher johann hari to tell me that hes nearly ready to go over his notes for in the lap of the gods ftnref the novel has since been renamed sons of fortune though he points out that he still prefers the original title serendipity the last letter is from stephan shakespeare who was my chief of staff when i stood as conservative candidate for mayor of london his loyalty since the day i resigned brings to mind that wonderful poem by kipling the thousandth man among the many views stephan expresses with confidence is that iain duncan smith will win the election for leader of the conservative party by a mile we wont have to wait much longer to find out if hes right day wednesday august am this will be my last full day at belmarsh i mustnt make it too obvious otherwise the press will be waiting outside the gate and then accompany us all the way to norfolk i sit down at my desk and write for two hours am breakfast shreddies uht milk and an apple i empty the box of shreddies just enough for two helpings am i am standing in my gym kit ready for my final session when ms williamson unlocks my cell door and asks if im prepared to do another creativewriting class when do you have it planned for i ask not wanting her to know that this is my last day and ive somehow managed to get myself on the gym rota she looks at her watch in about half an hour she replies i curse under my breath change out of my gym kit into slacks and a rather becoming tiger tshirt which will packed for me the day i was sentenced on my way to the classroom i pass joseph at the pool table hes potting everything in sight and looking rather pleased with himself any more news about justin i enquire he smiles theyve deported him he glances at his watch he should be landing at heathrow in about an hour he pots a red his mother will be there to meet him and ive told her to give him a good clip round the ear he sinks a yellow she wont of course he adds with a grin thats good news i tell him and continue my unescorted journey to the classroom when i arrive i find mr anders the visiting teacher waiting for me he looks a bit put out so i immediately ask him how he would like to play it had you anything planned he asks nothing in particular i tell him last week we agreed that the group would bring in something they had written to read to the class and then we would all discuss it but not if you had anything else in mind no no that sounds fine this week nine prisoners and three members of staff turn up four of them have remembered to bring along some written work colin reads his critique of frank mccourts latest book tony takes us through his essay on prison reform which is part of the syllabus for ruskin college oxford terry reads a chapter of his novel and we end with billys piece on his reaction to hearing that hed been sentenced to life and his innermost thoughts during the hours that followed i chose billys work to end on because as before it was in a different class to any other contribution i end the session with a few words about the discipline of writing aware that i would not be with them this time tomorrow im confident that at least three of the group will continue with their projects after ive departed and that in time billys efforts will be published i will be the first in the queue for a signed copy on the way back to my cell i bump into liam who when hes on the hotplate always tries to slip me a second icecream he thrusts out his hand and says i just wanted to say goodbye i turn red ive not said a word to anybody following my meeting with mr leader so how has liam found out who told you i asked the police he replied theyve agreed to bail so im being released this morning my solicitor says that probably means that they are going to drop all the charges im delighted i tell him but how long have you been in jail three and a half months three and a half months liam has been locked up in belmarsh waiting to find out that the police are probably going to drop all the charges i wish him well before he moves on to shake another wellwisher by the hand what was he charged with perverting the course of justice a taped phone conversation was the main evidence which the court has now ruled inadmissible once im back on the spur i phone alison to let her know that ten more days of the diary are on their way she tells me that the letters are still pouring in and shell forward on to wayland those from close friends i then warn her im running out of writing pads could she send a dozen on to wayland along with a couple of boxes of felttip pens interesting how i use the word dozen without thinking despite the fact that decimalization has been with us for over thirty years in another thirty years will my grandchildren take the euro for granted and wonder what all the fuss was about noon lunch egg and beans my favourite prison food but this time i only get one egg because theres an officer sitting where paul is usually placed however tony still manages a few extra beans pm i begin writing again only to be interrupted by three officers marching into my cell mr weedon accompanied by mr abbott and mr cook who are ominously wearing rubber gloves mr weedon explains that this is a cell search known by prisoners as a spin and for obvious reasons it has to be carried out without any warning what are you searching for i ask guns knives razor blades drugs and anything that is against prison regulations i am the supervising officer says mr weedon because mr cook and mr abbott are being tested for the national vocational qualification and this search is part of that test we will start with a stripsearch he says keeping a straight face i stand in the middle of my tiny cell and remove my tiger tshirt i then hold my hands high in the air before being asked to turn a complete circle mr abbott then tells me to rub my hands vigorously through my hair which i do hidden drugs just in case you havent worked it out this completed i am allowed to put my tshirt back on mr cook then asks me to take off my shoes socks trousers and pants all of which are carefully examined by the two junior officers wearing rubber gloves once again i am asked to turn a full circle before they invite me to lift the soles of my feet so they can check if im wearing any plasters that might be concealing drugs there are no plasters so they tell me to get dressed i will now accompany you to a waiting room while your cell is being searched mr weedon says but first i must ask if you are in possession of anything that belongs to another prisoner such as guns knives or drugs yes i have an essay written by tony croft and a poem by billy little i rummage around in a drawer and hand them over they look quickly through them before passing them back i am also in possession of a library book i say trying not to smirk they try hard not to rise but they still turn the pages and shake the book about drugs or money this time i see its due back today archer so make sure you return it by lockup because we wouldnt want you to be fined would we mr weedon scores a point how kind of you to forewarn me i say before we can begin a thorough search of your cell continues mr abbott i have to ask are you in possession of any legal papers that you do not wish us to read no i reply thank you says mr weedon that completes this part of the exercise your cell will now be searched by two other officers i was told later that this is done simply for their selfprotection so that should they come across anything illegal with four officers involved two sets of two it becomes a lot more difficult for a prisoner to claim its a setup guv and that whatever was found had been planted burglars i hear shouted by someone at the top of their voice sounding as if it had come from a nearby cell i look a little surprised that the officers dont all disappear at speed mr weedon smiles thats us he says weve been spotted and its just another prisoner warning his mates that were out on one of our searching expeditions so theyll have enough time to dispose of anything incriminating youll hear several toilets being flushed during the next few minutes and see a few packages being thrown out of the window mr abbott and mr cook leave me to be replaced by ms taylor and ms lynn who begin to search my cell mr weedon escorts me to the waiting room on the other side of the spur and locks me in bored i stroll over to the window on the far side of the room and look down on a wellkept garden a dozen or so prisoners are planting cutting and weeding for a pound an hour the inmates are all wearing yellow dayglo jackets while the one supervisor is dressed casually in blue jeans and an opennecked shirt its a neat wellkept garden but then so would anyones be if they had a dozen gardeners at a pound an hour i am amused to see that one of the prisoners is clipping a hedge with a large pair of shears quite the most lethal weapon ive seen since arriving at belmarsh i do hope they search his cell regularly twenty minutes later im let out and escorted back to cell all my clothes are in neat piles my wastepaper bin emptied and i have never seen my cell looking so tidy however the officers have removed my second pillow and the lavatory bleach that del boy had so thoughtfully supplied on my first day on block one ftnref bleaching powder can be added to pure heroin diluting its strength thus ensuring a larger profit for the dealer its against regulations to have two pillows pm supper i take down my second tin of ham p to be opened by a helper on the hotplate tony adds two potatoes and a spoonful of peas not all of them stuck together after ive eaten dinner i wash my plastic dishes before returning downstairs to join my fellow inmates for association i decide to tell only fletch tony and billy that ill be leaving in the morning fletch said that he was aware of my imminent departure but didnt realize it was that imminent sitting in his cell along with the others feels not unlike the last day of term at school when having packed your trunk you hang around in the dorm wondering how many of your contemporaries you will keep in touch with fletch tells us that hes just spent an hour with ms roberts and has decided to appeal against both his sentence and verdict i am delighted but cant help wondering if it will affect his decision to allow the contents of the little green book to be published on the contrary he says i want the whole world to know who these evil people are and what theyve done but what if they ask you to name the judges the schoolmasters the policemen and the politician then i shall name them he says and what about the other ten children who were put through the same trauma how do you expect them to react tony asks after all they must now all be in their late thirties fletch pulls out a file from his shelf and removes a sheet of paper with ten names typed in a single column during the next few weeks i intend to write to everyone named on this list and ask if they are willing to be interviewed by my solicitor a couple are married and may not even have told their wives or family one or two will not be that easy to track down but im confident that several of them will back me up and want the truth to be known what about and i shall name them in court fletch says firmly of course is dead but and are very much alive tony starts to applaud while billy not given to showing much outward sign of emotion nods vigorously lockup hollers someone from the front desk i shake hands with three men who i had no idea i would meet a month ago and wonder if i will ever see again ftnref i have already decided once im released i will visit billy more years and fletch more years if they will allow me to i return to my cell when i reach the top floor i find mr weedon standing by my door when you get out of here he says be sure you write it as it is tell them about the problems both sides are facing the inmates and the officers and dont pull your punches im surprised by the passion in his voice but let me tell you something you cant have picked up in the three weeks youve spent with us the turnover of prison staff is now the services biggest problem and its not just because of property prices in london last week i lost a firstclass officer who left to take up a job as a tube driver same pay but far less hassle was the reason he gave good luck sir he says and locks me in pm i begin to prepare for my imminent departure fletch has already warned me that there will be no official warning just a knock on my cell door around sixthirty and a youre on the move archer so have your things ready theres only one thing i can guarantee he adds once youve been down to the reception area you will be kept hanging around for at least another hour while an officer completes the paperwork pm i read through the latest pile of letters including ones from mary will and another from geordie greig the editor of tatler who ends with the words theres a table booked for lunch at le caprice just as soon as youre out no fairweather friend he i then check over the days script and decide on an early night pm i turn out the light on belmarsh for the last time day thursday august am i wake from a restless sleep aware that i could be called at any time i decide to get up and write for a couple of hours am i check my watch its six fortythree and theres still no sign of life out there in the silent dark corridors so i make myself some breakfast sugar puffs the last selection in my variety pack longlife milk and an orange am i shave wash and get dressed after some pacing around my fivebythree cell i begin to pack when i say pack i must qualify that because you are not allowed a suitcase or a holdall everything has to be deposited into one of hm prisons plastic bags am ive finished packing but there is still no sign of anyone stirring has my transfer been postponed cancelled even am i to remain at belmarsh for the rest of my life i count every minute as i pace up and down waiting to make my official escape what must it be like waiting to be hanged am i empty the last drop of my uht milk into a plastic mug eat a mcvities biscuit and begin to wonder if there is anyone out there i reread marys and wills letters they cheer me up am my cell door is at last opened by a mr knowles good morning he says cheerfully well be moving you just as soon as weve got all the remand prisoners off to the bailey he checks his watch so ill be back around if youd like to take a shower or if theres anything else you need to do ill leave your door open forgive the cliché but i breathe a sigh of relief to have it confirmed that i really am leaving i take a shower ive now mastered the palm press soap palm press method during the next hour several prisoners drop by to say farewell as the news spreads around the spur that im departing del boy relieves me of my last bottle of water saying he could get used to it once hes left i suggest to an officer that i would like to give my radio to one of the prisoners who never gets a visit the officer tells me that its against the regulations to give something to someone in need is against the regulations i query yes he replies you may be trying to bribe him or repay him for a supply of drugs if you were seen giving a radio to another prisoner you would immediately be put on report and your sentence might even be lengthened by twentyeight days my problem is that i just dont think like a criminal i wait until the officer is out of sight then nip downstairs and leave the radio and a few other goodies on fletchs bed hell know whose needs are the greatest am mr knowles returns to escort me to the reception area where i first appeared just three long weeks ago i am placed in a cubicle and stripsearched just as i was on the day i arrived once ive put my clothes back on they handcuff me only for the second time and then lead me out of the building and into what i would describe as a transit van down the lefthand side are four single seats one behind each other on the righthand side is a cubicle in which the prisoner is placed like some untamed lion once im locked in i stare out of the little window for some time until without any warning the vast electric barred gates slide slowly open as the black transit van trundles out of belmarsh i have mixed feelings although i am delighted and relieved to be leaving im also anxious and nervous about being cast into another world having to start anew and form fresh relationships all over again it has taken me three weeks to pass through hell am i about to arrive in purgatory jeffrey archer
