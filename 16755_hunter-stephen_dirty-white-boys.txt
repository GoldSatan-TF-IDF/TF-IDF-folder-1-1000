dirty white boys by stephen hunter norman mailers introduction to in the belly of the beast by jack henry abbott no one knows what its like to be the bad man peter townsend behind blue eyes chapter three men at mcalester state penitentiary had larger penises than lamar pye but all were black and therefore by lamars own figuring hardly human at all his was the largest penis ever seen on a white man in that prison or any of the others in which lamar had spent so much of his adult life it was a monster a snake a ropey veiny thing that hardly looked at all like what it was but rather like some form of rubber tubing therefore he was number one on the fag hit parade but the fags knew to stay away and could only dream of him in private lamar wasnt a fag although when the spirit moved him he was a butt fucker he wasnt a boss cons fuck boy either or a punk or a bitch or a mary or a snitch and he carried a simple message in the graceful economy of his movements to fuck with me is to fuck with death itself it helped of course that he was also protected by daddy cool the bulletpocked biker king who ran the macs dirty white boys with daddys special mojo protecting him and his own reputation as a mankiller almost nobody con or guard alike messed with him and it helped that his hulking cousin odell stood ready to back him up on the dime if it went down hard but mainly it was just lamar and his attitude he was the prince of the dirty white boys it was four oclock in the afternoon on a day like any other in the institutions melancholy history as oklahomas toughest prison in the guard quarters through two levels of security off the d corridor lamar turned on the shower and let the water hit him its blast struck his bulging muscles washed the sweat away this was his favorite moment of the day and as a ranking lifer he had earned the right to a private second or two in the hacks shower before lockup it meant as much to him as a million dollars in the bank and he knew hed never have a million dollars in the bank what he had was a nice fresh bar of dial soap which hed just unwrapped none of that green liquid disinfectant soap the regular cons used in their showers lamar pye was thirtyeight years old with a tangle of thick hair which he generally wore braided down his back or in a ponytail though he had an open friendly face and warm eyes showing over a nose that had seen much wear he also had fuck and you inscribed across the knuckles of his left and right fists and born to kick ass on his left forearm all in the spidery and uncertain blue ink of a freehand convict tattoo artist on his right forearm in the same wobbly line was a pictograph of a dagger jammed halfway to its hilt into the flesh a stream of red droplets wiggled out of it on his left wrist it said shadow of death under a crude but unmistakably effective rendering of a skull on the top of his right hand it said white greased lightning with a rattailed squiggle in fading blue indicating a lightning bolt lamar couldnt even remember getting that one he must have been drunk or high or something he just woke up one goddamned day during a twoyear slide for assault with intent up at crabtree state in helena and there it was craziest damn thing the water felt so good when it blasted against the swollen bulges of his muscles with the contrast between the hissing steam and the sense of cooling two hundred curls with the seventyfivepound bar two hundred squat thrusts with the twohundredpound bar on his shoulders a long goddamned time under the chest machine hoisting two hundred pounds of dead weight until he was swollen like a tire on a hot day when the water hit his muscles and deflated him man that felt so cool lamar contemplated his chest in the hissing steam looking downward he saw an endless field of possibility his chest was wide and white and not particularly hairy it was wide open you could put anything on it you wanted it was richard whod got his head turned in this direction newboy richard was so scared of them he hadnt said a thing for a week and lamar at first wanted just to torture him for a while before he fucked him and sold him to rodney smallss niggers for cigarettes but goddamn richard was so weak it wouldnt have meant a thing all richard would do was sit there with a pencil and some kind of tablet his hand flying over the surface of the paper as if by concentrating so hard he could make it all go away or read funny little books with no pictures underlining things furiously though he clung to lamars shadow like a dog whenever lamar went into the yard finally lamar had said goddamn you boy what is that shit youre working at addressed directly richard had seemed to melt his puffy face trembled as the color fled his cheeks he quivered like a leaf in a high breeze then he said art art who lamar demanded art art said richard you know art pictures what the imagination can show fuck all that shit said lamar now he really wanted to hurt richard he hated when somebody threw a word at him magination fuck that but weirdly curious he bent over and looked at what richard had been diddling goddamn it was lamar it was lamar himself fearsome as a lion scared of no man looking like some kind of ancient king or viking under a frosty moon lamar with a mighty sword ready to slay enemies by the thousands the whole thing had a spooky feel to it some kind of magic or something somewhere inside lamar felt a little thing move the fuck he said that aint the way it is im a hard timer goddamned inmate butt fucker i aint no goddamned hero ii just drew what my mind saw said richard please dont hurt me ah said lamar stumped he went back to his penthouse yet the image had somehow jiggered something in lamar it troubled his dreams bumping aside for a while the strokebook blondes who gave their rosy asses to him every night until he came and could relax not that night and the next day he wanted richard to show it to him and the next and the next he thought about it for nearly another week and then he started dreaming about it you know that there picture yes said richard could you do another one from what i told you you wouldnt have to see it or nothing i could just fucking tell you you could make it er yes i suppose i mean of course hmm said lamar thinking hard you know what i truly like is lions but a lion not in no jungle but in a castle you know and a bitch blond with really big tits and somehow she love the lion she love him like a man not like no pet now i dont want no picture of the lion fucking her but the lion could fuck her if he wanted to ah i think i see what youre getting at hes like an archetype of a certain aggressive masculine power huh ah i mean hes a lion and hes got a bitch and she has tits and its all a long time ago got that yes sir richard got busy for days he huddled in the corner madly dashing away hed throw pictures away cursing he even went to the prison library and got books with lions in them and then finally lamar is this what you had in mind he held out a sketch the lion was a god the woman a slut with huge tits her nipples taut as bowstrings it was master she was slave goddamn said lamar lookathat man like you got that outta my head damn aint that a goddamn piece of work only now wouldnt it be better if the lion was taller and maybe the gals tits werent that big thats too big it dont look real i want it to be real i like the castle though richard took the criticism like a man and spent another week on revisions when he made his final submission lamar was quite pleased goddamn richard you got a gift if i do say so myself now say i wanted you to try other things you know other things i see in my head could you do it i know i could said richard goddamn aint that something i want you to draw what i tell you you do that ill look after you got it yes sir said richard and the deal was done why was it so satisfying he didnt know but it was and it was a newfound source of pleasure he could just dream something up and richard would make it appear on paper it really made him happy so lamar swelled a little with pleasure taking happiness from the pleasures of his wellordered world everybody feared him he could nick just about any of the white boys and half the niggers if he so chose he had a percentage of three dope smuggling operations including a methamphetamine lab in caddo county that pulled in a pound of crystal a week he had his cousin odell about as happy as that poor boy could ever be he had richard to draw whatsoever he chose he was a wealthy man but then ahead of him something moved in the vapor and it all changed it all went away lamar startled looked up nogoddamnedbody was supposed to be in here he paid harry funt the hack four cartons of cigarettes a week to make sure nobody disturbed him in his private time whos that goddammit barked lamar a huge dark shape emerged from the steam just as buck naked as lamar gleaming and globular goddamn junior aint nobody supposed to be in here i bought this goddamn time fair and square junior jefferson went close to four hundred pounds and naked his giant body seemed like something out of a movie especially the way he shone in the light he had a goddamned strange look in his eyes too lamar didnt like this at all his feral instincts came alert junior was a known rapist and child molester and perhaps the only man in d block who didnt fear lamar or his monster cousin odell you know the goddamn rules junior said lamar backing up just a bit its mine i paid for it paid harry funt its the goddamned rules rulesbe shit said junior and reached down and grabbed his cock to show lamar it was stiff as a bat and strangely blue git me some white pussy said junior git me some white boy asshole yas i am you fucking nigger you stay away we got a gang truce and you is over the limits your dumb motherfucker cousin odell he done dissed daddy cool and so daddy cool sold your ass to rodney smalls who done give it to me you gonna service the niggers for a month lamar knew in a second it was possible that odell that boy was born without a brain in his head it wasnt just the soft part of his mouth and lip that was missing but a goddamned part of his thinker too but if he dissed daddy there was no sense in disciplining him because he was too dumb to know pain from pleasure worse yet he had no ability to imagine fear so to punish odell would be pointless daddy must have decided to punish lamar in his place and lamar saw the terrible justice in it he was responsible for odell odell was family you got something wrong nigger i dont take it in the ass i give it in the ass but i dont never take it there junior said i asked for you special lamar cause you so pretty lamar had seen junior kill a bitch in d yard once just by squashing him against a wall a snitch the bitch deserved it still junior just rammed him against the wall capturing the bitchs face in his huge belly and sloppy saggy chest the bitch beat and chirped but it was over in two minutes thats how fast it could happen in the yard junior advanced on him like the earth itself set on swallowing him up lamar had no weapons his shank was in his shaving kit in the shitter he had no boots to kick with he was outweighed by a good two hundred pounds of meat and though strong was not near strong enough but he wasnt scared it was funny he never got scared he laughed a little bit he liked having his back to the wall and everything on the line it was exciting he paused gathering strength as the giant wobbled in arms spread fingers grasping just as junior closed he hit junior a powerful blow right above the heart his fuck fist driven forward like a steam piston and the blow sent the echo of meat pounding meat against the hiss of the showers he followed up with a you to the solar plexus but it didnt slow junior a goddamned bit he just butted lamar with his belly back against the wall and leaned on him drain you of air then when you half dead do you like a doggy then you be movin to my cell yes sir you gots a busy night ahead juniors rich laughter filled the air as his arms squished around lamar his immense bulk flattening lamars ribcage crushing his heart lamar felt his head bobbing like that of a dying fish flopping on the dock for the amusement of small boys with a ham hand junior grabbed hold of lamars hair and quieted the head and then beaming with pleasure bent to give his victim a little kiss deoxygenated lamar watched helplessly as the nigger lips gathered to form a dainty seal then felt a scream of helplessness erupt from his lungs which shocked junior a hair giving lamar a whisker of a chance his neck snapped upward unfolding almost like a turtles and in a second hed sunk his teeth into juniors nose he bit and bit almost choking on the blood and he couldnt hear junior scream but scream junior did pulling away his hands flying reflexively to the torn appendage lamar spit some gristle out bent in a flash and struck upward another piston stroke that landed in juniors balls crushing one testicle junior staggered seemed to lose it then flared up in rage just as lamar drilled him a savage fuck in the throat this time with a quarter fist so that his knuckles were sharp like a blade they roared through the flab covering juniors larynx but they reached that treasure and crushed it junior went down to his knees gasping he begged for mercy with his eyes but lamar was not into mercy he quickly flanked the giant and with another open hand drove fuck into the back of his neck junior jerked forward as if the blow had a charge of electricity with it and put up a weak arm to ward off more punches but lamar kept hitting him in the high spine and the neck a f u c k and then a y o u i using the heel of his palms so that he would break none of his own bones over and over and over until the big man lay still lamar stood up from his handiwork breathing hard his hands hurt he was shaking involuntarily the blood raced and thundered in his brain fuck with me see what it gets you he explained like a great beached whale junior somehow rolled over blood gushed from his mouth and nose horror showed in his eyes a great slob by arm came up as if to ward off any more blows from the smaller tougher man the water beat down the steam heaved red liquid lapped at juniors blackness dont hurt me no more he said please lamar stared at him you could pound on someone like junior for a year and maybe youd fuck him up but you wouldnt really kill him he took a lot of killing more killing maybe than lamar had in him oh god moaned junior you done hurt me bad git some help i cant hardly breathe none lamar felt next to nothing only problemhow to shut this fat nigger up then answer he reached into the soap dish and took the new bar of dial in his hand then quickly he knelt to junior i think you got something stuck in your mouth he said better open up and let me see obediently junior opened his mouth and quick as a snake lamar jammed the soap bar into it and with his strong thumbs forced it in deep juniors eyes bulged and he lifted a feeble hand toward his mouth but lamar slapped it away and shoved the soap still deeper forcing it down the throat trapped beneath it juniors tongue rolled and unrolled unusual sounds came from himulllccccchhhh ullguccchhhhhhuchand he began to buck on the wet floor of the shower the water cascaded onto them both junior struggled and struggled eyes wide noises wet and revolting farts and shit ripping out of his ass filling the shower with filth and stench as under his blackness his skin seemed to turn almost blue at last the big arm went limp and his head fell heavily to the left his eyes stared into nothingness he was still in his own shit lamar stood back get up you fat nigger he said i want to hurt you some more but juniors eyes had filled with water now how the fuck am i going to wash lamar wondered then he took a deep breath and realized he had to get out or either rodney smalls and the niggers or daddy cool would kill him before nightfall richard peed hated the last hour before lockup the worst of all in the yard he could hang close to lamar or odell and in that way be protected from the predators after lockup he could more or less keep the two pye boys at bay by seeming to go so limp and formless he wasnt there that passivity somehow made them uninterested in hurting him and now that hed reached some kind of provisional deal with lamar about the drawings he felt hed made a real step forward toward survival for the three months that he was destined to spend in the mac before the deal clicked in and he was removed to the minimum security joint called el reno federal correctional facility twenty miles west of oklahoma city but at four lamar went to the guards shower after working out for two hours and odell went back of the kitchens to feed his cats richard had at least an hour of vulnerable solitude to survive he had taken to going to the cell and sitting as still as he could in the shadows thinking about this painter or that anything just to get through it he was always scared he knew he was food really thats all he was food a weak white man with no criminal skills no natural cunning no weapons whatsoever and a stark terror of violence he was the lowest thing in the mcalester foodchain he was plankton if god didnt want him eaten why did he make him so weak and then contrive due to no fault of richards own to put him in a penitentiary richard knew himself to be a uniquely talented individual it was merely others conspiring against him that kept him from achieving that greatness but somehow he saw things that others didnt see and felt things that others didnt feel it may have been that he was too damned sensitive for his own good that he saw through so much that made people hate him so but that was the burden of the artist in a society of philistines he had that cross to bear he could do it richard thirtyone had a pillowy bouffant of blond hair and a face strangely smooth for his age he had a long soft body and an extremely quiet way of walking as if his feet were somehow more delicate than others he was by profession an art teacher with a masters from the maryland institute of art in baltimore but by passion an artist who had spent the better part of the last two decades trying to master certain intricacies of the human form it was a problem he had never quite worked out but now with prison days ahead of him he thought if he concentrated he might find some way torichard goddamn boy get your ass up richard jerked from his reverie looked up to see lamar his hair soaked flying into the cell uh i listen here got to move fast you go out behind the kitchens and bring goddamn odell back here do you understand the terror blanched across richards face he swallowed as if ingesting a billiard ball the yard was a land of terror if a rabbit like him went unescorted the blacks would rip him up the aryan brotherhood would make him a hood ornament the home boys would make fajitas out of him the fags would fuck him in every orifice the indians would burn him at the stake the hacks might use him for target practice richard barked lamar now you got to be a man today had to kill me a big nigger in the hack showers and you what you kil lamar was on him rammed him backward and got his hand around richards mouth to shut him up fast listen here richard i am dead by nightfall if i dont get out of this place and so is poor baby odell and with the two of us gone little brother what you think they gonna do to you youll be the fuck boy to end all fuck boys someone gonna tattoo for rent on your asshole son now i caint be seen out there cause im supposed to be riding junior jeffersons dick right now we got to get out of here out it was inconceivable to richard thats right boy we goin on a little vacation before all fucking hell breaks out it was all attitude richard knew all it took was a certain carriage a manly posture a strut that stank of violence and warned all who saw you that you were the stone stud he puffed himself up and strutted down the corridor to the yard entrance he stepped into the blazing light his chest stout and his shoulders back he was a man nobody could fuck with him here kitty kitty kitty a black man sung at him someone else made wet kissing sounds a giant tongue licked its lips smacking with the anticipation of violent sex richard melted his knees began to shake his breath came in terrible spurts that he had to fight to get in and out of his chest his vision grew woozy he walked straight ahead pretending to be oblivious to the shouts that rose to greet him while he ached to cry there was no comfort in this universe none whatsoever nothing nowhere it was all darwinism darwinism gone spectacularly exponential the strong didnt just eat the weak they ate the strong too it was a primal sink a festival of eating mrs lamar pye you sweet thang be on your ass like a big dog someone called ending in a glissando ofpoochy sounds it had stunned him most of all that they had so much freedom inside prison hed imagined it as being in little cells the whole day where you could get some constructive reading done but no the cells came open at seven am after headcount and then it was pretty much anything goes only a few of the inmates the connected ones had jobs the rest milled and seethed in the yard or worked out endlessly pumping iron or playing some weird version of handball against the wall violence broke out casually randomly it was pure bosch a landscape of degradation the white walls loomed overhead cupping the sevenhundredodd inmates in an arena built for three hundred and the solemn guards with their automatic rifles paid only nominal attention to what was going on hey pachuco hey grin ga romeos got something for you to suck on my pretty one it was the mexicans cholos they called themselves they were as bad as the blacks sexy graceful men so full of laughter eyes flashing with passion weirdly stylish under their red bandannas and hair nets blinding bleachedwhite tshirts the blacks had their ways too they brought the steamy urban music of their culture to their space and you could hear the soul sounds blasting out twentyfour hours a day they were like superb ebony warriors with hard muscles sculpted from sheer anthracite coal glistening with sweat so wonderfully graceful and body proud scary so scary and then the red gang calling itself ndnz with those letters elaborately tattooed around their biceps in some picturesque calligraphy that was clearly the work of a genius they looked at him with flat eyes as if his lifeform didnt register on their radar screens they never teased or challenged but only watched him with their savage indifferent eyes and he knew they were imagining hurting him out of sheer boredom but none of the gangs was as bad as the white boys who really ran the mac the tribe of mutants and scum tattooed and slob by their hair greased up like vikings on a raid their squirrely eyes narrow with evil cunning they would fuck you or kill you in a second as if it made not a pennys worth of difference to them fat with bulging white bellies and purple wreaths of convict tattooing proudly inscribed on their chalky skin they were the outlaw elite goatees full hillbilly beards ponytails hair at any rate in its many forms deviance was their religion indifference to pain their own or others its highest form of expression some of them even had some teeth in his terror richard yearned for lamars protection yearned even to see the idiot odell he knew he didnt dare disappoint liamar who could be a stern disciplinarian so somehow he kept himself on track pushing ahead through the mob waiting for his heart to go into vapor lock the mac without lamar jesus it terrified him hed bewishud he looked up it was his other savior it was odell working quickly lamar went down two cells to freddy the dentists where freddy was painting the engine of some twinengined world war ii fighter plane model and sent freddy off to find harry funt the hack harry funt was the absolute centerpiece of the scam he had already with stunning speed that no iq test could ever hope to measure conceptualized in his mind by drawing upon the immense archival wealth of data he held in his head about the mac lamar looked at his watch twenty till the men would start filing back in shortly goddamned harry better show he went to his cell he took his best shank out from under the toilet bowl a wicked twoincher cut down from a butter knife cost him two cartons would kill a man in one swipe if you got him right hed done it twice too that made him feel a little better hed go down fighting at least been fighting his whole goddamn life cards always against him but it didnt matter he was a man hed do the job he could get through anything once when he was nineteen a couple of cherokee deputies in anadarko had worked him over for three long days broken his nose his jaw his cheekbone four ribs and the fingers of his left hand they thought hed raped this squaw girl he had and several others too frightened to complain but he never gave them the goddamn satisfaction of hearing him admit it that hadnt been the first time hed spit teeth and blood he went to his collection of stroke books dug through juggs and leg show and dears and rears and came at last to the november penthouse he took it out gingerly opened it to the centerfold and there he discovered the picture it was lamar the lion and his bitch princess he looked at it seeing his own features in the king of the jungle and the submissiveness across the womans beautiful face that was the highest form of love richard had finally gotten her tits right they werent real big floppers he hated floppers he liked them kind of tight muscley so theyd move when she ran but wouldnt bang the lines around the central form were heavily etched because hed ran over them with a pencil himself hoping to find out how richard had done it but his lines somehow made it heavier something in the picture he liked so very much nothing had ever pleased him quite that much he folded it up and put it in his pocket just as harry funt came in harry the oldest of the hacks was in his blue uniform with a walkietalkie and a baton but no firearm lamar freddy said were getting out now the three of us richard odell and meand you harry just looked at him he gulped some water came into his pale old eyes lamar had to kill me that nigger junior jefferson in the showers he was going to fuck me now i know you got annex forms in the office and you can get us out of the cellblock and by security at least into the a corridor and into admin two there was nothing in the old man at all no guts no outrage just a sense of wiltedness like a flower in the frost waiting on a cold nights death he looked down begging for mercy i cant lamar please dont make me got a wife needs a operation my granddaughter got one of them breathing problems we got to keep her but lamar had never been into mercy oh yes you can harry cause when they find junior all hells going to break out and the niggers will kill me i cant let that happen to me and mine ill turn snitch and you been milling in scat for daddy cool and copilots and phennies for rodney and nobody knows youre working both sides but me you even do a load of crystal meth now and again right now let me tell you how fast i will sell you to both of them old man just that fast there wont be enough of you left to feed odells cats harry threw a fast nervous look at his watch he had about twelve minutes until lockup then he gave it up exactly as lamars shrewd calculus had predicted okay he said but it would help if youd conk me one too it wont look so bad i might even get a medal it wasnt that odell was big it wasnt that he had a cleft palate and the gap under his nose was like the dark fissure of the mariana trench it wasnt that his arms were abnor many long and it wasnt that his teeth were black or that owing to his physical deformity he was a mouth breather and issued raspy wheezes wherever he went more than anything it was the strange almost lozenge shape of his head as it soared outward almost exploding from the pointy little chin into a broad pale forehead topped most absurdly by a flame of red hair he had freckles like any huck finn but his eyes were almost always devoid of emotion he held out a dead cat it had just stopped moving he had been holding it tightly a few minutes earlier he shook it to bring it back to life but it remained still and even floppy kiddy he thought kiddy no no kiddy no mew kiddy sleepy time kiddy kiddy be jumpy kiddy jumpy jumpy jumpy make kiddy be jumpyjump dell no like em kiddy ust no no sleepytime kiddy baby standing nervously before him richard thought jesus who framed thy fearful asymmetry william blake himself couldnt have thought this guy up everyone gave odell a wide berth even the blacks and the warriors ofndnz because odell was known to have no fear even in this behavioral grease trap he could inspire fear because he literally had none only lamar could control him or even reach him and lamar rented him out to daddy cool for disciplinary tasks odell would walk into a crowd of blacks without noticing them and maim the man among them whod earned daddys disapproval then hed walk away his face implacably impassive odell lamar needs us he sent me to get you come on quick na kiddy ust dud odell said impassively face slack and dull as if he hadnt heard what richard just said rich and was beginning to understand odell which had him worried my kitty is dead odell held up the tiny cat limp in his huge hands the fur between its ears was strangely wet as if he had been licking it richard thought hed puke odell was a squalid mountain of manchild with the brain of a fish and the docile demeanor of an old beagle until lamar told him to act otherwise thats too bad odell but lamar wants us now its an emergency mergy asked odell a hurryhurryodell said richard aping the strange language in which lamar communicated with odell awareness flickered behind odells dim eyes huwwy huwwy he said then made a half smile that increased momentarily the terrible gap in his skull he tucked the cat in his shirtrichard wanted to gagand sped off the masses parted to let him by nobody would dis odell or stand against him and in the blessed safety of his wake richard hurried after feeling almost heroic they didnt even reach the cell but instead were intercepted by lamar just inside the d block door okay boys time to go said lamar lamar i began the very nervous richard now you just shut up richard and be a good boy odell if richard talks you make him notalk notalk mar said odell love blooming in his eyes and he turned toward richard as if to crush his skull notalk wichud he said notalk said richard they headed to the lieutenants office which was empty the lieutenant would be in the guards lounge having a cup of coffee inside a nervous old harry funt waited lamar i got the forms but i dont know if this is going to work you boys have to put on irons and chains well put them on goddamn it harry youre going to conk me good real good you want to mess up the office thisd be where you jump me you can tell em we did it clean we dont got time for the office okay lamar if you say so and you wont say nothing about my participation if it doesnt work its gonna work harry this is lamar talking you believe it harry now here you take this he handed over the shank a short evilly sharpened blade embedded in a plastic haft you dont need no weapons lamar said harry you aint going to hurt nobody are you no sir i am not said lamar but i may have to face somebody down and a goddamn shank gets a man to thinking about what itd feel like to get cut up bad it surely does now you take it because nobodys going to throw the metal detector on you harry hurry now we got to get moving harry took the blade with a shudder sliding it into his hip pocket as if he didnt know what it was for quickly the three prisoners put on leg irons waist chains and handcuffs they were not allowed to move out of the cellblock area without the bondageit was mcalesters oldest and strictest security arrangement now lamar spose i get asked how come im bringing all three you boys regs say only move one at a time through the choke point into the de secure zone you just wink like you got three fish on a goddamn line you caught three biguns were gonna give something up the warden his self has got to hear you gonna be a hero harry hewo said odell now richard was really scared harry sullenly pushed his chained trio down the corridor take out your club harry said lamar itll look more serious harry swallowed and did just that and in a second they came across two hacks heading down to supervise lockdown harry what the fuck is this uh you know lamars got a beef with somebody and he wants to sing to the lieutenant wont talk to nobody less you wanna sing to me lamar bubba you aint got the heat to get me no deal im gonna give the warden some names but i need protection for me and mine and only the warden has the clout watch him harry lamars too fucking smart to go on the snitch hes playing some fucking angle i swear to you lamars a good boy aint you lamar said harry through dry lips lamars inmate scum harry dont you put your trust in him itll come to grief i swear but the guards slid on down the corridor heading to the cellblock and to their duties the little party reached the stairway that lead up to the cellblock exit and harry took out his walkietalkie ah control this is mikefive ah coming through with three inmates the two pye boys and their cellmate ah peed said richard yeah peed said harry into the thing whats the dope harry the radio crackled the lieutenant okay this say he did and you can check with him said lamar harry swallowed again seemed to lose half a shade of color and then lied badly into the radio yes he did control you can check got me a canary wants to do some singing you need an escort no got me a pussy new boy and two soft old boys thats all no sweat you watch that fucking odell said the voice hes as crazy as a goddamned loon cleared cleared but you gotta show paperwork harry led the three men up the catwalk at the top they could turn and see the whole cellblock behind them a cube cut with cells situated inside the larger cube of the housing building with catwalks called shooting ways strung out parallel to each level so that the screws could watch or blast away with water buckshot or s as it fit their purposes lamar looked at it his home knew every cell every nook and cranny every hiding place only place hed ever been happy where he belonged really belonged mar said odell go home see mamma thats right odell odell go see mamma you just do what i say and itll all be fine odell lamar realized was scared he was leaving something that he knew he probably couldnt even remember the outside so small and cramped was his sad little mind with his elbow he gave odell a little nudge of affection lamar going to take care of odell make it all right he said the main security gate at the highest level opened the three inmates stepped into a cocoon of professional attention guards flew to them patted them down one of them waved a garrett super scanner metal detector up and down in search of the telltale hum that revealed a hidden hat ping or razor none came meanwhile another man gave harrys paperwork the onceover harry this dont look like the goddamn lieutenants scrawl though goddammit the man can hardly write his own name when he drinks a bit his hand gets scratchy harry said whynt you call him for the okay the moment hung in the air richard had some trouble breathing but lamar was as slick as they come you damn boys are making it so hard on me i just might change my goddamned mind dont want to think too long bout what im set to do might change my tune lamar you have more shit in you than a goddamn outhouse said the guard go on harry get em out of here i cant believe lamars turning snitch thought you was a tough con lamar getting old said lamar cant get it hard no more wardens going to get me a softer joint you know a country club maybe i can get me some pussy get em out of here said the supervisor hope the goddamned warden knows what hes in for harry escorted them down the hallway beyond the security checkpoint it seemed like a different world suddenly the hallway was bright and airy though the windows had mesh screens it was just possible to see the green plains of southeast oklahoma outside as they fell away toward oklahoma city a hundredodd miles off all farmland and low hills and horizon richard saw the horizon between the two red turrets of the rear gate accessible only from admin two the building they were now in the outside world richard had forgotten such a place existed the weight of the prison was its totality its immensity in its grip all other possibilities diminished even disappeared he had a brief and sweet image of his life before of the freedoms hed had the pleasures the small idiotic rights a blast of pity for himself and his helpless ways swept over him in here said lamar putting his shoulder quickly against a locked door and bucking it open without a sound the four men were suddenly in the darkened office of the prisons medical administrator dr benteen benteen who was brotherinlaw to some powerful state senator was almost a total noshow these days with a bad drinking problem much loathed by everyone in the prison community but untouchable quickly lamar took the keys from the hapless harry and sprang himself he tossed them to odell who did the same and finally it was richard who got them by the time he was out lamar had taken up a post at the window they were two stories up jesus christ richard thought what were they supposed to do parachute yeah hes still here goddammit said lamar parked where he always parks that gets us ten feet less to jump you aint afraid of a little jump are you richard say twenty feet on a nice soft van roof richard looked twentyfive feet below he saw the flat roof of a white van how had lamar known it would be there goddamn guy comes to put hostess twinkies and hoho cakes in the guards vending machines every god damned tuesday this time now we jump onto that i can hotwire the goddamned thing and we off good thang them damned hacks love their hoho cakes so fucking much lamar knew the prison up one side and down the other just knew it cold fall long said odell boo boo fall hurt odell now odell you can jump it you know you can see mamma get out okay odell he turned to richard this boy loved his mamma she was the only one ever treated him decent till i come along we got to get him to her grave just once before he dies now odell want you to bend this goddamned metal screen out so we can get ourselves out of

harry you go on use your belt and the cord from that drape or maybe you can find some tape odell and i going to get this screen out richard son you just hang loose a sec we may need you but they didnt odell gathered up a length of curtain and cushioned his hands then proceeded to punch the glass out of the window then he upturned the doctors chair pulling it apart until he had a metal strut inserting it in a small gap in the metalwork he pried enough of the window mesh from its screws to get leverage finishing with the strength of his own arms he bent the screen back savagely until a man could easily crawl out meanwhile harry funt scavenged through the office until he found some masking tape this here tapell work just fine he said should i gag myself lamar yeah harry thats great you know its them little touches that make it real this here thing is working out just great aint it richard its great said richard really very very nice almost ready odell weddy said odell lamar said harry i did my ankles and legs im going to put the gag on now can you do my wrists not too tight or nothing and when you hit me just enough to bring some blood nothing dramatic im too goddamned old for drama why sure harry said lamar he waited as the old man put some cotton balls in his mouth and then ran a length of tape around his mouth to the back of his head then lamar bent behind the old man who eagerly offered his wrists behind his back and lamar swiftly ensnared his wrists then lamar wrapped several more lengths of tape around harrys mouth thats kind of tight isnt it asked richard well maybe it is said lamar but we want it real harry dont mind do you mind harry he asked harry gagging a little shook his head no good said lamar well then boys we are all set oh wait just this one little last thing he bent to harry we want it real dont we harry all the details just right harry nodded the shank magically appeared in lamars hand and he cut the old mans carotid artery chapter the phone pulled bud pewtie from a blank and dreamless sleep and he awoke in the dark of his bedroom his wife breathing heavily beside him all through the house it was quiet except for the sounds of his two sons shifting and squirming under their blankets down the hall he picked it up yeah pewtie here bud bud immediately recognized the voice of captain tim james the zone five area commander and his boss bud felt the edge in captain jamess voice a bad one on kids smeared on the pavement propane burning gas leaking a school bus burned bud had seen them all bud we got a callout its a big tenninetyeight up at goddamn mcalester three toughass inmates they capped a guard another convict and probably a guy they stole a truck from yes sir he said bud was secretly relieved hed seen a lot of random destruction on the highway what speed and metal can do to the innocent or the stupid twentyfive long years in he knew a certain part of himself was wearing away that part that could look without flinching at young lives crunched into bent metal russell bud pewtie was fortyeight a strong large man with short graying hair and brusque ways he wasnt exactly an emotion machine and his profession had conspired to drive what few public feelings he had even deeper behind the set lines of his squarish face no one could read much on bud he was a sergeant and zone five assistant commander of troop g of the oklahoma highway patrol that is for comanche caddo grady cotton stephens and jefferson counties as well as for the long northeastsouthwest run of down from oklahoma city on the way to wichita falls texas affirmative captain he said im rolling bud nobodys riding alone on this one oklahoma citys orders these boys are too goddamned mean and you can bet their first stops gonna be a gun store or some hunters basement were partnering up and traveling cocked and locked whom i partnering with i see you broke in that kid ted pepper he lives near you dont he for just a beat bud paused he tried to clear his head but yeah it would be ted somehow it had to be ted yeah teds about ten minutes away on the other side of lawton okay you double with ted this is just an ad hoc thing but were setting up roadblocks on all the majors between here and mcalester gonna be a meeting up in chickasha in the highway maintenance shop can you get there by ohsevenhundred for roadblock assignment i want you and ted to represent our troop and ill rotate others in as i can yes sir said bud ill call ted bud i know youll do damned good but be careful these boys are trash bud rolled out of bed pausing just a second on the edge to collect his scattered wits it felt cold as if a terrible wind were blowing but it was just a random chill bud it was jen in the dark yes what is it oh it was tim a goddamn callout escaped cons ill be sitting on a goddamned roadblock or running up and down the highway thats all you be careful bud i always am he said bud went down to the kitchen and after just the faintest pause dialed ted peppers number he knew it by heart it rang three times hello teds wife holly answered he knew her voice too well he swallowed hard on the phone she sounded like syrup there was a low vibration a hum that still made him a little woozy she was twentysix how complicated things can get holly bud you shouldnt call me here he holly is ted there of course he isnt here you know that hes in the other bedroom ill get him good you do that holly thirty seconds later ted came on bud it sure is said bud heartily and gave ted the news im swinging by in fifteen and i want to find you with all your creases straight and your ar locked and loaded got that son oh christ said ted i only just went to sleep well now i know you have it in you christ bud you got all the damn answers youre goddamn happy i can tell see you in twenty fifteen young trooper said bud he was so merry with ted old trooper sergeant all the damn answers full of laughs and teasing and the subtle insistence of obedience before hed won his stripes hed been the kid to a dozen tough old sergeants and now here he was a sergeant himself bud hit the shower was out in a flash and rushed through the rest then stepping into his closet he found his next days uniform springfresh on the hanger he pinned on the gold badge an indian shield with two wings above it and the words to protect and serve to a lot of the younger men the badge meant nothing but he still felt as if it symbolized his membership and acceptance in an elite society we enforce it said to the world we protect he pulled on his socks and a gaico ankle holster then stepped into his taupe striped slacks still thirtysixes the brown shirt with its flashy gray epaulets and pocket flaps fit him like a glove its three yellow chevrons stood out bright as daisies just below the yellowpiped arrowhead shoulder patch that said oklahoma highway patrol nineteen years to make that rank even if hed passed the test up at the top the first time when hed only done a decade he buttoned it up swiftly tied the tie bud you put your vest on jen called from the bedroom where she should have been sleeping it irritated him but most things jen said irritated him these days that goddamn things heavy as a washing machine still you put it on of course i will he lied he hated it made him feel like he had on a girdle last bud slipped into his black patent oxfords and tied them tight he stepped out of the closet bud you dont have that vest on i can tell youre going to get yourself killed and leave me with a mountain of bills jen said nobodys killing me he said now go back to sleep i swear you are an ornery man these days she said sullenly she settled in under the blankets rolling over he stepped into the short hallway not much of a house but nobodyd ever complained it was dark a blue dark but bud knew every square inch of it he walked a bit and leaned in to look at russ who snoozed with some trouble he was restive in sleep as in life russs hair mottled and tangled ensnared his handsome face above him the specter of some rock performer made up like the devil himself rose on a poster stark white and psychotic he looked like a pcp zombie bud had once seen a dea team blow away on the other side of ok city but bud didnt worry about russ russ who was seventeen looked like six kinds of shit with all that damned hair and the black clothes he wore and a little glittery something in his earlobe that bud didnt even want to know about but bud somehow knew he had too much of his mother in him to do anything crazy he still got mostly as he had a chance to go to a fancy eastern university if certain things worked out right across the hall he looked in on the younger boy jeff jeff was the smaller at fifteen but the tougher he had a pug face and an athletes wiry muscley frame the room stank ever so slightly of stale sweat socks moldy jocks ten pairs of sneakers he was the jock wannabe no genius not a reader but on any kind of field a hard and earnest plugger who yearned to do well and almost never did there was something tragic in jells wanting and continual air of disappointment in himself bud felt a wave of love and melancholy wash across him so intense that he felt he could bend over and kiss the young man on the cheek jeff seemed to need him so im going to leave this young boy he asked himself feeling the weight come onto his shoulders but leaving was being discussed it was a possibility up ahead on the road scared the hell out of him am i really getting ready to pull out well maybe i am maybe theyll be all right daddy jeff had stirred seeing his father yes jeff what is it whats going on oh they need me nothing much you dont have your vest on i can tell its nothing he said dont you worry a bit youre just like your mother get on back to sleep now bud put his family behind him and walked downstairs to the end of the hall to a closet he opened it to face his gun vault quickly he turned the familiar combination his heavy patentleather belt hung on the pegboard inside the door he peeled it off ran the belt around his waist and pulled it tight third hole a belt was important to a policeman it carried so much cuffs can of mace a baton if he was working crowd control a sap as some of the boys carried a radio jack a speed loader pouch and the gun of course of course the gun a fourinch smith wesson m magnum he took his off the shelf and gave it a quick wipe down its stainless steel ugliness gleamed in the low light but the damned thing felt so good in the hand it fired six murderous little federal grain hollowpoint bullets with a oneshot stop rating of percent bud went to the range twice a week he was a very good shot he opened the cylinder and quickly dropped in six federals from the open box he had two speed loaders each charged with six cartridges for quick refills unlike many state officers bud laboriously practiced with the speedloaders and could get his six empties out and have six new shells deposited in the cylinder in less than two seconds hed never had to do so just as hed never shot a living man but it was better to be able to do it fast and not need it than to need it and not be able to do it he secured the pistol in his holster snapping the thumb snap then he reached into the gun safe and removed a tiny smith wesson a twoincher flicked the cylinder open to assure himself it carried five p special hollow tips locked the cylinder and slipped it into his ankle holster left inside ankle again securing it with the strap he locked the safe up tight and pulled his smokey off its top the dark green flat brimmed hat was perched just so atop his head its brim just edging off the top of his vision as it was supposed to maybe thats where it started for him all those years back goddamn he still thought it was the bestlooking hat hed ever seen it was the only hat hed ever wear he wanted to be buried in it or at least with it he stepped out of the house and went to the cruiser parked in the driveway a gleaming chevy caprice in the blackandwhite tones of the state firing up the engine he picked up the mike and pressed the send button ah dispatch this is sixohfive im tenfiftyone to officer twoeleven got you sixohfive said the womans voice the night duty dispatcher advise you switch to police intercity net for updates as they come through affirmative dispatch any news big zero so far okay dispatch off i go he switched to the intercity net mhz eased the big car out of the driveway and headed to ted and holly peppers the pepper trailer alone on its grim little street was lit up like a turnpike gas station ted fully uniformed stood outside with a rifle case in one hand he was a tall goodlooking youngster perhaps too handsome if there was weakness to his character it was that as a young man things had been given to him too easily without his ever quite acquiring the lessons of humility and hardass work if youre a blueeyed boy with a button nose things just show up on your plate but he was all right ted just didnt have the giftthat special instinct for human deviance that cunning about motive that twitch for the truth under the lie and finally the will to do the job flat outthat marked a great cop but there werent too many great cops left and bud knew he himself fell short in a bunch of areas too he had only this on ted hed been around a bit more as bud pulled in the door opened and holly came out in a housecoat with two sealed eleven plastic cups that presumably held hot coffee her freckles stood out now without makeup her strawcolored almost reddish mass of hair looked like shed been electrified but dammit that was holly she was a cute one ted was in a surly mood bud could tell and holly kept her distance hi bud she chirped you and ted off on another excellent adventure holly for chrissakes ted said howdy bud ted you locked and loaded yes sir and i got three mags with the sixtyninegrain hollowpoints eighteen in each one as per good man lets get her in the trunk and get on the road morning holly oh dont notice me or anything there mr sergeant bud pewtie he laughed holly was a flirty thing i made you boys some coffee i hope it helps anything helps said bud opening the trunk ted put the rifle case in next to buds own rifle case where a mossberg gauge pump gun with an extended magazine was concealed you boys could start yourself a war said holly aint gonna be no shooting said bud these trashy boys just want to stretch their legs before they go back its just a little vacation way i hear they already killed three people holly said okay so theyre a little testy said bud but then he turned to ted ted i want you to go back and get your vest on this is a vest day if ever there was one bud you know i hate the goddamn vest you aint wearing one no i aint thats because i figure if theres any shooting you going to be a hero while i sit in the goddamn back seat and pray so i dont need no vest you do young trooper you dont want to widow this beautiful young woman do you ah bud now ted dont make me pull hard rank in front of your wife you just go on and do it and dont think you can shame me by calling me a hypocrite because i already know i am one and goddamn it son i am proud of it like a chastised child ted went sullenly into the trailer from where presently the sound of things being tossed and doors being slammed arrived its his day in the barrel i guess bud said hell be fine once he gets the coffee in him bud how are you oh holly you know he and holly met at least twice and sometimes depending on hunger and possibility five or six times a week at various sites around the motelrich greater lawton area and made love with a desperation and a purity that bud could never remember having felt in his life before he hadnt made love to jen in over two years he could hardly remember making love to jen but he could never forget making love to holly and what was going to happen next hell if he knew it had the sense of a high speed chase to it going faster and faster and something bad was bound to come of it but once you start in some terrible way you have to finish you said youd work it out and i think you will youll be a man somebody has to be around here he is upset about something isnt he could he know bud that boy hasnt paid no attention to me in a year if i turned green he wouldnt notice so no bud he dont know a thing okay i dont want him getting hurt its important we tell him when we tell jen so nobody gets hurt any more than necessary well work this out i promise i swear you never want anybody getting hurt do you bud thats what i like so very much about you but you should be wearing your vest well teds right im too old to itch that much all day though youre the third person whos told me to wear it in the past twenty minutes bud you should you really should nobodys shooting this old boy that i promise you bud i love you she suddenly said as if she had to get it in quick then ted looking stiff with the seven pounds of kevlarreinforced fiberglass that now girdled his torso under his uniform shirt came back out okay said bud time to get humming he shot holly a secret look as ted climbed into the car then climbed in himself backed out of the driveway and sped out of the trailer park heading cross town to pick up gore on the way to the ted was silent well bud finally said looks like we got a hard couple of days coming up nobody goes home on these jobs till its over i remember back in there was this con who but he glanced over and saw that ted had settled back involuntarily and begun to breathe the heavy breath of sleep middle of the night thought bud and put the pedal to the metal goosing the cube engine shooting through the deserted city as the sun just began to edge into the eastern sky it was full dawn when bud pulled into the chickasha highway maintenance barracks forty miles up the toward oklahoma city from lawton and ted had slept the whole way it was no big deal bud would have just talked to hear himself talk if it made ted sharper later on so be it he entered the lot not at all surprised to see cruisers not only from his own outfit but half a dozen others the county sheriffs offices the lawton and chickasha municipal police mps from the fort sill reservation whose vastness abutted lawton as well as a couple of black sedans that were the trademark of the osbi the oklahoma state bureau of investigation the states own downhome fbi oh christ bud thought osbies always think they know just that much more somehow always a little bit better protected than us poor old patrol smokies okay bub bud announced lets go git the particulars huh oh christ sorry bud didnt get much sleep last night that goddamned wife of mine kept me up like you wouldnt believe hard to believe a scrawny girl like that needs it twice a night oh to be that goddamned young again said bud completing the circle of the lie ted had stopped sleeping with his wife thirteen months ago for no known reason at alljust stopped bud had started sleeping with teds wife two months ago and he knew the reason they got out and headed in finding the place hopping as was to be expected he saw a lieutenant from troop m over in altus talking to two heavylidded types in illfitting suits who had to be osbi the two men in suits had remington s with scopes hanging over their shoulders in fact looking about at the law enforcement types milling in the corridor bud saw that nearly everyone packed extra heat get yourself a cup of coffee the lieutenant said to him were waiting on goddamn cd for a briefing i thought that old coot was dead said bud acknowledging the mention of the legendary lawman cd aint ever going to die said the lieutenant hes too pickled in bourbon to pass on he and ted found coffee and a big tub of dunkin donuts and bud passed on the pastry while ted took a sugary one suddenly bud noticed guys streaming by them into the duty room as if everyone just knew that it was somehow time to get the word bud filed in too and the place that was sparsely filled when a twelveman rotation got its shift briefing was now chockablock with cops a state officer made a few introductory remarks but bud like all of them paid no attention they were eyeballing the legendary old lt c d henderson sitting there in a string tie and tony lama boots and a definitely nonregulation colt automatic in some kind of ancient blackened multi strapped and buckled shoulder rig under his suit coat cd was the most famous detective in the state of oklahoma and a hardcore police gunfighter who went back to great days when the oklahoma city police pistol team sent its best men into the fbi to handle all violent duties he himself it was said had been trained in the art of closein shooting by the legendary d a jelly bryce but he looked so old rumor had it that he was a secret lush and would have been long since retired off the force if he didnt have photographs of wellknown politicians with prostitutes or something well my compliments to yall cant tell you how damned impressed i am with how fast you boys got here and how many of you there are cd said as he took over his face was a prune left in the sun an extra week and the suit khaki with cowboy piping seemed to have been originally bought for a much larger man in the unenthusiastic way it hung off his scrawny geezers frame anyway the goddamned department of correction dumped a bad one on us and heres the latest i have and i just got off the phone with oklahoma city pass the bulletins out please a couple of lesser lights walked among the men handing out threepage sheets at about eighteen hundred hours last night that is thirteen hours ago a bad old boy named lamar pye led his cousin odell and a poor new boy stiff named richard peed out ofmcalester state penitentiary the first bad news is it was only discovered at ten pm when they did a headcount learned that the three boys were gone and began to search found a goddamn treasure chest of bodiesan old guard was found with his throat cut a big black inmate named willie ralph jefferson jr stowed in a closet with a bar of soap shoved down his craw odells work probably we learned quickly that a vending machine delivery guy whose last stop was the prison never came back now thats bad because they were out over four hours before they were discovered missing which means roadblocks and bloodhounds in mcalester area aint apt to turn up much he then narrated some colorful details of the escape including a description of the van they purportedly made their getaway in an eightynine ford econoline with hostess products emblazoned on it and the license number and a description of the poor missing driver a willard jones what you see before you now is the rap sheet on the three inmates lamars the baddest bad news hes a goddamned professional inmate and criminal been breaking the law since he was ten years old his daddy matter of fact was killed in a shootout with an arkansas state trooper back in fiftyfive when lamar was just a lump in his mamas belly raised in reform school b and e assault assault with a deadly weapon armed robbery distribution of narcotics he just put his hands in everything working out of tulsa and oklahoma city he shot a convenience store clerk dead in just shot him point blank thats lamar anyway it was goddamn pleabargained down to murder two and he was paroled in then he and his cousin poor dumb old odell they commenced to rob banks fastfood restaurants hell they even robbed a yogurt shop in tulsa mall theyre both shooters we also believe lamar pulled the trigger on a couple of snitches who were ratting out the noble pagans motorcycle club on contract from the pagans heres something you wont see on no bulletin they say this boys hung like an ox they say he makes johnny dillinger look like a sprout in that department so if you have a suspect you can always check his pecker and if you need two rulers to measure id say you got your man there was tide of laughter in the room now odells like lamars body servant dumb as a stump and cant hardly talk retarded probably anyway in lamar and odell decided to rip off a noble pagan road captain who was dealing and they took him out beyond anadarko and shot him in the head well he didnt die soon as they thought and he named them first which is how come the boys ended up in the mac bud looked at the pictures of the two men and saw what hed seen so many times beforethe look of billy town trash hardburning eyes smoldering with either some obscure grudge against the world or utter stupidity minds that worked different from most minds thats what they were like as if in some way they were hardwired different killers manipulators ruthless savageand yet goddamn them always brave so much sheer aggression so used to violence so comfortable with it odells eyes were like coal lumps not a goddamned thing in them he just stared out from the photograph his strangeshaped head seeming to come from a different planet a black smear where his upper lip should have been lamar was different his face was wider and more open and held some charm to it in a certain hard way he was a handsome man but the eyes had such a glare to them such a fucknotwithme attitude there was something tragic in them too the hard cons the real pros always had a glimmer of talent they could have been something else something better my guess is heres how well catch him said henderson sooner or later hell run to his own kindoutlaw biker scum punks hard cases hell hes been affiliated with half the gangs in oklahoma hes done time with all the hardcore convicts and professional criminals in the state hell go to them and somebodyll rat him out you just watch what about this other boy a voice called peed is hard to figure said c d henderson he aint your inmate material or so it would seem no priors some kind of art genius went to that high school for the gifted they run in tulsahis daddy was a oil executiveand he went out east to some kind of art place a painter they say anyway back he comes when his mama gets sick and he spends ten years nursing her meanwhile hes teaching art at oklahoma city junior college but mainly hes painting bud looked at this richard peed under the puffy pillow head of hair he beheld a face remarkable in its softness no harsh lines attended richard peed at all he seemed raw material unformed callow a childman his face was dough waiting for experience to stamp an imprint upon it the eyes were fuzzy and slightly weak and even in the picture peering over the new rack of inmates numbers and bled of all nuance by the harshness of the flashbulb he radiated fear he was a rabbit the joint would kill him whatd this heman do a deputy sheriff asked rob a goddamned lemonade stand but bud could see the only mark against him was an assault with intent to kill three to five that almost never got a fellow time in a hard joint like the mac any firstyear law student could get a body with no priors out in two months well because he was white and rich they had to make a big show of going hard on him but the deal was hed do his three months at the mac and then be transferred to the federal playground at el reno what he did though was plumb right crazy sick said it henderson he had this art show and he thought all the reviewers were going to say how great he was only nobody came his poor mama was giving him a hard time so he stabbed her if e d henderson meant to shock his audience he failed all the men there had encountered more grotesque atrocities in the billy towns and black townships of oklahoma but henderson wasnt quite done yet stabbed her that is in the eyes put his own mothers goddamned eyes out blinded her chapter mother rabbit was learning about the wolves it was nearly eight getting on to darkness bud pewtie would not receive his phone call for a good six hours yet but in a van heading at just five miles under the speed limit west down state route toward ada the lesson progressed this rabbits name was willard it said so on a little oval on his pocket willard in script lamar thought whatever happens i aint never going to have to wear no shirt with my goddamned name in a little oval so all the square johns can say oh hello lamar check the oil lamar put that thing over there lamar i take sugar in my coffee lamar willard had already pissed in his pants he couldnt stop weeping but thats what rabbits did thats why they were rabbits now willard said lamar tell me again about your plant mister please dont hurt me christ its just a goddamned plant how many trucks jesus mister i dont know i never counted now listen careful willard i dont want to have to hurt you just tell me how many trucks answer my questions or ill have odell hurt you like he done before odell had already broken four of willards fingers he sat now his big arm neck laced around willards scrawny shivering neck eating twinkies hed eaten about fifty of them dinkies hed say occasionally richard called lamar you just keep going straight on toward ada dont do nothing stupid youre right at the speed limit son i can feel it richard driving the van tried to appear nonchalant but the rabbits terror was like the smell of decaying flesh in the air and it made him sick yes lamar called richard they rolled through jerkwater towns where richard had always wondered how people made a living across rolling green fields strewn with barrel like rolls of hay across a landscape that could have been a portrait of farmland usa he tried not to listen to what was going on behind him but only concentrate on the speed limit on staying right at sixty maybe twentyfive trucks willard was saying his voice wobbly and occasionally falsetto with fear we got accounts all over south oklahoma we do all the grocery store deliveries we got vending machine accounts in vfws in every town over five thousand we do cop stationscops eat a lot of hoho cakeswe do gas stations every place a man might eat a twinkie or a hoho cake thats where we are dinkies said odell please please i got a wife and two kids sir i never hurt nobody and never did no wrong never you mind willard you just work with me and ill see if i cant cut you a little slack with odell okay yes sir sobbed willard twentyfive trucks now when you pull in they all park together or what is it fenced you checked in does anybody pay any attention to you you go into an operations shack or what yall park together sir said willard concentrating very hard there aint no fence or nothing nobody checks you in the drivers go into the office with what stock they got left and unload then they check out if you didnt check out would anybody notice would it be a big thing who would know oh christ youre going to hurt me i am not going to hurt you less you make me hurt you i want this shit willard willard help me goddammit we can work together on this goddamned thing cant we i guess round about eight maybe theyd begin to wonder whatall the hell i been up to maybe if i dont git back by ten thats when they call the cops but drivers and vendor service guys you know they always go off do the god damndest things but not you willard you do good work yes sir now willard you got any money sir i only got bout ten dollars on me cash and i got lots of quarters maybe five hundred dollars in quarters and loose change ah said lamar calculating what about a bankcard you got a bankcard willard no sir i only make fourteen thousand dollars a year i dont have enough money for no bankcard do you have any money at your house please sir dont go to my house i got two little girls oh jesus why is this happening it was as if willards need to know why finally exasperated lamar beyond endurance he felt no man had the right to ask such elemental questions of him heres why willard you see what it says here he held out his big right fist the one that said fuck willard nodded yes you do and he held out his big left fist y o u i it said the fear radiated from willards eyes like heat lamar liked that in a man do you get it willard do it make sense now desperately willard nodded yes now it makes sense odell break his goddamned thumb odell ca key ca key good sweet cakey like mama sweet cakey all ca key in whole wurl lookie ca key lookie truck full ca key cakey white ca key good brown ca key milk like ca key mar like loud up sudden odell break his goddamned thumb hurty man odell do hurty bad hurt hurt thumb no go thumb no go thumb no go thumb go like pop pop go thumb now me ca key mar mar like now you go ca key willard screamed while odell broke his thumb he screamed so loud it irritated lamar who crawled forward below eye level to talk to richard how you holding up richard do you have to hurt him so richard asked hurt him hell you aint seen a thing richard in your short life if you think thats hurting lamar gave a little chuckle at the stupidity of richards observation anyway he continued after a pause i think youll be wanting to hit the turnoff up ahead into ada i do believe then we look for davis street and when we head down you give me a call lamar where are we going dont you worry son i got it all figured out now what was that about the wrists boy remember the other night you was telling me about the wrists willard was still screaming he sobbed and heaved and begged but odell kept him captured with a single immense hand while eating twinkies with the other the wrist the wrist now what the fuck then he had it art art oh yeah well i think actually ah you see what makes a painting or a drawing so fluid actually so lifelike is the flexibility of the wrist and the exquisite relationship of the articulate muscles of the wrist and hand to the vision and the imagination thats why a freepainted line is always called a living line goddamn said lamar rapturous with delight yes sir you sure can talk you can talk and you can draw you are a goddamned interesting young man aint he odell awoooooah said odell pye his broad crippled mouth knitting up into a smile his lips crusted with flecks of weightless white custard filling willard weeping in his grasp well now richard boy you be thinking on your next drawing i think i want to go back to lions i liked the eagles and i liked the tigers but damn theres something about that old king of the jungle that just tickles me where i itch the worst richard watched as a blackandwhite highway patrol car flew by across the way he checked his watch clearly they hadnt been discovered yet lamar had one more item on his agenda he crawled back into the rear of the van he reached over and lifted the rabbits head so that the mans face looked into his what he saw was what he expected to see no surprises at all fear the eyes were stone bright like the rabbit had been high on crank but the drug that made him so mad was just the fear you could now do anything to willard the rabbit you could fuck him fuck his daughters kill his wife set his house afire and hed just look at you like that baby lips aquiver he wasnt no man goddammit he was a rabbit even a nigger will fight you you push him hard enough or corner him but not a rabbit rabbit just look you over while you decide which part of him to bite on he may even help

death as peacefully as he could though the young man squirmed and bucked the van accelerated to close to ninety lamar turned and yelled goddammit richard you slow this thing down you stupid little cocksucker you get us chased by the police and i will have your ass for breakfast richard tried to get control of himself the boys struggle had at last ceased he checked the mirror as he dropped back down under sixtyfive and saw no red flashing light he was all right he tried to breathe slowly dinkie said odell chapter the world had ceased to make sense back in the seventies and it just got worse and worse and worse crazed kids with automatic weapons crimes against children and women these nutcase white boys who thought they were gods chosen niggers gone plumb screwball on delusions of victimization and fearfully nursed grudges sometimes he believed the communists or the trilateralists or somebody some agencythe cia the fbi the kkkwas behind it all but still it c d henderson clung to certain convictions against the mounting chaos primarily he believed in logic he was a detective that most specialized and refined and renowned type of lawman the most famous detective in oklahoma a celebrity at police conventions a consultant on cases far and wide his core belief was that if enough data could be assembled a clever fellow could find a pattern in it somehow and make sense of it and bring it to its logical conclusion he was sixtyeight years old and still a lieutenant hed always be a lieutenant just as inevitably as when they needed someone to run an investigation theyd always call him careers had been built on his intelligence and insight and still he made less than forty thousand dollars a year the men hed broken in with were mostly dead the men hed trained had retired or gone to other better jobs and he was now primarily working for rude young people but he still had the gift he saw the connections the others missed he was willing to do the dreary work the collating the sifting the endless examination of details these kids he often lamented to the missus these damned kids they just dont want to do the work get a wiretap bust a raid go to swat sweat an interrogation call forensics they aint got the patience to nurse the answer out they wont look at the stuff and just figure it out carl shed say they aint worth a glass of hot gravy in july it was the bitterness mainly that drove him to the loving arms of i w harper with his daily pint of harpers resting comfy and promising in a brown paper bag in his right inside pocket he could get his mind loose and fluent and quell the seething anger that dogged him like a mean little dog maybe he made a few more mistakes maybe he missed a trick or two maybe the younger men could smell the whiskey on his breath and knew to leave him alone after four in the afternoon it didnt matter it was drink or eat the gun he knew that now acolytes and cynics had gathered around in a hanger like facility at the oklahoma turnpike authority in chickasha as a whole flood of men in the second day of the pye cousins manhunt came off duty and tried to grab some rest and perhaps seek advice hed run a manhunt or two in his time it was said so lieutenant someone said got me a gal id like to git back to what do you think the chances are we gonna git off this detail soon most of em just wander around with no damned idea of what to do he began staring out at the young unformed faces and they run into a roadblock in the first few minutes or hours theyre easy theyre the ones the roadblock system is designed to catch then theres those who have some kind of organization sponsoring them and can count on it for supporttransportation weapons new ids that sort of thing but sooner or later somebody rats them out when theres an advantage in doing so but every now and then he continued every now and then you get a smart one one whos full of natural cunning from the getgo you know has the gift for such a thing add to that hes been calculating the angles for years hes thought over all the mistakes he made hes been smart enough to pick up tips from the older inmates and let me tell you he gives you a run he gives you a goddamn run cd you think this lamar is going to give us a run well now son its early yet but he has been out fortyeight hours and he seems to have goddamn disappeared thats very impressive i have to tell you so maybe lamar is your boy your hardcore bad man on a hot streak getting bolder and bolder and ill tell you thisif he is hell be hell to catch cd if the governor asks you for advice what will you say id solve it like any crime id say look for the third piece of evidence sometimes you can do it on two you cant do it on one that i know from long and bitter years of trying sometimes maybe just maybe two will set you on your way ive seen it happen a time or so but this here is just an investigation every damn case whether its some swat team hoedown in the city or a domestic dispute or a goddamn highspeed motorized chase along the turnpike its still fundamentally an investigation and the fundamental rules apply and its that third piece of evidence that takes you where you want to go every damn time thats how i got freddy the dentist it was cds most famous case it had even been written up in a magazine and thered been talk about making a movie though nothing ever came of it but no one shouted tell us about freddy the dentist cd at least not for a bit wasnt that thats the one said cd and he was off the old glory unrolled before his eyes lord how he wished for a drink to ease the telling but tell it he would to show these young men the way it was american airlines flight oklahoma city to chicago twenty minutes into its trip kaboom one hundred twentyone souls vanished in a thunderclap body parts over four counties the fbi high handing it it didnt take them long to determine an explosive device generic as all getoutfour sticks of dynamite wired to a drugstore clockhad blown the guts out of the plane before it even reached altitude they figured whoever had done such a thing had done it strictly for the money thus they made a rapid assumption that it was a crime for profit and quickly examined the data on newly acquired life insurance policies over on the victims that was their first piece of evidence this yielded twentythree suspects they then crossreferenced against engineering or demolitions experience on the theory that building such a device was a sophisticated enterprise demanding expertise this was the second piece of evidence and damned if in a day they didnt arrest a fortyfouryearold petroleum executive whod done fieldwork for phillips in the choctaw fields where dynamite was regularly employed for sonar testing but cd just didnt buy it the man always took out a shortterm insurance policy on his wife when she flew as far back as when they were married there were no accounts of marital difficulty and the fellow was a deacon in his church and he was screwing a secretary probably his true crime but one so easily uncovered it would have pointed the finger at him so quickly he could never have hoped to escape it but the most important thing he wasnt a handyman cd visited the house after the arrest and didnt see a single piece of homebuilt furniture not even a bookshelf in the basement there were no tools at all just boxes he knew there was a vast gulf between men who did things with their hands and men who didnt he didnt believe a man who didnt would actually take it upon himself to build a bomb the fbi was all over the newspapers with their big triumph cd said but to me the thing smelled to high heaven they couldnt find no trace of explosive residue in the house or office i dont know much about bombs but if theyre trying to tell me he built it i got to satisfy myself that hed have the confidence in his manual skills to do such a thing without leaving a crater over one half of cleveland county so cd set to work first piece of evidenceinsurance policies over not over to city boys like the fbi used to working organized crime whitecollar crime drugs that sort of thing nobodyd do nothing for less than a hundred grand but to a country person or a smalltime middleclass shop keep or justbarelymakingit professional man whos not got by on much his whole life and is way deep in debt thirtyfive thousand or so can sound pretty damned big this yielded him not twentythree names but fortyseven now he crossreferenced for some kind of explosives experience or exposure and achieved nothing none of the new names had any identifiable explosives experience so he figured the person must have gone to the library to learn he called the oklahoma city library and learned that of the fortyseven thirtyone held cards in its system computers were just coming in to use and he was able to examine the records of the thirtyone cardholders he discovered that one of them had checked out a book two months earlier called principles of explosive exploration a guidebook for petroleum geologists this happened to be one freddy dupont thirtyeight years old of midwest city okalahoma a dentist a dentist i thought cd told his listeners now why the hell is a dentist checking out books on oil field explosives and isnt a dentist by the very goddamned nature of his job the kind of manual tinkerer that would have the skill necessary to put something like a bomb together but it wasnt enough he needed a third piece of evidence so he took the book to an oil geologist he knew and said to the man i know what this book tells me what dont it tell me the geologist examined the volume for several minutes scanning the table of contents and the index and then said one word that sent a shiver down cds spine fuses thats what he said it didnt say nothing about fuses how to set the thing off whered a feller go to learn about fuses cd had asked him only one place i know the military was the reply he aint been in the military but then cd had a moment the military puts every damn thing it knows into field manuals it was pretty easy after that calling the us government printing office he learned that a dental hygienist named rose fluerry in dr duponts office for less than a year had ordered a field manual entitled special forces improvised field munitions detonation techniques an examination of the book yielded a blueprint for timing device simple with expedient materials which looked pretty goddamn much like the one the fbi said blew the airliner a days worth of surveillance revealed that in fact the dentist had moved in with rose fleurry another days investigation showed hed moved in the day after the blast that had claimed the lives of among others his wife and three children cd had picked up rose interrogated her gently for an hour and she had rolled over on her lover just that fast turned out she didnt care for him much anymore by that time he didnt put the toilet seat down and the fifty thousand dollars in insurance money on the wife and three kids strictly an afterthought a little fun money for a fling in mexico that he never got to take put him in the death house proud to say though goddammit the sentence was later reduced to life the funny thing is when we arrested himhe had model airplanes everywhichgoddamnwhere he loved airplanes but it was that third piece of evidence that done the trick this final observation fell on largely deaf ears for by now the old man had begun to bore the younger crowd cd felt it happen all the time they pretended to want to know but somehow they just didnt have the patience the concentration as they turned away to sleep for tomorrow cd pretended to go back to the data the osbi file on lamar but he reached into his coat pocket and slipped out the i w harper bottle the lid was loose with deft fingers he removed it he hunched seemed to shift in his old mans dryboned way and managed to draw a large fiery swig from the bottle it tasted like charcoal gun smoke and old plums it knocked him where he wanted to be which was into a state of blur bud rolled over trying to get to sleep on this job it was six on the damn block peeking into cars then twelve on the road for what was called aggressive patrolling and then six off and his six off was three gone and goddamned if old cd wasnt holding court with a bunch of bureau boys a couple of bunks on down the goddamned way there were dog teams outside yowling just in case an osbi helicopter made a buzz overhead every once in a while the communications center in one corner crackled and yammered men were cleaning guns that hadnt yet been fired sleep was a hard bargain tonight yet bud wasnt an unhappy man he and ted alternated on the driving and after close to twentyfive years of driving himself bud hated it when someone drove him and was it his imagination or was teds ambivalence about his life somehow expressing itself in his driving made bud pretty itchy to sit there while the boy diddled with the accelerator you go trooper you got to love to drive a car because thats percent of the duty day youll see death in all the ways it can come to drivers and youll give chase and maybe kill but it all turned on the powerful automobile you had to love that bitch on wheels or get another line of work but in three hours it would be his day to drive again a certain secret part of him responded to the pleasures of the wheel and he hoped they wouldnt nab those goddamned boys until after he had his eighteen but that was only a surface thing truth was bud felt another deeper pleasure though he could put no name on it for now in the temporary suspension of normalcy that the statewide manhunt brought he felt something singing and vibrant it was freedom or the illusion of freedom from it thats how he thought of it it it was it that was all it was it being the thing the mess the situation it meaning jen and the boys and the placid pleasures of duty versus the sweetness of renewal as experienced in young holly and all the pleasures it promised all the places to go all the ways to be bud was no romantic his idea of reading was the new guns ammo or car and driver and his idea of fun was to go to a high school baseball game and watch jeff play or to zero in the for deer season he went to the movies once a year which was one time too much he didnt watch tv since they took johnny off for that other goof and it still pissed him that they went and did such a goddamned fool thing mainly he just did his duty as he saw it hard and fair and expected otherwise to be left alone then it happened and all craziness broke out three months ago hed been cruising near to shifts end and had pulled off at a favorite place a diner called marys in the little town of cement where the coffee was hot and black and the hash browns crispy the way he liked them he was sitting at the counter taking his twenty when he heard his name bud sergeant bud pewtie he turned and there she was he remembered now when hed been partnered up with ted during teds sixmonth provisional hed met holly off and on and when ted got his first class stripe he and jen had the younger couple over to dinner to celebrate with a barbecue but then as ted changed hed drifted away and he hardly ever talked to bud anymore holly how are you damn what brings you up here the part of bud that he no longer thought he had reacted first it wasnt that holly was just pretty some other secret thing under her surface just teased him in a strange way her youth her boyish body those freckles that bright smile but most of all it was something behind her eyes something secretly merry and conspiratorial she was a plotter all right well bud truth is i came looking for you well sit yourself down and ill buy you a cup of coffee you ever hear of such a thing called a telephone real easy to operate you just drop a dime in and push some buttons and like magic youre talking to the man you want well bud thanks for the tip but it aint so easy i wanted it private you got it but this isnt some sad song i heard on the radio a hundred times and still cant say jack jump about that damn fool teds found a new girl or some such i know i look like ann landers but i dont have her wisdom my idea would be ill loan you the gun and you go shoot him i dont think ann would ever tell you that she giggled at old bud oh bud you love to flirt and make all the girls laugh dont you ill bet you were a pistol back in high school not so hed been a fullback big and awkward and a little smarter than people thought when they considered his bulk but no showboat with the girls hed married the first pretty one that was nice to him sure i was well anyway she said youre not far wrong but i dont think its a girl its just a thing hes just not there anymore i was wondering if somethings going on in the patrol or on the road i should know about it was true ted had drifted off he went his own way put in his hours and disappeared he was no longer a part of the elaborate smokey culturethe gym the shooting range the optional swat exercises the speed pursuit courseand when you took yourself out of that you sort of guaranteed youd stay at first class for a long time oh hes probably working some things out thats what he says when he says anything it can be a hard life but bud pewtie didnt let it turn him sour well old bud pewtie he went through his dog days too holly give him some room maybe he aint made to be a policeman thats okay no shame in that theres other things that he can do and make you and himself proud i swear it its a hard life and more than once ive regretted the path i chose well youre so john wayne i find that hard to believe but i love the way you tried to make me feel good she laughed and it suddenly occurred to bud how easy it would be for him to like her he wished sometimes hed stopped it there and just frozen that moment in his heart forever her laughter his pleasure in it her blinding beauty his sense of having done the right thing but a couple of weeks later having thought pretty much of nothing except her hed just up and called her one day and made up some pretext about teds problems and one damn thing led on to another it became it bud it was ted in the next bunk yes ted bud i cant sleep im gonna go sit in the car ted you need your sleep but i cant ted you have to be sharp is something bothering you ill tell you about it sometime bud youll know what i should do bud watched ted go on out he tried to feel something for ted shouldnt he feel awful partnered up with the man whose wife he was sleeping with but he didnt ted had made his own bed with his strange ways bud couldnt believe a bad thing about holly and some of the things shed told him made him sick ted watched dirty movies on the vcr alone late at night ted didnt seem to even think about touching her anymore ted just didnt care he was letting it drift apart ted partner you made a dumb mistake i wish i were man enough to help you out but i got too much involved they were on the swing between at chickasha and anadarko where the pye boys hailed from and where they just might head though bud thought not whatever lamar was he wasnt that dumb when ted finally broke his silence bud i got a thing or two on my mind well thats no place for a thing or two spit em out the young troopers face seemed to knit up in pain as he struggled for the words but then finally he relaxed a bit and just said it ah bud somethings been eating me alive for months now i even went to a psychiatrist through that employees assistance program the department of public safety runs but youre the first real person i breathed a word to well then youd best get it out just flat say it and well pick up the pieces and see what we got its this i dont think i got the guts for this line of work the pure guts so that was it the moment hung in the car on either side the countryside like a green river flowed by rolling yet mountain less the wheat fields and pastures and alfalfa fields all green in the sunlight soon anadarko would come up an ugly desolate little town with its customary bright strip of cheesy fastfood mills a mile off the dead center of town its a scary job ted every one of us feels it when we strap on the gun you run into a crazy a hoppedup tulsa gang banger a bad okabilly with an attitude you could stop a slug i feel it too specially in these crazy days where every goddamned body has a gun no bud youre just talking about duty anxiety thats what the shrink said but its something deeper well okay ted if you say so but i think everybody in our profession feels the horse collar about a year ago i had a bad tenseventy i got good radar on a nova about twenty miles below oklahoma city pulled him over it was around three in the goddamned morning not a soul about couldnt even see any lights on the horizon i did a run through dispatch and found there was no paper on the driver still i dont know why i was scared a trooper in maryland got one in the head just that way a few years back i remember ted i went to his funeral anyway i approached the car it was four blacks you know in the x caps the workout suits and man that car just reeked of grass theyd been having a high old time i like to got buzzed just standing there so i ask for the license and the guy hands it over and i feel these eight eyes on me and i look and theyre just staring at me the reefer smoke just pouring out of that car and im all alone and im thinking im dead im sure they were hauling a load and they were just staring at me waiting for me to make a move daring me to make a move and then i saw the first gun an ar like mine only with the shorty barrel it came up on the offdrivers side one of em gets out hes got a fucking uzi i see the guy in the back seat fiddling with something i couldnt even id some weird thing with ventilation holes in the barrel shroud a reddot scope a goddamned banana magazine and here i am with a smith and six cartridges goddamn bud my dad fought in vietnam and his dad fought in korea and world war ii and on down the line us pepper boys have stood up and been counted and all of a sudden it came over me so hard i thought id faint i dont have it ted so anyway i just handed the license back apologized for stopping and watched them go away they laughed i could hear them laugh as they pulled away i went back to the cruiser and i just cried i sat there and i cried ted just sat there face slack eyes dull burnt out used up hed let the thing eat him alive well ted youre a fine young officer bud finally said i think it would be a shame to let a thing like that worry on you too much sometime you got to back down those boys had you cold what was the point of getting killed for nothing theyve probably killed each other by now anyway why not just pass it as done and swear to do your best from here on out thats all bud havent you ever made a mistake dont you ever feel guilty no i dont suppose you do you just are naturally the kind of man who goes through life without screwing up god i wish i could be like you sometimes i think holly wishes i could be like you bud this and bud that that girl has a thing for you bud and for a while i hated you on account of it ted i no bud its not your damned fault well anyway thats it you got it i dont well ted the truth is i have never done a courageous thing in my life i dont have no idea how id be if theres lead flying about and i hope never to find out and theres all sorts of things about me you dont know bud said all units all units came the squawk over the statewide intercity net on the motorola both men suddenly started to listen osbi has just confirmed the location of the van thought to have been stolen by the inmate escapees pye and peed it was found in the parking lot of a hostess bakery and distributorship in ada where it had apparently sat for over thirtysix hours unnoticed goddamn said bud body in the back identified as willard jones twentyfour of ada we think were looking for victims car a blue eightyseven dodge dart plates limaxraypapa fiveninerseven dispatch said goddamn said bud that old lamars a smart one only place nobodyd notice a hostess van is in the hostess parking lot hes outside the ring now and nobody knows where the hell hes heading a quiver passed through bud lamar was smart and he was bad it was the worst news goddamn said ted glad you made me wear this damned vest chapter richard knew he was smart he read at three he was in gifted and special classes all the way through school with grades way off the charts and an iq that always opened eyes and his talent eerie vivid almost supernatural a special precious kind of boy who impressed all exposed to him all the way through but lamar was smart put richard on the street and hes dead put richard in jail and hes dead put him in russia in ancient rome on mars in the marine corps all those places hes dead not lamar lamar ends up running most of them or in their prisons running them lamar just knows always always figuring show him a problem and he breaks it down fast and right though not the way a normal man might he breaks it down so theres more for him and less for you thats his one moral law and having accepted it he has no qualms or doubts he works this law passionately and with straightforward conviction what is yeatss line the worst are full of passionate intensity thats it thats lamar a sly genius at disorder a prince of chaos these thoughts rocketed through richards ohsobusy brain as he drove the little trio in willard johnsons fouryearold dart west of ada toward ratliff city toward mr bill stepford srs place where mr stepford sr and family had some guns that they would take by any means possible richard tried not to think of that part these poor people were condemned hurricane lamar would hit them abetted by cyclone odell and wipe them out they were the dead sitting there in their little farmhouse even now watching the television finishing up the peach cobbler wondering about the upcoming grange meeting deer season and the possibility of oklahoma ever getting some sort of major professional sports franchise they had fought in wars and paid taxes and said their prayers for sixtyodd years and loved each other and the land that supported them and they were dead the existential majesty of it overwhelmed richard both lamar and odell were asleep in the back he could hear them breathing the evenoddevenodd rhapsody of their snores broken now and again by a belch or the rippling percussion of a smelly fart odell farted all the time and then smiled and said odell ma key stinky their presence held not only terror but squalor and banality as well they were so crude bald itchy raw unvarnished brutes of the id richard looked out the window at the silent alfalfa fields of oklahoma the long and dreadful wait in the van at last over he fought down a sob and studied a patch of sky riddled with stars richard thought i could do it i could slew the car off the road throw the door open and run run away flee the police would find me eventually i could explain just like the other thing its not my fault really i was made to do it i had no choice but he knew this was complete illusion he could no more get away from lamar than he could face him down and kill him lamar was everything lamar would run him down and break his neck with those strong hands watching him with those superficially charming but ultimately empathyless eyes then as he was dying of asphyxiation his spine having punctured his lungs lamar would fuck him in the ass laughing that would be how richard left this world he wouldnt do it of course it made him nervous to even consider such a thing if lamar could see what he was thinking lamar would kill him for thinking it lamar was an absolute god he demanded obedience as sternly as the figure in the old testament he looked out the window again be easy wouldnt it richard lamar asked softly from behind him it startled richard he jumped you scare so quick richard lamar laughed in a whisper but it would be easy wouldnt it what lamar you know dump us take off go on admit it you thought of it its not my nature to be bold no it aint i could see that from the start but i will change that richard i swear to you you stick with me i may not make you rich or even free but by god you will be a man do you read me yes sir said richard dont yousir me boy i aint no goddamned officer im your friend richard do you believe me your only friend yes lamar you dont like the killing do you no i dont son what that means you raised in a different place than lamar and odell where lamar come from you hadda fight like shit every damn day or someone take it all from you i do not enjoy it i am not a lowdown trashy man but a man has to do what he has to do to look after his people do you understand i do thats good thats very good no it was very bad because in the glare of their headlights a solitary mailbox stood against the glinting black tarmac before it and the fields of wheat country now fallow in summer behind it it said simply stepford party time said lamar it fell to richard lamar explained patiently this old farm lady she take a look at me and shes on the phone to the county sheriff i got something about me scares people you richard you got no tattoos and a girly body you couldnt hurt a flea so you knock on the door and get us in and when i come in you make sure that old man dont make it to no gun they parked halfway down the farm road richard could see the house its windows glowing standing in the middle of a barnyard the barn towering nearby it looked like a christmas card he yearned for moral destitution some sign of country decadence so that thered be some sense that these people deserved what lamar had in mind for them but no it was too pretty a banal quaintness possibly too studied a farm from a potemkin village odell split off back hed come in the rear when lamar came in the front it was about ten oclock why were the old people up so late yyou wont hurt them if you dont have to richard asked course not said lamar i aint lowdown only see we do need these guns suppose johnny cop pulls down on us go back to the pen let the niggers do us up you too up so fine even odell no sir cant let that happen okay just so i have your assurance you can count on me said lamar richard watched as he melted into the darkness he stood alone breathing hard in the brisk night hearing the wind beat through the trees and now and then the squawk and rip of small things in the dark fighting or dying there was no moon the stars rolled like wheat fields torrents of them high above remote pinwheels of ancient fire richard wanted to weep but he could only obey he counted in his head and when he reached the number three hundred off he went as he approached the house he could see the old man sitting in his study under some mounted game animals a glass gun case stood against the wall there was no old lady anywhere in sight but he saw the blue glow of a television from an upstairs room he prayed there werent grandkids or something in the house or visiting relatives he knocked on the door maybe theyd be smart nobody just opened the door to strangers in the night these days maybe theyd be smart and call the sheriff or get a gun and drive the interlopers away he knocked again praying for inaction the door opened wide why hello the woman said er hello im im an art teacher in oklahoma city my car broke down on the road i was wondering if you could call the triple a i dont have to come in and wait out there in the cold why i wouldnt hear of it thats the silliest thing i ever heard say you come on in out of the chill and well get the tow truck on its way do you like coffee lamar slid in like a shadow of a cat and seemed to envelope her muffling her cry he had the shank hard against her throat and richard fixated on the way its blade pressed against her white loose skin she made a weeping sound and in her desperation her eyes settled on richard they were widening in terror and begging please for mercy richard shuddered and looked away two loud crashes boomed through the house and odell for some bizarre reason without his shirt and with his hair wet and slicked back broke in from the rear an ax in his hand he paused to howl at the ceiling or the sky beyond the roof and richard watched in abject fascination as the cry arose from him and his body shivered in rapture all his demons were free and dancing in the room he raced for the study where the old man looked up at him in utter befuddlement then cowered from the blow he seemed about to receive from the immense halfnaked man with the ax the guns richard ordered lamar richard ran to the gun case its glass stopped him inside the gleaming treasures lay in repose he could see green and yellow boxes of cartridges stacked neatly in the corner he tried the handle but the thing was locked it baffled him and then the bafflement departed as the glass seemed to explode out at him odell had just blasted it with the ax wook oub said odell raising the ax in another mighty effort richard fell back as the ax smashed the door off the frame and odell greedily pulled a longbarreled gun from the rack and a box from the shelf and began inserting red tubes into the weapon with an oily klak he cycled it and turned dwan mub he commanded but the old man hadnt he sat there shaking literally stunned into shock from the way the universe had conspired in an instant to deconstruct his life lamar had dumped the old woman and came over to examine what lay before him goddamn he said almost immediately shotguns shotguns you dont got no pistols what the fuck is the matter with you you old piece of shit angrily he kicked the case then grasping his fury he took a shotgun off the rack and threaded shells into it he pumped it pointed it upwards and fired the noise was terrific richard had never been near a gun going off before in his life the pain of it assaulted his ears so loud a satisfying rain of plaster cascaded down on lamar who smiled at this tiny victory over the world odell was dancing merrily around the room now and then he would smash something and holler the two old people found each other at the couch the woman weeping in the old buzzards arms at last lamar went over to them i thought you hunted old fuck you im talking to you you want me to gut the heart out of that old bitch you talk to me motherfucker the old man glared up at him i gave up hunting deer last year sold all my center fires you what i killed over one hundred deer two elk three bears and a moose it was enough you fucking pussy i want center fire i want ooomph i want automatic i want a goddamn beretta i want colt i want magnum you dick sucking old puss i wouldnt even fuck your scrawny ass id give it to richard richard if he dont tell where the pistols are fuck his ass you hear me fuck him good up the ass and fuck his old lady up the ass tell him bill said the woman i cant said the old man tell him bill said the woman hell just take them and go out and kill people in the world hes going to kill us anyway were dead already it dont matter none he turned to lamar you know back in a lot of blond young men tried to kill me in airplanes called messerschmitts but i bombed their factories and killed their wives and children and destroyed their filth youre them you prison scum go ahead fuck my ass and fuck my old wifes ass you can hurt me but you cant scare me lamar for the first time in his life seemed a little unsure richard you hear that a goddamn hero odell its the pyes the old man told his wife on the news the escapees just the worst trash a sane society would have executed them both years back well to hell with you lamar pye and this simpleton and your little homosexual pal im not a homosexual said richard the old man spit on richard richard looked at the glob on his shirt then he looked at the old man he was one of those scrawny old types mostly leather and sinew with furiously burning blue eyes he looked like the sort of man who rose at four a every morning and gave hell in buckets to any and all that had displeased him over his long life he probably had a million dollars in the bank and believed he could take it to heaven with him his children probably all secretly hated him just as richard had secretly hated his father but like richard this mans children would never dare express their contempt directly you goin to let him do that said lamar why did he have to do that thought richard you cant let a man do that an old man with two shotguns on him who thinks hes a hero you got to break him down boy hes afraid said the old man i can smell it on him his underpants are brown and smelly it happened in the eighth air force all the time men like him they never made their twentyfive missions your underpantsa mess right richard swallowed yes as a matter of fact they were he wasnt sure when it had happened but now he knew that it had he swallowed again wondering who hed explain this to then kicked the old man in the leg way to go richard you show him you be a goddamned man richard shouted lamar everyone always talks lamar knew thats the rule but the old man had more grit than you find on the average yard and richard didnt have the stuff to get it out of him even though he kicked him a batch of times as he lay curled on the floor in front of his weeping wife okay richard lamar finally said not because he felt a pang of mercy for the square john but because richard was truly disgusting him his face all knit up like a girls as he pranced his prissy way around him kicking without a lot of force richard looked at him face twisted in emotion not rage exactly just some kind of terrible excitement shit lamar thought he looked like someone had stuck a pickle up his ass odell lamar commanded odell turned the old man over on his back and twisted his arm backward and up like a corkscrew until the old man screamed meanwhile lamar went looking for liquor could these people be christian teetotalers he had heard of such a thing but found it hard to imagine the screams behind him were irritating he wandered into the pantry didnt quality usually keep booze in a pantry lamar looked around he had never been in a house like this before he wondered what it would be like living in a house like this pictures of a bunch of kids on the walls he looked closely it was like they were from mars or something all these kids and these pretty women and handsome boys who had to be the old mans daughters or sons or something he wondered what it would be like to fuck a woman who looked like that they didnt look like the penthouse bitches with the perfect round tits and the creamy skin it looked fake even if most evenings it got you off these gals looked real somehow and sweet and tender he imagined the fear in their eyes if he decided to fuck them lamar hadnt had true pussy in almost a decade hed almost forgotten what it would be like even now he was a little unsure if hed taste it before they finally got him there it was brown bottles in a row in a locked cabinet he yanked the door open and a little piece of lock broke off some lock jack daniels old no tennessee drinking whiskey couldnt do better than that he unscrewed the cap took a swallow goddamn like wet smoke burns all the way down your eyes tighten like fists and little tears come to them only way the world would ever get tears out of lamar pye he took another quick swallow then put back the bottle best not to let odell know sober odell could be hard enough to handle drunk he could be death and impossible if billy cop came aknocking it wouldnt do any good to let odell be drunk because lord knew that goddamned richard boy would be no good in a fight with the law he wandered into the room with the television the news was on some trashylooking woman with an armful of babies was blubbering while two or three pretty girl reporters stood around and watched her melt down she was blubbering about her poor husband willard and what a good man he was lamar realized that was the wife of his willard in the truck goddamn willard he thought you sure married yourself an ugly woman but he sort of wished hed fucked her ugly or not he wanted to fuck something that was for sure maybe hed fuck the old man later next his own picture came on and somebody was talking about him saying the authorities considered the escapees to be armed and extremely dangerous wasnt that a mouthful the picture was the lineup shot from nine years ago when he had been picked up by ok city homicide after he and odell had tapped nicky pusateri for the pagans damnedest thing you just could never tell shot that little prick square in the back of the head seen him go down seen the blood squirt like tomato shot him again in the back and wrapped him in canvas and drove him twenty miles out and dumped him and he was alive after all that he was yes and the dicks had come for lamar finding him stoned on amphetamines and living with a woman named sally twoshoes an indian gal and sometime hooker who once in awhile would work a convenience store job with him and though nobody ever found out about it had killed her own father by drowning him in the toilet when he was drunk hed been making her blow him from the time she was ten on until she finally killed him age fourteen anyway theyd dragged lamar into downtown ok city some fancy building and taken his pictures he remembered one of the dicks smelled of garlic lamar looked at the picture again in the second before it vanished he was wearing a golf shirt the only one hed ever had with a little alligator on the pocket made him look like a pussy whyd he ever bought that shirt his nose was squashed and his eyes dull and unfocused because hed been sliding off the uppers his lower lip hung open because his face was so relaxed on the drug downslope his hair was long though pulled tight behind him he looked stupid it had been his last instant of freedom then some anchorwoman came on she was pretty like the farmers daughters and the girl reporters with willards wife maybe prettier he wondered how it would be to fuck her too she was talking in a low urgent voice about how dangerous these men were and how they should be avoided at all costs until the authorities finally caught up to them she talked about the terrible obscenity tattooed on lamars knuckles and she talked about how three men were already dead her face got all long and somber it somewhat tickled lamar the edge of breathy fear in her voice he liked that a lot he knew he scared square people they looked into his eyes and they just saw pain and horror that is if they looked into his eyes and they seldom did or seldom had even back in the world you tattoo a f u c k and a y o u i on your knuckles tends to chill the straights out lamar it was richard yeah we got em it was a vault the old lady gave us the combination what happened to the old man he isnt breathing too well he should have made it easy on his self saved us the trouble see what it got him oh well fuck him if he cant take a joke they walked on downstairs then into the basement a shelf holding jelly jars set in the wall folded out on hinges to reveal an open tredlock gun vault that stood about four feet tall and whose shelves appeared to display all the handguns known to man fiftysix thirtythree oheight said richard proudly i opened it myself out of deference to lamar not even odell had dipped inside lamar reached in and touched handguns many of them turn on the goddamned light he said the light came out lamar examined the wares and at last discovered what it was he wanted yes the man was a pistol shooter all right and lamar quickly seized what would be his prize it was a automatic with an extremely long slide and barrel maybe eight inches it had fancy sights mounted low to the slide he looked to see that it was a colt all right but someone had added a new inscription under the colt name that said clark custom guns new iberia la a bullseye gun asked lamar go to hell said the old man crumpled on the floor face swollen i do believe i will yes sir said lamar but it is a bullseye gun aint it bill was state pistol champ standing bull rapid fire three years in a row back in the seventies said the woman itd be a treat to see him shoot one day said lamar but that aint gonna happen then he reached inside the safe and came out with some thing else it was a big colt magnum revolver with a fourinch barrel called a python he handed it to richard here he said youre a man now then he turned to the old lady i bet you know how to cook real good howd you like to who mp up a real country breakfast eggs bacon juice the works i am hungry as hell and so are my friends grandma dont help him a bit said the old man you are going to kill us said the old lady yes maam i probably will have to not on account of not liking you but because thats the way things is but could we eat first i suppose so said the old woman youre a fool mary said the old man now bill said lamar marys just trying to be a good neighbor chapter must be some kind of trash bud thought amazed at the speed with which he raced through his betrayals it was so easy it grew to be a habit second nature he could call jen and bluff his way through a desolate little communication subconsciously calculated to stay uncommunicative because the less he talked the less likely hed screw up then hed call holly and be so sweet and kind and decent just that simple that fast made him sick but he could not stop doing it he was in the pay phone outside jims diner in ratliff city on oklahoma about halfway between duncan and south to dallas wasnt much here the diner a sunoco a laundromat and a convenience store the diner was known for chili but it was too early for chili about ten in the morning and theyd been on the road since six part of a larger sweeping movement aimed at trying to intercept intercept what the inmates those boys hadnt been seen or heard from since the discovery of the truck with the body in it thirtysix hours ago the phone rang twice then jen picked it up hi how are you thanks for the uniforms jen a slave always to her many jobs had driven up to the chickasha facility with five fresh uniforms in a plastic bag plus underwear and socks as bud was running low off his first supply well she said thats fine were all right here so how are owl her voice was so jen far away distant with an undercurrent of some distress but nothing you could put your finger on fine you know its beginning to get damn dreary and nobodys got no idea in hell where these boys are theyre going to call off the roadblocks and roving patrols sometime soon maybe as soon as tomorrow its pointless its terrible what they did to that poor vending service man jen said yes it is isnt it theyre bad boys how are the kids russ got his college board scores they were so high we should be proud of him he takes after you hows jeff doing oh hes fine he had a game last night but it was close and he didnt get in but he was in a good mood afterward the boys went out for pizza and he went along i should be there this damn job ill be there next year oh bud what is it he said glancing at his watch were you over near the fort on friday little signal of distress friday yes hed been with holly in a motel room for a couple of hours place was called the wigwam a little down from the number four gate to fort sill catering mainly to visiting military families it was run by a retired city cop who let bud have the room for free around midday bud was surprised at how hard this hit him he had never had any trouble before he looked up and saw poor ted sitting at the counter over an untouched plate of eggs and a halfgone coke talking to the waitress no no cant say that i was he lied trying to force some innocence into his voice and feeling himself fail miserably marge sawyer swears she saw you pulling out of some parking lot she honked and you didnt see her i only mention it because she wanted me to ask you if you knew that part of town by the base if you could recommend a good motel something a little less expensive than the holiday inn but in town not at the airport her sister is no jen wasnt me he barked i dont know nothing about that part of town he said feeling the lies awkward in his mouth look ive got to get back on the road call you tonight if possible sure bud hung up feeling he had done badly and furious at himself for it it was a bright morning and he was surprised to find how hard he was breathing who the hell was marge sawyer what had she seen hed been in uniform that day too so there could be no mistaking damn it had been a foolish thing to do best to cut back for a while or something he dropped another quarter and dialed the number she picked up right away oh bud its been so long since you called you said youd call last night now this always irritated bud and in his present mood it struck a bad note sometimes just the managing of it got to be so damned troublesome that he needed a night off there was always so much to remember why he was late what had happened what route hed taken home all the things that go into running a deception and sometimes it just wore him down i couldnt get any time away from ted they got us running all over the damn place ive only got a second well how are you holly wanted to know well its a hell of a lot more boring than just patrolling ill tell you that but i think theyre going to pull back after a while this road stuff aint panning out bud you sound so irritated im just tired holly i miss you sweetie i miss you too the day they break it offwill i see you well ill sure try he said feeling vaguely trapped i dont know if its possible i already missed one of my sons games and i want to get to the next one in case he gets to play okay she said in a tone that suggested it wasnt i do miss you i know you do talk to you soon he hung up feeling sour as hell hadnt he just promised her that on the first day off hed see her great hed be exhausted and what would the situation be with ted wouldnt he be off the same day it was a mess sometimes bud didnt know what the hell hed do so after indulging the sourness for a few seconds he headed back into the diner and slid in next to ted how is she ted asked fine just fine you call holly oh hollys okay i suppose ted said well i reckon we should shove huh bud shot a look at his watch tenfifteen yeah they were due back on the road just in case he didnt like to be out of radio contact that long didnt realize hed been on the phone for close to ten minutes he took a last sip of coffee lukewarmand stood to peel some money off for the food not strictly necessary but bud knew that if you started eating for freeit was so easypeople soon stopped respecting you he left a single for the girl also irked that ted never bothered to pitch in at least with a tip oh bud said ted one thing this girl here she wanted to ask you something bud turned to the woman a middleaged waitress with the name ruth on the nameplate of her uniform she was vaguely familiar from previous stops but hed never struck up a relationship with her as he had with a few of the girls in other towns yes ruth well sergeant its old bill stepford hes stopped off for coffee each morning for the past ten years every morning nine oclock sharp he didnt show this morning it sort of bothered me i told her it was something for the murray county sheriffs office ted said well theyre all out playing hero ruth said sam nicks hasnt set foot in this place since the jailbreak up at mcalester did you think about calling this farmer bud asked yes sir i did the line was busy called four times and the line was busy maybe hes talking to somebody well maybe he is but i know mr stepford and he is not the talking type what about his wife ted asked well shes a mighty nice woman but shes not the sort to spend half an hour on the line either sounds like the phone is off the hook said bud bill stepford hasnt missed coffee here in ten years he came the last time we had heavy snow drove his wagoneer through the drifts he likes our coffee bud considered where is it seven miles down the road then left on county road six seventynine a mile youll see the mailbox im afraid maybe he fell or something cant get to the phone people shouldnt live so isolated like that well said bud ill call dispatch and see if anythings going on they need us for if not maybe well take a spin by lamar let richard shower and sleep first because richard had driven while lamar and odell slept so richard sank into dreamless oblivion a mercy but when lamar shook him awake at nine he was still in the stepfords upstairs bedroom still an escaped convict still in the company of murderers richard pulled on a pair of bill stepfords jeans and a blue workshirt and then settled in to do two things at once under lamars instructions he was to sit in the upstairs bedroom and keep watch just in case and he was to draw lions ah now lamar with everything thats going on yes sir i want it done i want it perfect so that when the time comes we can move to the next step what next step anyway he now sat doodling the original muchstudied sketch before him it was beginning to fade into gibberish just a random blotch of lines he wondered what lamar saw in it to begin with he knew it was insufferably banal a lion a woman some sort of crazed aryan fantasy something out of the hyperborean age it matched exactly la mars arrested stage of development but it had nothing to do with art it was rather something out of that great unwashed fantasy life of the lumpen proletariat that expressed itself on the sides of vans or in comic books or boorish bloody boring movies it was so coarse untainted by subtlety or distinction yet it had saved his life he knew it had in some way tamed lamars rage and redirected it made lamar see there was more to life than predation and the drawing itself there was something wildly savage and free in it that lamar himself had responded to but which richard had since been unable to capture whether he stuck with lions or moved on to tigers and eagles when he thought about it it went away you just couldnt do something like that offhandedly it was a leftbrain rightbrain thing lamar had understood and let richard have a little bit of room on the issue but now he was pressing him for results fortunately the farmer had a large selection of paper and pencils available working with a no richard sat at the window looking out dreamily and tried to imagine some savage savannah where man and cat were the same creature but woman was still woman and on this plain the strongest ruled by tooth and claw and without mercy and of these creatures the most powerful and cunning was lamar lamar the lion who wasnt merely a killer but also a shrewd and cunning king richards pencil tip flew across the page he felt deeper into the concept of lion than ever before as if hed somehow entered the red zone the mindset of the jungle where you looked at other lifeforms and one question entered your mind what does it taste like he stopped hmmm not bad dreamily he looked out the window he tried to imagine a plain dotted with zebra and giraffe and cape buffalo and little wily antelopes and the everpresent hyenas and he almost saw it too though the illusion proved difficult to sustain when he noticed a blackandwhite oklahoma highway patrol cruiser rolling down the road toward the house even though bud was driving he was still in his surly mood ted you really ought to call holly nah was all ted could say shell be worried he said the truth is bud said ted we just dont have much to talk about these days i let her down too i can see in her eyes i dont mean a thing to her goddamn how i love her and there she is and i cant reach her bud swallowed uncomfortably something seemed to come up into his throat ted was truly miserable stewing in his own pain now you and jen you have a perfect marriage youre a team shes a part of your career shes happy with what you got she never puts any pressure on you well ted you know that appearances can be deceiving not yours bud ted look were going to have to have a talk a talk about some things you think i am that i am not and about some other stuff as well what but they had arrived in the barnyard of the stepford farm the house was white clapboard an assemblage of structures added as the farm prospered the lawn was neat and someone had planted a bright bed of flowers by the sidewalk a huge oak tree towered over the house bud and ted climbed out bud adjusted his raybans and removed his smokey hat from the wire rack behind his seat and pulled it on he looked about there was a fallow field where the spring wheat had already been harvested and the earth turned copses of scrub oak showed here and there among the gentle rolls of the land and far off a blazing bright green field signaled the presence of alfalfa there was a bluestern pasture off to the right and a few cattle grazed amid the barrels of hay looks okay to me said ted the goddamned phone is probably off the hook hello cried bud and then again there was no answer lets go up and knock and see what happens richard ran downstairs he knew he shouldnt scream but he wanted to the panic billowed through him brightly he wanted to crap again his stomach ached as he raced thumpingly along lamar he sobbed lamar lamar oh lamar he plunged down the steps in the darkness of the basement odell was over by the workbench sawing with a hacksaw richard looked and saw three long metal poles on the floor and three wooden boots or something lamar looked over at him lamar he gasped cops state police lamar just looked at him blankly then he said how many a goddamned team swat what or just a one car i only saw one said richard halfway up the driveway be here in a minute lamar nodded he turned and looked at the stepfords who sat groggily on an old couch you make a sound and youre dead i mean that sir and i aint afucking with you his voice was level but intense odell meanwhile had risen from his position and was busy threading ammunition into the shotguns that richard now saw had been sawed off so that they were short and handy lamar took one threw some sort of lever with an oily clang were going upstairs you tie these people up and i mean tight then you come up you hear shooting you come arunning do you get that and bring your gun hootin said odell happily yes lamar said richard okay odell said lamar we goin fry us some smokey lamar stuffed a dozen bright redandblue shells into his pockets and odell followed they raced up the steps lamar watched them a guy with some miles on him and a kid standing in the sun just looking the place over the older one called out hello and adjusted his duty belt then he got his smokey hat out and set to fiddling with it he wanted it just right just set perfect on his head showofiy cocksucker the kid looked somewhat grumpy maybe tired he wanted to get it over with lamar knew they were cherry he could smell it on them they had no idea what they were walking into if they had theyd have had their pieces out and theyd be behind cover he watched as they exchanged a few dry words then made up their minds to come up to the house he could tell also that the young one had a vest on by the unnatural smoothness of the way the cotton of his shirt clung to the kevlar the older one though barrelchested and big was apparently without body armor for there was more give in the material as he moved odell you go out the back around the side of the house on the left you aint gonna fire until i do you wanna do the old guy first same as me he may have been in a scrape or two and maybe has been shot at he probably wont panic so bad as the other but main thing is they cant reach the goddamn cruiser because then theyll call it in and in two minutes they got the goddamned backup in we gotta take em out clean you got that sweetie kwean said odell you shoot for the head on the boy aim high try and hit him in the face the old boy you can gut shoot him he aint wearing no vest odell darted out the back shotgun in hand lamar moved up to the left of the window they were too far for a shotgun if this goddamned old farmer had had an assault rifle he could have taken them both out with one fast semiauto string he had four shells in his cut down browning auto a pocketful of spares and his goddamned longslide but he hated to shoot it out with a handgun too many its or maybes with a handgun the excitement in him was incredible but so was the giddiness he almost giggled bliss boomed through him he tried to chill himself out but goddamn this was going to beyn when to fire fire when they knock on the door fire through the goddamned wood blow em back but maybe the buckshot didnt have enough power to get through the wood and would spend itself getting through it no best to let em get within ten feet and then pull down knock em down with the shotgun then close and finish them off with the oooooooeeeeeeee barbcued smokey they walked up toward the house a large dragonfly flashed in the sun bud saw the flowers and the love of flowers the owners had put into them jen was like that too it seemed strange they hadnt come out to greet the policemen as farm people were among the last in america to still show respect to the badge he had turned to ted to remark on the stillness of it when ted exploded ted didnt actually explode he was simply standing stricken in a sudden cloud of red mist and his throat had gone to pulsing colors and his eyes had widened with horror to bud it seemed as if they had stepped through a glass door into another world and were suddenly ensnared in a medium of molasses or oil something thick that dampened all sound and made their motions utterly painful and slow there was no noise at all or if there was bud didnt hear it a bit he felt the stings as though being attacked by a swarm of bees and had a sense that a leg had died on him and then the world flashed orange and he had no sense of anything as if hed been somehow snatched from time itself and then he returned to earth a second later surprised to find himself down on the ground he had no memory of falling blood was everywhere he looked at poor ted who was bleeding even more profusely at the throat and screaming soundlessly a starburst had fractured the left lens of teds raybans blood ran in a snaky little line down from the obscured eye it all seemed to be happening so slowly and he could make no sense of it at all though the air seemed full of dust and insects and then he realized they were taking shotgun fire from the left window and that he had been hit bad boomy boomy boomy gun go boo myjerky shell outta poppy gun go boomyjerky again ha ha makey smoke ma key fire bad uns fall down go hurt red on them look it red boomy ma key red mar go loadyshooty loadyshooty loud dell ma key gun go boo my again put in shell thing gun go klack then gun go boo my odell laughed funny so funny im hit oh god screamed ted blowing through the soundless ness now there was noise everywhere buds ears were ringing in pain and it was so loud he hurt he had a coppery taste in his throat as if hed just had a penny sandwich his lungs creaked and the rasp of teds breathing sounded louder than a buzz saw bud didnt remember drawing the smith but he just had it there in his hand out of some miracle or something and he was pumping off rounds at the broken window just squeezing and squeezing and then another rake of pain ripped across his chestvest vest he mournedand he went down flat the gun was lost then he had it again and brought it up and fired but came up with nothing but the sounds of hammer striking empty primer he opened the gun and six shells fell out he stared at it dumbly speedloader speedloader clumsily he grabbed at a speed loader from the pouch but his fingers were thick and greasy with blood it fell from them and rolled in the dust picking up grit where it was smeared with red im hit oh god im hit wailed ted cover bud was thinking cover the car was too far he rose and halfyanked ted to the tree ten feet away a large man ran at him and bud lifted the smith to fire and the man ducked bud couldnt figure out why the gun didnt fire he looked oh yes he hadnt reloaded the speed loader lay in the dust he thought he had another in the pouch reload reload he told himself pulling the second speed loader out he dropped it too then he remembered teds gun and tried to get it out but the security holster wouldnt permit the piece to be withdrawn ted shivered desperately beneath him blood pulsed out of a hole under his ear and his whole face was spotted with blood his legs were also bleeding i cant see he said oh christ bud i cant see be cool be cool bud said trying to make sense of it he picked up his dropped speed loader and somehow got the tips of the six cartridges it held inserted in the chambers he twisted the knob and the shells dropped into the gun he slammed the cylinder shut and looked around for targets but he could see nothing the car he thought get to the radio get backup do it do it now ted i gotta run to the car dont leave me please dont leave me richard tied the last knot too tight and felt the old man shiver in the cruelty of it but he didnt care he had other things to do he looked at the two of them trussed like pigs under other circumstances a tragic scene but not now he raced up the stairs to the kitchen his thought now get out of here he would run to the barn and into the fields beyond he simply would disappear while the shooting was going on they would find him later he would convince them he had nothing to do with it but he was halfway through the kitchen when the first blast came even louder than the one lamar had fired last night it was like being inside a kettledrum he dropped instantly his face on the floor boom boom boom it would not stop the noise level just rose and rose and rose he had no idea guns were so loud he lay there on the floor and began to cry please dont let me be hurt he tried to free himself from ted and looked for targets but smoke and dust hung in the air illuminated by the sun he blinked nothing made a lot of sense shotguns two shotguns that much he knew he thought he saw movement at a corner of the house and fired twohanded this time fast two shots and when he rose to run to the car a blast took his legs out from under him and blew him down the gun skittered away he couldnt see the gun he tried to crawl dont leave me please ted yelled grabbing at his ankle he craweled a bit further until he looked up at lamar pye standing over him well howdy dad said lamar oh christ said bud yes sir i was you id make my peace too mr smokey fuck you said bud oh aint you a bull stud though odell come see what we have done bagged coupla smokies he turned back to bud liked that speed reload you done under fire right nice give this to youyoure a professional you just got outsmarted odell get that other boys gun from him odell pye amazingly big his red hair tossed every which way his face blotchy with pimples and freckles walked over to where ted cowered bleeding he kicked him hard in the back in pain ted spasmed outward and odell reached down and yanked his gun from him gun said odell proudly lifting teds smith that it is odell that it is lamar turned to bud now dad case you dont know it your bacon is fried i got no beef agin most cops just other stiffs doing their jobs but you smokies shot and killed

went to the car bud heard the report as he fired a shotgun shell into the radio then a second later he heard the trunk open eeene gun eene gun sang odell and bud saw that he had shaken the case off teds ar shit he thought then he thought can i make it to my backup he had the smith around his ankle when lamar turned bud lunged he got to the gun but he couldnt get the thumb snap off clean because there was so much blood on his hand and his thumb kept slipping time he got it off lamar had leaned a big boot on his ankle pinning it and had reached down and removed the gun big boy like you little lady thang like this you ought to be ashamed he tpssed the gun away dont kill me please dont kill me shouted ted ted shut up yelled bud i dont think he can hear you said lamar i think he done lost his

amazement tell you what he said how bout if i kill both you and then you can argue in heaven over which one i should have killed he thought his own joke was pretty funny but then he turned to odell

it would not stop hurting he looked so much blood he must have been hit a hundred times he never guessed he had so much blood in him it hurt to breathe it hurt to think lamar had gone somewhere he was alone he thought of jen oh christ hed been such a bad husband all the things hed never said or did and at the end all that time with holly why why wasnt i a good man i only wanted to be good and it all came to this and he thought of his youngest son jeff oh jeff i wanted to be there for you so bad i wanted to help you show you things and if you needed a little extra help i wanted to give it to

were next a twerpylooking white boy was drivingthat goddamned richard peed lamar and odell walked over lamar said you made your peace with the lord yet trooper eat shit said bud lamar walked over to ted ted had folded into a fetal position half on his belly and his side and was weeping softly lamar bent over him with the and shot him in the back of the head his hair jumped a little as the bullet tore into it then he turned to bud but the was empty and its slide had locked back he handed the gun to odell and brought his shotgun to bear the range was about twentyfive feet you shoulda worn your vest sarge said lamar merrily bud crumpled against the buckshot and heard no noise he was in the center of an explosion red everywhere the smell of dirt and smoke in his nose the sense of heat and the thousand things that tore into him he felt his soul depart his body chapter they traveled in silence for the longest time odell behind the wheel beaming with bliss a wary lamar next to him and richard and the rigid stepfords in the back seat at one point mrs stepford whispered something to her husband excuse me he said missus has to go wee wee lamar said im sorry maam but i have to ask you to squeeze it in a mite longer we have to make some tracks what the hell difference does it make said mr stepford youre going to kill us same as you done them law enforcement boys just cooperate okay old man i got to concentrate on where im going they drove onward over country roads right at the speed limit but never breaking any laws they heard no sirens and the radio announced no discoveries of police bodies they saw no helicopters okay said lamar looking at a map you want to go on straightystraight no tumee yall keep your eyes open for cox city where were going to go left on to bray he cant read the signs but he can drive straight and turn when i tell him where are we going lamar asked richard richard i aint ready to talk to you yet got to figure this out yet and what im going to do with you you just be quiet did i do anything wrong but lamar just glared ahead finally past empire city lamar took off his hat it was a wide white stetson once mr step fords finest sundaygotomeeting hat he made a show of examining the small pinfeather in the band but it was clear he had made a decision he pirouetted around in the seat to face the three in the back now richard he finally said with a good deal of weariness i want to knowwhere the hell were you during the fight ah said richard ah i went through the kitchen after odell i was going to circle around from the other direction see only it was over before i got there werent not said mr stepford i could hear him he was lying on the goddamned kitchen floor he was crying i believe youd make a better outlaw than this poor richard boy here dont you mr stepford believe i would lamar though i dont run with no trash like you boys well anyway said lamar richard what the hell am i going to do with you you got to do more than just art lamar you know this isnt my cup of tea it sure aint but if i cant trust you to back me up in a scrape what the hell good are you we are in scrape city from here on out lamar i dont even know how to shoot the g lamars arm flashed back and he slapped richard hard with the hat across the face it didnt hurt so much as shock richard who looked at lamar with utter dismay this merely made lamar more angry and he commenced to beat heavily on richard with the hat slapping it at him richard cowered covering himself with his arms that used to be a fine hat said stepford at last lamar settled down he turned back to the front breathing heavily his anger had mottled his face red his lungs wheezed and ached in his chest he said to odell pull over anywheres fine this big field odell slowed the old wagoneer down let it slew off the gravel shoulder a bit then eased it across the drainage ditch and into a field he let the smooth veight perk for a few moments then satisfied he turned the key and let it go silent the road a narrow black ribbon cut across the wide flatness of cotton and peanut fields no cars were anywhere in sight the sky was huge piled with clouds like castles some scrub oaks lay a quarter mile to one side okay folks he said time to get out dont do this lamar said mr stepford you are scum but you cant do this to us you have come to admire my wifes cooking and my fine collection of guns which served you well in the fracas i have to do what i have to do old man you too richard you got to come too oh god lamar said richard stop your sniveling richard said mrs stepford lamar do what you will but shut this boy up he giving me a headache but can i pee first ive been he tin very tight yes maam odell will watch because nothing at all to him the rest of you v lady some privacy ca they did as he commanded w because off it wasnt fair he had tried he had wanted so hard to do what was expected of him lamar please shut up richard you all set mrs stepford thank you maam this way he walked them into the field it was near twilight the sun was setting in an orange smear it looked like a constable sun to richard utter serenity lay across the land it was the exact opposite of the pathetic fallacy nature was being ironic damn her exquisiteness they wandered across the field richard felt as if he were an ant on a pool table the horizon around them was remorselessly flat they came after a time to a fold in the land and stepped down into a gang of scrub oak trees abutting a messy little creek it was utterly private okay said lamar this will do have yall made your peace with god you piece of shit lamar said stepford dont make it hard on yourself old man it dont have to hurt a damned bit dont run or nothing theres only pain in it hold me bill said the old woman you are a goddamned beautiful woman mary said bill stepford to his wife he was crying a little you gave me fifty great years and you never complained a bit mary i wasnt a decent husband i had an affair i had many affairs the sharecroppers daughter maggie minnie purvis in town al jeffersons niece the secretary mary i am so very sorry its all right i knew about them she turned to lamar this man flew fifty missions over germany in the war he was wounded twice and won the distinguished flying cross though he says its nothing he came back and built a farm up from fallow ground and was the grange president for twelve years he raised four sons and two daughters and gave work to over a hundred itinerant laborers and their families he paid for their medical while they was here and for three of their children to go to college and he never asked for nothing he is a good man you have no right to end his life in this field he is a good man said lamar and i dont have no right at all except that i have the gun and that gives me the right he turned to richard here he said handing him the troopers silver revolver this belonged to that dead cop that old boy was mean as cat shit right up to the end maybe some of that grit will rub off on you shoot them both in the head or i will kill you then he raised the longslide automatic thumbing off the safety and leveled the muzzle at richard richard swallowed he dont have the guts said stepford well you just give him the chance said lamar go on richard show me you are a man do some mens work richard turned the old people were on their knees mr stepford held mrs stepford who had begun to cry richard felt queasy as hell here was the naked thing its own self put the muzzle to the head and pull the trigger be over in a second but he didnt have the guts it was too horrible would their heads blow up would it squirt would it be gory wouldnt there be blood everywhere he turned and faced lamars gun and saw his own death in lamars blank eyes oh shit he said he remembered the classic yale experiment where most typical americans routinely pumped up the juice and tortured some poor fool because somebody told them to well this was different his life was on the line he turned and pressed the gun against mrs stepfords neck and closing his eyes pulled the trigger nothing happened except a click he pulled it again its broken he said richard you are so dumb said lamar get your ass back to the car richard scampered back see he said he do have the guts to do it he just too dumb to know the gun werent loaded sorry to put you folks out had to test the boy he aint much but i dont guess youll be signing up mr stepford so ill have to make do lamar you like to scared mary to death couldnt be helped got to do what i got to do that simple you get in my way on a job old man ill shoot you dead but you have sand that i admit you took all i had to hand out and i respect that believe it or not youd last on the yard and that poor boy would die if i hadnt saved him now you all stay here tonight it wont get cold come morning you amble over to the road well be long gone by then youll be back home tomorrow lamar said mary stepford you are a bad man and they will kill you far sooner than you plan on but maybe itll be fast on account of what mercy you showed today thank you said lamar that may be the nicest thing anybody said to me sorry we had to steal from you and take your guns but i have to do what i have to do goodbye lamar said mary lamar turned and walked back to the car bill watched him go mary you are such a fool that man is pure white scum hell be dead before sunrise tomorrow or the day after and a lot of folks will go with him cant believe the softness in your heart for such a scoundrel well bill stepford she said hes everything you say and worse but hes one thing you never were as i have known and lived with for many a year hes true to his own they drove south then west in the setting sun through farmland and small dull towns finally richard said thank you lamar thank you richard odell richard proved he was a man he can pull the trigger dell poppypoppy said odell with a smile that means odell is happy richard you have made that poor soul happy you are part of the family thank you lamar now we got to find us a place to hunker up and work out our next move lamar i hope you like to camp richard me and odell spent more than a few nights under the cold stars it aint a problem cant check into a hotel and dont want to go running with the biker gangs because johnny cop has them so snitched out you cant spit amongst em without hitting a badge or a microphone i dont feel like kicking down no doors at least not for a bit too much to worry about well try and lay about a time in the back lands richard only had one gift it wasnt much but he had been hording it for this moment when he at last felt hed passed a test lamar what i think i may have a place to stay he said chapter he felt his lips first it was as if they were caked in mud or scab or something experimentally he tried to move them and felt them crack apart breaking into plates of dry skin there was no moisture in his mouth he heard the dripdripdrip of something he could not move his body was hardly there he seemed unable to focus or remember anything except orange flashes flowers the buzz of insects then he remembered lamar leaning over ted and the way teds hair puffed from the muzzle blast he remembered curling he remembered the shotgun shell tearing into him he remembered the pain jen jeff russ lost they were all lost he felt like his own father that handsome rigid man glossied up in funeral parlor makeup asleep in his coffin redder and pinker in death than hed ever been in life but there was light and maybe now that he concentrated sound it was as if he were swimming up from underwater a long long way toward the surface he just barely broke it and the smell of something came to his nose bourbon it c d henderson of the osbi was looking at him through specs the lieutenant fell in and out of focus now he was an old man now a pure jangle of blur finally he cranked into some kind of stability hes coming to the lieutenant said as if into a megaphone the words reverberated in buds skull jen appeared he tried to reach out of death for her but he was ensnared in a web she appeared griefstricken her face grave and swollen he had not seen such feeling on that impassive face in so very long jeff swirled into view intense and troubled russ even russ who never went anywhere with them anymore russ looked drained of anger and distance and bud could see the child in him still under the intensity of his stare oh bud dont you dare die on me jen said he couldnt talk dad jeff said jeff was crying oh god daddy you made it were so damned lucky he saw the plasma bag suspended over one bandaged arm and another bag dripping clear fluid over the other he lay swaddled in bandages he felt something attacking his penis and squirmed thinking of rats then he remembered from other visits to emergency wards a catheter he was so thirsty jeff he said finally jeff kissed him on the forehead he wished he could reach out and stroke his sons arm or something but he couldnt move now and then a shot of pain would cut at him russ reached over and just touched him on the arm bud nodded and blinked at his oldest son hes coming out a young man in a hospital uniform said and bud saw his nameplate which read dr something or other when had doctors gotten so young he looked back to jen he felt a tear forming in his eye he saw young jeff so fair and pure and russ with all his complicated brains and hopes and hair and recalled again the bullet blowing into poor teds skull why did i do so poorly caught me without a thought in my head came in and took me down took us down lamar pye blew us away youre going to be all right sergeant pewtie said the doctor the blood loss is the main thing another hour and youd have bled to death that old guy was tough ill say buds eyes must have radiated confusion because jen explained old bill stepford he hiked thirteen miles through the dark until he came to a farm and called the police they got there by midnight theyd been looking everywhere but had no idea what had happened you almost bled to death that was three days ago tttted he managed dont you worry bout ted said c d henderson he aint in no pain where he is now he had to know one last thing even as the effort of asking it seemed to drain him of energy and will why why said cd because that damned lamar is scum thats why bud shook his head imperceptibly why am i alive cause you aint a dove thats why said cd old man stepford was a dove hunter come the fall only shells lamar could find was light birdshot numbers eight and nine a surgical team had you on the table over four hours bud dug close to a thousand pieces of steel shot out of your hide but not none of them lifethreatening and there aint going to be no lead poisoning neither lamar popped you with maybe five six shells from a sawedoff barrel he must have thought hed blown your heart and guts out from all that blood hah goddamned good thing you left your goddamned vest off but anyway hed sawed that barrel off to a nub and the shot pattern opened up and nothing got inside your chest cavity or to your spine and nervous system or your brain tell you what though you aint goin through no metal detector no more bud bud slept until he swam up again to brightness this time he focused onto the face of col w d supenski superintendent of the highway patrol the colonel was another version of bud husky and remote with the public with one of those pouchy faces that looked like feed sacks left out for a decade on a fence post hed been a marine fighter ace in the vietnam war all those years back and in the company of those he trustedother white men who carried guns and believed in the abstraction of authoritycould be quite a folksy old charmer well damn bud he said not even old lamar pye could put you out of commission the colonel had small dark eyes that were capable of three expressions blankness sick consuming fury and genuine delight it was the latter force that beamed through them today though i must say ive seen turkeys hanging in the barn that looked a sight better bud offered a feeble smile no one in his family was in evidence been talking to jen bud shes a fine woman you are a lucky lucky man there bud bud nodded bud its my great pleasure to tell you that the department of public safety and the oklahoma highway patrol has decided to confer on you the highest duty award it is within our power to give the medal of valor bud swallowed we found six spent cases from your bud and your empty speed loader severely wounded and under fire from two sides by murderous killers you were able to draw and engage the enemy and even reload and maybe it was the fear you put in the pye boys that made em release the stepfords three hours later maybe you saved those lives too and if your damned partner hadnt done the babygoo on you you boys might have even brought the pyes down sir bud said ted tried his damnedest im sure he did bud but the fact is you returned fire and he didnt we found him on his belly with his hands over his head and his legs drawn up like a little baby he just lay there and they came and shot him he didnt fire a bullet bud the truth is we get paid to stand up to boys like that thats what the people want now teds going to get a posthumous award the oklahoma highway patrol star of bravery his name goes on the big plaque at department of public safety in oklahoma city and a funeral bud were going to have troopers from all over america coming in because our community hangs together in times like these he should get the best medal bud said not that medals mean a damned thing bud it dont mean much now and i know how you feel i lost more than a few wingmen but in years to come that medal will mean more and more especially to your boys i know i been there yes sir said bud now what about the pyes did we pick them up yet fact is the damned pye boys have dropped off the earth dont know where they are we got osbi and fbi and troopers and sheriffs and mps all over the state digging for em even the goddamned media is cooperating though its a first well get em bud nodded but he didnt agree lamar might be savage and crazed but he wasnt dumb he had that inmate cunning always had an angle to play now bud you just rest take your time in recovering and ive already talked to jen you just let yourself mend you dont never have to go back in a cruiser again if you want that lieutenancy that you turned down so many times its yours you could get paid for the job you already do which is running a troop if captain james is telling the truth bud youd get a captaincy eventually and your own troop or we could bring you up to headquarters to run the firearms training section youd like that wouldnt you bud be a fine cap on a fine career bud smiled meekly knowing he didnt have to say a thing the next time he came awake it was the pain that awakened him the drugs had worn off how he stung he felt like a horde of bees had worked him over every little twist and jiggle and the bees got back to work this wasnt going to be no piece of cake he was desperately thirsty jen poured him a glass of water and he drank it greedily he had the sense it was another day or so later and that it was night hows holly he finally said oh that girls taking it fine sometimes it doesnt hit them for a bit shell have some rough days ahead i was over there last night donna james and sally mcginley and a few of the others had brought hot dishes it was very nice she seemed all right i suppose she was very happy for all the support and everyone agreed it was best she hadnt had kids yet shell remarry therell be plenty of time for that theyre going to give ted a medal one of the highest the funeral will be something very special how was she toward you toward me why bud whatever do you mean i got her husband killed thats what i mean i like to have shot that boy myself from the way i handled things you stop that bud no one has said such a thing or even thought it i would know youall ran into pure black evil thats all there is to it but bud didnt think so what percentage of his awareness had he lost in his little snit about almost getting caught it came back to him thats what hed been thinking about on the drive from the road to the farmhouse had he missed something car tracks signs of disturbance any of the little things the signals a policeman has to be aware of that might keep him alive had he gone out back where they must have stashed willard joness stolen car no not bud goddamn bud was just sawing away on some other bullshit about getting himself caught with his pants down open the door and let in mr lamar pye thank you very much and lamar did what lamar would do because that was lamar you only had to look at those glaring eyes or read the jacket about the long list of felonies and killings to know what lamar was about a black vapor seemed to blow through his mind i want to go to the funeral he finally said i have to do something for ted bud they say i want to go he yelled in a violent husbands voice that meant he wanted no discussion its tomorrow jen said go get a doctor goddammit jen do it bud i have to go to that thing its the last and only chance ill have to do right by him thats all there is to it it was sunny a fabulous day in april and the oaks looked full and majestic against the flat and dusty plains of the lawton veterans cemetery the breeze rattled the leavesso much shimmering green all of it stirred by the persistent wind that oklahoma wind that seemed to wash over everythingamid the gray stones that stood over men whod died because a bitch called duty had said so far off to the northwest stood mount scott hardly a mountain but still the commanding elevation in the wichitas it was an ancient dry old hill bleak and stony bud was so sunk into himself now he could hardly focus the beauty of the place and the death of the place he responded to it in an especially bitter way maybe it was the drugs they had to keep him stoked to the gills or the pain would begin to build but bud was the sort of man as jen would tell you who when he sets his mind on a thing that thing comes to pass so bud sat in the wheelchair as jen pushed him along he wore his dress hat his dress uniform and raybans because his eyes were hollow and blood rimmed seven small bandages were visible on his face and neck under his shirt a single huge wrapping protected his hundreds of wounds and on his legs still more of the smaller patches he could walk if he had to a slow step at a time but for now this was all right what he felt more than anything was fatigue not pain not anger not regret a ton of liquid lethargy the air weighed too heavily upon his body he wanted to sleep but he couldnt sleep he had no words for anybody the glasses sealing his eyes off helped but he had the enormous urge to just lie down and go to sleep nothing seemed worth two cents anywhere in the world but he knew he had to be here somehow jen and jeff pushed him across the flatness up ahead they could see a little draw where the last ceremony was beginning troopers from all fifty states and police representatives from nearly as many cities around the country had arrived when these things happened it was amazing how many cops wanted to be part of it to come by and say there brother its all right it could just as easily have been me you did your best bud you all right jen asked hed snapped at her twice as they were getting him dressed he knew he was behaving badly in front of his son yes i am fine he said im ready to go dancing goddammit dad said jeff im sorry jen he said aint fit to sleep with the dogs today that goddamned lamar pye running around free as a bird and poor ted is going into the ground wasnt right wasnt no kind of right now the anger seethed through him he could live with the pain but the anger was something else entirely could he live with that he didnt know up ahead he could see tv vans parked and handsome people in the artificial brightness of the camera lights standing apart from the milling crowd of law enforcement types that irked him too hed been watching the tv news seemed like lamar and odell pye had become famous and poor old ted was secondstring there had been long interviews with miracle survivors bill and mary stepford and a hundred shots of the most famous oak tree in oklahoma the one behind which he and ted had cowered while lamar and odell had fired and advanced on them there was footage of shotgun shells and pistol cases littering the ground a night shot of the caravan of vehicles at the farm the blueandred eggbeaters filling the darkness with their urgency the medevac chopper rising to haul bloody bud pewtie to comanche memorial shocktrauma even a shot of poor shotup bud on the trundle being wheeled in from the roof to the emergency room he looked dead as hell face white partially covered by a bloody sheet one shoe off and one shoe on jen pushed him through the crowd which magically melted and stilled now and then a low howdy bud rose and bud nodded to acknowledge as the last of the crowd parted jen slid him into the front row where the big shots sat colonel supenski in his dress blues a man from the governors mansion standing in for a governor who couldnt make it two old people who had to be teds grieving parents captain james and at the end of the row holly if he had been seeing her for the first time hed have fallen in love with her all over again she looked still and grave and almost numb but her skin had blossomed somehow as if it were dewy with moisture she seemed as pale as a white rose her eyes focused on nothing as she just sat there in a kind of solemn haze told you id see you on the day we got off it he thought another one of my damned lies she felt him looking at her and she smiled the smile blew him away he loved her smile one of the best parts of their intimacy was the way they laughed so hard at each others strange jokes they shared some kind of wavelength or something holly rose and came over and smiled bravely at jen and knelt down and touched his hand how are you old trooper she said holly i tried so hard just couldnt save him they got us cold its okay bud she rose and gave jen a hug and then hugged jeff before returning to her seat bud had been through too many before the details were all familiar and only the tiniest most meaningless deviations set this one apart from the others a trooper honor guard consisting of one man each from oklahoma arkansas texas new mexico colorado and missouri walked the casket from the hearse to the bier and set it down and only one man was out of step by the end of the trek instead of the usual two the casket was heavy but they always were just dead weight after all the elaborate business of the flag folding proceeded awkwardly because the team was newly united but eventually they got it crushed into the tricorn shape only stars showing and the team leader presented it to holly with a little salute twenty yards off the sevenman firing team fired three volleys for a total of twentyone the volleys were ragged as they always were and in the vast space the gunfire thin the worst moment was always taps it didnt matter if the bugler played it well or poorly in tune or out there was something in the mournful ache of the music and how it spoke of men dying before their time for something they only vaguely understood and being only vaguely appreciated by the people on whose behalf they died that made it hurt so much bud bit back a tear feeling the blackness in him rise and rise yet again he saw the puff of hair as the slug went in and lamar unbending from the task with the blank eyes of a carpenter or a stonemason no words were said beside an invocation by the minister and then it was over that fast holly was swept up and embraced and borne out the troopers and cops began to file to their cars okay bud jen wanted to know or do you want to stay a bit no lets get out of here four days later bud was released from the hospital at home he lay there feeling slightly liberated but in a bit the black vapor settled over him again almost like a blanket that he could pull tight someone had warned him of this poststress syndrome a bitch to get through feelings of worthlessness and failure and bonegrinding fatigue all right so i got it but good he chased jen out and she slept in the living room she never saw him cry nobody had ever seen him cry and goddamned if he would start now with that shit but he had a night when he cried and another night when he locked himself in the toilet and threw up bad the doctor dropped by twice a day and there was a long session with colonel supenski a highway patrol shooting investigation team and homicide investigators from the murray county sheriffs department and the county prosecutors office bud told it all to them except his surliness over the near slip of being caught by jen they went over it doggedly who was where when the shots came this and that like a slowmo replay in a football game would bud testify before a grand jury in order to get a true bill against lamar bet your ass he would he tried not to think of holly but at night that came over him too the flash of the gun the softness of her skin the ugly powder burn melted into teds skull the tautness of her nipples the grin on lamars face as he pivoted with the shotgun the smoothness inside her thighs one became the other flash and explode orange ness pain ecstasy all of it crammed together he yearned to call her but he couldnt on the fourth day it was at last time to rise he got himself up and slung on blue jeans a starched white shirt with a point collar a good pair of tony lama boots brown with a black shaft he threw a bolo tie with a horses head on the clasp around the shirt neck tightened it up he slid a colt commander with a shooting star magazine crammed with eight hollow tips into his waistband over his kidney then pulled on a sports coat he lumbered down the steps at first feeling woozy but then he got the hang of it jen ill be out a bit then ill stop at the hospital back before dark she came from the kitchen and intercepted him at the front door her face was gray and remote and as always somewhat impassive except for the glare in her eyes you can hardly walk just what do you think youre doing mister i feel i have to say something to that farmer write him a letter or give him a call thats why they invented the telephone without this old boys gumption im in the ground and youre the one theyre bringing the hot dishes to send him a card bud you still have steel in you suppose something breaks free and you start bleeding again you could bleed to death if i was meant to bleed to death id have done it with a thousand steel balls in me not in my truck driving out to the country do you have a gun the commander good i dont want you out in the world without some protection didnt do much good the last time he said but the theory sounds promising bud went to his truck a blue ford f climbed in and stuck the key into the column switch then paused christ would there always be somebody pulling on him would it ever end looking carefully left and right he eased out the clutch and backed into the highway then threw a bit of gravel as he accelerated in seconds he came to a larger road and slipped into traffic behind a huge cattle carrier bud worked his way through the gears in the heavyduty fourspeed tugging the stick firmly his feet light on the accelerator and clutch pedal he loved the goddamned truck he truly did but bud didnt drive straight out to the stepfords with no conscious thought at all he stopped at a convenience store and went to the pay phone he dropped the quarter and dialed the number it was just like the last time in front of the diner just that simple in time she answered howdy he said thank god you called holly whispered oh bud i cant talk now the minister is here he thinks hes helping oh lord seeing you would help i been home and couldnt call you know ive got something to do anyway can you meet me in elgin that diner ralphs i think it is say about two this afternoon ill be there bud hung up and returned to the truck the drive to the stepfords passed without incident on the way he drove by the diner where the waitress had mentioned bill stepfords absence why hadnt that set bells ringing reason was a policeman will knock on a thousand doors in a career maybe a hundred thousand maybe a thousand policemen knocking on a hundred thousand doors over a twentyyear span will produce one lamar pye waiting in the window with a semiauto shotgun ready to blow them to hell and gone the numbers say go ahead knock on the door lamar was just the road accident that happens to other people and makes life interesting bud now came to the mailbox and the road into the farm he turned headed down it the same line of oak trees the same justturned wheat fields the same eventual arrival at the house itself a white clapboard structure with new rooms added every decade or so the porch the barn the feeding pens the mud the hay it all looked the same except now the yard was much crisscrossed with tire tracks from the multitude of emergency and police vehicles and the tree bud looked at what for two or three days had been the most famous tree in oklahoma and north texas where he and ted had sought cover and from which he had fled to the cruiser to call for backup not making it bud parked where hed parked before the obvious place it was now as it was then still green just a farm he had a bad moment where he didnt want to get out am i ruined now he wondered no real fear for twentyfive years but then ive never been hit in twentyfive years now has this thing ruined me am i afraid to make the stop or knock on the door his breath came in little spurts he opened the truck door hearing the buzz of cicada as he had that day he smelled alfalfa and animal shit as on any farm he stood for a moment looking around it could have been that day same bright weather and warmth same time but then his knee began to hurt because there was a tiny ball of steel under the kneecap that the surgeons hadnt had time to get out maybe theyd go back and get it maybe bud could live with it and as he thought about that one in a hundred other places his body began to sing the percodan was wearing off he checked his watch it was an hour till the next dosage shit he thought it wasnt a bad dream it all happened he closed the door and headed to the house but halfway up as before he was intercepted by a man with a shotgun now hold on mister this aint a tourist attraction you got business you see my lawyer but otherwise you clear on out bill stepford was spry and peppery as a cat even with half of his face swollen like a bluegreen grapefruit he didnt exactly point the gun at bud but just sort of clung tightly to it as a man whos gone without water may cling to a canteen even after his rescue his blue eyes one round one flat both fiery burned into bud and a y of veins stood out on his forehead mr stepford i aint here to sell or buy a damn thing i came to offer up my thanks goddamn yes mary come out look whats showed up its that bud pewtie the man too tough to die up and about in six daysmy lord son you must be made of pure gristle no sir im made of skin and bones just like you and maybe you saw some of the same kind of blood on the ground i surely did thought you were a goner i was till you walked halfway across oklahoma and saved my hash thats what i came on by for bud dammit it wasnt nothing im an old coot who walks ten miles a day if i hadnt gone two miles in the wrong direction to start i might have gotten there earlier dont think it would have made much difference sir i had another few hours of life left any way you cut it and poor ted was already in the barn bud you come on in and have some coffee and tell me all about your adventures aint much said bud following got a thousand holes in me and maybe a hundred of them little tiny balls no probe could get out none of em went too deep they just cut the jesus out of me thats all im damned glad you hunt doves and not deer with those deer slugs bud i have a case of winchester deer slugs under my workbench old lamar just never found them dont that beat the monkey they headed inside laughing like old pals mary stepford looking pale and leathery rose from the sofa to greet them well mr pewtie i swear i never thought youd be coming by for coffee i didnt either maam i thought my coffeedrinking days were over well you are a sight for these sore eyes the old woman said and pulled him close and gave him a down home hug i came by to thank youall a letter or a call didnt seem right after what you did you were the heroes a bad boy like lamar dont leave you no choice bud you got to be at your best or youre finished youll get him bud maam i have to confess the last thing i want to do is run into the pyes again scared me then scare me now maybe if id had a second just a second to get my bearings but it happened so fast thats scum for you said bill they know the advantage of surpriseworks for em every damn time just as it did against me they had a nice little visit and bud kept it light because the old woman seemed a little shaky though old bill stepford was billowing brimstone and hellfire most of the time he didnt really want to take them back through it what was the point really when it came time for bud to leave and the old man walked him back to his truck only then did the conversation meander back to the three convicts stepford ran salty profiles of each one by bud when bud heard how useless richard was he wondered why lamar hadnt dumped him maybe its the lions stepford said bud ad read all the police reports hed talked to colleagues just that morning to get the latest but this was new lions he said yes sir he drew pictures of lions for lamar dont ask me why silliest damn things you wouldnt say have them pictures sure do bud care for a look yes sir said bud he was thinking lions chapter no one ever said lamar was afraid of work on the first day on the farm he rose early and drove the stepfords wagoneer into the barn into an empty stall he removed the battery then with a pitchfork he climbed to the hay loft and laid into the pile up there and threw it to the floor of the barn then he forked the hay around the vehicle until it could not be seen no one would ever stumble on it and no one could look at the huge pile of hay filling one of the empty stalls and suspect that a stolen car was hidden under it the next morning he chopped wood around ten odell came out and joined him and they split all other logs into firewood in a heroic fourteenhour stint the next day they decided to clear land where she said she wanted eventually to plant a garden out beyond the barn although it had been merely the most banal passing suggestion for nearly a week lamar and odell dug the prairie thatch out and fought their way down to red dirt which they then leveled and raked and graded digging at least a hundred large rocks and a thousand small ones out of the earth then they cut down a dozen of the scrub oaks and some dead mesquite reduced the wood to kindling and dug out the stumps maybe the hardest of their labors for the trees had been joined to the earth stubbornly like the partnership in an ancient marriage and it took enormous investments of sweat and will to break them apart the sun was bright and harsh and the wind snapped across the dry prairie far off the scuts of the wichitas stood out the only feature on the otherwise featureless horizon look at them said ruta beth lord how they work they work like my daddy worked theyre basically elemental men of the earth richard said grandly though this insight was lost on ruta beth she simply looked at him through guared little slits of eyes nothing showing on her grim face and said richard sometimes you say the craziest things a major disappointment he had not impressed ruta beth at all she took one look at poor pitiful richard and abandoned him before the relationship had even begun it was lamar beaming with testosterone and sweat who drew her like a beacon ruta beth tun was twentyeight years old and sinewy as a wild dog she usually wore sears jeans a thin cheap wool sweater over a faded blouse heavy farm boots and a black hair band which pulled her dark cascades of hair into a rope behind her head she had chalky skin and mean little eyes with which she constantly scanned the world for threat or aggression never relaxing never giving always on alert her fingernails were chewed to grimy nubs and she was always hugging herself in a slightly unseemly way but her grimness hid a romantic streak once directed at richard and in a seconds passing redirected toward lamar when she had seen richards picture in the paper during his trial for criminal assault against his mother she had cut it out she wrote him a letter that went out in the next batch of correspondence among other missivesto president clinton the governor meryl streep hillary clinton robin quivers of the howard stern show nancy reagan ronald reagan barbara bush two ofcharle mansons female followers shed seen in a tv interview and reba mcentireon a variety of noteworthy subjects she had never before gotten an answer except the routine thank you so very much from the clintons which she didnt count as a real answer but in the case of richard her answer showed up three months later at eleven p spattered with blood along with lamar pye and his damaged cousin the document that initiated this unlikely course of events was the strangest looniest letter richard had ever read it even shocked him a bit dere mr peed it began though you cannot know me at the same time we are one i believe in another life in many other lives we must have been boy and girl friends we must have offended the gods with the purity of our passion and so they cursed us and sent us too wondering through time always close enough to know the others presence the others sorrow but never close enough too touch too hold too kiss too have secshual untercoarse as did you i lost my beloved parents in a tragedy it wasnt easy but now i have made peace with the sorrowful passing of mother and daddy they frequently talk to me from heaven which is a very nice place its like a howard johnsons where someone come to change the sheets every day it has a very nice salad bar mr peed i miss you though i have never seen eyes on you i have stared at your picture so hard in the daily oklahoman i have almost wiped it off the page mr peed i believe we could have a wonderful life together if only we could meet thank you for your attention yours fondly miss ruta b tun route odette oklahoma when he showed it to lamar lamar read the first paragraph silently moving his lips across each word and said richard i cant make hide nor hair out of it is she crazy i think so lamar crazy as hell but she likes me she lives in the country her parents are dead im thinking maybe it would be a place to put up hmmmm said lamar well suck my cock why the hell not bettern shittin in a wheat field where well catch cold and our noses run with snot they found the farm lurking behind a solitary mailbox inscribed with the name tun on route it was in a desolate sector of kiowa county about thirty miles west of lawton halfway to altus it felt like the true west all right prairie for grazing mostly some fields heroically turned for wheat but generally the feeling of wideopenness in every direction except due east where the mountains lay the highways transected kiowa like lines in a geometry problem and off of the asphalt now and then a ribbon of red dirt would run disappearing in subtle folds of the terrain the farm lay at the end of a mile of such narrow red dirt road and when you stood in its front yard your back turned to the twostory clapboard house rotting and dim and facing outward you felt as if you were among the last men on earth just flat grass distant mountains and the snapping wind as far as the eyes could see ruta beth asked no questions she took one look at the trio and knew who they were and why they were there it was the message from god she had been expecting these long lonely years it never occurred to her to be frightened she smiled at richard and nodded knowingly to the astonished lamar but went first to odell you poor thing she said you look famished you come on in i dont have much but what ive got im willing to share odell likes cereal maam said lamar its his favorite thing what do he like er he likes that honey nut cheerios a lot he likes your sugary ones he dont like the healthy ones you know with the nuts and all i have corn flakes ah hell eat em but he aint crazy about em i like cereals too i have some others capn crunch no mr pye i dont have no capn crunch how about special k aint that just like wheaties odell dont like wheaties he did long as there was sugar on it till they put that michael jordan on the box where we come from we hate the niggers i know were supposed to love the niggers these days but you try and love our niggers up at mcalester and they just laugh and cut your throat killed me a big nigger thats what started this whole goddamned ball rolling i do have some frosted miniwheats frosted miniwheats odell you hear that frosted miniwheats this gal has frosted miniwheats weenyeets weenyeets odell began to chant his vague features united in a rapturous passion you come along then odell she said and took the big man inside lamar turned to richard your gals pretty goddamned sweet if you ask me you better make her happy or ill crack your skull thats when richard knew he was lost lamar was thinking about painting the house it was a mottled gray peeling and sad he wanted it to be cheery blinding white the white of happy white folks on a rich farm with lots of kids he had a brief rare little brush with fantasy all of them there ruta beth and richard and odell and lamar all of them happy in that house but even as he drew some warmth from it he knew it would never happen goddamn johnny cop had seen to that if johnny cop hadnt ashot his daddy lo those many years ago hed never be in this mess with all these worries all these things to think about and now he was getting hot again still he could paint the house that would be his next project he could scrape the old dead paint off take a week or so then sand down to new wood another week take maybe two weeks to give the place another coat odell could do some of the work although odells tiny mind had never had much in the way of skill odell could dig or hoe or plow all day long seven days a week but he couldnt do anything that involved thinking he just didnt understand odell now think we gonna knock off for the day lamar said it was sixthirty p of the third day of the second week theyd finished re roofing the barn and theyd restrung about a mile of fence between ruta beths and the mcgillaverys property because the mcgillaverys cows kept breaking into rutas far field and that meant the mcgillavery boys would come looking for them and that would be trouble he and odell walked back to the house odell go wash he said washwash for dinner din odell said and went merrily off he knew hed find ruta beth out back working at her wheel it amazed him what she could do just the lump of clay the pumping of her foot the spinning of the wheel and some kind of miraculous thing occurred goddamn he loved to watch it and there she was hunched over the spinning wheel her hands actually sunk into the blurred muck her face intense and furious the muck seemed to be spinning itself into something thin and graceful today like a candleholder that he remembered his mama had before his mama died amazin what you can do he said she almost never blinked she had this funny way of just looking at something until shed sucked it dry it amazed him that she wasnt afraid of him a man killer like him with fuck you i tattooed on his knuckles who made the quality nervous if he were in the same goddamned county mr pye she said it aint nothing really you could do it me nah id mess it up but go on love to watch you she worked intently for another few minutes then she said what will you do them cops wont never stop looking you have to move on i know i hate to go aint ever seen odell so happy its where he should be cant hurt nobody cant get in no trouble no liquor no niggers or hacks trying to take from him he could be happy here you love him everybody says you are the meanest man there is but you love him hes all i got we go way back its so beautiful but they will get you stories like yours never have happy endings this here place is my happy ending i swear i dont see no bad in you but bad is what i am i guess i was homed to it on account of what happened to my daddy i never once looked back only thing is ever any good at you could have been a farmer then somebody come and try and walk on you you cant let that happen so you stop em and next thing youre pn the run thats how it started goddamned uncle jack kept odell in the barn kept him chained beat him his own son beat that boy he got thirty dollars a month from the county to keep that boy on account of his being so sick in the brain and he didnt spend a goddamned penny of it on odell only reason he took me in is because the state paid him twentytwo dollars a month on me so as to get me out of their reform school he was brother to my daddy jim who was killed dead by state troopers over in arkansas and when my mama edna sue died and they put me in their reform school and i give them so goddamn much trouble cause people was always trying to back you down and i just got it in my fool head nobody was going to back me down anyway they sent me to my uncle and his wife camilla and i was just shit to him shit that brought in a social services check one day he beat odell so goddamned bad i thought the boy would die because odell had shat up his pants they had so much trouble teaching odell about the bathroom anyway i reckoned to stop it caught uncle jack along the perkinsville road drunk as usual on odells money aint done nothing in my life that made me feel so good as when i put the blade into that mean old bastard and its been like that ever since me watching out for odell him for me we was all we had in the goddamned world and it wasnt so bad wed made our place until goddamned junior jefferson pulled his stunt it was as complete an accounting of his life as hed ever given to anybody youve had such a hard time the house is full of men with hard lives were just like them thats all its a sad story mr pye i honestly believe if youd have caught a break somewhere along the line you could have been a great man i dont know why youd say such a thing im just a piece of scum but what would you do if you could do anything lamar thought the question had never been put to him before id like to invent a ray he said you know like a beam of light and everything you shine it on you make it fair you shine it and theres a lot of money and nobodys sick or angry or nothing you just make people happy thats what id do a happy ray id shine it in all the prisons and all the shithole jerkwater towns id shine it on odell and he could talk and his mouth would be mended up id even shine it on the niggers yes goddammit i would and they would change their evil ways she beheld him gravely that is the sweetest thing i ever did hear well it wont never happen said lamar youre like that ray you give people hope you watch theyll believe in you like in jesus or mr elvis presley they know you stand for freedom she touched his knee i thought you loved that richard he showed me that letter i guess i did dont know why i thought so much of poor richard he aint but a ninny i doubt he has hair on his privates what is it you want ill give you everything you want no woman ever said that to me so sometimes id take it i want you to have it i so bad want to give it to you ill be your true first mr pye she said shyly and youll be my first too richard could tell hed fucked her it had really only been a matter of time a woman as nuts as ruta beth would almost certainly end up fucking a crazy fuck like lamar anyway when they came in from the barn loosey goosey and giggly they both smelled of cunt it was to richard a low rank odor his mother smelled like that sometimes after one other friends had visited when he was a little boy and hed been made to play in the garden but now lamar was happy as a goddamned head of household whos just made the mortgage even odell picked it up he looked up from his cereal bowl and smiled brightly flecks of frosted miniwheats clinging to his lips and yellow teeth he was happy its like a family my god thought richard it was some terrible parody of happiness lamar the daddy and ruta beth the mommy and odell and richard the two boys it was the normal life hed never had it was such a good time the little family in the kitchen of the farmhouse laughing some demented norman rockwell could have painted the picture and put it on the cover of the saturday evening post richard thought lamar with his ponytail and tattooed knuckles and scrawny ruta beth with her chalky addams family skin and her inbred farm face and odell eternal boyman with a tunnel for a mouth and a mop of reddish hair and two tiny eyes and of course him too richard whod blinded his mother one day in a fit of rage because the para fascist rightwing daily oklahoman had refused to review his exhibit richard peed artist in transition at the merton gallery on dwight street they even did errands like any family it turned out that ruta beth had no paper anywhere in her house no writing implements nothing she didnt even have any magazines newspapers or books so of course she had to go out and get tablets of paper and pencils for richard to continue his lions with as that was his most important contribution and she also had to drive all the way to murfs guns in duncan to buy doubleought buckshot for the shotguns when they learned from the tv that goddamned salty old state cop had somehow managed to survive because hed been hit with birdshot but lamar wasnt mad he was so mellow in his new life goddamn was he a tough old boy he hooted he was a right tough old buzzard but birdshot didnt get him done wont he have something to tell his grandkids the heavier shells were important for another reason only one last thing to figure said lamar thats the place where we going to do our next job richard smiling wasnt sure what lamar meant by job you know to rob were robbers richard dont you get that its our work and the way i work them shotgun shells going to come in handy chapter she pulled into the elgin diner erect and brave in sunglasses she sat in a window booth she looked pale even through the distorted reflection of the interstate on the surface of the glass she was not dressed in black but in a neat little sleeveless polkadot dress the freckles on her arms matched the pattern of the dress and when she saw him her face lit up she waved her hand tentatively he waved back oh lord he thought here it is he got out of the truck reached back and tucked the commander which had slipped a bit back behind his kidney hed taken a percodan half an hour early after leaving the stepfords so the pain had gone down somewhat still he was moving like an old man a step at a time as if the air itself sat on his body with a special kind of violence he was nearly fifty he felt a hundred and fifty a geezer full of melancholy and black thoughts his legs ached his body seemed cut from old stone as he climbed the steps he entered and her smile lit the place goddamn how the young woman could smile was it all young women or just this one he began to feel a little woozy as he approached she rose and took his hand and gave him a quick kiss well now bud who painted you the color of dead roses oh my poor poor baby well you know how to perk a fellow up dont you ive felt better thats for sure are you in pain oh nothing i cant handle with only the slightest help from a million milligrams of heroin every twenty minutes or so youll joke when the devil comes round with his bill bud take my women take my money take my life but dont take my sense of humor mister when that colonel came to tell me about ted it took him an hour before he got around to you that was the worst bud my bud i had to sit there playing the grieving widow just crazy to know about you bud oh bud happiest day of my life they told me you were going to make it i had to keep crying when alls i wanted was to laugh because they said you were going to make it holly damn you look good oh bud oh bud holly im so very sorry about ted no man deserves to die like that he wasnt a bad boy i just fouled up i wish to hell i could do it over well you never can can you how are you holding up bud im fine now that the funeral is over and poor teds mother and dad have gone home i dont have to play the sobbing wife no more you know the patrol can arrange for a doctor or somebody to help you you know someone to talk to you bud youre the only person i want to talk to and the insurance what it is it aint a fortune but its damn comforting theres no horrible financial thing crushing down on you its fine bud itll get me through more than a few years and they said theyd try and help me get a job great bud youre not facing this are you i dont know bud i dont want to talk about me i want to talk about us bud looked out through the goddamned window to green oklahoma a hundred yards away he could see the interstate and the cars flashing down it where hed made a living for so long bud we can have everything now im sorry ted got killed but it wasnt your fault and it wasnt my fault it was lamar pyes fault now we can be together its one less difficulty its time bud you know it as well as i know it holly i then he ran out of gas dont you want to be with me lord yes then bud why not why cant you just do it holly you should know he loved you very much what happened to him he just lost his nerve and it was eating him up he thought less of himself not you he deserves a little time before we up and move in and start sleeping together for the whole world to see you never cared too much what the world thought yeah maybe and theres the other thing whats that lamar lamar holly said oh yeah lamar now what the hell you think that means it dont feel right with him still out there bud holly i said id take care of you for my partner that was the last thing he asked before lamar come over with the gun and i will i swear to you i will but i got to take care of my partner first teds dead bud theres no care to be taken and nothing with lamar pye is going to bring him back well bud said without much more to offer is that it bud lamar youre going to go up against lamar the whole goddamned state of oklahoma cant find lamar and youre going to find him as usual he didnt know what he meant i dont know what i mean is nothing feels right with lamar on the loose wouldnt necessarily have to be me gets him frankly the last thing i want is to run into lamar it aint personal the hell it aint holly i just so you arent going to touch me did i say that seems like what you meant i swear to you at that moment when lamar meant to finish me what was in my heart was the thought id never been with you fair in the open the two of us at a restaurant a barbecue you know a damn couple last thing on my mind as i went under was it true it felt true about now but he wasnt sure he really didnt remember damn bud you kill me well thats my job you know that place two exits back the do si do motel yes got us a room bud wanted to celebrate being alive bud looked at his watch he was due at the hospital by three and it was already near two but what the hell it was only a hospital their differenceswas it a womanman thing or a bud holly thinghad to do with being naked she didnt mind it she sort of liked it in fact and could be so damned casual about it bud hated it just that feeling of vulnerability of being wide open to assault of being a fat man whose nakedness revealed his idiocy so it was that after they had made love he had to pull the sheets up around his loins in secret and terrible fact he yearned always when they were done to dress instantly but he also knew that the moments afterward were the most hallowed to her were in some sense the point of the exercise where her oneness with him was at its most intense and so he could never deny her them goddamn bud she said lamar may have filled you with lead but he sure didnt take your manhood you had plenty left for me why did she think him that good a lover in the beginning hed been a mighty engine able to climb the mountain two or three times in a single afternoon it was the incredible joy of freedom of a new other life but the beginning was long past and it seemed to him at least that his mighty engine only just got up the hill these days but he figured that what she saw was what she wanted to see that buck from the first weeks he knew hed never be that again or at any rate not with her it saddened him but he never quite had the guts to put it into words you sure he didnt shoot you with love potion instead of lead he laughed she could be so damned girlish her breasts showed they were little things but beautiful he loved their weight their heft their round perfection and pink tips and the way they jiggled ever so slightly when she laughed it was steel he shot me with he said steel shot another lucky break the infection rate on steel is much lower than lead but that aint luck at all compared to having you you didnt start bleeding no the bandages held no telltale red spots marked the opening of the tiny wounds it must have felt like being hugged by a stamp collection he said oh bud you are so funny first time i saw you i thought oh my its john wayne himself but then you got me to laughing and i saw how much better you were than john wayne or anybody her absurdly high vision of him how could he say no to a woman who thought so highly of him he came the closest to being the man she thought he was and believed him to be when he was with her and no other place in his life i wish i could stay here forever he said suddenly no bud she said it aint good enough we deserve a house and maybe our own kids or to travel a real life we were meant for it we were supposed to meet i believe that in my heart i believe youre right he said exactly what he didnt want to say it amazed him somehow he always did the exact opposite of what he set out to do he was turned inside out but not by her she was just holly as usual he was turned inside out by it the thing the two of them well sweetie ought to be heading back im late you go bud just promise me this lamar thing youre not going to let it grow into some huge obsession some mission where you got to get your revenge it aint worth it it would just get you killed it aint anything like that i just want to be part of the team that brings him down thats all a part of his end the way i was a part of his beginning the doctor was angry because bud was so late and he seemed to wish he could find something seriously wrong with bud and throw him back in a hospital room out of sheer meanness but buds wounds resolutely refused to break and bleed it was as if he had sealed himself up again yqur colonel called he said hed tried to reach you at home i dont think he was happy well i didnt get in any trouble today so he shouldnt be too angry what you did sergeant was you got laid bud looked at him in surprise sir i no i know it i can tell it physiological signs i dont know what youve got going sergeant but i wouldnt press it you aint going to no its your business just dont try and go too far too fast you could get hurt again and this time permanently now take your percodan and when he got home there was only more trouble it was jeffs game night and bud had promised hed go he was late and jen had gone on without him he gobbled a sandwich and almost called holly since he was alone in the house and she was back now too but he thought the better of it and instead raced across town to the lawton cougars field where the jv team was playing its home thursday night game under the lights bud found jen sitting high in the bleachers hi he muttered where were you the colonel called and then they called from the hospital and everything ah you know got to jawing with that farmer and next thing you knew i was all out of time her stony isolated silence was rebuke enough he knew from the sullen set of her body and the sealedoff look on her face that she was angry and hurt please dont get so mad i was late im here now hows jeff is he in no hes on the bench he never starts bud you should know that not this year bud looked and saw his youngest son appearing small and wan sitting in the theatrically bright bath of lights at the end of the bench jeff was an outfielder who could run down any ball and would even thrust himself brutally against a wall to make a catch if he had to but his batting was something of a family tragedy it had just all but disappeared hed hit his freshman year and been a star and now as a sophomore had moved up to varsity but then the slump had begun it just sucked the life out of the boy and the harder he tried the worse he did he was stuck on the jv team and couldnt even get into the lineup bud checked the scoreboard it was seven to two the altus cardinals leading the hapless cougars top of the fourth it seemed that jeff didnt move it was as if he were enchanted in a bubble the game flowed around him players ran or swaggered by yelling and hooting but jeff was frozen in some faroff place as if in another world lost in concentration how do you feel she said its not bad he said you know at the end of the drug cycle the pain is bad and at the beginning its okay it just slides back and forth im sorry i snapped at you bud i just got so scared when they told me youd been hit finally after all these years and i expect you to be moody after what you been through its a marvel you can even face the world a cougar got on second and another walked the few fans mostly dads and moms began a desultory clapping but the boy on second was thrown out trying to steal and the next boy hit into a double play jeff could hit this guy bud said bitterly i know he could youre so angry bud said jen i cant say i blame you what you went through seeing poor ted your own near miss its so horrible but i cant stand to see you eaten up like this cant the department get someone for you to talk to stop it he said brusquely i dont need to talk to nobody i just need to get back to work the whole thing will feel better when we get this creep locked up thats all now a cougar dropped a fly and then another one threw to the wrong base in a second the score had jumped to nine to two but bud was secretly pleased it meant that jeffs chances at hitting were better and indeed in the eighth with two down and nobody on jeff was sent to the plate bud watched the younster unlimber from the bench stretch and twist try to shake off the cramps in his neck then he placed the batting helmet on his head and went to the batters box bud tracked him as he went his face set in the taut mask of a warrior his eyes squinting as if to crush every last mote of concentration onto his immediate problem he entered the box took three almost ritualized hip pivots dragging the bat through the zone as if to arrange himself like a machine for the proper setting by which to engage the ball in the bright fake light he looked so lean and strong so poised so perfect bud realized his heart must have been yammering and his knees shaking but from the distance jeff could have been a cal ripken or a george brett a natural hitter oh please let him get a hit he requested of the universe some mercy for my son let him do well or not so bad do not let him fail ive failed enough for both of us please show him mercy the pitcher a tall and whippy black kid wound and delivered and jeff took a called strike the ball popped sharply into the catchers glove dust rising from the impact like a gunshot bud thought again the bullet hits teds hair flies and ted is gone he shook his own head as if to clear the troubling thoughts from alighting anywhere and dialed back into reality to check as jeff took what was apparently the second of two balls this should be his pitch he said to jen the pitcher fired and jeff overeager swung wretchedly he looked like a crippled stork and the ball ticked weakly off into foul territory to the thirdbase side damn bud said he should have parked that one in the wheat he thought oh christ i would give my life for my son to do well on the fifth pitch bud thought the pitcher uncoiled with a particularly venomous spasm almost snakelike in the strike of his arm and the ball swept toward jeff in high theatrical light just as jeff himself seemed to unscrew from the hips up shoulders following hips arms following shoulders bat following arms the whole thing was liquid somehow punctuated by the sharpest crack bud had ever heard much louder and more decisive than the shots lamar had launched at him the ball rose the noise of the desultory crowd rose bud himself rose screaming yes yes yes and the ball sailed outward go you bastard go bud willed it oh please he saw the left fielder crouching at the fence and as the ball descended the boy leaped and it seemed he had it zeroed but felt despair rise like a black tide into his heart but the leap wasnt high enough by three feet and the ball bounded away in the darkness oh god bud said grabbing jens arm he hit a home run jeff jeff way to go he was crying literally as his son trundled sheepishly around the bases to be greeted at home by some of his fellow players god he said to jen im so damned happy bud she said my god youre bleeding chapter odell sat with the ar in his lap and a red wig on his head he had tits he was wearing lipstick and a blue fur trimmed coat from the year the year that ruta beths daddy had bought it for ruta beths mother at dillons department store in oklahoma city he didnt look much like a woman he looked like a gigantic transvestite with an assault rifle if you looked close but who would look close he sat benignly in the back seat of ruta beths little toyota twelve miles beyond the red river on the outskirts of wichita falls texas just off interstate on its long pull from oklahoma city sitting next to him was richard also with tits tennis balls taped inside the dress also with a wig black and a red hat with feathers curling down as well all of it having at one time belonged to beulah tun ruta beth had done the makeup though richard thought shed gone a bit overboard on the rouge in the mirror hed looked like some kind of corpse if odell didnt seem to mind richard certainly did but of course he would say nothing in jeans and sunglasses his ponytail tucked out of sight under the brim of bill stepfords stetson lamar sat chewing on a long stalk of wheat next to his right leg also out of sight was the cutdown browning a gauge though it was not loaded with birdshot but doubleought buck shells he had the longslide in the waistband in the small of his back and next to him in the drivers seat with buds mossberg sat ruta beth herself also in a cowboy hat thats it said lamar what we come this piece to see thats it our ticket to tomorrow but richard didnt get it i dont see anything he said use your magination said lamar they were parked at a dennys restaurant just off the interstate ramp the sign said maurine street its lot jammed with cars the restaurant sat on a small podium of land like the king of everywhere the remnants of a crowd visible through the doubleglass doors out front and the windows that circled it like a bright necklace at the entrance to the parking lot stood a proud art mo deme sign turquoise and red at night it would blaze like a beacon up to the interstate i just see a dennys said richard ennys odell said and giggled is there a problem here aunt lucy said lamar aunt lucy you trying to take command of the outfit you got a better idea but wouldnt a bank be better it would certainly be more dignified dified said odell rocking ever so slightly well now let me explain said lamar you got to keep up with the times bank robbing aint what it used to be a they keep the big money in the vault with a time lock so you only got what loose moneys up front sometimes lessn a hundred or so bucks b you got the goddamned cameras all over the place aunt lucy are you listening lamar im sure youre right then you got silent alarms you got money packs rigged to explode

sunday afternoon let me tell you what you got you got the big old breakfast money from about a thousand texas baptists them baptists they like to go to church and pray all morning then stroll on down

teeth whole goddamn families it makes em feel close to the lord dont ask me why so round about four you got maybe ten twelve thousand in small bills in the managers safe you got no cameras you got no guards you got no heroes you got nothing but a staff of assholes what hates their goddamned jobs and aint about to die for no denny whosoever the mother fuck he may be enny said odell cheerfully daddy i swear you know everything said ruta bern you are so smart now if you like aunt lucy well drop you off and you can rob a bank while we do this here texas dennys no lamar said richard thank you aunt lucy aint you the sweetest thang all right darling lets go for a little drive through the neighborhood then park and you and me head in for a lookiesee well leave the two ladies in the back yes daddy she said ruta beth pulled the car out turned right into a residential area turned and turned again passing by small white houses well tended with green lawns squares houses and now and then a square could be glimpsed hosing down a mid sized car pushing a mower just bullshitting with another square richard looked at them seeing a lost world flee by once hed had such contempt the people fools and jerks parvenus and philistines without a brain in their head nothing to sustain them but delusions like baseball family work yet now their dreariness broke his heart it looked so comforting git that long sad look off your beautiful puss there aunt lucy said lamar you git to looking that sad and i wonder if you aint about to make a break on us lamar i was thinking no such thing yeah i heard that before he acts up odell you conk him good eventually ruta beth swung around and they pulled into the dennys parking lot okay you gals stay put for a bit odell you tuck that big piece away case anybody looks in were going to check the place out richard watched lamar get out of the car stop and so casually stretch himself as he pulled on a jean jacket over the then he put his arm around ruta beth and just as casually as a couple of high school kids on a date the two of them sauntered into dennys richard sat back trying to relax he felt absurd in the getup and he was bored but he couldnt get out of the car because in the open the fraudulence of his disguise would be obvious he looked over at odell who grinned at him with empty happy eyes looking into odells eyes could make you insane they were guileless and remote far removed from concepts such as cause and effect or right and wrong he was simply a gigantic baby who needed to be fed and wiped lamar brushed his teeth every night talking to him in that singsongy voice baby talk and giggles yet in odell there was a kind of innocence he wasnt evil he had no choice at all in the matter hed probably have been better off in the prison where at least he was feared and respected which meant he was left alone or in a home somewhere if thered been money to put him in a home where they could study the strange gaps in his mind that left him mute and empty yet curiously able to perform small handeye tasks like driving or shooting left to his own ways and shielded from temptation he probably wouldnt hurt a flea richard turned from odell and found himself looking into the blank sunglasses of a deputy sheriff lamar sat at the counter sipping coffee he looked like any middleaged cowpoke texas style behind his shades his eyes scoped the place out it was done in greenand brown zigzags lowintensity colors to soothe people he checked for entrances the main one in the front righthand corner of the building and around to the side an emergency exit painted over the windows gave a good view of the parking lot however his eyes went back to the counter followed it to the register which he saw was some kind of computer type deal he figured when he went to the john he could carefully check the register and see if there was a silentalarm button or wire near the cash drawer rare but not so rare it shouldnt be checked out hell who knew in goddamned texas there might be a sawedoff or a sixgun slung under the register this damned state had guns everywhere there was a mirror on the wall too probably okay but he made himself a note to check it out you put the point of a pencil up against it if there was a gap between the pencil and its reflection you were okay but if they touched it was a oneway job which would mean a watcher or maybe even a shooter on the other side the kitchen as usual was behind the counter with a long dutch window through which to slide the plates now it held two cooks on sunday at least four maybe six all of them black would they make a fuss to save the boss man his insured money probably not certainly not older guys but a young buck like the niggers on the yard busting with come and wanting to show how dead tough they were hmmmm would bear watching he pivoted slightly to study the layout of the tables only one dining room that was fine but what wasnt was the dogleg as the greedy bastards that ran the place had set six booths in the hallway that led to the bathrooms and the managers office as a nosmoking zone be hard for one man to cover both the main room with its fifty or so tables and the hallway ninety degrees to the right the register man could probably cover both or he himself as he took the manager back to his office could cover the hallway but where would he put his tail gunner best place would be in a window booth halfway down that way the tail gunner could watch for heroes in the crowd and take them out if he had to and also keep an eye tuned to the lot for cops and there was that back way out which pleased lamar if it came to shooting you never went into guns you always went away from them flanked them and dealt with them and then the problem with a goddamned wheel man with only four players on the crew and one of them shaky as hell and another a cherry and the room big there was no way he could have the wheel man out and running needed the crew inside all of them even dickhead richard didnt like that at all have to park right there at the entrance and run in but a cop driving by might see the car engine running doors opened empty thats the sort of thing that set them off have to run a test on the patrol runs how often does johnny cop come amoseying by and only three days till sunday best to wait until next sunday but richard would crack odell would get dangerously bored and who knew what might go down with ruta beth here he looked over to ruta beth who had turned shit she said a cop the deputy tapped on the window he was just a boy really midtwenties with cornsilk hair and eyes that were too far apart behind the aviators shades actually he looked a bit mean and surly and he stared right at poor richard he gestured richard just stared at him stupidly his mind utterly blank with panic in fact he wet his pants the warm urine cascaded over his crotch under the dress he blinked back tears behind him richard could feel odell tense and see one of his hands disappear as it slid under the blanket where the ar lay the butt stock of the rifle was in plain sight if the cop looked at it and could get beyond the idea of the absurdity of an assault rifle in the back of an old toyota with two old ladies hed have them cold richard began to gibber strange noises came from his throat ayah ayah ayah he began to chant through utterly dry lips his mouth felt like a hole full of sand impatiently the cop repeated the strange gesture and then tapped on the window wahl wnduh said odell more gibberish then it cleared magically in richards head roll down the window his trembling fingers flew to the crank and he wound it down feeling an idiots smile splay across his face he was beyond panic he was in some place where butterflies of pure fright flitted and danced howdy maam said the young cop mouth agape richard nodded moronically its such a hot day i was somewhat worried to see yall sealed up like that a dog can die in an hour locked in a car yes maam seen it myself you going to need some air it was pure nonsense to richard why didnt the cop notice his whiskers his thickish shoulders the black hair on his arms the broadness of his hands or the goddamned rifle butt sticking out of the blanket between the two yall from out of town oklahoma down here visiting richards tongue seemed to constrict he wasnt sure what he was about to spit out aunt lucy oh aunt lucy dont you git upset he looked over and saw ruta beth flying down the steps toward him and lamar hanging back but eyeing the situation carefully she ran to richard and began to stroke his hand gently saying to the cop you know aunt lucy was as perky as a bumblebee until the stroke now she just sits in the rocker all day long with mrs jackson and they rock and rock and rock on thursdays we like to take them for a long drive only chance they ever git to be off the farm the young cop stepped back looking from ruta beth to richard and back again never once considering lamar thursdays bills day off ruta beth continued he works at the chalmers plant up in oklahoma city lord hes a kind soul my first jack williams jr why that man wouldnt do a thing if it werent to his own advantage she turned dramatically bill honey its okay you can go back and get the ice cream lamar nodded and headed back inside they love ice cream ruta beth continued to the young officer but lord you cant take em inside they just cant handle it all the hustle and bustle so we leave em in the car git a quick dr pepper then bring em their ice cream its the best part of the week okay maam said the young officer just checking the old lady evidently rolled up the window aunt lucy you bad girl and i tried to make em see how quick they could run out of air on a hot day seen it happen to dogs all the time mama comes back from the grocery with her two kids and fidos done bought the ranch in the back seat terrible way for kids to learn about dying well i will talk to aunt lucy you can believe me shes just got to learn be seeing yall hope you come back to wichita falls well i certainly hope we do too the cop passed lamar now emerging with two icecream sodas in paper cups and tipped his hat lamar smiled and came around and climbed in here you go aunt lucy he said loudly and made a show of handing the cup to richard but at the last moment pulled it away aww said richard you blankethead richard he hissed as he slid in goddamn you couldnt think of nothing but to look at him like you swallowed a goddamned fish im not an actor lamar no you aint he said then turning honey you saved our goddamned bacon on that one you done just great i think you got a future in this shit lamar said richard can i have my soda no you may not said lamar odell gets one soda because he sat cool as a cucumber with a smile on his face just like i told him and ruta beth gets the other one because she handled that johnny cop slickern motor oil you dont get nothing richard another second and id have had to pop that boy and were on the run again for nothing you dummy shit he gave ruta beth a kiss as they pulled out thank you daddy she said wichud wee wee said odell whats that odell said lamar honey did you understand him hes saying richard went wee wee said ruta beth oh aunt lucy said lamar you are such a baby chapter nothing panics you like your own blood but by the time hed gotten to the hospital bud had figured out that he probably wasnt going to die that night and he didnt stitches underneath his arm had popped when he leaped to celebrate jeffs home run but the loss was minimum though the young emergency room doctor wouldnt release him and so he spent another night in the hospital despite his considerable meanings and groanings about it he complains like that all the time jen told them its his idea of fun but the next morning colonel supenski himself showed up with lion eyes and not a lot of oldboy fellowship bud you are ragging on me something fierce yes sir said bud glumly now i want you to consider doctors orders my orders you cant go roaming about doing god knows what its not a vacation youre still on duty and your duty is to recover and return to active duty yes sir said bud bud i can see in your eyes somethings eating at you i know how being shot can make a man call into value a lot of the things he holds dear i want you to bud fixed the colonel with a glare what are you saying colonel theres talk bud talk talk about what bud as i understand it somebodys wife saw you and teds widow at a diner in elgin it didnt seem right whose business is it it shouldnt be nobodys business bud but that isnt the point what should and what is are different as night and day the truth is if you wear the badge and walk the walk you have to live a life that not only is free of taint but looks free of taint it isnt pretty and it sure isnt fair but its what it is and thats the fact and i know you know same as i do now alls i want from you is recovery time do you understand bud took a deep breath never in his long career had he ever argued with authority it wasnt his way if you enforce rules you live by rules that was that but this time for whatever reason maybe just his prickly orneriness or some deeper sense that the universe was now ever so slightly unhinged he said whats going on between mrs pepper and myself is just nobodys damned business but hers and mine and maybe my wifes thats all there is to it the colonel looked at him hard bud a deevorce a scandal it could cost you so much believe me i know i went through one in the marine corps fourteen years ago and it took me forever to get back on my feet i never ever got the love back of my middle daughter and i will die regretting that all for a younger woman i thought i loved who is now married to a general so i know bud ive been there plus bud i got the patrol to think over you up and marry the widow of the man you were partnered with who got killed when you were along might git some folks talking next thing you know you got those news boys looking for dirt its a hard thing yes sir said bud i hear you but what i should tell you is teds dying words he asked me to look after holly okay bud i believe you now you just get better and ever damn body going to be fine they let bud go that afternoon but before he drove home he called holly hi oh bud tell me it wasnt nothing no just some stitches broke some minor local bleeding thats all oh thats great and theyre going to let you out i am out oh bud can i meet you holly thats just it people are beginning to talk the colonel said something there was a long silence on the line holly the last thing either you or i need is some huge mess over whos with who so what are you saying bud well i dont know bud thought about how simple it all became without holly it was as if all the weight that had accrued on his neck and shoulders over the last few months suddenly took flight and vanished he saw the future before him as a kind of sentimentalized postcard golden and pure yet even as he could not bear the thought of hurting jen neither could he bear the thought of hurting holly bud do you want it to be over no holly of course not i couldnt live without you he said bud i couldnt live without your bad jokes we just have to be careful for a time is all this settles down we get it all straightened out when will i see you well i got a grand day planned for us tomorrow i want to go through lamars prison stuff everyone else has why shouldnt i anyway thats a long drive up to mcalester i could meet you say in duncan at eleven we could drive on up get lunch id go into the house for an hour or two and then wed come on back and have dinner on the way oh bud dont that sound like the prom itself bud drove on home then and got there just as jeff had returned from practice jen was back late and behind seemed to be manufacturing some despair over the dinner that she felt she had to prepare the issue was chicken or fish neither sounded like much to bud goddamn he said we got some celebrating to do this boy hit a home run i just got out of the hospital and you worked too late to put in one more minute here lets go out to dinner i need meat red meat freshly killed the meers store any objections dad its so expensive for hamburgers whatever lets go we can put it on the card bud we havent paid that yet well it aint overdue so it wont bounce come on jen lets give this boy a thrill like the one he gave us last night dad jeff said in a voice dense with mock despair over his fathers shameless corniness now come on people times awasting maybe even russ would join us if he aint snooty these days i have a paper due tomorrow russ called down from upstairs honors history russ looked like a goddamn beatnik but he got straight as and was a good boy even if he rarely spoke one word in a language his father understood we shouldnt leave russ said jen bud bounded up the stairs the ache in his legs vanished in his explosion of enthusiasm it was suddenly overwhelmingly important that russ be there that they all be together his oldest sons room was a strange jungle to him the junkaddict rock star in the poster all the narrow little paperback books without pictures on the covers by people bud had never heard ofcamus sartre nietzsche mailer dostoyevsky names like thatmagazines with words rather than pictures on their covers too a whole universe that just puzzled bud whod had to drop out of oklahoma state his freshman year when his father had died of cirrhosis in an air force hospital and had gone into the air force himself for four years the next week now whats this about a paper it cant wait dad if i screw up this thing foster wont give me a recto princeton like he said he would your brother did so well i know thats terrific im really happy for him but this paper sure i understand said bud who of course didnt russ was a thin boy more bone and muscle than flesh who wore his hair troublingly long bud tried never to look at his left earlobe where something glittered and he didnt approve of the way the boy dressed almost purely in black except for a battered leather coat of the sort the pilots had worn when bud was an air policeman those many years ago russ had just charted his own course through life he loved his folks and never gave them a lick of trouble but he wanted a wider more passionate world read all the time was trying to read himself out of oklahoma its okay dad said jeff who had come up the stairs after bud hes a brain hes got to study he didnt say it angrily he and russ never competed directly and ran in completely different circles in high school it was all right it was cool but bud felt a flash of anger he loved it so when his boys were together and he could hover over them as he had when they were children perhaps most fascinated at his own sense of kingship than out of any sense of giving them something too it was a selfish thing jen had told him the boys had to be who they were not his little servants there to reflect his glory he didnt quite agree but everywhere he saw the signs authority breaking down both on the road and in the home it was a losing battle no sense at all of even fighting it the day of the father as master was ending closing out he knew that and could get through it he told himself but he missed that sense of lordship that used to come with paying the mortgage okay no problem well bring you something thanks dad said russ they left shortly and drove through the dark nobody said much on the way over there wasnt much traffic as they took cache road through the builtup strip abutting fort sill and then got to plain flat highway west of lawton twenty miles out of town they turned and drove up through the wichita national wildlife refuge where buffaloes could actually be seen the mountains rose around them like humps of stone the meers store was an old miningcompany store whose quaintness some clever people had preserved now it served huge hamburgers made from authentic longhorn beef said to be low on cholesterol high on flavor it was one of those downhomey joints known for good beef cold beer and flirty waitresses full of junky posters and deer that nobody in living memory had killed it didnt take long to find a table and in just a bit more time bud was draining a budweiser and waiting for a big hamburger his favorite jeff you should be so proud i thought id bust a gut when you hit that ball i did bust a gut jeff gave a strange selfconscious shrug you did so well jeff said jen were so proud well one lucky swing doesnt make a season no but it just might start you off on a path to success i feel you have the talent to be a major league player if thats what you want bad enough probably not dad he should still plan to go to college bud said jen sure sure i aint saying he shouldnt but he should also be damned proud what pitch you hit dad i dont even remember i just decided id swing truth is id pretty much given up didnt think i could hit him the ball was just smoke that guy was good hes pitched a couple of nohitters this year hes only a sophomore they say hell go pro before he graduates but he threw it where i could hit it god it felt so good well sir it looked good too bud sat back he ordered another beer when the girl brought the food delicious as anticipated it was dark in the place and as he ate he could see people but not their faces they could have been anyone he thought and thought of all the hundreds of times hed come across grotesque things on the road where out of nowhere scum hit innocent people and took their money and sometimes their lives the people just couldnt do a thing about it except hope for mercy thats how sudden and ugly it could come his family sat in the light who was in the dark who waited was it a lamar pye death just waiting to happen and who would protect them he bud he was sworn to be off with his young woman having the kind of adventure hed never had when he was a young man and was so lucky to get to now but who would save them from the lamars he looked at them jen was telling jeff about a new jacket she thought he ought to get for his college interviews jeff was saying that russ didnt get a jacket but didnt need one he was such a brain they were intent on their conversation and bud wanted to hug them both and hold them from the darkness he met her at eleven and they set off for mcalester why everybodyfbi osbi u marshals department of corrections police pittsburg county sheriffs department oklahoma city homicidehad gone through the squalid collection of convicts possessions such as they were these were the very best professional investigators in the state what could bud find that they couldnt bud knew the answer nothing anyway he wasnt really even an investigator having spent most of his career on the road where things happened fast and furious and you handled a hundred decisions and situations a day but no penetrations into mystery or playing a dozen varying accounts off against each other or cultivating a network of informants but still bud somehow wanted to know lamar in a way that reading his jacket could not provide he wanted to touch the things that lamar had touched and cherished and see what lamar felt about life i dont know how you can put your hands on those things what do you expect to get out of it holly asked just as jen had that morning jen had said it was a sick obsession holly however grudgingly accepted it i dont know he said dont the indians believe if a man holds a thing dear some of his soul rubs off on it but lamar dont have a soul maybe his evil rubbed off on his stuff i want to see whats left in it bud thats crazy well maybe it is but im going to go nuts if i just sit around that house and take percodans itll be a nice trip they took oklahoma east from duncan toward the small penitentiary city miles away it was a bright summers day and on either side of the highway the farmland spilled away the neat fields broken up by stands of trees or low hills all of them decorated with the rhythmic pumping of the oil wells which somehow looked like giant insects at their feeding up pause and then greedily down again now and then theyd blow by some hopeful rural town usually with pennants flapping and gas station signs climbing heroically into the sky and a small civilization of fastfood joints bud loved it highway america always different always the same he loved the snap of the wheat in the wind and the small tidy places and the neatly furrowed fields and the high blue sky and the green everywhere it had given him such a thrill to roll down that ribbon of concrete in his unit aerials whipping lord of it all and all who looked on him knew that he was the man that counted he looked over at holly she was such a pretty young thing he didnt believe hed ever seen a person in whom the features were so perfectly formed why did she like him so she looked over and smiled she had nearly perfect teeth what are you thinking bud im wondering how come of all the men in the world you picked me you could have had any of them well i could not have and you know it i picked you because you were the kindest and the strongest and the bravest and the best who wouldnt pick such a man he shook his head the absurdity of the praise almost irritated him he remembered the fear the sense of worthlessness hed felt when lamar brought the shotgun to bear for the last moment just before pulling the trigger whatever his virtues they were valueless that day the cloud that passed through his mind must have shown in his eyes bud she said cant you let it go the thing with lamar teds death that horrible thing its over the others will get him sooner or later its forgotten okay i swear it oh bud she said with a sigh you are such a wonderful liar that seemed to let the tension escape and they drove the rest of the way in a buoyant mood he flirted and she laughed they listened to the radio there was an oldies station in oklahoma city that they picked up koma and bud knew more of the songs than holly did they made jokes about the troopers parked by the roadside or occasionally cruising down the other side of the highway strip it was light and pleasant in under two hours they came to the small city of mcalester and from the highway they could see the citys only remaining industryits prison from oklahoma as they headed in it looked somehow magical like a moorish city or a camelot the high white fortresslike walls shining in the sun it looked so cheerful so promising but it was such a fantasy no cheer in that place and goddamned little promise here we go said bud turning off route for the twomile spin up west street until it delivered them into the prison itself was it his imagination or did he feel a sense of dread and evil as they approached as if the air somehow had gotten heavy mcalester state penitentiary was everything you thought of when you heard the word prison the walls were huge and blank and festooned with cruel razor wire and up close the fraudulence of the whitewash revealed itself because you could see the ancient bricks mortared into place in the millions and you knew that under the bright paint they were dingy as though soaked in woe so much bad comes out of a place like that it makes you wonder said bud as he turned off west street onto prison boulevard in the shadow of the vast south wall itself the convicts call em gladiator schools its where a young kid with a wild streak learns how to be a burglar a butt fucker a cop killer and how never to feel nothing about what hes done you dont want to know what goes on inside a place like that you cant begin to imagine it but ill tell you this nothing good ever came out of an american prison id drench em in napalm and turn every last boy inside into ashes and black bones and start over the newspapers would scream holly pointed out they would until they watched the crime rate fall bud pulled into a slot marked law enforcement just shy of the admin building that crouched under the walls and turned his truck engine off lamar and odell and richard theyd come this way he remembered from the newspapers that first day after the escape the arrows pointing to a secondfloor grated window in the admin section of cell block a out back where that poor boy had parked his truck and they had climbed into it and waited for him to come to his death then theyd driven out the gates turned left turned left again and come down this merry little street with the cheery visitors center the wardens big house like a mansion even a tacky little museum before turning down west street and heading out into the world open that glove box he said she did and saw a small black gun thats a beretta he said thirteen shots safetys on anything happens bud i know its silly and not a thing will happen but you know how my mind works anyhow you take that gun and push the safety down with your thumb then all you have to do is pull the trigger thirteen times that should make him really mad so after that you slug him with it bud you are so strange do you really think theres going to be another prison break no but like the man says if you want peace prepare for war ill be back in an hour okay yes sir its not a problem you sure yes sir i brought a paperback book along to read good they were expecting bud but if he anticipated any personal apology for the things that mcalester had unleashed he got none only professional courtesy distant and cool but not rude he checked his colt commander with an assistant warden who took him into a bleak little office there in three battered cardboard boxes were all that remained in the big mac of lamar pye his cousin odell and richard peed no letters said the assistant warden lamar and odell havent gotten letters in years nobody cared about them or even knew about them until they broke out they didnt exist bud nodded i dont know what youre looking for said the assistant warden but if you think youre going to find it there i think youll be disappointed how long do you want oh an hour or so thats fine sergeant take your time no rush no ones going anywhere bud sat down and pulled over odells box it was mostly clothes neatly laundered blue jeans and plaid shirts a few prison denims of the sort that were no longer strictly mandatory the underwear all clean no porn he seemed not to have a sexual bone in his body a model airplane poorly assembled some kind of world war ii ship with glue smeared all over it a shank cut from a shoehorn wickedly vicious and finally a cigar box just as a small boy in a fabled boyhood would have a huck finn bud opened the thing first off he saw a faded picture of a farm woman taken judging from her hair some time in the sixties she had that severe depressionera look no meat at all on her sinewy features narrow eyes that expected no mercy from the world her taut mouth held a tension of sorts she was hunched in a cheap coat though the sun was shining the picture was blurry but in the background he saw white clapboard a farmhouse perhaps he turned the picture over ode ll mama camilla anadarko oklah it said in bold childish letters though the writing could not have been odells since the man was hopelessly retarded and illiterate next out came a coloring book bud opened it some time early sixties badly done the crayon strokes violent and mixed paying no attention to the lines the book was drawn from a walt disney cartoon movie called sleeping beauty full of thin beautiful blond people an act of cruelty bud thought to give such a thing to a hulking damaged boy like odell with the hole in his face and the nothingness in his mind he could just look and wonder at what he could not have ever a womans flowery hand had written odells favorite book inside the cover and paging through bud finally came upon what must have been odells favorite page it was a dragon rearing up ferociously about to strike a handsome knight with a sword alone it was not touched by a crayon the image held too much power for young odell to defile that was it so little for a human life even an odell pyes he pulled the next box over finding it heavy it had to be richards because the heaviness soon revealed itself to be books richard was a reader in the belly of the beast in cold blood the pound era thus spake zarathustra by somebody whose name bud could not even figure out how to pronounce the books looked a little like russs which somehow irritated him paging through them bud found lines highlighted in yellow marker it was all gibberish mostly about violence thus speaks the red judge why did this criminal murder he wanted to rob but i say unto you his soul wanted blood not robbery he thirsted after the bliss of the knife his poor reason however did not comprehend this madness and persuaded him what matters blood it asked dont you want at least to commit a robbery with it to take revenge and he listened to his poor reason its speech lay upon him like lead so he robbed when he murdered he did not want to be ashamed of his madness crazy stuff what the hell could it mean he guessed richard was trying to figure out what he was doing in here too bad richard boy you made your decision now you got to take the consequences bud put the little book down and went through a few heavy and glossy paperback books on art mostly painting again nothing pornographic some art suppliessheaves of drawing and tracing paper a small box with pencils chalk chunks of charcoal for sketching but no sketches no weapons just shaving gear all neat and a toothbrush the toothpaste neatly rolled up a comb a bic razor some colgate shaving cream soap in a plastic box it all gave bud the creeps for some reason and he soon tired of richard and his intellectual vanities he pulled the last box over gave l it said on the outside the clothes were neat in a professional convicts way jeans a jean jacket even a pair of cowboy boots much polished much worn a stack of magazines guns ammo shooting times gun world and a profusion of stroke books bud paged through them penthouse and playboy and a few more obscure ones that seemed to show women in stockings or women bent over spreading their asses exposing their tulip like assholes or leaning back and ramming plastic or rubber dildoes into amazingly prehensile vaginas again bud felt slimy as if lamar were drawing him in making him party to lamars own inner horror he set the magazines down found a wellthumbed copy of the picture history of the third reich he found something called the turner diaries and another called the last clarion for the white race aryan brotherhood shit at last he came to an album of sorts he pulled it out lamars book it said in blocky letters the same letters he recognized from the back of the picture of odells mama he opened it up encountering a crumbling yellow news clipping from the arkansas gazette of august hero trooper slays two before dying the headline read and bud made out the murky onecolumn shot of a man identified as trooper sergeant swagger a state trooper sergeant shot and killed two suspected murderers on route north of fort smith yesterday afternoon before dying himself of gunshot wounds inflicted by the two men dead were sergeant earl lee swagger of polk county a marine congressional medal of honor winner in the pacific in world war ii and jim m pye of fort smith and his cousin buford bub pye also of fort smith state police give this account of the event yesterday morning two men answering the descriptions of jim m pye and buford pye robbed an ap in downtown fort smith shooting two employees they escaped in a white ford authorities immediately began roadblock procedures but the two assailants evaded the roadblocks they were spotted by sergeant swagger on route he gave pursuit and managed to drive the vehicle off the road near winslow attempting to arrest the men he was shot in the lower chest and stomach as the two men made their getaway on foot sergeant swagger shot and killed buford pye then he trailed jim pye for nearly three hundred yards into the corn fields where he exchanged shots again with his assailant pye was hit in the eye and the stomach and was found dead at the spot sergeant swagger returned to the car to await medical attention but bled to death before help could arrive he leaves a wife eria june and a yearold son bob lee wow thought bud they knew how to build a lawman in those days wonder if id have the guts for that action rather than contemplate so melancholy a topic bud gave the page a turn next was a report card from the arkansas state reformatory middle school dated june lamar got a bunch of s and s in his subjectsas and bs that wasbut some educator had written lamar shows great potential when his classes interest him but his tendency for getting in fights or disruptive behavior threatens his academic achievement he must learn impulse control additionally he sexually assaulted two younger boys he clearly has overly mature aggressive tendencies as well as serious resentment of authority he had better be given therapy quickly before he develops serious personality pathologies of course he wasnt of course he did the next page another news clipping from the anadarko callbulletin of january farmer found slain on perkins ville road the story simply related how a farmer named jackson pyethe third worthless pye brother bud concludedhad been stabbed to death by a mysterious assailant as he walked home along a country road from a nearby tavern there were no witnesses the report also said he was survived by his son odell another page convenience store robberies continue another local man arrested on rape charges another bail denied to violent offender gave another gave escapes from county lockup bud riffled through the pages the raw verbs of crime headlines yelled up at him from the seventies and the crimes mostly robbery and theft now and then a murder and a sentencing lamar had become the compleat career criminal master of a dozen violent trades his acts marked by brazenness violence and a certain nutty courage lamar had balls no doubt about it pyes convicted in pusateri killing read the last one an account of how lamar and odell shot a motorcycle gang snitch in the head and dumped him how he miraculously survived to identify them before dying sentence fifteen years to life for each killer cousin the album was lamars life what he was proud of his resume what would you do with such a man how could he possibly be reclaimed he came from criminal stock he evinced antisocial behavior from an early age was unnaturally aggressive and took to the lifestyle of the professional criminal with extraordinary ease he was born to be a criminal that was all bud put the book down there was nothing at all here except a warning for any and all who dared mess with lamar pye without backup and lots of firepower put him in your sights and blow him away thats all he glanced at his watch hed been at it three hours jesus christ and holly was still waiting outside he reached for the pile of slick magazines to reinsert in the box but by their very slickness they fell to the floor skidding and opening bud cursed and bent to retrieve them and then noticed something strange across the rolling mountainous breasts of the penthouse pet of august there was inscribed some sort of figure it wasnt a drawing but the impression of a drawing that had been done on a paper laid across it bud picked it up tried to find some angle of light that would reveal its secret that didnt work the image kept collapsing as the light changed it occurred to him to do a tracing he remembered that richard had some light paper in the art supplies in his box and he quickly got it out he laid the paper across miss august only slightly obscuring the thrust of her tits the prong like tightness of her nipples with a piece of charcoal he delicately rubbed the paper just enough pressure to leave the charcoal everywhere except in the grooves where it sank under pressure when he was done he looked at what he had brought out it was the image of a lion chapter mar go byebye wif rutiegirl dell go barn see moo cow plus wichud moocow niceynice soft smell toasty eyeballs brow ny like

climbed from the dusty vehicle richard youre a painter aint you time to pull your weight son lets get this sucker repainted but richard looked like somebody had just squeezed all the air out of him he was the color of dead petunias whats wrong boy odell hit me twice i dont see no blood if he really hit you youd be bleeding but he hurt me odell no bon ky richard richard nicey nice odell go me sorry odells face lit in contrition genuine pain seemed to briefly shine from his eyes dell baddy bad he said see he apologizes richard okay does that take care of it ah said richard i suppose lamar the baby has been upset at your absence said ruta beth i wonder if we could control him if you werent here dont you fret that hon said lamar now come on we got work to do but richard wondered for just a second there it looked as if odell was going to lose it his dull eyes inflated in fear and rage and it was as if his whole chest swelled he had grabbed richard and slapped him hard atop the head twice richard had felt like a rag doll the fear hate of losing lamar had turned odell briefly psychopathic and frightening it scared the shit out of richard in one of his moods odell could hurt anyone he shuddered at the thought odell alone in the world without lamar come on boy get to work commanded lamar they spent the afternoon with cans of spray paint and richard tried to lose himself in the work he was surprised how much he enjoyed the simple task it was freedom from lions it was freedom from fear it was freedom from odells whimsy or the utter domination of lamar after a frenzy of taping over the trim he sprayed the bright orange paint on the car in smooth circular motions almost as if it were an airbrush amazed at how quickly the car picked up its new color and how good he was at it he was much better than lamar a lot better than ruta beth and completely better than odell who simply could not get the concept of smoothness and just hammered a spot onto a single sector of the car so clumsily that even lamar saw the hopelessness of it and gave him another job and pretty soon they had it a nice orange car the next day friday lamar said to him okay richard you come with me today we goin pick up our second car a second car yes sir it will surprise you how a dumb okabilly like me got this sucker planned out richard we actually going to use three cars yep you got to plan it right if you want to stay ahead of johnny cop them boys got their computers and their helicopters and their whatall gittin harder and harder to do an honest days stealing but i think i got em buffaloed on this one yes i do hey boy youre arunning with the big dogs now aint it a toot yes sir said richard as they were pulling out of the farmyard in ruta beths toyota she came out and gave lamar a little peck on the cheek you be careful hon i will and you take good care of odell you watch him he can wander off dont you worry about odell me n him are going to have a good time im going to work and hes going to spin the wheel for me good he feels useful then richard you mind daddy he knows what hes doing yes maam said richard dont be late honey we wont be you want the roast beef tonight thatd be super lamar said they pulled out lamar was happy damn he said shes the best goddamn girl a man could find im a lucky man richard yes i am they drove the mile down the red dirt road turned left on then a few miles down west on toward altus the highway was flat across a flat land under a high western sky and a blaze of sun unfiltered by the thin clouds the mountains jutted from the plains and the wind snapped across the earth now and then a tractor would slow traffic down or theyd meander through some onehorse town a brick bank and hardware store a strip mall with an auto parts place and a laundromat the inevitable eleven see said lamar amiably trouble with those goddamned sevenlevens is that ever goddamned hour the manager sets a certain amount of the cash in the time lock vault through a little chute up top so at any given time you cant get but what the stores taken in in the past hour aint hardly worth the goddamn trouble he knew so much he knew how stores were organized what kind of vaults they had how police patrol shifts worked how city and state cqps differed in their investigative approaches how to operate any kind of gun or machine how to get into or out of anything how to rewire or deactivate electronic security devices it was as if he had burrowed into the very structure of the universe and knew all of its useful secrets now richard i do want to talk to you bout sunday sunday richard didnt want to think about sunday he had just willed it out of his mind you tell me what your job is im your tail gunner thats it now whats a tail gunner do he pretends to be a victim of the robbery he doesnt pull a gun or anything hes just with the squares his hands up everything but hes watching in case theres some hero or undercover cop you never know about undercover cops or some cowboy lots of cowboys in texas now richard what are you looking for man with a gun and what might the signs be ah richard struggled to remember hell have a coat on no matter how hot it is and hell be very conscious of the coat hell always be adjusting it you know pulling it tight to keep it from falling open you really think we may run into a man with a gun remember when that crazy guy went into lubys there were a hundred people in there and not one of them had a gun we may not be so lucky you going to see a bulge a bulge maybe a no richard goddamn dont you remember nothing these new holsters are real slick in holding the piece in tight to the body in the old days you could always see a bulge its all changed now with this here ballistic nylon plus all the cops wearing flat autos instead of rounded wheel guns you probably be up against a boy with a beretta or a glock or a sig rangers carry sigs texas highway patrol berettas you got to read his body got that yes sir said richard disconsolately feeling very much like a teenage boy who had disappointed his father and what else ahwhat else what else i dont know you dumbhead it may be a bitch yeah used to be damn few women working police and fewer by god of them packing guns now you got a goddamn oneinfive chance itll be a woman now if theres an undercover or plainclothes or offduty cop in there you got one chance in five its a woman could be a woman with kids woman at a table with her daddy or her old man could be a nigger woman a mex anything you read the goddamned body look for the way they carry their hands the way they dont swing about fast because it might cause the coat to fluff up you got that yes sir and if you see it and she goes for it when the job is coming down richard whats your assignment i have to shoot yes sir like i told you gun out front you look at the sights you look at the sights and you fire fast three times you put her down richard or she gonna put us down you think you cant do it think on this i get hit odell may go hog wild with that ar he could make that goddamned lubys thing look like sunday school you want that on your conscience no sir no sir quick in quick out nobody gets hurt we go home rich they were in downtown altus now driving through the dusty streets it was a low old town with no buildings over three stories lots of closedup storefronts a general store a courthouse and city hall that looked as if plush times had passed by many a year ago the usual statue of will rogers who never met a man he didnt like a few benches but lamar didnt go for it too open pull round the other side of town well find something with a bit more privacy they cut through what passed for the altus suburbs little houses swaddled under wilted trees and soon enough hit the commercial strip us running north yeah this is more like it pull in there richard pulled into a strip mall crowded with cars food lion was the big draw there was also a yogurt shop a county library a rexall a movie complex with five tiny ratty little theaters and a sporting goods store ooo movies aint that a treat pull in here richard were going to the movies no richard we are not going to the movies richard sometimes i wish id left you in that goddamn cell for the niggers theyda been more happy ida been more happy and hell boy maybe you da been more happy they sat in silence in awhile a car pulled in and a father and son got out and went up to the box office the father bought two tickets and they went in now aint that a gift see richard hell be in there two hours when he comes out itll take him at least a half an hour to figure out that he didnt forget where he parked his car but that somebody stole it itll take the cops even in a hick burg like this another fifteen twenty minutes to come on by to write the goddamned report by that time well have that sucker wearing a different color and new plates slowly richard drove over to the car but lamar said we got some time you just cruise a bit we got a last thing to talk about oh christ thought richard you got one other job what is it lamar now say something goes wrong i catch some shit i dont make it out or i get hit bad and die in the car bleed to death maybe the law is closing in its all gone down its turned to yellow cat shit lamar it could happen this is risky business sometimes the craziest things fuck you up you listening you can see it in your maginationt all too easily richard felt like crying i saved your ass from the niggers i got you out i got you this new life richard if they catch you you can tell them you was forced in all of this richard you might even be a hero in all this you could tell them all the bad things we done the stepfords will say you didnt do nothing that goddamn luckyass john waynelooking smokey sergeant will say you didnt shoot nobody hell theyll make a movie with whats his fucking name richard gere that the one hes playing you but you owe me one thing richard yes lamar you still got that smokeys gun you aint lost it or nothing no lamar i have it its back at ruta beths under the mattress i sleep on he hated it it was a big silver thing hard and slightly greasy he was supposed to dryfire it a hundred times a night to develop strength in his hands but he could never pull the trigger more than twentyfive times before it hurt too much ohyou dont have it now great richard well never mind if it goes to the skunks on us richard and old lamars been turned to meat by some state cop with a shotgun full of number four you wait till odells head is turned then you put that gun muzzle behind his ear and you pull the trigger thats the sweetest thing could happen to odell if im not here iii thought you loved odell i do too much to want to have to think about what would happen to him if i werent there to watch out for the boy who would care for him who would explain things to him there aint no mercy in this world for a big old baby whos listened to his evil cousin done harm and cant talk for himself who would brush his teeth who would make sure he eats sometimes he dont even know enough to eat at all hes the sorriest soul on earth truth is theyd make him into some kind of geek show if im dead and they catch him then they send him to some hole without me to figure out whats going on and to make the way for him couldnt have that richard no way so you got to do what i tell you yes lamar i knew i could trust you richard okay drop me here richard pulled over and lamar slipped out took a quick looksee in each direction then smooth and unruffled as could be just bent to the car door and slipped a long flat piece of metal down the window shaft with a few swift diddlesbackward while looking around with the softest and most relaxed expression on his facehe popped the lock and jumped behind the wheel in a second he had it started he backed out pulled by richard with a smile and headed off on his way chapter on saturday bud went to the new lawton public library just down from the new police station and looked at art books and books on africa lions what the hell was this thing about lions was it just lions or was it another themethe lion in art of the latter there wasnt much he only came across one painter who could be called a lion artist a frenchman named rousseau who painted the goofiest things bud had ever seen the stuff was called primitive the most famous showed a lion licking a sleeping black man under a spooky moon bud gazed on the picture trying to figure it out it actually kind of shook him it was like looking into someone elses dreamsit had that clear serene quality to it almost childish it seemed somehow smug that its meanings were sealed off to normal folk like himself it gave him the goddamn willies the other famous lion painting also by rousseau actually wasnt primarily about lions at all instead it was about a woman on a chaise lounge in the jungle she had the same spooky calmness in one corner of the picture a lion and a tiger almost lovers gazed from the dense green trees it also had that childish quality but there was nothing in it that seemed to have to do with lamar pye or richard peed because they were so peaceable and in a way so unnatural to lamar nature was savage this kind of wussy lion would strike lamar as a kind of sacrilege somehow but then bud noted a small drawing in an art history book jammed with paintings of important men and battles was it a lion it was a cat but could it be a lion he looked close at the caption more foreign gibberish with one recognizable key word lion tour ne vers la gauche la tete levee it read the artist was another french guy a eugene delacroix this eugene appeared to know a bit more about lions than his poor countryman rousseau there was nothing phony or movielike about it and this lion couldnt have come out of any dream it was a big beast somehow shivering in the delight of its own existence its head corkscrewed slightly to the left so that you couldnt see the famous lion profile or much of the familiar mane the beast seemed to be stretching itself on some plain somewhere but eugene must have feared lions and known what they could do in a way the dreamer rousseau never could eugene somehow got its throbbing power the bunched muscles under the skin the sense of sheer grace and coiled energy stored in it its animal purity but the eyes especially seemed to have some secret meaning they were jetblack arrowheads set in the narrow skull animal eyes devoid of mercy or curiosity merely intent on feeding whatever instincts happened to play across the lion brain odd how much emotion a few lines inked on a piece of paper one hundred oddyears ago could stir bud shivered himself though not with delight he felt the power of the predator the instinctive killer maybe this is what richard was trying to bring out but that was all he came up with and so he put the art books aside and turned to the lion as animal gazing for hours at lion photography from a variety of texts this got him even less lions for all their vaunted majesty were just big cats in their slouchy poses their silkiness their slopebellied laziness he saw a cat one of the boys had once had a yellow tabby thing hung with the name mischief whod laid around the house all day watching the human beings with total disinterest seeming as harmless as a slightly animated pillow but every once in awhile hed bring in a tiny lung or heart or something as an offering as if to a god as if he bud master of the house were the god whatever it worked the cat lived with them in perfect harmony for eleven years before finally dying comfortably of old age bud had always liked its split personality that it could be the complete tabby by day then slip out at night and revert to savagery rending some small creature down to its organs but this got bud nowhere except into a blinding headache he called holly and had a brief but entirely pleasant chat as he told her all about the lions of the lawton library and she laughed at the image of the big old boy who looked like john wayne looking at books on lions and how the mamas must have thought he was crazy or something she said he was damned lucky they didnt call the police then he said uh i was thinking i might drop by tomorrow you was was you she said in flirty fake astonishment well whatever gave you that idea oh a little fellow well if you come you best bring him along about noon yes sir she said when he got home everybody seemed happy he even felt happy though he had to gobble a percodan to keep from hurting it seemed that all was at peace in the strange realm he called his empire he didnt have to mollify any of his farflung rebellious provinces he had a few beers a light supper and went to bed before either of the two boys got home from dates or parties or whatever he dreamed of lions on sunday bud rose and feeling he hadnt been paying enough attention to jen and feeling also guilty over what he had planned for noon went to the nine am service with her and jeff russ of course the intellectual had stopped going to church in the eighth grade so russ slept because hed been out late the night before on some fool thing at least he hadnt come back with another earring bud put his anger aside or in the little place where he stored it and drove across town with jen and jeff in jens station wagon jen had taken to going to the methodist church though like bud shed been christened a baptist her father a prosperous farmer up near tulsa had always referred sneeringly to methodists as baptists who forgot where they came from and although jen stuck with her father on pretty near everything shed decided to give methodism a shot and it stuck the methodists had a preacher named webb fellowes whom she liked a great deal because he always gave a damned entertaining sermonf or a younger man he seemed to be quite wise and respectful and he was funny today he told an amusing story about a rich texas oil man who annually gave percent to the church and quite a sight more when the parishioners decided to build a new building afterward this texan was asked if he belonged to the church hell no he said the church belongs to me bud saw what webb fellowes was getting at it wasnt a thing about how much you gave in dollars but how much you gave in your heart if thats the case he thought i aint much of a christian especially because as soon as the service is over and jen and jeff and i go to get some breakfast im going to go break a commandment after the service they walked down the line that got them to the minister and he was well up on things hear you hit a dinger son he called out heartily clapping jeff on the arm yes sir i did said jeff that balls still climbing said jen no maam it just barely made it over the center fielders mitt jeff said but it was a home run nevertheless well mrs pewtie youve got every right to be proud and every right to be thankful she said and took buds arm and brought him a little closer howre you doing sergeant asked webb fellowes well said bud they tell me i wont be going through any metal detectors without setting off every alarm between here and kansas city but i feel pretty good the minister laughed the lord looks after those who know hes there he said bud smiled enthusiastically at the young minister and at the absurdity of the statement what a crock he thought as he pumped fellowes strong hand the lord dont look after nothing he just sets the goddamned lamar pyes of the world loose and hell comes for a meal nearly every place that boy hangs his hat afterward the family went to the dennys on cache road near the holiday inn and had a nice big breakfast though bud who hated to wait in lines grew restless while waiting to be seated and began to get somewhat angry but there was no point to that then he remembered that once hed had lunch with holly in this place but it hadnt gone well because he was so frightened of being seen by somebody he tried to put all that out of his mind bud had what they called their grand slam three scrambled eggs home fries bacon and a pancake bud i swear you leave some food for the people still in that line jen said in her abstract way i dont know why but i am damned hungry you havent been eating since it happened lamar pye took my appetite thats for sure but i do believe he gave it back to me today he shoveled down a forkful of home fries they were a significant weakness of his dad jeff said i wanted to head out to the batting cages on sixtyone i dont want to lose what it is i got can you drive me out sure bud said trying to keep a little stab of disappointment off his face his plan with holly just washed up when do you want to go oh anytime figure wed get home and change and then go sounds good he said feeling like a heel for what he was about to do oh say ill tell you i was going to log in some range time today i think i may invest in one of those ninemillimeters i dont never want to try and speed load under fire again sixteen shotsll beat six any day of the week the lawton boys carry these clocks and i thought i might head over to their range and see if i could talk one of them into letting me run a box of ammo through to see how i like it though jed wheelright had a beretta i liked a lot so whynt you relax a bit after you get home let the food settle and ill go on be back in an hour or so then well go hit bud you know you get to talking guns with those boys at that range you wont be home till well after nightfall it irked him that she knew him so well no i swear it just fifty rounds in the q target just to see if i can hit a goddamned thing with a nine much less a glock and then im home believe that when i see it jen said sure dad i have some reading to do anyhow when they got home bud changed into jeans and a loosefitting golf shirt that wouldnt rub against the bandages that still crisscrossed his wounds and took his middays ration of percodans im going now he called but there was only sullen silence from jen but of course bud didnt drive to the range instead he drove to hollys trailer in sherwood village parked around back and feeling selfconscious as hell slid up to the door as he knocked on it he took a glance at his watch now thats a terrible sign he thought every time you start by looking at your watch it aint going to be a good thing at all but she opened the door in a short white robe and her perfect thin long legs got him to forgetting about the time and for an hour or so they were the only two people in the world god bud you sure you aint eighteen you make me believe i could be thats for sure ida hated to know you when you were eighteen youda killed me i guarantee it you were one then and i dont think i knew the difference between my pecker and my carburetor didnt until you began showing me three months ago he lay back trying to suck all the pleasure out of the moment the room was sunny and bright her spare bedroom because bud still felt queer about making love to holly in a room where she and ted had been though that spot was but ten feet away from where he now lay through a thin tin wall goddamn i feel good he said nobody ever made me feel as good as you do you aint so bad in the howgooditfeels department yourself mr pewtie she said but bud he lay there a bit watching the shadows play on the ceiling bud i want to know just one thing are you at least working on it by that i mean thinking about it theres work to be done we got to find a place you ought to talk to jen and the boys you ought to talk to a lawyer theres much to be done it cant just happen up and sudden bud faced the ceiling everything she said was true holly this aint the time but its never the time i told jeff id drive him out sixtyone to the hitting cages now she sighed okay bud go to the hitting cages with jeff but you have to do something soon it aint fair to nobody it wasnt so bad after that was said he dressed she joked with him and wouldnt sulk or act victimized and she gave him a good faretheewell so he could go off and be with his son without the cloud of a bad secret scene hanging over him about a mile from home he pulled into a strip mall parking lot and opened the lockbox in the rear of the pickup he took out his shooting bag where he kept his muffs and shooting glasses and assorted tools and picked up a small brown bottle of shooters choice bore solvent he squirted it on his hands and worked it in like a hand cream because the odor was so totally associated with firearms in his house the act itself disgusted him it was so common and low you have become cheap he told himself then he locked it back up and drove home he checked his watch he was only half an hour late he prayed that jeff hadnt lost interest or gone off with friends im home he yelled coming in the door sorry im late jeff lets go okay pad jeff called russ were going to hit at the cages you want to come nah thanks dad its okay jeff came bounding down the steps in cutoffs a collarless jersey shirt and his nikes he looked ropey as a cowboy a string bean of a boy all sinew and muscle and ranginess okay lets go yall be home by dinner jen called from the kitchen now again bud was happy nobody was in any pain anywhere once again hed gotten away with it nobody suspected a thing and even holly seemed content the edge he might fall off of wasnt so close at least for a little while he and jeff drove out route to micks driving range and batting cages a downhome entertainment center that had seen better days but for which each had conceived a deep affection how was the glock dad jeff suddenly asked what oh the glock the clock now he had to lie to his son flat out something he hated to do it shoots well just like a revolver you pull the trigger and off she goes no cocking or anything they got the safety in the trigger little latch you pull automatically when you pull down but i dont know didnt have much feel to it not like my smith could you trade grips no the whole damn frame is one piece of plastic technically speaking it doesnt have grips they do have this little rubber sleeve you can pull over it i hear give it a palm swell and finger grooves but i think i like the beretta ninemillimeter best it feels just like that beretta i have i heard that beretta nines a good gun the gis carry it that they do said bud problem is it costs about one hundred dollars more than the clocks do thats why the cops all like the clocks you can own one for about fourfifty a beretta run you fivefifty six hell my was nearly five dad you ought to buy the gun you like if you ever have to use it again itd be better to have one you liked rather than one you got a good deal on bud nodded the boy was right at least someone in the family was thinking straight micks driving range and batting cages was set on a rolling chunk of green oklahoma farmland that overlooked the surrounding countryside and now and then when the artillery students were firing over at fort sill just to the north you could hear the rolling booms of the big s as they detonated against far mountainsides the road ran on a crest the highest point in the county and from the complex you could see for miles it was a windy day and micks was always festooned with pennants like some kind of extravagant musical comedy and the pennants snapped and fluttered in the wind the driving range was full up with golfers driving their little pills out onto the green like tracer bullets but for some reason the batting cages had never quite caught on jeff had no problem finding an empty one dad you going to hit nah ill just watch id pop stitches if i swung the bat too hard we dont need that you need some money yes sir i do bud handed over a tendollar bill and took a seat on the bench as jeff got change and fed the tokens into the machine he stood easily at the plate as the mechanical device ninety feet away issued what sounded like a reptilian clank as it came to life then with a shiver its arm lashed out and it dispatched a ball jeff just leaned into it and sent it sailing with a satisfying crack jeff was hot he was in the zone he was really seeing it bud just sat there and watched him and enjoyed each second of it the snap as the arm uncoiled and sent a ball whistling inward jeffs seemingly slow stroke the inevitable contact and the rise of the ball a white dot that screamed toward orbit then fell disconsolately to earth man you are really whacking that ball today bud called yes sir said jeff i am out of the slump when jeff used up the first ten dollars bud gave him another and then when that was gone offered still another dad you dont have to its okay its so great to see you out of your slump nah its fine i feel good jeff and bud headed back to the truck what are you doing different can you tell its the head i was leading with my chin and it was throwing the whole swing off that plus pressing so i just concentrate on keeping my head still watching the ball and swinging through its working was it set on fast absolutely dad from the start well if i were a scout id give you a hundredthousanddollar signing bonus on the spot id settle for a coke its a deal they got cokes at the machine nodded to gruff old mick and headed home as the twilight passed on toward darkness you mind if i see if anythings on the radio dad nah go ahead said bud jeff fiddled with the stations looking for koky out of oklahoma city the big rock station but as he slid through the sounds he cut across some urgent chatter that signified catastrophe built around the last two syllables of the word robbery wait stop said bud but they couldnt get a clear signal it must have been some texas ghost signal or something but bud grew concerned in his way and said switch to the am that news station dad you said jeff okay okay jeff switched bands to get to ktok and they heard the weather a network feed out of washington with headline summaries of notable local stories see its shhh commanded bud for hed heard the announcer launch into another story authorities in wichita falls texas have issued an all points bulletin for three escaped convicts in connection with a bloody shootout and robbery at a dennys restaurant this afternoon six persons are dead including four law enforcement officers in an armed robbery that netted an undetermined amount of cash oklahoma convicts lamar james pye his cousin odell warren pye and richard franklin peed escaped from the mcalester state penitentiary in oklahoma april second they killed a prison guard an oklahoma highway patrolman and a bakery goods driver and kidnapped an elderly couplebefore dropping out of sight four weeks ago police say todays armed robbery and shootout in wichita falls shows that they are armed and dangerous and at large in the north texassouth oklahoma region chapter the eggs lay before richard they seemed curdled and dissociative as if they were losing their very sense of eggness they were disintegrating untouched before his eyes next to them a small mountain range of home fries dried out as if in preparation for an ice age altogether it hardly looked like food anymore his coffee had grown tepid and rancid he glanced about consumed with that same queasy feeling hed had in the car before lamar and odell had gone crashing in on the stepfords everywhere he saw families couples a few lone air force personnel just sitting there eating their food they had no idea what visitation was about to come crashing down upon them in just minutes lamar odell and ruta beth would be upon them to take the money and threaten them with violence coffee he looked up into the eyes of a waitress ah no he said you okay you hardly touched your food no im fine im okay you want me to take it no he said not yet thats a real pretty picture huh oh thanks hed been doodling lions of course as per his masters wishes he dreamed of lions they pounced and lunged through his deepest thoughts he just couldnt get the neck right though somehow the waitress dissolved he wished he could quiet his rapping heart his knees were shaking the big minute hand drew nearer and nearer to four when everything would start happening depending on what police call signals lamar monitored on his new radio shack scanner in the car could be a bit before four could be a bit after depends lamar had said dropping him off half an hour before he swallowed the gun in his waistband hurt it was a huge thing and of course they didnt have a holster for it he just had wedged it in though lamar had done some magical thing with a string running a little loop down into his pants tied at either end on his belt forming a kind of truss that held the gun from slipping further he took a last look around trying to remember men in coats like the one he wore no only a cowboy over there or farmworker or something in a jeans jacket too short to conceal a handgun a woman undercover cop no possibility that was the thing about dennys it was the american melting pot at its best every stripe and shape of american you could imagine but in here today were only doughy middleaged types with their mamas and a couple of air force enlisted women wichita falls being a big air force town air force people flew airplanes right they didnt have guns they could bomb they couldnt shoot in the kitchen from what he could see was just a mess of black men in their forties working up a sweat and laughing to beat the devil all the time certainly not offduty policemen that left the manager a fat boy with pimples in his early twenties with the eyes of a squirrel and a perpetual grimace of near hysteria hed be the one lamar took in back to open the safe hed be the one lamar had said he could break in a minute never you mind how he stole a look at the young man who was officious and neurotic at once now shooing two waitresses off to fill water glasses or pour more coffee now rushing back to get on the cooks now working the register what a world of pain awaited that boy richard felt indecent exposed to so much imminent hurt and yet so unable to stop anything im like a falcon he thought it was a metaphor that had come to him when lamar had driven off in the station wagon there he had it his freedom he could just drive away nothing held him he had a car he could go and go and go instead ten minutes later he headed back to the farm that was the falcon part falcons are trained by their masters to believe theres a tether holding them to the masters wrist the master manages this by keeping the falcon on his wrist with a tether until the falcon finally falls asleep once he falls asleep hes convinced but sometimes it can go for days man and falcon just trying to outlast the other until sleep with him it had taken about ten minutes some willpower now he believed that no matter where he went he was tethered to lamar until lamar set him free and lamar would never set him free he shook his head took a last look then he felt the pressure of eyes upon him and turning to look out the window that his table sat next to saw the station wagon pull into the lot the car paused waited for another to clear out of the lot and pull into traffic he took a last look around he hadnt thought the room would be so full it was supposed to be between lunch and dinner these damn texans they couldnt do anything but by their own rules the car pulled up and into a disabledonly parking place he saw lamar in his cowboy hat and odell rocking gently in the back seat and ruta beth all staring at him richard took the handkerchief out of his pocket and waved it gently that was the signal he watched as lamar slid off his hat and pulled the ski mask down ski masks seemed to magically appear on ruta beth and odell the doors were opening in long raincoats to conceal their weapons they were out of the station wagon it was happening just then as he looked back toward the cash register richard saw the texas highway patrolman come out of the mens room drying his hands lamar listened to the scanner set on mhz the police cartocar frequency as they approached the restaurant its messages and strange halflanguage of tencodes and regional jargon crackled sporadically ah dispatch this is rvictortwentyfour i am ten twentyfour on the remington street accident tenfour rvictortwentyfour ah tennineteen the station tenfour dispatch i have a tenfiftyfive in custody copy that rvictortwentyfour you want breathalyzer

tenfour charlie let me know when youre ten twentythree and on it went them boys got themselves just a quiet sunday afternoon a few drunk niggers thats all hoo boy what they got acoming lamar waited for a car to clear then pulled into the restaurant parking lot carefully he navigated his way to the entrance and pulled up in front of it sliding into the open spot marked for a wheelchair lamar im pretty scared said ruta beth sweetie you gonna be just fine odell you aready eddy said odell placidly okay boys and girls lets kick ass and get paid he said pulling his ski mask down each burst from his door lamar went first low and crablike almost a scuttle but not a run because there were four steps to climb to get up into the restaurant but also because when you ran you were out of control and control was the heart of the job armed robbery was about it and nothing else you made your statement in the first second and drew your linesyou were in charge if anybody stepped over the line man woman boy girl baby you had to hurt them bad no exceptions no mercy you broke their bones you broke their spirits you took their money and you left them crying and shaking they could not get it in their skulls that any way but yours existed if you had to kill them you just did it cold and sudden and went on with business lamar was through the door first his heart steady as a rock his eyes darting like swallows and in the first second he saw the cop the cop saw him a little something passed between them and the cop took a half a backward step as if to say whoa partner let me think on this one but by then lamar had the shotgun out and the cop knew he was finished and was determined to go out like a man he was fast in his life hed probably dreamed such a thing a thousand times for it was one of the risks of the job his right hand flew to his automatic meanwhile in a fraction of the same second and equally without a conscious thought and without a twitch of curiositythough he did note the cops unexplained presence and meant to deal with it laterlamar raised the cut down browning a from under his coat and blew a doubleought into that surprised old boy texas highway patrol still had those oldtimey thirties uniforms gray shirt red collar and epaulets and they carried sigs and this boy was meat before he even touched his own gun the doubleought erupted into nine slugs traveling at over a thousand miles an hour and took his life from him and sent him knocko backward against the wall between the two restrooms to the left of the managers office he slid down the wall leaving a webbing of gore upon it for the pellets or some of them passed on through and his lifes blood spurted from his ruptured heart as he fell what lamar didnt know was that he had just called in on his radio jack which ran up from the transmitter on his duty belt and was affixed to his lapel fourteen miles away in the basement dispatch room of the iowa park barrack a dispatcher heard what she recognized immediately as the amplified sound of a firearms report she began frantically to call in the men on her network and in two minutes made contact with fourteen of them the fifteenth had just called in goingoutofservice at dennys for his twenty minute break getting no reply she calmly began to broadcast all units all units i have a possible tenthirtythree at the dennys off there at maurine street can somebody please verify possible signal thirteen signal thirteen meant officer down assistance required immediately lamar knew none of this of course he turned from his murder to face what he did expect utter incredulity everywhere he looked he saw slack mouths and gaping eyes as the echo of the shotgun blast seemed to rattle around in the still air and the gun smoke drifted into layers then the stupidity broke like glass into fear lamar could almost feel it shatter through the room a child began to cry moms squirmed to draw their children in to them and dads put out their hands to calm the older kids though their faces drained of blood as the great possibility of death dawned on them the airmen at the far table were sheet white almost pissing in their fancy blue uniforms the gun smoke spread through the room like vapor it was incredibly quiet except for the sudden clicketyclick as the spent gauge shell hit the floor and rolled quickly ruta beth had pulled buds mossberg from under her coat and vaulted the counter to chill out the nigger boys behind the dutch door and the two waitresses behind the counter odell had the artwo feet of black plastic colt assault rifleand waved it toward the seated citizens who immediately melted under its threat though it was a semiautomatic lamar knew its power for crowd control was awesome for anyone whod watched tv would assume it was a machine gun yall stay seated and we wont hurt you none we come for dennys money not yours lamar yelled in a loud unhurried almost countryandwestern voice witnesses would later say he sounded friendlylike sort of like travis tritt or randy travis his eyes caught on richard at his window table the boy looked almost as scared as the square johns then he pivoted his attention to the short pimply boy at the register he closed quickly put the gauge at the youngsters chin the boys mouth was working dryly he looked like a fish lamar had caught during one of his infrequent stays in society his jaw seemed to twitch as he sucked for air dont hurt me he said i will kill you if you dont gimme what i want the boys fingers flew to the computer register and he punched a key and it flew open take it sir take it all thats smalltime shit boy in back the safe you open it or by god youll wish you had using the gun as a prod lamar pushed him along they stepped over the dead cop whose eyes had glazed like marbles he lay in a satiny pool of his own blood legs akimbo head bent in an unnatural way both hands almost delicately relaxed he looked like a fallen angel lamar dipped down and with one hand removed the sig from a safety holster lamar knew how to bypass the fake thumbbreak and find the real one further down the strap it was a p in that made him happy he liked s he slid this one into his back waistband right next to the holstered longslide dark colt in the office the safe was a small sergant greenleaf model an eightdigit multipletumbler combination variant sunk in the wall behind the managers grimy desk he pushed the boy over to it its a time lock the boy lied badly do you think im dumb sonny lamar asked this was the dicey part he really only had but a minute to break the boy down its funny the reservoirs of courage and sheer cussed orneriness you find in the most common people maybe the boy would be a surprise hero giving up his life to save denny a few grand it bothered lamar that he was so young an older man would roll over in a second having the wisdom of witnessed pain in his time and knowing nothing was worth a squalid death in the back of a cheap restaurant lamar walked around behind the boy and suddenly smashed him with the shotgun driving him to the earth the shudder of the blow resounded satisfyingly through the weapon the boy leaking blood lay on the floor dazed when his senses returned his eyes bulged with animal fear lamar bent and with one quick movement he trapped the boys little finger in the fulcrum of his fist he broke the little finger the boy yowled in pain he began to weep he blubbered and was attempting to request mercy when lamar stilled him by thrusting the shotgun muzzle into his larynx i aint got no time you open the safe or ill break all your fingers you wont never play the piano again then ill gutshoot you to die slowly you think i wont you want to try me i will as sure as rain he stood back the boy regained some composure and crawled to his feet snot ran down his swollen face he applied himself to the combination lock and had it opened in a second you shouldnt have lied to me lamar said like a stern father he fired once into the boys chest blowing him out of the way he wasnt sure why hed done it it just was there for the doing and without a conscious decision having been reached he did it from the floor the boy gurgled and mewled and began to address a speech to someone named andy but lamar paid no heed he stepped over the fallen boy and leaned inside the safe pay dirt fourth of july a little stab of elation jerked through him swiftly enough he pulled the locked cash bags off the shelf knowing they could be easily enough cut open later and dumped them into a laundry bag he had purchased that very morning he took a last look around noted nothing and stepped out into the restaurant proper it was as if hed never left it was like a still photo called the robbery ruta beth and odell held the public and dispirited staff at bay a couple of the waitresses were weeping one almost hysterically the square johns just looked up in horror afraid to disobey afraid to do anything afraid to exist no heroes in this crowd no sirree it was going swell plus hed got to whack a smokey okay boys and girls time to the sound of a siren rose and then another it froze them lamar turned ruta beth turned even odell turned watching them richard turned too oh no he felt the panic flap through him and though he struggled to control it he could not his mind was full of spiders and firecrackers a squad car its flashbar pumping electric light into the bright air and its siren howling like a wounded animal sped toward them followed by another and another he knew he had to get out of there the police would kill him he jumped to his feet blindly and then confronted his next most devastating horror a woman had risen from the table across the aisle with a small automatic pistol in her hand she was aiming at lamar richards hand flew to his gun but he couldnt get it out he screamed as loud as he could the woman fired the bullet missed she fired again and missed again as ruta beth fired her doubleought buck delivered from a range of about twelve feet drove into the woman punching her backward into another booth containing old people who like atoms liberated in a chain reaction began to race toward the exit plates and glasses spilled to the floor and coffee spewed across the tables lamar screamed the cops are coming they going to shoot yall dead he raised his shotgun and fired two fast blasts into the ceiling it was too much the noise the death the seething gun smoke someone threw a chair through one of the big windows and then through another one and the square johns like rats on a ship began to pour out into the parking lot leaping the threefoot drop to the earth just as the first two cars pulled up a cop emerged from each shotgun ready but could find no targets in the human tide that gushed from the restaurant quickly lamar threw his shotgun away and handed the money bag to odell taking the arill cover you git yourself out he grabbed odell and gave him a kiss on the mouth then turned to ruta beth you saved my bacon hon you did just fine lamar you have to dont you worry about me none now git take old richard too he quickly went to the doorway and fired three swift shots at the only cop he could see the gun had a liquid jerk to it as it fired but it came back on target quickly the officer sat down sadly then lamar swept over to the other target and fired twice at it smearing the windshield with a quicksilver of fractures wichud yelled odell picking richard off the floor the bigger man halfcarried him through the broken window there was glass everywhere the sounds of gunfire a general sense of panic loose upon the face of the planet and richards own immense fear he looked back and saw lamar like some crazily heroic mythic sergeant from some war movie firing away blazing like rambo at the police then he was in the car odell punched it and the car backed savagely hitting something and knocking it down with a terrific clatter then roared ahead seemed almost to tip as it lurched on two wheels into the street and then in a burst of sheer acceleration really whooshed down the road but just as quickly it slowed to almost a halt took a severe turn and began ambling along at a content pace richard sat up they were in some quiet suburb an undisturbed fifties world of small frame houses overhanging trees and greenfiltered sunlight behind them the turbulent sounds of sirens rose and rose and rose mar keened odell mar thats okay honey said ruta beth whod taken the mask off to shake out her long hair daddy can take care of himself lamar dropped the mag out and slammed a new one in he pulled back the bolt a weird kind of plunger deal atop the weapon and let it fly forward he looked over the sights and could see nobody two cop cars were parked aslant at each entrance to the parking lot and he knew hed hit one of the cops and the other had shown no signs of fight having retreated behind his car where he was betyourass on the horn calling in reinforcements lamar licked his lips which were dry as sand well goddamn boy he told himself you done got yourself in some damned pickle he took off his ski mask and threw it away if he was going out he was going out as lamar pye bad man and legend the white boy with the biggest dick in the whole mac he shucked the raincoat a great relief as the goddamned thing was hot he fired five quick shots at the gas tank of one of the cop cars hoping hed get an explosion but it never happened instead a couple of poorly aimed shots came his way he fired quickly emptying the magazine to drive them down then slid back from the door and crawled low over glass until he reached the kitchen a black teenager cowered against the sinks crying dont hurt me none sir the boy sobbed shut up you aint been hurt im the one theys tryin to hurt he almost shot the boy but what would that prove it might do him some good back in the joint if he let a nigger live where hed killed a passel of whites he rose and ran to the rear delivery entrance and opened it two cops fired shotguns at him but he ducked inside in the second before the buckshot arrived to spall the door you got to bring the fight to them he told himself cops aint used to that they used to men folding up but here i got to go at them and go at them hard or they going to get my white boys ass for good and only he went to the back wall where high up there was a window he could never get through it but he could get a good clean shot at one of the officers but as he was about to fire he noticed what he had climbed up on it was the sink and next to it was the garbage chute he kicked the flap that covered the chute and discovered a ramp about eighteen inches wide leading at a sharp angle into darkness though he thought he saw a glimmer of light fuck this he thought they got me covered if i stay here he dumped the ar and wedged himself into the chute a sickening stench rose to his nose the stench of decayed food grease decomposition he thought for a second he wasnt going to make it that his ass would hang him up and the cops would come find him half in half out but he slid down with astonishing speed was launched airborne into lightness had a strange sensation of liberation and then found himself amid fetid food and packaging in a dumpster he rolled out of it wishing he had the ar but he still had two s he looked about quickly finding himself in a well in the rear right side of the restaurant lamar stepped upward and found himself slightly flanking the two cops who had the back cover he saw the texas highway patrol car parked out back too now he got it the first patrolman had come in and parked at the rear entered through the rear and gone in to wash his hands thats how come richard hadnt seen him he shook his head from out front came the crackle of shots and the sounds of sirens as yet more reinforcements arrived time to kick ass he thought and ran toward the police car it was simple murder the best kind the guys never knew he was on their left he just ran at them a gun in each hand and when they looked up it was too late to do anything it seemed to happen in slow motion it had an incredible clarity to it like a football replay on the tv he watched as the one half rose to bring his shotgun to bear but the man seemed to be climbing through molasses or motor oil his eyes big as eggs his fingers scrambling at his gun like some kind of honkytonk piano player as he tried to find the trigger lamars first shot hit him in the throat the adams apple seemed to explode as if rigged by demolitions experts and the blood spurted from it in a dark red spray the other took more killing as he spun away into the fetal position lamar shot him twice only to discover he had a vest on so he leaned in close and shot him in the head he watched the hair flywhy was this familiarand the dust or mist rise as the body went into that complete stillness that was sheer animal death he stood over them and emptied his magazines into them feeling for just a moment the most powerful king on the face of the earth lookame loo kame he thought exultantly he threw both handguns and one of the police shotguns into the back of the cruiser slid in found the key and started the car another cop car came around the corner and lamar gunned straight at it until it swerved he banged it hard shattering glass then he backed and turned to face the fence that kept him in it was a cyclone lamar knew it to be weakest dead center between poles and so thats where he aimed the car punching it the big crown victoria smashed the fence slowed then blasted through vegetation something lashed and shattered the windshield but in a second burst of energy the car bashed through seemed to drop a bit then landed in a backyard lamar pushed the accelerator down smashed over a patiodriving lawn chairs this way and that and sending a picnic table full of hamburgers and deviled eggs flipping crazily through the aircrunched a hedge and peeled across the front lawn until he hit the street took a hard right and really leaned into it behind him he heard the sound of sirens chapter bud got there by ten pm and the crime scene was still a damn county fair hed listened all the way in on the radio the identification had come quickly enough through elemental police work the serial number of the recovered ar was checked against the national criminal information center computer files which promptly revealed it to have been teds taken at the stepford farm within minutes a faxed bulletin from oklahoma authorities with lamars mug on it was shown to the busboy whod gotten a good look at lamar he idd him immediately so by six p the apb for lamar odell and richard and an unknown fourth gang member had been issued but so far thered been no arrests although the brass had ordered a full rollout of all north texas and southern oklahoma law enforcement units including airground search teams with infrared capacity canine units and horseback rangers moving across the range and farmland south of wichita falls the rangers set up roadblocks on all the major roads and at the three bridges over the red river fifteen miles north of the city and established patrols up and down the riverbanks bud parked down maurine street a bit and made his way back to the scene gawkers of course were out in the hundreds the roadway was jammed with pickups lots of teenagers and young roughnecks it had a camylike feel to it which bud had noticed before at big accidents on and which always made him a little angry someone was hooting goddamn of lamar pye got clean away to the beeps of horns bud spat in disgust but it didnt surprise him that to some lamar might be a hero for his wild ways and unwillingness to take any crap from anybody thats what was poisoning america he thought he approached the barrier of yellow crimescene tape that had been run from pylon to pylon around the perimeter of the dennys a batch of tv camera crews were off to one side sending their feeds back to the big cities at least half the official vehicles in texas filled the parking lot and inside the shattered restaurant evidence technicians probed and collected and representatives from the regions police agencies stood around talking issuing bulletins putting out information on the radio net and whathaveyou hold on there sir said a texas highway patrolman as bud ducked under the tape you cant cross that line bud flashed his id folio oh sorry sarge you oklahoma boys are all over this one these are our boys said bud killed one of our troopers a few weeks back we want em bad i know that i was at that young mans funeral and it was a sad one well if we catch em in texas well be glad to send yall the bodies they dropped four officers and two citizens that lamar hes a goddamned piece of work that he is trooper whos in charge our colonel benteen running the show like he usually does some rangers trying to horn in as usual we got the same problem with our damned osbi boys well i think you got your osbi down here some place and your own colonel the polish one supenski yep and that it c d henderson of the osbi thats the one that boys a drinker you can smell it on him anyway youll find em inside good luck thank you trooper bud walked on passing between vehicles and knots of men sipping coffee and talking in low intense voices and at last entered the restaurant it looked like the last building left standing in a battleground its windows all shattered its walls pocked with bullet holes shards of glass and window frame everywhere tables tossed this way and that and of course the chalk outlines of bodies long removed bud saw two one against a far wall between the mens and the womens rooms and another deeper in the restaurant itself great pools of gummy blood marked each spot each death spot had the quality of magic to it somehow no officer or technician would come within ten feet theres a third in the managers office that lamar he blew away a twentythreeyearold trainee manager after breaking one of his fingers to get him to open the safe bud what the hell are you doing here it was colonel supenski well i couldnt stay away no i suppose you couldnt goddamn this lamar hes a fulltoot son of a bitch he must be crazy he aint crazy lt c d henderson said he just likes the buzz it gives him when he pops a feller its like sniffin human glue lo sergeant pewtie he fixed bud with a squinty look from behind his specs how could he be so old and still be a lieutenant bud wondered then he sniffed the familiar vapor of bourbon cut by the breath mints that didnt quite hide it and he knew lieutenant he nodded goddamn said it henderson hes a smart one the texas boys found the car lamars gang made its getaway in five miles down the road he didnt just steal one car he stole two damn his soul so eyewitness ids and tag numbers of the getaway car aint worth piss and there wont be any prints on it you watch who was the woman he shot well the witnesses say this other feller shot her we dont know who this guy is whoever he blew away this citizen a mrs rhonda mccoy of wichita falls mrs mccoy was a probation officer for the state of texas and had a concealedcarry permit she tried to do her duty she was so overmatched it wasnt even funny died in front of her parents and her husband and her two kids jesus bud looked at the carnage he got out through a goddamned garbage chute scum in scum out dont that just fit the bill go on bud take a look around back bud walked through the restaurant and cut into the kitchen a number of men stood around the chute there on the counter tagged and bagged in a big cellophane evidence bag but unmoved was teds ar he went over and looked at it it was a black and glistening thing plastic and parkerized metal had a modern look to it like some sort of a gun from space he got it from a goddamned state trooper in oklahoma one of the texas cops said killed him for it i know i was there said bud youre pewtie yes i am you must be made out of steel to come out of something like that they say youre the toughest cop in oklahoma right now i dont feel so tough bud said if ida been minding my business he thought maybe this didnt have to happen he walked on back through the kitchen to an open door in the rear he saw two bodies on the parking lot evidently the last to be removed and another fleet of cops standing around some taking notes beyond the cyclone fence was mashed down and a path of sheer destruction indicated lamars escape route hey pewtie we had twenty cops here and we was overmatched you shouldnt feel so bad catch that boy in my sights the next time and ill pull down and lie to the shooting board about it bud said we all feel that way said the texas cop except we dont got shooting boards in texas bud walked back through the rubble of the restaurant trying not to step on anything you dont have to go so dainty there sarge an evidence technician in white plastic gloves said were pretty much done bagging i feel like im in a goddamned war zone bud said were you in nam no no i wasnt well it reminds me of a place called hue after tet bad shit ill tell you said the tech they got coffee over there you want some thanks said bud and turned wondering what the hell am i doing here why did i come whats it prove he shook his head isolated amid the clutter sure he was stupidly in the way and then he saw the lion bud stood stock still looking about to make sure nobody had noticed it and wondered whether or not to call out to call out what hey come look at this it was on the floor covered in glass splinters more or less shoved aside amid other papers by the evidence techs as they pawed through the rubble looking for clues it was so odd how it had just hooked on the tiniest corner of his vision as he scoped the room wondering what the hell to do he went onto one knee and very gently pushed two crumpled place mats aside as well as a dozen assorted pieces of glass to reveal more of a third and what upon it had caught his eye yes another lion drawn absently presumably by richard as he waited for the raid richard must have been used as recon and then tail gunner though all agreed it was the new gang member whod done the shooting hey techie he called the technician came back you got something there sarge you got prints already yep we got em and fed em into the fbi fingerprint lab amazing how fast that goddamn computer works you get a make we already made both pyes and the peed guy no sweat as for the fourth member we grilled witnesses but nobody can remember him touching anything we got the shell he ejectedmaybe a latent will turn up on that okay i got a feeling this belongs to richard peed hes the artist the man looked at it closely i dont see no oil spots pal i doubt seriously think we could get a print off that getting prints off paper is tough you need some kind of hard glossy surface glass linoleum formica thats what i thought you want to bag this sucker yeah i ought to but could i get an impression of it a xerox or something theres a xerox machine in the managers office so you wont scream if i go xerox it and then bring it back dont mean a thing to me oklahoma what you want it for i got a thing about lions bud picked up the place mat which was emblazoned with the dennys crest and some connectthedots games and riddles whats black and white and red all overa newspaper for kids and walked into the managers office a flung spray of dried brown blood against the wall savage and shapeless almost a map of the explosion of the charge through flesh signified the spot where lamar had killed the young manager and the tape outline on the floor marked his fall in the other corner undisturbed was a copying machine and routinely bud pumped out a facsimile of the place mat which he folded and put in his pocket then he walked back to the tech who trapped the thing in an evidence bag and zip locked it shut pausing only to fill out a slip say bud it was c d henderson yeah lieutenant bud you want a drink i got a pint be happy to give you a shot helps clarify the mind they say no thank you lieutenant itd put me out cold anyway they tell me youre a pretty smart boy always top of your class outstanding arrest records a rep for writing good reports im just a highway jockey lieutenant you boys are the detectives you dont have something going sorry i dont youre not working some angle on lamar no one else has cottoned to the odor of the bourbon was overwhelming as i said im not an investigator you boys are the investigators yes sir thats what it says and i know you smokies dont like it a bit but a smart boy like you experienced hand good operator i dont know bud seen you digging through evidence and then running off to make a photocopy looks mite peculiar he finished up squinting at bud through shrewd old country eyes aint doing nothing come to see what this goddamn lamar done thats all there is to it lieutenant cause i know how it would please a stud boy like you to get another crack at lamar i aint going up against lamar no way he got the best of me once and i dont doubt but that he would again hes too much hombre for me if i should get a lead on lamar id call the marines the fbi and state cops from here to maryland and back yeah but would you call the osbi hey this aint a turf thing yeah i hear that ever damn time one of you smokies tries to bump me off my own investigation now we might get some good leads out of all this physical evidence i want to be there when it goes down you hear me yes i do lieutenant loud and clear good man bud you and me were old salts we can get along you git something you call old cd i want in on it tenfour trooper copy that said bud chapter the water was cold he couldnt make it another second he would die he could feel his lips chattering and his body growing numb it was so cold i cant make it ruta beth richard said shut your mouth you damned fool she spat back you lie there like a goddamned man or ill have odell hold your head underwater for a few minutes but its hopeless he isnt coming daddy will come ruta beth said goddammit daddy can take care of himself and he will come isnt that right odell will cwuh said odell also chattering the three of them crouched in a patch of reeds the cold water of the red river running up to their necks they were in a desolate spot about ten miles outside burkbumett between the burkbumett and the vernon bridges over the river a hundred yards of strong black current lay between them and the promised land of oklahoma but the rush of the water was so strong richard knew hed never swim it it would suck him down and drown him there was no mercy at all in the night the wind whistled and rattled through the reeds in the dark he could just see riverbank and mud flat and enemies were everywhere a few hours back a department of texas safety fourby four with two squinteyed rangers had come lurching down the riverbank punching its way over fallen logs skimming into the low tide where necessary its spotlight playing in the brush for signs of the robbers but it had passed by at one point only fifteen feet from them and gone on down the line it would be back then about an hour later there were lights on the oklahoma side as presumably a duplicate of the same mission unfolded over there but the trucks werent the problem the problem was the helicopters they came in fast they came low and their noise seemed to explode from nowhere as they roared along the river about a hundred feet up two three times an hour these hunters really wanted to kill something once richard had caught a glimpse of the observer hanging out of the cabin door a squat man with huge binoculars a cowboy hat some kind of mouth microphone and the meanestlooking fanciest black plastic rifle richard had ever seen it looked like a ray gun he was a boy who meant business he wanted to drop a bad man before the night was over cant we wait on the bank richard now moaned through his chattering teeth wont be another helicopter by for an hour youre the biggest fool i ever met richard said ruta beth didnt daddy tell you bout inferred with that inferred stuff they can see you in the dark by the heat of your body thats what theyre doinghunting you by your heat them boys get a reading on heat from three bodies hiding in the grass goddamn if they wont have a whole company of rangers here in bout a minute how did lamar know so much lamar knew everything but lamar was dead hed have been here by now if he was going to make it richard said we are going to freeze to death and that will be that daddy is too goddamned smart for any johnny cop she was even beginning to talk like him now richard please shut up or odell will have to discipline you yes ruta beth richard said wichud came odells glottal spasm odell i heard no bon ky please but odell didnt want to hurt richard instead he gathered him up and hugged him it was the strangest thing odells arms just drew richard in and his great body seemed to absorb richard there was nothing sexual in it at all for the sex part of odells brain lay happily dormant but it was all tenderness wichud ma key ma key good wichud no cold wichud like ma key warm odells love bloomed like a hothouse flower richard felt the heat radiating from the big body and in the embrace the purity of survival odell what a strange boy what planet do you come from the warmth saved richard it reached out and plucked him from the frozen loneliness of his exile and gave him a life he yearned to lose himself in it he knew now he could get through anything the hours passed six more times the helicopter roared by at last the dawn began to nudge its way across the sky ruta beth yes what do we do if he doesnt show nothing wait some more but theyll catch us ruta beth had no response it was true the car they had arrived in was deposited under a camouflaged tarpaulin in some trees but a mile or so away at the end of a farm road near an abandoned farmhouse in daylight its shabby fraudulence would be uncovered swiftly enough spotted by the chopper it would draw hundreds of cops within minutes theyd fan out with bloodhounds find the trail follow the little party to the rivers edge and find it cowering there across the river ruta berns toyota had been artfully hidden it too would be discovered in daylight the only real chance was to get across the river in darkness pull away in the toyota which as yet had no criminal charges against it and head by back roads to ruta berns farm in the slow progress of light richard at last saw ruta beths stony face she was a true believer in the cult of lamar but even now he could see that her hope was vanishing hell be here she said know he will waiting for lamar it was like some existential play written by a perverted frenchman high on keef and boylove but instead of snappy patter and ironic reflections on fate the three principals merely huddled in the water wrinkled as prunes waiting for the sun to rise and betray them at least thought richard it would be over soon a fish bit him he started at the impulse of pain fighting through his numbness but the fish bit him again not bit himgoosed him almost comically squeezing his balls playfully odell but odells passive face indicated no measurable mental activity what thegoddamn said richard he has come lamar broke the water like a seal shivered in great animal fury and snorted merrily hah shoulda seen you jump boy at that moment richard loved him lamar lamar shouted ruta beth mar mar marrrrrr aped odell now folks hold it down it aint party time yet i got to git you out of here where you been daddy in some damn johns garage i managed to git me out by cop car dumped that cut cross town and ended up hunkered down in this garage waiting for the lights to go down sos i could jumpstart the car and come acalling on yall you got the money you bet we do lamar said ruta beth come give me a hug and a kiss honey believe i will said lamar and as odell watched happily the two swarmed toward each other in the grayness for a big sloppy kiss only richard thought to wonder how many did he kill to get out but disengaging himself from ruta beth lamar announced now its time to move wheres that goddamned canvas sack honey up on the bank daddy you want me to git it i do he turned to richard you look cold as a corpse boy you chattering iits so cold lamar richard said hell in three hours ruta bethll have you eating biscuits by the fire ruta beth pulled the big canvas sack close to lamar great babe he said and reached in to pull out a coil of thin waxy rope richard could just barely make it out in the gray light you swim richard yes said richard good now i want you to swim across and slipknot this to a tree good and strong so that these folks can pull themselves across ii gulped richard he looked the torrent of the red was strong swollen with rain it thundered along and in the gray light was beginning to show the source of its name it looked like a river of blood rushing out of a sucking chest wound pausing only here and there to generate eddies of bubbles where the current curled on itself and lashed downward now and then a stick or piece of vegetation would come shooting along it was the river of death thats all out there richard would surrender his limbs pummeled by the long nights cold he would be sucked down then shipped downstream a bloated leaky corpse haw barked lamar had you there son ill swim the goddamned river you help me git the rope set around a branch here so it dont get away then you go across hand by hand you got that ruta bern you follow odell yes daddy wop said odell with that lamar and odell unleashed the rope and got it secured around the stout trunk of a green willow that grew crookedly out of the bank lamar tied some strange super knot that only a bosuns mate or an eagle scout would know okay odell you hang on to these bad boys and he pulled two handguns from under the water odell took them eagerly wish me luck said lamar wish to hell i hadnt askipped all them swimming lessons back at the country club he threw himself into the water like a child at the beach and in several long strokes was gone it was almost five minutes before they saw him scuttle out at the other end slither up the bank and secure the other end of the rope to another limb he gave the signal okay boys said ruta beth daddys calling odell can you go first go said odell odell began to pull himself across the river hand over hand along the rope that ran just under the waters now pinkish surface with his great strength he went quickly even though he carried the money sack now you richard no ruta beth you go suit yourself but dont mess around richard the law gonna come soon and we cant wait and if they git you no matter how much you fear lamar you will betray him we both know that she fixed him with a burning glare her small country face so severe in the gray light had the aspect of a botticelli nudes so reduced was it to planes and angles it was as if she were putting the evil eye on him some furious hex thing so that he could not escape his fate then off she went and being light and farmstrong pulled herself along without apparent effort until he lost her in the rush of the water now it was richards turn tentatively he pulled himself out the current was so much stronger than he anticipated when the river deepened so that he could no longer stand it scared him he almost froze on the spot but then he got his nerve back up and launched himself farther with each pull on the rope his anxiety increased the rope was deeper his face was farther in the water it was so cold the current was so strong at one point the rope seemed to sink a good two feet beneath the surface and it was all he could do to keep his head above the water sucking in half a lungful of air now and then from his vantage point he could see nothing no land no sky only the glinting surface of the water as if the universe had become nothing but water the idea of it terrorized him yet he pulled on then he opened his mouth too early and caught a swallow that rocketed down him the cough racked up through him seizing his body but still he clung to the rope just a little farther he thought he managed to get two more pulls on the rope in before surfacing for air must be nearly there he thought but he made the mistake of turning to look at the far shore which he assumed must be but a few feet away he could barely see it he wasnt even halfway the depression of it hit him like a sledgehammer give it up he said give it up but he fought on blindly it was a long groping night walk the world resolved itself into the roar of the water and the exhaustion in his arms he ached to surrender at one point he did and ordered his hands to release him but they would not he found it in himself to go another few pulls and then another a good sweet lungful of air got him over his worst despair onward he pulled it was going to take forever but at the next sighting he was astounded at how close the shore was and with a mighty pull he got himself into the shallow waters he saw them in the brush a few feet back from the rivers edge his feet touched he let go of the damned rope he stood to raise himself and wave and then the current had him richard said lamar almost conversationally richard was so close he was coming out of the water then he just seemed to sit down and the water scooted him along his face had a silly halfsmile as if he couldnt believe what was happening as if this were some damned joke richard said lamar irritated git your ass out of but he was gone the water had him and as lamar watched the silly look melted into one of sheer terror and weakness richard panicked began to flap lost control and was out of sight in seconds wichud said odell that boys gone said ruta bern water took him lamar just watched he felt something like disappointment then he was angry goddamned stupid richard come all this way andshit he said lamar its over let it be said ruta beth let it be richard sank the world turned dark and liquid there was no light down here weakly he kicked and waved against his fate but there was no mercy at all anywhere he fought for air but the water beat its way into his lungs he gobbled for air but there was only water he closed his eyes in the gray light he thought of his mother mother he wanted to cry his mother was a beautiful woman she drove his father away with all her friends they were a rich aristocratic crowd from tulsa thirdgeneration oil money long removed from the smell and sweat of the fields and his father preferred the old boy network of kickass riggers and upfrom penury scalawags like himself whod made their fortunes on guts and nerve all these puffy people all of his mothers friends with their eastern pretensions they finally drove the poor man away though richard didnt think thered ever been a divorce richards mother told him he could be an artist she took him to art lessons so early and surrounded him with artistic people he went to europe when he was six nine eleven and fourteen it wasnt her fault he turned out so disappointingly she had done everything she could somehow things were always set against richard she would arrange for introductions to various prominent men in the east when they traveled there but the men were always disappointed in him he had a gift but not a great one that was clear and he was so much less interesting than mother he was a wretched conversationalist he didnt have her buoyant charm her vividness her confidence and she told him that not in subtle ways but baldly and to his face richard you could do so much better if you werent so meek you will not inherit the earth that way i promise you you have to learn to project people dont find your selfdoubts attractive at all reach out open up but the more she pushed him the more he sealed up it was as if he was blossoming inward becoming more retarded and pitiful and selfconscious and crippled with terror he was afraid of everything on the day it happened he returned home and found her with a friend eventually the friend left and she came downstairs and mixed herself a drink still beautiful at sixtyone and asked him how the newspaperman had liked the exhibition uh said richard aching with dread mother he didnt show he what he didnt show mother i dont know what happened maybe he got lost richard i have over four thousand dollars invested in that exhibition what do you mean he didnt show he stood there thirty years old quavering like a child he hated her almost as much as he hated himself call him she said i did he wasnt there call him again mother call him richard call him now you silly little fool you cannot let people simply walk on you its why you always end up with nothing and why i always have to bail you out i pay for everything richard you get everything for free he made the call the man was there uh mr peed sorry i told you id come by if i could but the art critic thing is only part of my job i also have to read all the sunday feature copy and we got a little behind and i just couldnt make it its not the new york times you know its just the daily oklahoman he hung up call him again his mother said he was never sure not then not in the immediate aftermath not in the months of meditation why it happened the way it did when it happened why that day that minute it could have been any other day any other minute it was the maid who called the police he tried to make them see he wasnt trying to blind her he was really trying to kill her but the knife was shortit was a butter knife quite bluntand somehow she had proven so much stronger than he thought shed gotten down beneath him so he couldnt reach her heart after the first pitiful blow shed sort of curled up so he had to un peel her but she was very strong the only place he could stab her was the face the eyes well the eyes are on the face arent they it wasnt his fault richard suddenly broke the surface of the water he was way out in the river the trees were hurtling by it was much lighter a flood of sweet oxygen poured into his lungs he smiled but the water sucked him down again richard yielded to death it embraced him and he embraced it he felt its strong arms pull him in smother him there was no pain at all only a persistent tugging that broke through the numbness in his body he had a last dream of lamar of all things pitiful crude powerful violent lamar odd that he should think of lamar here at the end lamar had him up on the surface richard choked on air calm down goddammit richard screamed lamar dont fight me he was upside down in somebodys strong arms the sky was bright and blue the clouds rushed by a helicopter should have come but it didnt nothing came the roaring had ceased he felt as if he were in one of the swimming pools of his boyhood and wanted to spit a gurgle of water to see if he could make mother laugh he felt the ground and in his exhaustion looked up to see that odell had him and was pulling him ashore lamar came out of the rushing red water a second later beautiful in the gray dawn soaked and muscular his hair wet his denim clothes plastered to him his face grave with effort and pain he smiled at richard you are a peck of trouble richard i swear cmon boys said ruta beth lets git before goddamned johnny cop shows chapter no one knew how to run a crime scene anymore the old man lamented it was stunning they got any evidence at all these days these sloppy damn kids rough and eager as untrained young dogs no one had even erected a windbreak cant you do a little something about the breeze son he gently corrected a young osbi agent began to look around for something out of which to construct a barrier to prevent more wind erosion but he was so clumsy in his efforts cd worried that hed do more harm than good the old man hawked a gob of phlegm out of his dry old throat and squatted in the dust the wind whipped through the scrub oaks and two hundred yards away the angry red torrent of the river surged along toward arkansas it was high this time of year full of the melted snows of the winter and treacherous other times of the year itd dry to a trickle had lamar calculated on that too was he that smart it could be nothing said a young ranger captain named tippahoe offered up by the great state of texas as his opposite number it could be our goddamn break you said it henderson i musta run a thousand tire tracks and i aint come up with diddly less its to tie a specific vehicle to a specific location dont know what good the goddamned track is without the vehicle well son maybe youre right and maybe you aint believe ill just play the hand out as its the only one the good lord deemed fit to deal me he turned from the obstreperous texas ranger to a foolishlooking young oklahoma highway patrolman lurking nearby with a walkietalkie you got any word yet on those evidence technicians sir theys coming tied up in traffic outside of oklahoma city they cant chopper em in sir all the choppers tied up in trauma delivery okay tell you what you tell them lieutenant henderson says to call colonel mcclutcheon the operations officer of the four hundred and first aviation battalion at fort sill see if he can free up a huey and get those boys in here before the glaciers arrive from canada colonel robert m mcclutcheon he owes me a thing or two yes sir ill tell em but thats all son the small party was standing under a gloomy sky in the wasteland of scrub and low vegetation that was part of the red river basin on the oklahoma side a half mile or so away on the texas side a texas policeman had located a stolen volvo in a ditch this discovery had led to another a stolen camaro once white now painted orange and covered in a camouflaged tarpaulin they were currently being dusted for prints by ranger technicians but cd knew what the prints would show these were the various getaway vehicles stolen by lamar pye and his crew members there might be a print of the fourth member of the gang but cd doubted it lamar was too smart but those discoveries in turn had yielded this tiny little scrap of hope on the oklahoma riverbank here in the dirt a very very good track off still another vehicle cd appreciated the orderly way lamars mind had worked how cleverly hed planned it out stashing the legal vehicle at the end of the train of stolen ones so that as they made their final fallback to their hideout theyd do so in a car that couldnt of itself attract attention and whose plates would run legal if checked such a smart boy cd turned and made as if to mosey off just a bit in search of new evidence but of course he slipped the brown paper bag from his left inside pocket unscrewed the lid and took a fast swig i w harper seven years old like the smoke off a prairie fire he went to wooziness then came back out feeling calmer and more in charge he screwed the lid back on lightly and slipped the pint into his pocket he turned back and had that odd feeling that everyone had been staring at him but had just that second looked away so as not to embarrass him everyone that is except for young captain tippahoe whose face was knitted up with contempt and impatience and where were you tippahoe when i shot it out with luke sweetwater and indian joe brown in where were you when i took six inches of blade in the stomach from crazy sally pogue and only saved my life with a fired as she was getting up to my throat what about the time i faced down two hundred citizens of gem city and saved the lives of two innocent nigger brothers that i knew hadnt raped mrs mclintock in where were you tippahoe but tippahoe didnt know and wouldnt care he just stepped back took off his hat and ran his hand through expensively trimmed hair and acted vaguely superior cd looked down at the little trace of ridges and grooves in the dust it seemed to lose a bit of its distinction even as he watched as a gust of wind took another quarter inch off the top where are them damn boys he wondered he wouldnt let the rangers do it he only trusted his own osbi team he wanted another drink i hope it lasts said tippahoe and i hope it aint a goddamned wild goose chase we sure dont do things like this in texas what you gonna do lieutenant track down all the cars in oklahoma oh i may have a card or two up my old sleeve said cd and hawked another gob of phlegm into the wind he looked back at the track in the dust which seemed to lose another millimeter of distinction was it the second piece of evidence he wondered the agent sent to build the windbreak was now struggling with sticks and a blanket it looked hopeless come on boys he thought come on lieutenant yes son theyre telling me the armys going to detail a chopper to pick your team up in oklahoma city well praise the lord and pass the bourbon son bud was changing the oil on his truck when jen came out and told him the colonel was on the phone it was tuesday afternoon about two hed gotten back from wichita falls the night before last not even bothering to call holly then he had slept late had had bad nightmares awakening in a foul mood no good to man or beast wife son or girlfriend he had laid low the whole day grouchy and forlorn like an old cougar in its cave now he was trying to make himself something human again he wiped valvoline off his hands and went in the house sir bud i figure if youre well enough to go bouncing out to wichita falls on your lonesome you might be well enough to do some real work am i right yes you are no uniform necessary bud you can go in plainclothes id carry though i always carry colonel you use your truck write the mileage well reimburse got it the colonel then explained what had happened around ten yesterday morning two rangers had discovered the abandoned camaro and the volvo that lamar had stolen on the texas side of the red river a print team lifted some good latents which were quickly made as lamar odell and richards also discovered was a hundred yards of green no riggers rope which could have been bought in any hardware store between dallasft worth and oklahoma city it had been stretched across the river the team had evidently used it to get across dont that beat all bud that lamar hes a goddamned genius we got the bridges covered and helicopters with infrared and he still beats us bud hes smarter than that even the shell that was ejected from the shotgun that killed that lady probation officer there was a print on it lamars he loaded his buddys gun because he knew we already had his prints hes a goddamned smart boy all right said bud wondering where he fit into the operation well maybe lamar done slipped up just a bit said the colonel on our side of the river we found tracks of the car they had stashed to take them out of there old c d henderson threw a goddamned redass tantrum and got them to make a cast we faxed the tread to the fbi and we got a make just like that its the pattern for a goodyear b a lowend non reinforced radial made entirely for japanese cars with sixtyinch wheelbases and sixinch tire wells goddamn if that old drunken coot didnt hit a jackpot only three varieties of car can wear ityour hyundai excel your toyota tercel and your nissan sentra from the years on moreover two of the companies changed their design last year so it can only be three model years of the hyundais and the toyotas and four model years of the sentras the last getaway jobs got to be one of those you follow got you said bud we shook out about fortytwo hundred cars registered in south oklahoma that can wear that set of tires bud about two hundred of them are registered to people with felony convictions were fixin to raid on them just to be sure because cd is dang sure theyll run to kind i could no bud your raid days are over were going doorto door on the other four thousand its going to take a heap of man hours bud it aint the glory route thats for sure i got five other exdetectives and retired patrolmen working the job you get the address you find the car you lookiesee the tires and if you get the right set of tires on the right car you call in the license number and we see what we shake out maybe we stake out maybe we raid depending bud you can imagine theres a lot of goddamned public pressure on this one thats why were working so damned hard yes sir the colonel told him the joint states task force was headquartered at the old city hall annex near the police station in downtown lawton where hed show up to get his list and bud said hed leave right away the colonel said he appreciated it but he knew he could count on bud oh and bud yes sir that other matter bud didnt say a thing bud you still there yes sir that other matter thats in hand aint it bud aint going to be no big scandal a heroic patrol officer caught in a love nest with his partners widow nothing like that no sir bud said good knowed i could count on you bud bud went back outside he tossed the empty oil bottles and the used filter into the trash can and poured the used oil into a couple of zerex containers then he picked up the two craftsman wrenches hed used and tossed them onto the clutter of his workbench he felt a flash of shame he could find time to sneak away and fuck holly a couple of times a week but he couldnt take time to clean up after himself at home he went back inside and showered and changed into a good pair of levi his best tony lamas and a white shirt he went down to the gun safe took out the colt commander and pinched the slide back to make sure it was loaded then snapped on the safety and slipped it into an insidethepants holster which he then inserted into the waist of the jeans and hooked on his belt he had two extra magazines in a belt mount next to the colt last he put the beretta with the thirteenshot doublestack clip inside his shirt behind his belt buckle it would hurt like hell after a while but let it better to have too many guns than not enough bud yeah you come here a second now now what the hell did she want jen i dont have time i have to you come here that was jens nononsense voice shit she sounded loaded for big game was he going to have one of those bitter explosions where her sense of isolation from him and his lack of passion for her lashed out at him it seemed to happen all the time jen this is no goddamn time he started to bellow as he walked into the kitchen but what stopped him short was finding her and jeff looking like theyd just swallowed a whole flock of canaries bud what have they got you doing asked jen they got me knocking on doors as part of some combined state task force thats all it wont be nothing that i guarantee you now whats going on he said remember dad i was asking you about the millimeters yes i do bud remembered his lies to jeff in the car on sunday well sir said jen maybe thisll help with lamar just in case i called my mother and asked for a loan jen six hundred dollars against my share of the farm profits this year and so jeff and i went down to southwest pawn and gun this morning this heres to get you out of that low mood and so you dont have to use those speed loaders anymore she held out a blue plastic box and bud knew in a second his wife and son had just given him a big beretta mm automatic a sense of shame hit him he swallowed felt himself blushing jen thats so nice dad i got you this its a shoulder holster for the beretta said jeff holding out a plastic package with the name bianchi on it now you go anywhere you go in style jeez said bud i sure as hell dont know what i did to deserve yall eagerly they helped bud mount up with a box of grain silvertips that miss edna at southwest had thrown in to aid the cause of law and order bud soon had the new beretta stoked with seventeen rounds and had another magazine of sixteen on the counter it was a black brute of a pistol a kind of inflated version of the inside his shirt it fit his hand like a handshake from a brother and when he brought it up to a weaver grip he found its sight picture clear and vivid next issue was getting into the x design of the rig not the easiest thing but eventually with everyone helping they got it done the spare magazine went in a pouch that hung under the other arm as a kind of counterbalance to the heavy automatic when he slipped on his sports coat it would be hard to see he had become a threegun man but the thing felt like a brassiere or how he imagined a brassiere would feel the gun hung underneath tight in its holster but loose enough to slap him if he turned quickly a quick grab presented it neatly enough but it was a move hed have to work on until it was smooth as silk goddamn he figured counting it up no wonder im walking slow these days got fiftyeight rounds of ammo stowed on me that ought to be enough for anybody bud went back to the safe and took out an old carbine hed hunted deer with as a young man it always helped to have a long gun along you never could tell with a box of twenty soft points he walked to the truck and put the long gun in its case behind the seat jen brought out his sports coat a light tan cotton thing and his hat a white stetson he pulled on his raybans you look like a texas ranger she said youd best hope not theyre the meanest boys that ever walked the planet oh wait forgot something but she had it his briefcase full of richards lions your damn lions while im looking for this tire ill do some thinking about the lions maybe i can figure what hes got going there was an awkward moment and then he embraced jen thank you he said it was damned sweet of you but she pushed him away brusquely as if the gift was what any woman would give her husband you run a hundred rounds or so through that bud you know they jam more in the first fifty rounds than they do in all the others i will hon that gun aint supposed to jam ever jeff said i read all about it in guns ammo he gave her another hug go on get out of here earn us some money so we can feed these damn boys she said turning bud drove away into lawton but not yet toward downtown instead veering east into the first strip mall that boasted a pay phone quickly he dialed hollys number the phone rang and rang and rang where was she probably met someone good for her he was about to hang up when at least fifteen or so rings into it the phone came off the hook and he heard her tired voice hello are you all right were you sleeping i was worried no answer only her heavy breaming then finally she said you were going to call two nights ago i was up all night waiting holly i went to wichita falls the robbery you hear she had not he told her so you couldnt call in all that you couldnt call just once holly im sorry there was no time down there and by the time i got back it was really late i justi didnt think and you didnt call yesterday he was contrite no i had a bad night im sorry i didnt do nothing yesterday bud look what youre doing to me holly this business has come up again they want me to do some work for them he explained briefly what would happen how he was going back on duty searching for cars with a certain set of tires over the southern half of the state the beretta was so heavy under his arm bud you make all these promises then you sort of fade you like the sex great but when it comes to making plans then you fade youre not there youre off somewhere im sorry holly is there anything i can do yes dammit i have to move i cant stand this place we have to find some new place will you look for it with me it seemed excruciating to him it would be horrible he hated the newmarrieds aspect of itchecking for shelves and viewsand he felt so indecent but he said of course i will sure i will oh bud she cried i knew you would oh bud i knew you would now sweetie i got to go when will i see you soon i swear well start looking soon oh bud i love you so much feeling relieved bud drove over to the city hall annex an old office building hastily reconfigured to its new purpose on the first floor in a wideopen bank of rooms a few texas rangers hung around there was a phone bank and a slew of operators and a radio receiver just like at the highway patrol shop and a filing cabinet as well as the by now regular complement of computer terminals with civilian clerks and who seemed to be running the show but his old friend lt c d henderson of the osbi who looked spryer than bud had ever seen him for once the whiff of booze didnt cling to him a smile even came across the creased old face howdy there bud they told me you was coming back on as an emergency investigator yes sir i am said bud figure i can pound on doors as well as anyone well theres many a door needs pounding bud weve already got bout six men out there but with close to four thousand names the more the better so wherem i heading well lets see many of em are in lawton where weve sent most of our men and another hotbed is way out in ardmore but lets work you in from the country side you wont get as much done since theres some space between ranches and you may get sick of looking at cattle but its got to be done great said bud he was issued a stack of computer printouts bearing addresses and car registration data for tillman jackson and cotton counties in the southeast sector of the state about two hours ride he was told hed probably end up heading out to greer and harmon and kiowa counties too in the next few days your truck got a twoway no sir it dont okay well issue a motorola portable unit you wont have no problem itll be preset to our net fortyfour point nine you tentwentythree each stop and tentwentyfour afterward just in case we always want to know where youre at i hope you aint lucky again i hope i aint either you got it right you just tell em were doing a criminal investigation involving a motor vehicle and investigating is elimination and we want to check them off the list you find the car then you check the tires if you get the right tires on the right kind of car then you call it in wait for what the computer kicks out and sit by until we decide to raid or stake out thats all if you should bump into anybody nasty you do not want to be in it without backup youre even more on your lonesome now i get that im looking at cars and tires not to make arrests i told you i dont want to cross with old lamar again we got a heavyduty swat teamrangers troopers and an osbi supervisor sitting out at fort sill airfield with army pilots anybody gets in a jam we can have twenty men there in a few minutes sounds good to me tenfour bud bud picked up his radio unit and a map and headed back to the truck it took him a few seconds in the cab to get the electronic gear set up then it crackled to life dispatch this is sixohfive i am tenseven outward bound to tillman county tenfour sixohfive bud took south of town followed its straight shot south to the toll plaza at oklahoma then got off to follow into tillmans vast and empty flatness it took him about two hours to find his first stop dispatch this sixohfive i am tentwentythree at loveland route the del rio farm looking for a red tercel thats license plate oklahoma onefiverninerninerrogermike tenfour sixohfive bud got out at a decaying farmhouse and began what would become his routine for the next two days he knocked on the door showed his badge id introduced himself and went into his song and dance it was amazing how cooperative people could be most americans just love to help the police why sure officer it caint be me or mine theyd say or some variation thereof in loveland a gnarled hispanic grandfather took him out back and showed him the car it hadnt been driven in a year and rested in rotten splendor atop a quartet of cinder blocks and so it went sometimes the cars were chan sometimes beatup sometimes theyd been recently sold and the name of the buyer or the dealership was gladly provided sometimes bud had to wait for a man to come home from the plant or the bar sometimes it was a boy returning from town or chores or the dairy queen but sooner or later the car would turn up hed examine it steal a look at the tires and pass on it twice in the first two days he found the right set of goodyear radials on the right car itself no crime one was down near cookietown in cotton county owned by the towns southern states grain and seed branch manager a florid redhead with blemishy skin and a belly as large as the outdoors it seemed unlikely but maybe the mans son or brother or something had some connection with bud called it in but the computer produced no evidence of previous criminal activities associated with mr fuerman or his wife no other family members in existence according to records then on the cherokee reservation near polk lake in tillman he came across a rundown onestory government tract house half its shingles flapping in the dry wind and as he walked to it he felt a hundred eyes on him cops always have a feeling for such a thing but dont let it go too far or it just plain flat ruins them bud conquered the little whisper of fear and knocked on the door to find a woman with a face that looked as if it had aged in lava for a century or two as if she had worn away all her teeth gnawing on bones finally after he explained in english what he wanted she said for him to go out back he found the thing a beattoshit hyundai excel once yellow now nearly rusted out and only one of the tires was a goodyear b and it was as bald as a rock maybe that one and only that one had been the track the detectives had picked up near the red he felt the eyes on him again and looked up at the house wondering if even now lamar pye werent squinting over a gunsight at him but he quelled the feeling walked back to his truck and called it in half an hour later the response came the car registered to a sonny red bear could not be linked to criminal activities and no trace of criminal records either local or federal could be found for either sonny red bear or any of his family just then the door burst open and bud saw what had scurried so mysteriously behind the doors of the little house it was a mess of kids squalling and seething led to the car by a handsome woman the children crammed in any which way and she got in and drove off bud played a hunch dispatch can you tenfortythree the name red bear for a state of oklahoma daycare license got you sixohfive he waited and then it came back that yes one carla red bear had applied to the state for just such a daycare license though its issuance was pending you got a violation to report there sixohfive bud paused was a time yes hed report any violation the law was rigid and unshaded and it was meant not to be violated whether the issue was speed limit or murder and he was a rigid man or at least he used to be but today he wasnt out here for any business other than lamar pye hed cut the red bears some slack and maybe it would come back to him in some way naw dispatch just curious im tentwentyfour here and out got you sixohfive other than that there was no excitement as bud prowled the byways of the third then the fourth then the fifth county over the next few days in search of the three car models in their appropriate years he threw himself into the hunt so because he knew that it represented an escape from it and so it was finally on the sixth day a tuesday of the following week when he was nearing the end of his list that he reached an address on a rural route near altus in kiowa county he paused at the entrance to the road in and tentwentythreed his location it was a barren part of oklahoma and the raw wind whistled across the rolling prairie he could see the house a mile in clapboard old and peely with its constellation of attendant lesser structures behind the mountains stuck out of the earth and here and there snaggy mesquite trees clawed at the sky or a parcel of scrub oaks nestled like drinking buffalo around a creek he headed in checking once again to make sure of the registration of the car a toyota tercel and the name of the owner lull ruta beth chapter lamar would never admit defeat or even disappointment still wasnt exactly a huge sum given what theyd had to go through to get it now maybe it aint a lot he said but it aint a little either not by a damn sight why theres lots of places to go lots of places to see on almost five thousand dollars but the truth was ruta beth had over nine thousand dollars inherited from her beloved late mother and daddy already in a bank account which she was willing to just fork over to lamar ruta beth that wouldnt be right you just dont give money to a person even though you love him it would be right if i said so she said well maybe come a rainy day that moneyll help out in fact maybe well borrow against it though i cant but guess theyd have the serial numbers recorded that would make mother and daddy happy ruta beth said lamar smiled still he was secretly upset a night or two after the robbery when the little family was gathered around the tv at the news hour watching for the latest on their own celebrity a flashy black man came on and said some are calling the pyes the boldest gang to come out of oklahoma since the thirties when pretty boy floyd roared out of the cookson hills and lit up america with his desperado ways but what pretty boy had in style and substance this gang makes up for in sheer firepower and dumb luck they are the gang that could shoot straight but couldnt think straightthe horrifying face of modern crime lamar brooded silently on this for a bit until his anger at last came welling out during the weather he suddenly started bellowing like an enraged father all this goddamn shit about pretty boy floyd and bonnie and clyde and johnny dillinger and how great they were its shit i tell you what we done we done bettern them old boys by a goddamn cocksucking mile his outburst quieted them all even odell who was working on a big bowl of frosted miniwheats lamar seemed to have it back under control but a vein on his head suddenly began to throb and then lamar got tooting again in them days he said earnestly looking at richard in them days the police didnt have nothing the radios had a range of about ten feet when they worked fingerprints was brand spanking new and had to be handcatalogued by clerks there werent no computers the cars was slow they didnt have no magnum pistols your biggest gun was your special they didnt have no helicopters no infrared no fax no nothing hell the fbi in them days was nothing but another gang with machine guns and bars nobody did hard time in a joint where all the niggers was uppity why hell any goddamned body could have been a desperado now look what we got to contend with look what we went through to get a lousy five grand im telling you no charlie floyd no bonnie parker no goddamned johnny dillinger could have pulled off what we pulled off we dont get no credit theyre saying we were just goddamned lucky well sir lot more to it than luck by goddamn god yes sir yes sir he sat there seething you should write that boy a letter lamar said ruta beth no maam another way of how come our type is better than them oldtimey ones the cops been using that trick for years go on the radio or the tv and disrespect an honest job of thieving so that the thief goes and gits himself all smoked up and pulls a rash job or sends a letter or something no sir what we have is selfcontrol i guarantee you we are goddamned serious then he got up and went outside they heard the toyota start up and leave the farm daddy is upset said ruta beth set said odell he has a right to be upset said richard i wish i had a surprise or something to give him so that he would feel better it was a wonderful idea a surprise exclaimed ruta beth in joy odell has anyone done give daddy a surprise odells face went slack as he contemplated this problem for minutes his eyes registered no occupancy but at last he found a kernel of information to impart took a deep breath and tried to find the way into speech his face mottled with effort the suspense grew he looked like he might explode but finally he said no prise whooee squealed ruta bern lets give him a surprise then a cake said richard who had himself always fantasized about a surprise party when he was a child we aint got no cake said ruta beth gake gake said odell in odells mind there was a memory of cake too he remembered way back old time mama sing mama kiss cake softee sweet on fire happy birthyday to you happy birthyday to youoo happy birthyday to odell happy birthyday to you mama so nice cakey good so long ago you hush now odell honey there aint no cake well make do with something come on the merry band went into the kitchen they opened the cabinets and indeed could find no cake but odell did quickly spot a can of storebought vanilla frosting he liked to spread it on bread pros fros he said urgently pointing his whole face turning red in the effort oh dell honey thats wonderful said ruta beth odell smiled you could put that on something said richard it wouldnt be a cake but it would be sort of a cake well id like to have a real cake said ruta beth its a damned shame we aint got no cake could you bake one no time but odell was not through yet he began jumping up and down with excitement and pointing his face lit with frustration as he tried to find the words to present what was clearly the most complex thought his brain had ever attempted to generate his eyes rolled his tongue fought in his mouth for fluidity he was putting two pictures together in his mind ed pros cake how could he get them to understand ed he was saying knowing that somehow it was wrong the harder he tried the more angry at himself he got sometimes he wanted to rip out his own eyes and tongue for being so different the pressure rose as he tried to form the word ed ed ed said richard ruta beth do you know what hes trying to say no idea she said odell honey you go slow and try and say all the letters odell made an effort to calm himself when he at last seized control of his own voice he spat out the word bed bed thought richard bread shouted ruta beth yes richard hes saying bread the excitement was intolerable richard felt it himself yes what was a cake but bread with sugar well why not put some sugar on a nice loaf of bread then cover it with frosting wouldnt that be sort of like a cake we can do it he shouted exalted we can do it odell smiled rapturously as ruta beth kissed him and wichud gave him a manly clap on the shoulder eagerly they set to work richards artistic talents came to the fore one problem was that shed of its wrapper the loaf of bread kept separating into slices it was richards brainstorm to pierce it with uncooked spaghetti strands to provide a kind of internal discipline that would hold it together odell didnt have the patience to spread the frosting but it turned out that richard didnt either even with his art training it fell to ruta beth with her eyes squinted and her tiny face knitted up like an angry fist she dabbed the frosting on the sugary bread a dollop at a time when she was finally done by god it did look like a cake he began to sing py birfee apy birfee we need candles said richard candles would really make it work suppose it aint his birthday or suppose hes one of them that dont like to be minded of his age ruta beth asked darkly but richard held firm no it should have candles he said i think we can take it on principle that lamar is the sort of man whod see the necessity for the ceremony his will held sway they had no birthday candles of course but they did find some candles kept in case the power went out richard cut them up and wedged them like carrot stumps into the frosting when they were done it looked pretty much like a cake but something was missing richard tried to guess what it just looked sort of disappointing the frosting was white somewhat unevenly applied but mainly it was that the shape of the loaf of bread wasnt obscured enough it just looked like a loaf of bread smeared with frosting we can do better than that he said then he knew it needs a lion everybody agreed that this was a wonderful idea richard set to work quickly he located supplies peanut butter to etch the face two raisins for eyes smashed bits of frito to form the mane steadily he worked as the other two hovered over him in the small warm kitchen at first it was chaos but richard had invested so much over the weeks in lions that he was able to bring the shape out from nothingness just seem to demand that it emerge from the swirls of peanut butter and the liquidity of the peanut butter as a medium was interesting somehow it was more naturally akin to the texture of muscle that he had had so much trouble getting into his drawings the bodyform just seemed to define itself out of the glop powerful and radiant vibrant with predatory muscularity it pleased him slowly like a mediterranean mosaicist adding his last few tiles he built the fritos into a mane then he added the two raisins they were too big it looked stupid then he saw a halfopened package of oreo cookies odell liked to pry the oreos apart and lick the frosting off he took a cookie out broke it into bits and found two of approximately the right size that looked like eyes carefully he placed this last detail where it belonged wion wion shouted odell lordy be said ruta beth it do look a lot like a lion just then they heard the car pull into the yard lamar parked near the barn then ambled toward the house git ready for a suprise called ruta beth lamar climbed to the porch opened the door and stared at the candles glowing in the dark now what the hell surprise shouted ruta beth richard and odell simultaneously leaping from the corners of the kitchen at lamar in the split second after ruta beth had turned on the lights for the first time in his life lamar stood agape his mouth fell open he looked at them dancing merrily in the kitchen and at the thing they had made for him then he started to cry thats the goddamned prettiest thing i ever saw he said oh my oh my oh my how you have made me proud today thats the goddamned best surprise a man could get and a lion on it richard boy i know your work thats you oh its so goddamned nice gake gake shouted odell well lets up and have us a piece said lamar lamar it aint a real cake it may not taste like much said ruta beth well damn id say its as real as a cake could get ruta beth he bent to cut it but odell yelled kwandul kwandul candle said richard he is saying blow out the candle make a wish obediently lamar blew out the candle whatd you wish for ruta beth wanted to know for us always to be this happy he said he cut the cake into four pieces the knife in his big fists the f u c k and the y o u i blazing off his knuckles and passed the pieces out for the birthday boy always hands out the cake and if they sort of closed their eyes and let the sugary bread run in with the frosting it did taste like real cake there wasnt but a dimes worth of difference between the two of them so it was that lamar woke strangely happy the next morning he had started scraping the house for its new coat of paint but somehow he didnt feel like it they all needed to chill after the rush of the robbery it would be a good day to take it easy he wanted to check the far field which ruta beth said her daddy had once dreamed of planting with alfalfa but he wasnt quite sure if he wanted to plan that far ahead it would be a shame to start something so ambitious and then have to let it go for one reason or another odell was up watching the early morning cartoons on the tv which he never missed and ruta beth was messing around in the kitchen richard was still sleeping of course so lamar went out to the creek that ran between ruta berns and the mcgillaverys place he was trying to think of another job a job that would light up oklahoma like the goddamned fourth of july but it was hard with this crew theyd just managed to skip by on the dennys and had been lucky as that goddamned tv nigger had said suppose that damned woman had hit him instead of missing it was probably richards scream that made her miss richard wasnt much good at nothing but the scream had helped probably more than it had hurt lamar didnt like to think how close hed come to buying the ranch even with a little goddamn old ruta bern had been faster than odell on the return fire wasnt she a peach butwhat kind of a new job were they capable of you needed a really hard crew to bring off something fancy richard could drive he and odell could handle the heavy stuff and ruta bern could tailgun that was about all that was available he now saw that going in without leaving someone in the car was a big mistake almost got them all killed so he tried to think of something they could do another dennys nah maybe a grocery market or the big px at fort sill or what about something that nobody had ever donesay a whole mall wouldnt that be something the whole goddamned thing or a rodeo had anyone ever robbed a rodeo what about one of them casinos the indians had built on their tribal property or a highstakes bingo game lamar sat back dreaming of the glory of it all mightily pleased so much was possible two months ago hed been just another con in the grim hole of the mac with nothing to look forward to except trying to hold on to what he had now look he had a family he had a family he hadnt worked it out just yet but if they could do two or three more scores big ones then maybe they could lie low maybe buy a camper and go to florida or something lamar had never seen florida he had an image of beaches and water and palm trees he could imagine odell splashing in the water and richard drawing and ruta beth just staring at him in that hard way she had as if she were trying to suck his soul out of him through her eyes how that girl could stare anyhow he imagined them happy happy always come the middle of the afternoon he got to feeling thirsty and thought how nice one of those icecold coca colas ruta beth kept in the fridge would taste and so he decided to head on in he was a man very much at peace with himself and ready to face the world when he rounded the corner of the barn and saw a truck coming down the driveway toward the house bud pulled up in front of the house he heard no dogs barking strange because most of these farm places had dogs but the stepfords never did either bud felt a little buzz from somewhere he wasnt sure where it was like that time a week or so ago on the reservation just a sense of being watched he picked up the mike dispatch i am tentwentythree the tun farm off east ofaltus thats tenfour sixohfive we have you listen here dispatch got me a feeling want you to run the name tun through records real fast see if anything kicks out tenfour sixohfive you hang in there tenfour bud sat for a minute or two in the heat usually you pulled into a farmyard the mrs came out to see what was going on or one of the hands leaned out of the barn or something but it was just quiet he could hear the slow tick of the truck cooling an old farmhouse lay before him and beyond in the emptiness the wichitas standing out like boulders the wind snapped sunflowers along the red dirt road bobbed and weaved in its force a cicada began to saw away like a lumberjack he looked back at the house these people hadnt given up someone had commenced scraping to prepare the wood for new paint though the job was at rest now still it spoke of hope for the future looking around he saw the fields were fallow but they didnt look grown out hard work hard as hell bud had worked farms when he was a young man between classes at oklahoma u before he had to drop out and hed hated it there was no harder way to make a living than to pull it out of the earth with your own two hands sixohfive tenfour dispatch ah we have nothing on tun in our records i did do a crosscheck and it seems some years back a mr and mrs tun that address were killed but theres nothing in the records to indicate adjudication in the case maybe that was it the feeling of death heavy in the air the way it sinks into the wood a farm couple murdered nothing in the records to suggest the culprit had been caught seemed eerily familiar but he couldnt place it okay thanks dispatch im going in wait for my ten twentyfour wilco sixohfive good hunting bud touched his three guns the big new beretta under his arm the colt on his right kidney and the little beretta inside his shirt okay he thought time to go lamar watched the man climb out of the truck he knew he was a cop from the long time hed spent on a radio in the cab now the man got out looked around set his hat just right yet still paused checking cautious bastard lamar had sunk into the high grass he didnt move a muscle then the cop came around the truck still looking and by god lamar thought hed fall through the earth itself it was that goddamned trooper sergeant the one he thought hed smoked at the stepfords big as life pewtie that was it pewtie oh aint you a tough bastard your own self pewtie was big and had that flat cop face weathered and serene that just drank in every damn thing lamar had seen that goddamned face a hundred times but now it was time to think whats he doing here whats he up to is it a raid goddamn no thered be swat people and fbi and choppers and osbi hot dogs all over the goddamned place this pewtie was here on his own lamar wished he had a gun on him and told himself hed never again be without one he thought of his two s upstairs in the bedroom freshly cleaned each with a magazine of glinting shells in it but he also knew if hed had a gun hed have drawn and fired and no matter what pewties would have brought the boys here soon enough then he thought of a new problem what happens if he sees poor odell hell know him in an instant hell draw and shoot and poor baby odell will just go down spitting blood out with his frosted miniwheats or richard he would recognize richard too for hed have that cop gift for memorizing a face off a bulletin able to pull it up at a moments notice we are fucked he thought if he sees them two we are fucked if i kill him now if i can then maybe were not fucked so fast but we are fucked best thing that could happen ruta beth come on ruta beth honey you got to get us out of this bud looked around one more damned time he could see nothing in the yard that seemed the slightest bit out of place he decided just to get the goddamned thing over with he walked toward the house a ladder leaned against it and bud could see the line where the paint scraping had halted whoever did the work knew what he was doing the old paint was scraped off down to bare wood slicker than a whistle maybe they did it with a machine or something but it just looked like hard work to him the oldfashioned kind no job for a slacker that was for sure he climbed up on the porch from inside he heard the sounds of the television a cartoon show for children that was good too kids meant family meant probably not escapedconvict armed robbers and killers now he was feeling pretty good he knocked on the door he heard some rustling inside but he wasnt sure what it was at last the door opened and a chalkyfaced young woman stared at him her wide eyes were dark as coal and she wore her dark hair pulled back in a long ponytail she was in jeans and a nondescript print blouse sleeves pushed up she fixed a glare on him which might have been fear and might have been hate miss tun yes i am she said if youre here to sell me something i dont need nothing no maam he said and took out his id folio with its golden state of oklahoma shield my names russell pewtie im an investigator for the state highway patrol i aint done nothing wrong she said im not saying you have maam its just that were investigating a crime and we may have a lead in a tiretread mark so we know what kind of car it is your car fits the profile i just want to take a look at it so i can cross you off my list and get on to the serious business ah she said was it a look of panic in her eyes bud began to pick up a sense of disturbance maam if youd like to call the family lawyer and have him come on out or something i dont have no family lawyer well maam id be happy to wait until you called someone if you like i can give you the number of legal aid and they can either supply or recommend a lawyer but no charges are pending against you miss tun we just want to account for these cars so by process of elimination we come down to ones we cant explain those are probably our boys okay sure itssorry im just not used to policemen i understand wouldnt be natural if you were maam she stepped outside in a flash glimpse he saw a kitchen and through a hall and two doors the blue tv glow your son maam what oh the tv no i just like to leave it on it keeps me company you live alone i do since mother and daddy died ive been here by myself i see youre having some work done yes got tired of looking at the old dead paint hired some men to clean it up and paint it but then they got another job so they ran off to do it said theyll be back but you know how hard it is to find quality work these days it seemed to hang together but bud was wondering why is she so nervous lamar watched as the trooper idd himself to ruta beth and began to gull her into something would she be smart enough would she make some stupid mistake goddamn how could they have tracked him he had been so careful he had thought it out a step at a time sometimes staying up all night just worrying his way through it what could he have done wrong he looked this way and that odell must be still camped in front of the tube if you didnt give that boy an order hed be content to sit there like a bump on a log from june till november richard was the goddamned problem richard could bumble in at any moment and start to cry the cop would recognize him it would all fall apart it came down to this lamar hated the idea that the trooper sergeant hed caught so flat footed a month and a half ago would be the one to bring him down he saw the stories now for he knew how they thought the newspapers and the tv would turn it all personal theyd make this lucky motherfucker into the greatest goddamned detective since dick motherfucking tracy he lamar would be the goat lamars anger ruptured like a boiler exploding he felt his muscles begin to tense and the blood begin to sing in his ears be careful he told himself you get mad you make a goddamned mistake he tried to clear his mind in order to figure out choices maybe he could double around get into the house by the back way get to a gun and just blow the fucker away but that would take minutes it might come apart before then and hed be stuck in the fields out back while bud pewtie blew away odell and richard and called for backup what would pewtie do would he go in the house or was he after something else suddenly ruta beth stepped outside closing the door after her and the two of them began the long walk to the barn lamar slithered backward a snake then plunged into the darkness of the barn and began to look about for some kind of weapon then he saw it the ax hed used to split logs he had it up in a second and slid into a pool of darkness inside the door dead still not hardly breathing the ax had killing weight to it if he got just the smallest break hed be on pewtie like the night one swipe and it would be over this must be that shootout in texas she said its so terrible what them men did why do people have to be so cruel maam ive been a police officer for nearly twentyfive years and the truth is i dont know four thousand dollars couldnt buy nothing with that but as he was talking bud was looking all about something still didnt sit right with him her nerves the idea of leaving a television on just to hear it why not a radio i keep it out back by my wheel she said beg pardon wheel i am by profession a potter i turn clay on a wheel then i paint it and glaze it and bake it in a kiln i can make pret near anything by now then i go to craft shows on the weekend it isnt much but its a living well thats nice funny i met all kinds but i dont believe i met a potter before id be pleased to give you a pot mr pewtie well thats kind of you maam i think ill just get it checked off and be out of your way gits kind of lonesome out here thats why im talking up such a storm i can appreciate it they walked through the barn and out back to her work area her potters wheel stood under a leanto the coal fired kiln next to it and on her bench were several cans of paint and her pots they blazed with color she seemed to be doing some imitation indian thing with them but they were better than any pottery hed seen in the reservation shops the colors were jagged almost savage and stood off the echer like blood pouring from a wound my he said impressed you are a hell of a potter those things are beautiful why thank you officer she said modestly and then he turned to the car lamar watched as she boldly led him toward the barn beautiful sweetie beautiful he was thinking he could have pounced at any second and in his mind he thrilled at the prospect of it that was what he was addicted to the hot fun of the violence he saw himself really getting his weight into it and bringing that blade whanging down into the troopers bull neck what a wound it would open the meat would splay open red and pulsing maybe a sliver of bone would show thered be more goddamned blood than you could shake a stick at pewtie would turn stunned unbelieving and his eyes would lock onto lamars and beg for mercy and hed weakly raise his hands but lamar with his great ironpumpers strength would bring the ax down again and again in a rain of killing blows it excited lamar he wanted to do it so bad they paused to gab a bit at her workbench and the cop said something that lamar didnt catch but when the cop started to examine the car lamar slid through the darkness and got almost within spitting distance he could lunge out now at any instant and take the man down his hand tightened and loosened on the ax shaft and he tried to control his excitement and think through the red rage that clouded his brain so that he could figure out the right thing hell maybe he should just do it and to hell with it but he waited hah said bud he stood up a little disappointed the old oncered tercel lay blistering in the sun its plaid interior had faded and was anyway jammed with blankets spots of rust flaked the left rear fender and the rear bumper also looked rotted out a bit then he leaned back again looking at the escutcheon on the old tire slowly he walked around one by one looking at them nope goddammit nope the tires were old all right but they were bridgestones not goodyears for some reason hed just had a suspicion this one might be the one the womans nervousness the isolation the anomalies of the tv and the hard male work put into the place well thanks very much miss tun i see i can scratch your name off the list no maam i dont believe you shot up any dennys restaurants lately not in this lifetime at any rate she said with a little laugh bud disengaged abruptly from the situation it was of no more interest to him well ill be getting out of your hair now have to get over to granite sure mr pewtie now i cant interest you in one of them pots bud looked back one of them really did leap out at him ocher glaze black diagonals and a bright orange sunburst like the end of a world could you sell me one i get fifteen dollars for the small ones and twentyfive for the big ones ouch not cheap but ill tell you what your choice ten bucks hell thats a bargain if ever i heard of one fortunately the pot he chose wasnt a big one so he forked over the ten without feeling terribly greedy he didnt as a rule like to take little extras with the badge but hell once in a while didnt hurt a thing she fetched the pot brought it to him and the two of them walked back through the barn to his truck come on back she said i enjoy visitors thanks miss tun good luck to you he got in now if they were just lucky a little bit longer if odell or richard didnt come walking out of the house lamar watched from the pool of shadow behind the barn door his heart was thumping pewtie was too far away to get with the ax now it was in the hands of god he diddled with the car a bit picked up his radio and called in what lamar assumed was his task completedand then with majestic leisure started the truck it took him another minute to back out of the yard and then three more minutes to pull down the dirt road to the macadam take a left and then disappear there seemed to be a long pause in the day lamar found that he was doused with sweat unlike the race out of deimys he didnt feel exhilaration he just felt the total numbing meltdown of shock that attends survivors of near death experiences he didnt like it a bit he looked up ruta beth came out of the house almost in a daze she cupped her hands as if she were about to call to him no he said loud but not a shout dont call dont look left or right just mosey into the barn in case at that moment odell opened the door looked out in confusion odell stay where you are no waitand make sure the shotguns is loaded keep richard in the house odell nodded and ducked back in eventually ruta beth came on over you was in the barn the whole time i was one silly move out of that boy and id have cut him open with this ax he had two guns i saw them both one under his coat the other in his belt probably had more goddamn said lamar that boy was loaded for bear the car it was the car he wanted to see honey yes it was daddy tell me exactly what he asked xactly i have to know the words numbly ruta beth reiterated buds explanation i see said lamar concentrating mightily he said he had to check it off they still use that old one thats what he said daddy now honey you think real hard tell me the whole talk not just what he said but what you said i have to know if you said something that gave too much away and a sly old dog like him might sniff it out laboriously she recreated the conversation now and then prodded by lamars insistent probing it went on for ten minutes but then she said i tried hard lamar i didnt do nothing on purpose honey you done great see he caught us in a mistake we should have stories prepared last thing you ever want to do is try and be making stuff up as you go along trip up too easy no maam got to have your story straight up front got to have it worked out and tested thats how you do that kind of work goddamn ruta beth i must say you got to be some kind of natural at that kind of work have you figured it out why he was here lamar thought a little harder and then he had it tires he said that was soft dust this side of the red sure enough we left tracks in it they must have got a good tire print and the ffuckingbi done em the models of cars them tires could fit so theyre just wading through the dmv listings hoping to turn up the right car with the right tires and the right fucking boys theyre so goddamn worried they even got old bud pewtie his hide so full of buckshot still he cant hardly walk out doing shit bird work he was laughing now he saw the joke in it ruta beth stared at him in horror but lamar she said they was right i got them tires two years ago when they was marked down because the tire place said goodyear had discontinued the line and they just wanted to reduce inventory not them tires no maam night of the party i went out remember goddamn i got to thinking about the ways we could slip up and only one i hadnt covered was the goddamn tires i swapped em with bridgestones i lifted off a hyundai excel hah old bud pewtie thinks hes so goddamn smart he aint as smart as no lamar pye chapter the final day bud tried to make it last longer he dawdled he examined each car with microscopic attention he wouldnt disengage from conversations he just let it drift but still it ended he pulled down the driveway of a farm all the way over near healdton in jefferson county the sun was a huge pink balloon sinking through wavering atmospheric phenomenon and the twilight was still and windless he looked each way as he pulled onto the road and saw the black band of the highway stretching in a straight shot toward a blank horizon okay thats it dispatch sixohfive do you copy sixohfive over whats your situation tentwentyfour on the obrian location nothing to report bud no dispatch nada zilch negative anybody get anything thats a big negative sixohfive lots of disappointment at this end best git yourself home now bud thanks dispatch tenfour and out bud clicked the radio off in two weeks hed gotten to know dispatch a little a retired tillman deputy sheriff another good old boy like himself steady and salty in a sense he wanted to please dispatch as much as himself or it c d henderson or colonel supenski but it wasnt to be the joint task force in two weeks had called on close to four thousand addresses in the southern oklahoma region and located close to four thousand toyota tercels hyundai excels and nissan sentras in the proper model years of these over eight hundred had worn the goodyear tires each owner had been investigated and either cleared or interviewed at length some fourteen were put under surveillance which had itself yielded nothing meanwhile joint highway patrolosbi raiding teams had entered the domiciles of close to two hundred former or currently wanted felons who owned the proper car again nothing although the lieutenant himself said theyd served warrants on and apprehended over twentyeight fugitives from justice in the process bud himself had been to over domiciles in the past two weeks working twelve fourteen and sometimes sixteen hours a day roaming the back country roads of the southernmost five counties some nights he hadnt even come home but had checked into truckstop motels for a few hours ragged sleep and one night hed just climbed into a sleeping bag and slept under the shelter of the open tailgate oddly it had been his best sleep he tried to think it all over as he headed back to lawton to turn in the radio and see what the hell to do next if there was a next goddamn lamar smart as a whip all them brains spent on defeating the law and completely unyoked to any moral compass he could have been a doctor a goddamned lawyer with brains like that but he spent all that time just figuring out one thing how to get away with it he wasnt your criminal genius like the movies had it sleek and cosmopolitan with a taste for fine wine and maybe his iq wasnt the kind that tests could measure but he was a smart boy tiredly he turned on the am radio to ktok the oklahoma city allnews station and listened to the numb recitation of the world and the regions events from what the president had done on down to what happened in the oklahoma city council that day and soon enough he got the bad news in lawton highway patrol and osbi authorities today called off a statewide dragnet for the car they believed was used by escaped convict lamar pye and his gang in the may robbery and shooting spree in wichita falls texas which left four law enforcement officers and two civilians dead well just have to wait for you to strike again lamar bud thought and this time i know youll make a goddamned splash and a half in a related development lawton school officials revealed today that a lamar pye cult appears to be growing and gaining strength in lawton high schools elevating the escaped convict and armed robber into a folk hero at lawton west last night vandals defaced the school gym with long live lamar and go lamar graffiti superintendent will c long said the superintendents voice came on the air its a symptom of the moral limbo in which all too many of our children are raised that some of them would consider a lamar pye a hero shit that really got to bud it was like these goddamned kids today they thought it was funny or cool when somebody stood over a poor policeman and blew his brains out or caught him coming out of the mens room with his hands wet and blew him away with a blast of doubleought the news put bud in a black funk a near rage it made him wish he was a drinking man still and he felt like pulling over to the next bar he found and chasing his anger away instead he drove on as the darkness increased changing to a cw station whose jangly rhythms soothed him some and then he knew he had to call holly again it just came like that and he didnt bother to fight it at all he found a pay phone by a convenience store the other side of oil city he had to call collect because he didnt have enough change well howdy stranger she said i thought youd dropped off the earth been looking at threeyearold toyotas just like a real detective how are you bud im okay howre you honey im outta toyotas thats how i am and im missing you something kind of bad a likely story only the truth you aint had sex in awhile thats what it is no maam that aint what it is i miss holly shes a peach now i dont think im gonna be doing a thing tomorrow you and me were going to look at places oh bud i thought youd forgot no maam be over round ten bud i was looking through the want ads i found a house to rent i want you to see it so bad ten oclock oh bud i love you so much now why did i go do that he said to himself when he hung up back in it all over again bud woke the next morning to a dilemma since he was only going house hunting with holly did he need his three guns the answer seemed clear but wasnt it might seem to be no but if he didnt put the guns on then jen would surely know he wasnt headed off on police business still the prospect of walking into strangers houses with a smile on his face and three automatic pistols on him wasnt pleasing either thats how it was in this business you were always thinking figuring angles trying to work your way two or three jumps ahead you always had your lies prepared up front because you didnt want to improvise under pressure where youd surely start contradicting yourself and anyone with half a brain could unravel your tale it was like living in enemy territory all the time goddamn turning me into lamar pye he thought as after his shower he put himself into the rigmarole of slipping into the holsters loading the guns and magazines every last thing including the little beretta which felt as if over the days it was going to wear a hole in his belly i may give up on this goddamned he called to jen as he slipped the gun into an open button and down behind his belt at just the right angle so that it didnt give him too much difficulty but she didnt answer grim again okay he called im going she came around the corner and fixed him with a glare anyways where you off to i thought they called the search off well they did he saidsliding into his lie not looking quite at her that was what a good liar could do look you straight in the eyes and sell you the tallahatchie bridge not bud he sort of let his vision dawdle into the middle distancebut i got some paperwork to do and i dont want that damned lieutenant thinking any the less of me i cant do a thing to impress him ill just mosey down to the annex check some things diddle around be back by midafternoon i dont see why you have to go today youve been gone for the best part of two weeks i have a job to do he said let me do my job all right she reacted as if shed been slapped which in a way she had as well as lied to straight up with a bitter expression she retreated and then said russ hears today if the news is good you should be here for him and we should take him out to celebrate would he go out with us though he just sits up there reading we have to try should i go up and say good luck to him hes sleeping jefts gone but russell doesnt have classes until ten today okay im sorry i yelled at you this thing has me down it certainly does jen said numbly ill see you he gave her a brief kiss and went out and climbed into his truck he drove by a roundabout way to hollys he parked and went in it was just that simple one woman and then the other without so much as a howdo youdo oh dont you look like a stud bud bet i know what you want holly i got all these goddamned guns on me getting out of em is harder than getting out of my boots well i guess youd rather play with them than me bud she teased but he answered in earnest i just put on this shoulder holster its a pain to get out of and back on adjusted just right okay bud have it your way you may never get another chance but she was dressed herself and only teasing him she looked so damned cute today he could hardly stop himself from wanting her who wouldnt want such an attractive young woman with all that spunk and that way she had of poking fun at everything when he was with her every other damned thing seemed to go away it just felt so normal they stopped for coffee at an outoftheway place and then drove on to the first of her addresses a small place in a nicely kept neighborhood on sixteenth street a block or so down from lee boulevard near the south side of town the lady who owned it was waiting for them a wispy whitehaired old bat she took up with holly right away all but ignoring bud as though she sensed his true irrelevance to what lay before them and started gossiping with holly like a daughter bud awkwardly put his big hand with his wedding ring on it behind him in a back pocket that pulled his jacket back and walked up the walk behind the two ladies feeling left out but also so strange he now had to face it the part of it that had left him acutely uncomfortable all these late weeks it was this househunting thing why had he agreed to it except out of stupidity and sloth it felt like such a violation actually going into another home looking at it and imagining a life in it while a few miles away a wife and sons went about their business completely unaware of the betrayal that was being planned coldly against them by their sworn protector bud shook his head he climbed the porch looked at the blooming dark void that lay before him into which the ladies had disappeared then swallowed and followed a young family had lived here he saw in an instant the place stank of young kidsthe way they piss the way they smear their food on everything their warmth their noise their considerable odors it was now empty but on the cheap carpeting were the stains of baby food and spilled milk and wee wee here and there on the walls was a smear of pudding or a dried stalk of broccoli see what a nice sunroom the lady was saying the holloways said they used it as a family room bud looked at the small windowedin back porch which smelled of mildew who lived here he asked suddenly sergeant holloway and his family he was transferred to germany and rose and the boys went with him though i dont think she was too happy about it be good for kids to see a foreign country though bud said mine never did but he was thinking another sergeants home some goddamned fool for duty giving his whatever to some bigger outfit doing well enough but not truly well he looked around sensing the other sergeant was he an artilleryman maam he asked wanting just one more detail somehow no i believe he was a military policeman though with an artillery battalion the whole battalion deployed to germany bud nodded looked around another cop he listened as the two women clambered up the steps when they were gone to the upstairs he poked a head in the kitchen it was small colored yellow with flowers on the wallpaper and all the appliances looked scratchy and sticky the linoleum was worn where the kitchen table had been and a bulletin board was literally riddled with hundreds of puncture marks where various family documents must have been hung he had one in his kitchen too he sat there imagining the shouts of children maybe the bustling of the woman in the kitchen trying to make a good meal without a lot to work with and where would the sergeant be yes in the living room plunked down on the sofa watching the goddamned football game how many times had such a drama played out in his own house and now and then jen would come out and yell you boys be quiet your daddys watching the football game or your daddys trying to sleep had she hated him for it had she resented it you saw things like that all the time the woman just finally saying to hell with it and sinking a butcher knife in the husbands chest or getting out the deer rifle and nailing a through him or soaking him in hot grease had jen ever wanted to do that he thought of jen as shed been when hed met her all those years ago the prettiest woman hed ever seen and when shed returned a few of his shy smiles hed hardly known what to do shed stood by her man too she waited for him his first two long years in the air force and married him then spending the first two years of marriage in a tiny apartment on his sergeants salary outside the pope afb in north carolina where hed finished up as an air policeman shed gone with him when he went back to school and when he decided to join the troopers instead of staying the course feeling too old among all those kids shed said fine and made do with a trainees salary and then a trooper first classs salary the long years at a corporals salary when even though hed passed the sergeants exam others with seniority or connections got the job shed had the kids and done the crap work and gradually took over every thing he didnt like doing like the checkbook the taxes the pta meetings she always managed a parttime job she never made a big point over how much more money her daddy had than he was able to make and if she was disappointed in the life that bud had built for them all those years rolling up and down oklahomas highways she never let it show shed worked like hell out of commitment to a man and some idea of a family was it her fault shed put on weight and the years had drained her face of joy and her conversation of everything except a sullen sometimes bitter irony suddenly an overwhelming melancholy came over bud he couldnt take it anymore the teeming swarming sense of family in the old house the sense of a sergeant his wife the children no money and the struggle to hold it all together in some way he turned and went out to the front porch where a beatup sofa sat like a throne from which to view the neighborhood he put himself down on the arm and took in great draughts of air that helped somewhat for a second there hed felt like he was going to puke he wondered if he wasnt coming down with something and ran a hand across his brow only to have it come away damp all your systems breaking down you old fool he told himself he had a sudden urge to just bolt just get the hell out of there to hell with holly and this nonsense about the house nothing would make him feel sweeter than to put some distance between himself and holly and the damned old biddy and run on back to jen if he confessed got it off his chest maybe he could get his marriage and his family back do it do it now but he didnt do that either he sat there for a time looking up and down the quiet street trees small homes a few kids out and about bud bud honey could you come up here bud turned and went upstairs where three small bedrooms and a john lay off the short hall bud mrs ryan says we could knock down one of these walls and make the two littler bedrooms into one big one now why would they want to do that if his boys came hed want them to have a place to stay and some room even if it was small you could turn it into your office honey she said yeah he said my fiance is a highway patrol officer holly explained to the woman im glad youre a law officer i seen that gun on your backside i thought maybe you were that awful lamar pye im no lamar pye he said though ive spent considerable time looking for him hes a terrible man said the woman my daughter lives in wichita falls and ive eaten many sunday breakfasts in that restaurant i think its terrible what he did i hope youall catch up to him and kill him dead id hate to see him go to court and some fool decide he was the true victim in all this well get him bud said bud honey mrs ryan says shed let us have the house for only threefifty a month we could move in right away it would be so wonderful its a nice quiet neighborhood bud smiled and said holly weve only begun looking dont you think you ought to see some other places yes honey said mrs ryan your fiance is right you should see a lot of places so you dont feel youve rented in a panic ive seen too much of that you dont have any other prospects no i dont honey you take your time dont we have other houses to see today honey yes okay ill call you later in the week mrs ryan thank you so very much they walked to the truck and got in now lets see holly said i think this next one holly can we just hold off on this we saw a house today it was fine dont we want to think this thing through a bit bud i justi dont know holly it just suddenly didnt feel right to me you could move into that house by friday and what then i might not be ready forwell i dont know bud and hollymy god that woman was talking about lamar pye who shot and killed your husband blew his brains out and you didnt even blink an eye you just went ahead with your question about if the house was available this boy killed your husband damned near killed me and killed a mess of poor folks you got to have some response you cant be human and not well arent you mr high and mighty i didnt notice you getting solemn about mr lamar pye the last time you had me every which way from sunday you didnt give a damn about lamar pye then or about ted pepper either holly im only saying bud i have to get out of that trailer im sorry holly her face knit up in a small flinch of pain oh bud i just want a house of my own please you dont have to move in just help me move please holly please i aint saying you have to move in butyoull have a place holly just say yes bud just on this one thing think of the fun wed have up there fun was her word for sex oh hollyif it makes you happy she squealed in delight and gave him a big kiss then she ran off to tell mrs ryan after a lunch he dropped holly off and drove quickly to the annex so that he could see it and feel it and know what was going on and in that way his lies to jen about having spent the day there would be that much more authentic he entered to find it all but empty dispatch manned the radio unit but there was no traffic a few clerks sat at their computer terminals listlessly but none of the ranger types were around any news bud asked dispatch not a thing bud we going to have to wait for old lamar to strike again thats all and hope we get luckier i wonder how many hell kill this time bud said bud bud get your goddamn ass in here came a scream from the inner office what the hell is going on said bud you dont have to go in there bud in fact probably best not to i aint seen him so bad then im bud come in get in here damn you the words were slurred and desperate shit said bud and headed in to discover the office a disaster with paper computer printouts books everywhere a paper cup sat before lt henderson on the desk and bud could see that it was half full of amber fluid the old cop stared at him he had one of those wrinkled prune faces under a thatch of hair but now it was rosy with the power of bourbon he reeked his chin seemed to want to pitch forward as re fought for a bitter consciousness and blinked back the darkness bud have a drink with me just one do both of us a world of good he said adding a sloppy and uncharacteristic smile cant say no to that said bud and watched as the older man poured a couple of fingers worth into another paper cup he pulled from his desk bud tasted the whiskey fire and memory and buzz all at once thats a good drinking whiskey lieutenant bud i think theyre going to let me go lieutenant i am sorry goddamn their black fucking hides i give em close on forty years now i come up dry and its enough to push old cd out the goddamned door im sorry lieutenant sorry aint got but piss to do with it said the old man pouring himself another shot and draining it with a gasp it was my idea took a mess of convincing all that overtime cost the state about five hundred thousand dollars but i told my boss and yoursand they told the governorthat itd get em lamar pye but it didnt the old detective stared into the grim space what the hell did i do wrong what did i miss lieutenant im not a detective im a road cop thats all dammit bud there arent any more detectives im the last one your metro boys your young feebs your treasury agents or atf boystheyre not detectives not any of them theyre clerks they do crime scene or they tap wire or they interview witnesses and take notes but they dont do no goddamned detective work not a one of them the old mans head lolled forward and his lower lip hung loose he seemed to breathe heavily through his mouth and once again fought for consciousness his eyes closed but then like a lizards peeped open again you listen to my thought on this problem and tell me what i done wrong heres how i broke this sucker down they always run to their own kind they do thats the first principle sure as summer heat no place he could go but into the criminal community hes got to be somewhere among folks whod give him aid we got the biker groups nailed he aint there and we got the goddamned cartire type so if we crossreference we come up with close to two hundred possibilities he has to be there has to be what did i miss lieutenant i dont know did i miss a category felons known informants fences criminal lawyers anybody in the culture what category could i have missed what other category is there thats what i believe im missing im missing a category bud you got any categories lieutenant as i said this aint my line of work see with freddy dupont the missing category was secondary experience that is reading thats what done it so im missing a category goddammit lieutenant i wish i had an idea see its points you need two points to draw a line one point criminal community another point the cartire track but goddammit nothing i need a third point goddamn a third point a third category another drink bud lieutenant i got to get on home i got a boy hearing about college today the baseball player no sir the student a ball player and a student it sounds like a fine family bud it is said bud the lieutenant took another hit from his paper cup and the whiskey seemed to bring a tear to his old eyes or maybe it was just that something blew into them anyway he said nope never had kids myself just never had the damned time then suddenly he lit up and for a second his melancholy seemed to evaporate say bud he said one of these days why dont you bring them boys over love to meet em bring em over to the house and well sit em down and give em their first drink best a boy learns to drink with his daddy and not out behind the woodshed i wont have much to do hanging around the house id like that bud bud knew it was the drink talking just as when he said that sounds like a damn fine idea lieutenant he knew hed never do it it would be horrible his two sons who were already from different planets than their old fart of a father locked in some strange little house with this bitter old coot who was from still another planet it would never happen besides he didnt think the old man really wanted it to happen either he checked his watch it was nearly four damn he was late i ought to be going now lieutenant you go bud you done good work all my boys done good work id rise to shake your hand but i pissed up my pants a few minutes ago and im too embarrassed to move oh lieutenant i dont pay it no never mind said the lieutenant he poured himself another drink emptying the bottle and threw the bottle into the wastebasket where it shattered then he looked up and seemed surprised to see bud still there go on get out get about your life he commanded darkly and bud hurried out bud said dispatch your wife called when you were in with the lieutenant she wants you to call thank god he was here when she called he found a phone sweetie its me bud russ got in theyre going to give him a full scholarship hes going off to princeton university all right hey isnt that great bud said a surge of joy leaped in him something was turning out in his life hell have so many chances hell meet so many people a whole new world will open for him thats great ill be home in a little bit and well go out if thats what he wants he said he would he wants to see some friends later but hell go out on my way russ deserved it hed worked hard at his studies and he was a very bright boy the school counselors had told them it was in this mood that as bud drove home he passed a large gray structure on gore boulevard which he had passed perhaps five hundred times before but for the first time he noticed the lions chapter it was the fucking neck the key to the lion lay in its neck somehow in the density of muscle and bone in the knots of hair in the fucking shortness of the structure there lay the secret to that amazing regality that kingly magnificence yet richard could not free it not that is with a pencil or a crayon or any conventional drawing implement lord how he had tried like popcorn puffs his crumpledup failures lay scattered about him in the upstairs room of ruta beths farmhouse he felt a killing headache he could not get it his beasts all had a strange tightness to them he drew them in his sleep he drew them in the air with an empty hand he drew them in his mind he drew them on paper and he had never quite brought it off in fact if he thought about it his best lion had been done in the liquid medium of peanut butter it was the image hed crafted on the mock cake something in the wet fluency of the material and the ease of its manipulation and the lack of pressure or expectation had freed him to really achieve the pure essence of lion hood and his first dumb drawing in the mac and maybe a doodle here and there on a place mat in the margins of a book or magazine those too had had the freedom he needed you think too much he thought what had conrad said thinking is the great enemy of perfection boy had he gotten that one right richard stood yawned trying to shake the tension from his back and neck and the weariness from his wrist lamar and odell were out in the fields on some absurd agricultural project ruta beth was behind the barn working at her fucking wheel he was alone of course it would help if lamar had told him the point of the lion did he want a formal portrait what was his thing about the lion where would it go what would it become if he knew that then maybe it would be better or easier but lamar wasnt saying he was too sly it was as if in some preliterate instinctual way lamar knew it was wisest not to disclose this information he wanted richard to struggle and build the lion out of that struggle rather than providing for him a neat little dedicated purposebuilt image he was a tyrannical patron so the lion what is the essence of the beast he was a hunter he hunted he roamed the savannah took down the helpless and stole their meat he hunted to live but nohe also killed to live the hunting wasnt the point the hunting was only the rationale something in the lion loved to close in enjoy the fear and the pain of the quarry and experience that sublime moment when its spastic struggle ceased and its eyes went blank and bathed in the black torrents of its own blood it passed into limp death what a godlike moment what a sense of cosmic power how thrilling richard tried to find that impulse in himself no such luck knockknock whos there only us lambs he shivered disgusted such a thing did not exist for him thats why it was hopeless he stood and restlessness stirred in his limbs he suddenly ached for freedom he needed to move he began to roam through the upper story not much three bedrooms and a bathroom that ruta beth kept immaculate especially with as she put it three big strong boys in the house the toilet seat was down he wandered into the room ruta beth and lamar shared again it was farm and convictneat the sign of people used to living to very high standards of imposed discipline yet you could look at it for a hundred years and never divine from its clues that a lamar pye killer and robber and butt fucker had taken up occupancy it titillated him a bit to be in lamars private space the blood rushed to his head he knew how the angel lucifer must have felt when he wandered into gods bedroom before his exile for just a second he tried to imagine what it would be like to be lamar the lion to look upon all living things as prey and to know with bloodboiling confidence that you had the magic power to drive them to the earth and rip their bloody hearts from them to taste the hot blood and feel the weakening of their quivers as they slid into death he had to laugh yeah right the feeling was hopelessly counterfeit it didnt belong to him who are you trying to kid he wondered then richard noticed something it was an envelope manila on the closet shelf hidden behind shoeboxes it struck him as odd for nowhere else in ruta beths strange little house was there a hidden treasure feeling just a little daring richard snatched the envelope saw that it was stamped kiowa county prosecutors office march now what thehe opened the flap and reached inside there were two of them green with age in frozen copper postures of the hunt bud pulled to the side of the road and looked up at the building and saw what it was the harry j phillips fine arts society bud paused for a second as an intriguing thought whispered through his mind he glanced at his watch had some time he decided what the hell he got out reached behind the seat and removed his briefcase setting his stetson right he climbed the low concrete steps pausing for a second to look at one of the lions close up all the power and glory of its musculature stood capured in the art the piece was an homage to the power of the lion and even bud felt a little thrill at looking at it he went inside where it was dark and had the feeling of a cathedral hushed and almost religious a uniformed guard watched him come closing time is five pm sir the guard said bud flashed his badge looking for the head man whod that be and howd i find him dr dickstein hes the curator admin offices down on the left thanks bud walked down the corridor he looked at the paintings they made him feel insignificant a few made no sense at all others seemed like photographs of explosions now and then one would throw up an image so arresting it stopped him in his boots but in time he made it to the office of the curator and stepped inside to find a young man in shirtsleeves and wire glasses sitting at a computer terminal he was one of those wiry boys with great coils of hair like electrified springs he looked a little like russ bud couldnt help thinking ah excuse me can i help you bud pulled his badge sergeant bud pewtie oklahoma highway patrol im looking for dr dickstein he in there er no im dr dickstein dave dickstein sergeant what can i do for you god they were growing them young these days bud immediately felt hed screwed up not getting that the guy who ran such a place could be so young sir i was hoping you could give us some help well said the young man some ambivalence leaking into his tone you may have heard we had three convicts break out of mcalester state penitentiary a couple of months ago now theyve set to armed robbery and they killed four policemen and two citizens a few weeks back the tvs full of it sir it seems that one of them was an artist he studied art back east in baltimore yes i still dont well i have some of his drawings here it turns out he likes to draw lions lions the young man looked bud over intently sir im no art expert said bud and the truth is i couldnt tell one joker artist from another i cant even remember which one sawed off his ear but i thought i might find an expert and have him look at the drawings maybe hed see something i wouldnt maybe theres a meaning in them i just cant grasp and somehow maybe i dont know it would lead me another step of the way well said dr dickstein i did my ph on renaissance nudes that doesnt have much to do with lions but id be happy to look at them did you see our lions by the way sergeant yes sir i did thats what brought me in here replicas of the lions outside the chicago art institute the lion has been a theme in romantic art for a thousand years it usually represents male sexuality particularly in the romantic tradition these boys aint so romantic no i dont suppose they are dr dickstein said richard slid out the photograph he stared at it with some incomprehension its details were exact and knowable but they had been arranged into a pattern that made no sense at all he saw a bedroom slipper a bedroom a bed two sleeping forms a nice nightdress a bathrobe then he realized that the room in the photograph was the room he was at that moment in and that the bed was the bed that still lay between the two windows which ruta beth and lamar now so placidly shared in fact the photographer had been standing almost exactly where richard now stood except that he had been perhaps three or four feet closer to the foot of the bed than richard now was involuntarily richard took the steps over the hardwood floor until he stood in the exact spot he looked at the bed which was ever so neatly made so tidy with a white bedspread with little rows of red roses on it he looked at the wall above the bed white and blank and formless he looked back in the picture it was the same except that the two people in the bed werent sleeping they were dead someone had fired something heavyeven richard knew enough to suspect a shotguninto them as they slept the shells had destroyed their faces and skulls and the inside of their heads like fractured melons lay open for all the world to see jackson pollock at his most amphetamine crazed had contaminated the wall flung spray spatter gobbets of flesh patches of skin a whole death catalog of the contents of the human head displayed on that far wall which was now so tidily cleaned up and repainted richard felt woozy ruta berns parents obviously the tragedy she had so glumly and vaguely referred to in her letter was a murder someone had broken in and blown mother and daddy away ruta beth had probably discovered them like this that explained her weirdness her craziness her strange devotion to a man like lamar who whatever else could protect her but she stayed in the same house she slept in the same bed richard shivered he looked back at the picture blood blood everywhere a carnivores feast of blood the triumph of the lion over its prey something in him seemed to twitch or stir he noticed thatgood heavenshe was getting an erection quickly he put the photograph back in the envelope and the envelope back where he had found it he returned to his desk the blood sang in his ears the lion the lion his pencil flew across the page bud opened his briefcase and spread the three drawings out on dr dicksteins desk the crude tracing hed found among lamars prison effects the drawing from the stepfords and the doodles on the place mat at the dennys crime scene he studied at a place called the baltimore institute is that good the maryland institute its a fine school said dick stein you know this is very unusual if you study the lives of artists indeed you find violent and maladjusted men but almost always their rage is directed at the self the ear you know van gogh that sort of thing its rare that they express their hostility to the world at large i suppose theyre too narcissistic we aint sure how much hes in command he was celled with a tough lifer con an armed robber by profession very powerful criminal personality we think richard just got sucked up in it lamar has a way of getting people to do what he wants hes the real monster the young art doctor stared at the three drawings for a bit this one isnt in his hand no it was in an impression i found in a magazine that was in lamars possession in the pen its traced the line is heavy crude and dead i believe thats right never saw the original it was etched in a penthouse the light caught it right and i brought it out myself yes but clearly the original drawing is richards yes sir yes i see commonality and this this one its the one he worked on the hardest yes sir at the stepfords they told me lamar ordered richard upstairs to draw while looking out so it was an assignment yes sir it represents lamars view of himself yes sir very romanlook sergeant you dont have to call me sir dave would be fine everybody around here calls me dave dave it is then good anyway it represents lamars view of himself men who think theyre lions see themselves as powerful kingly sexually provocative very romantic in their own eyes incredible un selfcons ious vanity typical criminal personality id bet sounds pretty familiar yes i thought it might and it doesnt quite work i think you see in the second lion something studied perhaps too cute the first one is much cruder but its much better richard is trying to do too much in number two he has conflicting impulses its very renaissance actually very italian hes trying to please his patron the powerful lord who doesnt know much about art except what he likes and yet his own subversive interests keep breaking through his talent is betraying him he knows that the subject matter is beneath him he sees through it so he really cant force himself above the level of the commercial hack he despises the material its so coarse vikingprimordial warrior stuff the killer elite at play in the fields of the lord hmmm what is it arendt says about the banality of evil this is it in spades and richard knows that he doesnt like drawing it but of course he hasnt the guts to say no what would happen if he said no you dont want to know ill trust you on that one is he any good as an artist well theres something here i dont know he has technical skills yes and he doesnt want to do it but he is doing it and that tension makes it somehow interesting how about the third one ahlots of vigor dash panache done offhanded with his left brain something else was on his mind he did it just before the robbery they had him as lookout if hed have done his job right maybe all them people wouldnt have died you dont like him do you sergeant bud thought a moment no not really he had choices lamar and odell they never had no choices they were born to be trash they learned at the toe end of somebodys boot richard could have done anything what happened to him didnt have to happen he was smart enough for it not to have happened thats what i despise about him hes not even a good goddamned criminal lamars a great criminal lamars a pro this poor pup hes just what the convicts call a fuck boy i can see how prison would be somewhat hard on him said dr dickstein and thats it wellyes thanks then youve been some help the museum directors eyes knitted up then and he seemed to really throw himself at the three drawings at last he said you knowi dont know theres one other thing yes sir it probably doesnt mean a thing maybe not but tell me anyway what i see here is a process of he paused groping for a word what i see is a process of purification somehow hes honing reducing it concentrating it trying to simplify it hes trying to reduce it to pure essence of lion for lamar bud looked carefully at the drawings from number two to number three it was true same lion same posture but somehow simple less fretwork to it the lines bolder the suggestion more powerful why he asked well hes getting close to cartoon almost one could say or emblem hes reducing it to emblem or trademark i dont know but theres definitely a lot of work a lot of practice a lot of method gone into it now hes nervous before the crime hes not thinking its just come welling up and he gets this one which is by far the best whatever hes reducing it to hes almost there lamar will see that bud looked at the drawing he was trying to figure out what it could be was lamar going to put a trademark on his crimes i dont know said the doctor it looks like something i once saw but is there a visual tradition in criminal culture possibly it has to do with graffiti or hex signs or some such some unique signature some proclamation of deviance that says to the world i am the bad man he paused it looked like something to bud too then he remembered the mottling of blue stains on lamars arms as lamar bent to put a bullet into poor ted and the f u c k and the y o u i lamar wore on his knuckles it appeared to bud perfectly formed and beautiful its a tattoo bud said astounded at his own insight richard is designing a tattoo for lamar chapter tattoo said richard goddamn right said lamar thats what you been workin on and now by god you done it what lay before them on ruta berns coffee table was richards best and final lion a beast so pure and fierce it leaped off the paper at you to tear your throat out it sang of blood next to it was a beautiful young blond woman tawny and silky and adoring her arm around the king lost in his mane it was like a nazi wet dream i want to proudly wear that on my chest i want a artist to put it there in a nice parlor not no convict thing like this here trashy shit on my skin now lamar im sure a good one could i mean i saw tattoos in mcalester i wouldnt have believed evidently its gotten quite sophisticated its not crude anymore the artists are quite free with line and color lamar carefully unbuttoned his shirt and shucked it off though he hadnt been working out regularly as in the mac his body was still sleek with muscle on his pneumatic arms the fading blue ink of prison tattoos that had lost their vitality spilled like stains but on his hands the f u c k and the y o u i still told the world who he was see he said its like it was meant to be i never had nothing on my chest i done that all on my arms and hands and back when i was young and stupid or young and drunk or high on crystal or all three but here id like that lion just as bold as bold can be daddy said ruta beth that would be cool that would be the coolest thing i think it would be too said lamar see ive always seen myself as a lion and this here thing is what would make it so baby odell what do you think do you think lamar would look cool with a lion on his chest you know a real roaring lion like the one richard here been practicing to draw odells damaged mind grappled with the concept and at last grasped it picture on skin lion grrrrrrrr scary pretty too too he said so excited he sprayed frosted miniwheats and milk with each syllable he wants one lamar thats what the boys saying said ruta beth can he get one well sure maybe not when i do it because somebodyll have to stand guard but later well get him a right nice one odell what you like your tattoo to be but odell did not want a lion he wanted something else doggy mar me doggy doggy dell yoppayoppa yes sir baby odell well get you the goddamnedest best doggy ever there was right richard you could design a doggy just like you done a lion richard couldnt you of course lamar daddy i want one too of course honey i want a picture of my mother and daddy on my back and a raven i want it on my right shoulder blade bet richard could do that too huh richard ahyes actually richard thought he was going to faint ever since he was a boy richard had hated needles what was tattooing as he understood it but ordeal by needle just sitting there the tattoo artist would puncture and puncture and puncture injecting a small permanent blot of color under the skin until some hideous banality like a skull and crossbones or a battleship or f u c k and you was formed he knew he couldnt get through it but he also knew this is why he was here in some way his skill with the pen had jiggered something deep and yearning in lamar it had drawn lamar to him made him important even magical to lamar it had he supposed saved his life richard i want your help help be the foreman son you worked so hard on the drawing and now i would say its perfect i want you to work with the skin artist and get it exactly that way i dont want no slipups his mood turned briefly dark he pulled the muscle of his biceps until they could see where drops of blood once red but now faded pink dripped off a tattooed slash in his arm opened by a dagger it was a trompe oeil of some earnestness but not much skill however what infuriated lamar was the third drop from the wound see that one look see it they all crowded around yes sir daddy said ruta beth whats wrong see how it goes out all the others go in thats whats wrong but richard realized it wasnt a mistake the tattoo artist whoever he was was trying to make the spurts of blood slightly more authentic by varying their configuration and modulating their placement in the stream knowing instinctively that irregularity meant realism if hed done it the way lamar had assumed hed do it it would somehow be deader it was the endless battle between the patron and the artist for control of the work it was the pope versus michelangelo i suppose id have to do some research id have to find a guy with the skill you cant just walk in on these things id have to see samples of his work i think they have magazines full of tattoos you could find a guy from them and then we could no no said lamar that would take too long he does something this fancy ill be laid up for a month while it heals longer i wait longer its going to be want it done now tonight but lamar i the fort dont you get that the fort fort sill outside the fort on that fort sill boulevard tattoo parlors you got that right we go tonight we check em out if you find a boy who can do what i want then we do it tonight we lay up bout a month i figure another job we pull it off then by god its mexico and a vacation a vacation said ruta beth oh daddy you think of everything it happened rarely enough anymore because everybody had such different schedules and agendas but it happened tonight and bud was a happy man they were all there his wife and his two sons gathered around a dinner table in the mahogany room of martins lawtons finest restaurant for forty years and the place still knew how to put out a pretty good plate of roast beef its specialty though tonight jen had decided to have some fish thing and russ though the honoree had chosen a plate of linguini with pepper sauce but he was happy bud was they sat there eating bud shoveling down the forkfuls of reddish meat that always so delighted him the boys looked great russ the object of all attention had slicked up his act a bit he wore a white shirt buttoned at the top and a pair of black jeans over his black boots and his long hair smoothed backward the earring was still a little one jeff in a blazer and tie looked a little more like buds idea of a princeton student we are so proud of you russ said jen see whats so great isnt just that russ is smart said bud the world is full of smart people lamar pye hes smart hes smart as hell but russ works thats whats rare the world is full of people who think theyre just too damn smart to work russ was modest through all this but seemed to be enjoying it only jeff was unusually quiet although he also had good news he had been moved up to varsity well said bud they say a man is rich to the degree his sons make him proud who says that dad said russ teasing the old man well i dont know who exactly it was maybe a russian maybe a greek and maybe i just made it up but if its true then im the goddamned richest man in oklahoma tonight well dad said russ maybe ill flunk out you wont flunk out no man who works as hard as you has a thing to worry about then you go on and go to work doing what you want and you have sons wholl make you just as proud as you two make me youall listen to your daddy said jen hes speaking the truth you boys have been a great thing for us made us so happy not a lick of trouble between the two of you thank the lord bud had more roast beef bud do you think we should order some champagne said jen i think these boys are man enough mom said jeff that stuff costs eighty dollars a bottle well jeff said bud your brother has just saved us about a hundred thousand dollars so i think we can spend eighty bucks jeff the domestic is fortytwo fifty jen said you can buy it in a liquor store for about fourteen dollars a bottle jeff added bud called the waiter over and ordered a bottle of champagne slightly shamed by jeff into choosing the domestic one when it came he ordered it poured for the whole family then dramatically he said and heres to russ and all the hard work hes done they all lifted their sparkling glasses and drank but bud only let the stuff touch his lips and did not swallow here let me pour some more he said giving each a half glass more until it was all gone the boys and jen finished the champagne and then it was time to go bud looked at his watch about ten he called for the check and paid it with his visa card without wincing though it was about forty dollars more than he had expected still except for jeffs strange sullenness it had been a wonderful evening is it the last he wondered am i about to do some fool thing and move into a little house near the airport with a young woman bud what you were talking to yourself i must be going crazy they drove in jens station wagon through lawtons quiet streets and pulled in the driveway about tenthirty dad do you mind if i go over to nick sisleys asked russ hes having a party no fine but dont be home late isnt that right jen thats fine how about you jeff you have any plans i think ill go over to charlies he said when the boys had disappeared she said to bud and i see youre going out too oh you didnt drink any champagne i may go have to make some phone calls first bud whats going on oh got me just the tiniest idea that might lead us to lamar probably nothing just want to check it out tonight cant it wait jen its nothing im just going over to the tribal police department over at the comanche complex i just want to ask some questions is all she fixed him with her harshest stare as if shed never heard of such a thing in her life then disillusionment crept across her features and utterly defeated she went upstairs he heard her wheezing disappointment he watched her go feeling as though he ought to say something but no words arrived at his lips and she just turned into the bedroom and closed the door lawton was two towns it was a churchgoing tree shaded small oklahoma city with wooden houses nestled on streets that andy hardy would have been proud to call home where every third block sported a park or a school or a church a town where all life coagulated toward the central mall and the county seat for comanche county and it was a soldiers town jammed up with pawn shops and girlie bars and porn stores from fort sill boulevard around to cache road and out cache road for a mile or two the fort sill boulevard strip just beyond gate no was hopping tonight cars jammed its narrow way and it blazed with neon young artillerymen freed from the days duty of delivering their mm packages into the mountains their ears booming still their heads aswarm with the computations necessary to send the shell in the right direction wandered in packs up and down it looking for diversion this usually involved fleshly appetites and there were places on the strip where for an honest hundred bucks a man could get a good drunk with a good blow job thrown in for good measure in others two hundred could be spent with no blow job to be had anywhere on the premises you had to know where you went but among the girlie joints and the mailbox usas and the porn shops and the pawn shops there was to be found now and then a tattoo joint skin fantasy was the title of one the flesh house another skin art still another little burma art house the rainbow biceps and on and on it was crowded as it always was in the hours approaching midnight and the toyota crawled along through the traffic you sure this is safe said richard sure it is said lamar down here its mostly mps looking for drunken soldiers the city boys stay clear besides this cars been checked by the great bud pewtie him self and passed with flying colors theres nothing in the system on the car ruta beth drove through the traffic very carefully nudging an inch ahead at a time nobody paid them any attention mostly it was cars full of soldiers looking for a place to light hows that look richard lamar asked the place was called tats with a gaudy neon sign on it and underneath it said best in the west and under that trained by the great sailor jerry collins of honolulu complete to liner and shading machines custom work available bikers welcome hey that looks like the kind of place huh richard said lamar it looks promising well go check it out son gulping richard got out of the car and went into the small shop two semi human forms lounged behind a counter and on the walls were hundreds and hundreds of little designs of the two the one that appeared to be the woman watched him most closely the other was completely zoned the odor of disinfectant hung in the air ah hello said richard the woman looked at him up and down squinteyed she must have weighed pounds and wore a cutoff biker denim shirt her huge arms bulged from them and were inked from top to bottom in webbed darkness with jots of color here and there when she lifted her face to him he saw the tattooing extended from her shirt up her neck to her chin he turned and looked at the other morose character he was equally gaudy but what richard first took to be skin disease was actually a rather elaborate spiderweb that covered half his face he wore a leather vest exposing a whole blue museum on every square inch of his cellulite but the best touch was the gold pin that pierced his nipple an involuntary shiver glided through richard hep sport hep help she meant ah yeah he said trying to sound tough was thinking of a piece chest multicolored private design customlike you mean yes maam dont do much custom more a west coast thang movie stars these goddamn soldier boys just want i luv mama pricked on ah its not for me for a friend let me show you the design richard walked over to the counter and unfolded the lion rampant and the beautiful woman and the castle sheeit said the woman rufe you touch that rufe came out of his stupor bending to see glory he finally said thats a twothousanddollar custom tattoo take me best part of a week could you get it richard asked the subtlety the line running down from his mane to his body to his paws the way it captures his tension and strength the neck look how coiled and alive the neck is also the loft in the womans breasts see how elastic and alive they are we dont want tracing we dont want a dead line we want something vibrant can you do it sure he could you could do it cunt you rufe but rufe bent over and studied very carefully then he said jamie show him the crucifixion she turned and bent and pulled her blue denim shirt up what richard saw on her broad back was indeed the crucifixion only it was a handsome biker being crucified etched there in the flesh in vivid blues and reds surrounded by state troopers in the roles of roman centurions richard could hardly keep a straight face pretty goddamned great aint it said the woman its a goddamned masterpiece said rufe its something said richard meaning it differently than rufe and the woman took it but as he looked at it carefully he saw that it wasnt quite what he had in mind what the piece had in drama and detail it certainly lacked in subtlety of line the figures all had a stiffness through them and they all stood at the same angle the faces were identical it was like a drawing by a sick crazy boy high on amphetamines and inner sadomasochistic fantasies of penetration and blood but lacking entirely any grace or sense of life its just not what were interested in sorry he said id do it for fifteen hundred rufe said just like that picture you showed me every last line and detail aint nobody can do work like that around here but me if hes the best thought richard okay well maybe so said richard still its a little you wont be offended tell me im a man i can take it its a bit stiff the person on whom youd be working he wouldnt want it stiff it would upset him and when he gets upset things happen take it from me you dont need this job okay your money your skin whos the best the very best its worth twenty bucks for the time itll save me he pushed the bill across the counter well said rufe truth is the big actions dried up and left lawton its mostly a west coast thing butwell theres one guy left around here he dont work much but i have to say hes a goddamn genius done it his whole life whats his name jimmy ky hes a good fella born in saigon started in the orient where its an art see the spider on my face had that done in sixtyfive in tokyo by the great horimono he leaned forward see how much lighter it is them boys got the touch i must admit jimmy ky studied under horimono hes got the touch himself if hell work on you oh hell work on this guy wheres his place it was bingo night high stakes bingo the sign said lighting up the night sky the bingo palace was the largest and most vivid building in the comanche tribal complex off highway where an obliging u government had constructed a quartet of sleek structures for people who cared very little for such things the parking lot was jammed and in the windows of the palace bud could see a full house of farmers and city folks bending over their cards while gaudily costumed squaws and braves walked among them selling new cards cokes bags of peanuts and the like okay folks came a voice booming over the pa that even bud could hear out in the dark we have an i everybody and remember you win on two cards you win four times the jackpot but bud turned from that spectacle and instead walked through the dark to a lower building a hundred yards away he tried not to notice the high unkempt grass or the beer cans and coke bottles that lay in it and he tried not to notice the graffiti defacing the nice new buildings comanches once dog soldiers the most feared of the plains indians a magnificent people ride a week on pemmican fight and win a major cavalry engagement against numerically superior and betterequipped foes then ride another week on pemmican now they tended their gambling franchise and watched their customs crumble as their young people were lured away to the cities bud shook his head he reached his destination which bore the designation comanche tribal police and slipped into what could have been any smalltown cop shop a dingy governmentgreen holding room with a sergeant behind a desk and two or three patrolmen lounging at their desks all of them wore jeans and baseball hats and carried sigsauers in shoulder holsters they were lean tough young men none too friendly howdy he said to the sergeant names pewtie oklahoma highway patrol he showed the badge im looking for a lieutenant called jack antelope runs he around oh you state boys you always come by when you got a crime to solve and you cant solve it gotta be an indian dont it said the sergeant as a matter of fact it dont said bud its gotta be a piece of white trash man killer that makes the average brave look like your minnie mouse but i got a matter jack might be able to help me on thats all right sarge said antelope runs from an office dont you give bud no hard time for a dirty white boy hes not as bad as some i could name howdy bud jack aint you looking swell these days jack antelope runs had a cascade of raven black hair running fiercely free and was wearing a little bolo tie that made the thickness of his neck and the boldness of his face seem even more exaggerated he was a huge man approximately pounds and his eyes beamed black fire come on in bud glad you still walking among the palefaces brother and not with the wind spirits well old goddamned lamar pye tried to show me the way to the wind ill tell you bud walked in and sat down so whats it all about bud is this a lamar thang yes it is i figured a gary cooper boy like youd take it personal now jack it isnt that way no sir i just had an idea i wanted to talk to you about so talk brother talk i seem to remember a circular some months back isnt there a big indian gang making a move to take over narco from the bikers seems i been bulletinized on that item a few times in the past few months they call themselves ndnz said jack mean and nasty boys yes sir started up in prison you put our brothers in white prisons and sure enough they going to start up their own gang to stand against the niggers and the mexicans and the white boys its another thing were guilty of yes it is said bud it aint strictly a comanche thing though some of our young men have done the dying but its run mainly by cherokees you might talk to larry eagletalon at the cherokee tribal complex hes now actually i aint interested in the gang except you think maybe lamar might be profiting from native american hospitality in some jerky tribal backwater no its not even that one of the hallmarks of ndnz as i recall is a really and truly fine ceremonial tattoo around the left biceps no yes why yes it is now sir i got me a funny feeling whoevers doing that work is a real fine tattoo boy maybe the best in these parts the ndnz braves wouldnt have any less thats what cocaine money buys these days fast cars white women bold tattoos yes sir now suppose lamar wanted such a fine tattoo whered he go to those goddamned scum joints on fort sill boulevard catch hepatitis b in them places it dont sound like a lamar but you never can tell but he wants the best and isnt the boy doing this work the best so its said whered such a boy be found hmmm said jack antelope runs i just want to check it out see if lamar been around maybe thats another step maybe we stake out lamar shows up our swat boys are there and lamar goes into the body bag no one has to know any information came from the comanche tribal police bud for a white boy maybe you aint so dumb im just a working cop antelope runs thought a minute and then finally said you know what happens to me if i start giving up indian secrets to white men the ndnz boys leave me in a ditch and nobody comes to my funeral and nobody takes care of my widow and my seven little kids i hear what youre saying ill ask around but thats all i can give you understand i guess i do jack i just hope lamar doesnt decide to stick up your high stakes bingo game next he could send a lot of boys to wander among the wind spirits i hear you yes i do but its a whitered thing i cant change that you cant change that okay i see i been wasting your time here bud give you a card let me write my home phone in case something comes up and you have to get in touch it aint but jack antelope runs scrawled something and handed it over to bud who took it and sullenly walked out he felt the laughter of the boys in the squad room as he left another white boy bites the dust in the parking lot he heard n n last call n he got into his car feeling old another wasted trip then he looked on the card and at jack antelope runs writing it said jimmy ky rt indiahoma it looked deserted the neon was out but if you pulled up you could see that if lit the sign would have readunder three or four chinese letterstattoo key youd have to know where to look though the parking lot was deserted and the place was way out on route near indiahoma it was a clapboard shack by the roadside across from a deserted gas station nobodys home said richard well have to come back i think tonights the night come on richard yall wait here while we take us a lookiesee lamar got out and bent to check his richard heard mysterious clickings then lamar walked up to the door and knocked hard time passed the wind whistled through the high grass out back above the stars seemed to fizzle and pop like silent fireworksthe sky was the record of a huge explosion violence was everywhere or at least the hint of it there wasnt a sound to be heard anywhere in the universe except for the persistence of the wind eventually definite shuckings and shiftings were heard and deep inside the house a light came on the door opened a crack go away somebody whispered we closed the door slammed shut but lamar caught it perfectly with the flat of his foot his full force behind it and knocked it back open in reddish light there stood a scrawny asian about sixty he looked mottled as if suffering from some skin disease you jimmy ky lamar demanded jimmy ky no here no more he go away go far away i jimmy kys father my ass said lamar youre jimmy ky got a goddamn proposition for you lamar stepped inside and richard followed i heard you the best said lamar well i want the best the asian looked at him betraying no fear richard now saw that the mottling on his face was tattooing but of a sort hed never imagined it was lustrous dark vivid incredibly detailed and ominous the old man was dark blue and red his face gone in a kaleidoscope you do that yourself my master horimono well its pretty goddamned good you that good lamars aggression filled the air he was like the lion confronting a goat but the goat was strangely unafraid the old man just looked at lamar without much emotional investment i his apprentice still he finally said show him richard richard gave him the drawing of the lion jimmy ky looked at it for a long moment its shit he said why you want this trash go town lots of people in town do this trash no no said richard thats just from your asian perspective this is done from the western perspective and its stylized in a different method it has to look western it cant have that exotic i can do best make it roar but it trash said jimmy ky bluntly it aint trash said lamar look at the way he got the fire and the pride of that lion look at that bull neck thats a goddamned piece of art we got money how much how much you need ah for that fortyfive hundred dollars you wan you pay four thousand bucks aint no tattoo worth that kind of money jimmy ky looked at him shrewdly how bad you want it mister you no want it you go away now i go back to sleep goddamn said lamar seems like a robbery gotta pay for the best said the old man shit said lamar how long maybe twelve hours start now be done tomorrow afternoon then you go lie down for about a week get drunk infection set in lots of pain you got want it for every color you suffer fever sweats lots of agony no fun at all how bad you want it shit said lamar i can get through any goddamned thing he turned to richard you and ruta beth you park across the street at that gas station out of sight you stay there as backup you tell odell to come on in hes working shotgun got that yes lamar okay old man lets get to work you make me a lion okay hokay joe can do the old man actually seemed happy bud missed it the first time there were no lights on it was just a deserted clapboard shack on the way to indiahoma on a bleak stretch of highway but when hed gone on into indiahoma he realized hed gone too far he turned around and headed back he seemed to course through inky darkness the roast beef in his stomach hadnt settled yet he was half a minute from pulling that goddamned out from under his belt buckle where it had grown into a massive problem what on earth did he need three guns for two was enough for any man but then he saw it standing stark against the bleak prairie under some runty trees he pulled halfway into the parking lot gave it a once over it seemed completely quiet and abandoned there were no cars in the parking lot and he could see a neon sign that wasnt on but up near the edge of one window he could make out just a sliver of light what the hell he thought feeling ridiculous ive come this far i may as well go all the way so the evening wont be a total loss richard looked at ruta beth in the low light he could hear her breathe see the darkness in her eyes he actually felt pity move through him imagine a child like that coming upon the murder of her parents how are you doing ruta beth he asked she fixed him with a narrow glare what the hell do you care he felt her pain ruta beth i know how hard life can be sometimes i was thinking how if you ever needed anyone to talk to why id be ready and will she recoiled you aint got no romance in mind ah ruta beth why she drew back her little fist knotted into a clot you put your hands on me richard and i swear you will be sucking teeth for a month and that before lamar gits done with you ruta beth i only meant shut up she hissed a truck pulled into the parking lot across the way a man in it waited for a second then got out and just stood there can you see big guy cowboy hat thats all a cop i dont know not in uniform do they have plainclothes detectives way the hell out here i dont know said richard who had no idea i doubt it said ruta beth to herself mainly since she expected no sensible answer from richard maybe if he come from the city but he come from the other direction from indiahoma hes probably some big goddamn brave in a big truck the government bought for him just out for a cruise a chief or some such shit why would he stop here maybe he knows jimmy ky he aint a cop said ruta beth how could a cop have found this place coincidences like this dont happen in the universe not no how they watched as the big man went up toward the house it wasnt the pain pain didnt frighten lamar it was the helplessness and the pain he lay flat on his back under a big light his chest had been shaved and scrubbed with astringent until it stung now what he saw was so weird in the back room he saw a oneeyed giant thats what it looked like at any rate really it was only the old slope bent over him with the needle his eye swollen huge and bloodshot by the lens it wore it was an operation for now the surgeons latex gloves were slippery with blood you gotta lotta blood in you the doctor laughed it connected with something somewhere in lamars previous life but he couldnt say what or when the only reality was the needle it hummed and tapped as jimmy ky leaned over and worked it not a big pain like the thrust of a blade or the channeling of a bullet but a sharp brief flash of explosion on his body enough to make him jump or leap each time no move goddamn make you look like kitty cat not lion lamar tried to ride it eleven more hours of this shit and this wasnt even the bad stuff this was the easy part doing the base colors the larger shapes the hard work would come later when the little man got down to details and moved in with the tiniest of needles for the little drips of color that gave the piece life and he was a careful craftsman unmoved by the pain he caused his subject he never looked hard at lamar but only at the design lamar was afraid to breathe he took strength from one thing and one thing alone his cousin odell baby odell sitting with the implacable patience and loyalty of the retarded watching and waiting and playing sentry at the door to the back room it was so goddamn dark ruta beth couldnt see a thing the truck was just a truck the man just a man standing there as if deciding when he finally moved he walked toward the door and there was something familiar in the gait where did she recognize it from hhes going in came richards singsongy voice what should we do shut up she barked but herself thinking what should i do she watched as the man approached the door paused again adjusted his hat as if he were stepping into a fancy restaurant he was a big guy well packed with bulk and girth but no damned youngster something familiar to him goddammit she reached under the car seat and pulled out her ski mask she pulled it over her face feeling the scratch of wool the stink of her own sweat its warmth its closeness her mouth tasted like pennies its nothing said richard wanly hes just a cowboy he wants to get tattooed hes some oilfield hand he wants i love susieq on his biceps thats all shut up you pussy boy she said she slid lamars cut down browning gauge semiauto from the back seat pushing the safety off her hands flew to her waist where shed tucked lamars sig its all right said richard please make it be all right the man stepped in closed the door behind him there was a glorious blessed moment of silence whew said richard its all then the sound of shots lots of them fast and wild and from where they sat they could see the gun flashes illuminate the darkness of the tattoo house odell stirred into action yanking a shotgun from somewhere but without willing it bud had drawn his colt commander from the high hip holster and hit the thumb safety and he and odell fired almost simultaneously the flash from the gun muzzles filled the room with incandescence the snakes seethed and pounced in its blinding whiteness bud was not hit and did not know if he had hit odellhe doubted it as he had pointed not aimed and had fired with one handand without a conscious thought anywhere in his head he jacked the trigger seven more times pumping s at odell in a burst that sounded like a tommy gun and like a tommy gun it was evidently inaccurate for bud saw clouds of plaster flying large chunks of masonry ripped up the flashes blotting details from his vision then the gun came up dry bud cursing for only an idiot shoots a gun empty without counting shots to reload with one in the spout and less vulnerability he dived into the room ripping a fresh mag off the pouch on his belt slamming it home and thumbing off the slide release to prime the pistol once again he came to rest behind a counter that now atomized into shreds before his very eyes he saw the glass liquify as buckshot pulverized it and the stuff blew into his face knocking him back blinking but he felt no pain and in response fired three fast times at the gun flash receiving on the middle shot the impression of a yowl odell had disappeared smoke hung in the air there was a moment of silence then a small blue asian man came crashing from the open doorway bud tracked and nearly fired at him but didnt and instead redirected himself toward the opening itself to see the low hunched form of lamar pye bent in a combat crouch good twohand hold but apparently unable to see bud bud couldnt see his sights it was so dark so he just put the back of the pistol against what little he could see of lamar and fired three more times fast reloading his last mag with one shot left in the chamber just as he knew he should he also understood that in firing hed given away his position if lamar wasnt hit mortally hed return fire in just a second so bud slithered to his left coming hard against a wall then backed spastically until he found what appeared to be a door and slipped back into it flashes lit the darkness both lamar and odell fired odell obviously not dead at all maybe not even hit and the counter behind which bud had cowered simply evaporated as lamars s and odells buckshot remodeled it he heard lamars pistol lock back dry and another sound hollow like someone blowing in a wandseemed to suggest that odell was reloading as well he could see no part of lamar but he put the pistol before him in that segment of darkness out of which had sprung odells bursts and convinced he saw a shape squeezed off what he meant to be but two or three shots but in shooting he banished the sudden demons of fear that had come from nowhere to tell him what a fool hed been how hed walked in here without backup without even a radio and so he could not stop shooting until the gun was empty again he thought he heard a cry as he dumped the colt and his hand sped to and ripped his big new beretta from the shoulder holster waharrrrr waharrrrr came a gurgling cry from the dark it was odell his voice veined with hurt goddamn it boy you stay put cried lamar in return equally anguished who the fuck are you mister what the hell you aint no cop we dont mean you no goddamned harm bud was silent all he had to do was open his mouth and lamar would have a source of noise for him to bring fire on wahharrrrrrrr mama wahmarrrrrrrrrr pweezze mama odell you stay down daddy come git you in a bit wheres that goddamn car a car more of them the criminals had backup the cop didnt shit bud thought who the fuck was he where had he come from why was it happening like this lamar hurt every damn place and he felt so goddamned naked his shirt off blood all over his chest but what had him worried was odell odell sounded hit bad hed never heard that tone in the boys voice it was so pitiful so animal odell hurting it just filled lamar with rage if only he could clear his mind and think or if only that goddamned ruta beth would get here where the hell was she wharrr came odells quavery voice you shut up odell we be out of here in a jif he called back he had one goddamn magazine left hed fired the other two seven s where was goddamn ruta beth his breath came in wracking sobs the room was so dark he could see nothing lamar looked about how stupid that he was in the light and his enemy in the dark kind of goddamned mistake that could get you killed he slipped back in the room jumped up and with a light tap of his gun muzzle shattered the huge light over the table the space plunged into darkness how long had it been maybe thirty seconds where was goddamn ruta beth he slid back to the door edging out he could see nothing the guy was somewhere in the back of the shop amid the destroyed counters that had just exploded as odells buckshot had blasted them but where had he found cover was he dead himself already lamar couldnt see a thing and he could hear nothing over odells labored breathing lamar tried to clear his head the main thing was to get out fuck this boy let him live or die but get out go back to the farm and regroup he wondered if the sounds had carried all that gunfire in the little room in so short a time the stink of gunpowder in the air oh who are you you motherfucker who are you goddammit lamar bellowed to silence smart boy wasnt making a move wharr came odells wet voice then mama see mama yes hed promised hed take baby odell to his mothers grave and hed never made good on it how could he with all the goddamned cops in the world on his ass then as his eyes adjusted to the dark lamar noticed something there just ahead of his eyes light switches turn on the lights lamar put this motherfucker in the lights and kill him marrrrr whispered baby odell bud was squashed so low to the floor he could hardly move the darkness was absolute he could hear odell moaning and breathing harshly but since lamar had turned out the lights nothing from him he tried to gauge where the door back to the tattooing room had been thats where lamar would be right now waiting for him to make a sound or would he maybe lamar was creeping toward him even now to get close and cut open his windpipe no hed make noise moving across all that glass on the floor theres no noise only the wheezing and moaning of odell maybe theyre just waiting for their pals suddenly the lights came on bud blinked as his eyes filled with dazzle a shot cracked out from the nowvisible lamar but it hit a shard of wood blown loose from the counter and danced away all bud could see was that big gun in lamars hands not part of lamar but only the gun the longslide gripped tightly time seemed to slow down as if it were an accordion slowly being stretched bud thought front sight and fired lamars hand exploded in a burst of pink mist and the fell away lamar slipped and fell unarmed fear on his face front sight bud thought he tried to take his time that is to shoot in twotenths of a second rather than onetenth placing the front sight on lamars face now distended and swollen with fear as lamar lay helpless before buds gun sights baby dell hurt so red juicy wet mushy everywhere hurty clicky boom go arm boom go chest boom go tummy boom boom boom marrrrr mar cry no mar bad man hurt mar no bad man no hurt mar mar babys friend no man bad man hurt bad man as bud fired the world around him suddenly lost its stability as a cloud of dust showered down upon him he ducked feeling a terrible sting in his leg and turned odell stood behind the counter part of his jaw had been blown away bud could see tiny teeth the tongue squirming like a mouse his eyes were wild and insane he held the shotgun that hed just fired at bud in one hand as the other was useless soaked in blood that ran in torrents from a high chest hit odell pulled the trigger again but nothing happened he started to walk toward bud raising the shotgun like a club bud fired six times aiming at center mass each shot tore a hole in odell and more blood spurted wetly down his shirt but still he came bud fired seven more times the mm hollowpoints punching at odell who halted went to his knees and with a look of utter agony climbed back to his feet odeeeeeel he could hear lamar shout bud aimed at the forehead and blew a big chunk of it out he aimed at the eye and blew a blue hole just beneath it he aimed at the throat and tore it open the beretta locked dry odell was on him that huge weight the rancid breath blood spraying from the ruined mouth the sound of breathing labored and wet and desperate like an animals odells big hands were on buds neck but the medium of their grappling was liquid blood was everywhere slippery and almost comical as bud squirmed for purchase under the huge man then he remembered his belly gun bud got the out from his shirt not even remembering pulling it and stuck it under odells armpit and squeezed the trigger he fired and fired until at last odell slumped against him slack bud pulled himself out and stood lamar had climbed to his feet he held his left hand in his right another bouquet of roses that was blood you said lamar you goddamned bud pewtie you done killed a baby bud aimed at lamars headamazed and impressed that lamar didnt flinch or cower so intense was his hateand pulled the trigger the gun didnt fire he looked at it hed shot it empty against odells bulk in the next instant a huge billow of dust flew into the room and the thunder of collision mixed with the roar of an automobile engine a car literally stove through the front of the shop blasting glass and wood everywhere in the drivers seat a figure in a black hood leveled a shotgun at bud who dropped just a fraction of a second before the gun fired he felt the sting of another pellet this one lodging in his scalp bud thrust himself backward down the stairwell felt himself float in darkness and then hit the steps with the sensation of a beating delivered by six cons which took the breath out of him and filled his eyes with stars he rolled over and slithered deep into the darkness totally animal now intent only on escape but no one followed him down the steps instead he heard the roar of the car as it backed out presumably with lamar now aboard and then howled away bud listened to the sudden silence he felt chilled and missed his sons he wasnt sure if hed done right or wrong he yearned to call jen or holly or have his old life back he began to shiver richard had never heard anyone howl in such pure animal pain before aaaaaaah lamar cried bucking and sobbing in the back seat holding his crippled and bloody hand there was blood everywhere all over the seats on the sideboards everywhere meanwhile curled in total concentration her face grim and unyielding ruta beth drove mindlessly onward slow down goddammit yelled lamar once through his pain when he thought she was going too fast but if they expected squad cars rushing their way the howl of sirens ambulances helicopters whatever it didnt happen they drove on through darkness weve got to find him help said richard hell bleed to death again through his pain lamar screamed out you shut up richard goddammit it aint bleeding no more its only pain i kin git through pain ruta beth you git us home you hear hell bleed to death shrieked richard it is bleeding shut up richard said ruta beth let daddy decide lamar tried to lie still but the pain was intense should we dump the car lamar asked richard maybe they have a description and what then you moron theyll find it and trace it and beat us to the farm i dont think that sonofabitch got a good lookiesee he was so goddamned busy jumping down those goddamned stairs he didnt have no time to get no read on the license plate tell you that oh a sudden spurt of pain seemed to jack through him he tensed and wailed it seemed to come like that in spurts or when they took a corner and the centrifugal force spun blood toward his wound and the pain flamed again daddy you sure youre all right just drive goddamn it ruta beth wheren the hell was you wes in there shooting it out with that johnny for a hour before you came in whynt you jump him in the goddamn lot lamar baby we didnt know he was a cop he looked like a cowboy in a pickup truck thats all then all hells breakin loose and richard and i are trying to figure out what the hell to do so i just finally goose her figuring any other way either you or he shoots us as we come through the doorway couldnt a been more than a minute felt like a goddamn day oh that fucker was good shoots me in the goddamned hand there was a silence then ruta beth said what about the baby the baby is dead that goddamned smokey must have hit him fifty goddamned times i never saw a boy soak up so much lead and keep agoing goddamn odell he was a man odell wasawwwwwwww a spark of pain erupted somewhere inside him then he was quiet ruta beth began to cry poor odell she said he never meant no harm to nobody if the world had left him alone heda left it alone oh thats so sad he never got to see his mamas grave neither oh lamar oh daddy thats so wrong what they done to him richard just looked out at the dark oklahoma country side as it flowed by more emptiness than hed ever seen before in his life how that fucker got there thats what i want to know how did he know wed be there maybe it was just bad luck said richard no luck is that bad richard it was that goddamned bud pewtie that trooper sergeant fuck has more lives on him than a goddamn black cat i blowed him away twice at that farm and still he man tracks me down that fucker howd he do it howd he know he some kind of dick tracy or something is he goddamn columbo is he the pink panther what the fuck howd he know the question hung in the silence lamar lay back rocking gently then he sat back up only one goddamned way a cop know anything these days someone drops a fucking dime to buy some time off you got that gun richard that heavy one yes i do lamar well give her here awkwardly richard handed it to lamar who sat up in the seat to take it he cocked it and pointed it at richards head god lamar you you sure you aint been talking to anybody boy you sure i ought to blow your head off just to be sure please lamar oh please please i swear to you when would i how could i i didnt even know wed end up there who knew you wait the papers will say why hes there ahh it aint that you dont have the guts to betray me lamar said he uncocked the smith and chucked it on the seat then he lay back again goddamn it hurts he said oh christ it hurts so bad that goddamned bud pewtie bud had no sense of time he hid in the basement for what felt like hours and hours his scalp wound began to sting unbearably and would not go away but at the same time his leg wound throbbed the second was somehow a deeper and more troubling pain at one point he touched his face and realized it had been ripped to shreds the vision in one eye was blurred as if he had a stone the size of a cinder block in it his mind blacked out into shock but he never really lost consciousness he remembered the last camping trip in the wichita mountain preserve it would have been about it was the last time they were really a family russ was a freshman and little jeff would have been in the seventh grade already having troubles grades that just werent happening and serious selfdoubts bud remembered wishing he could reach the boy cut through whatever ailed him could put his hands on him and say hey itll be all right bud lost himself in this world for quite a bit he remembered how green the world had seemed up there how pure they camped in a nimrod that hed pulled behind his truck high up on a ridge with much of the state spread out before him and the air so clean it almost ached to breathe it in hed been so happy theyd loved each other so much even if no one had said a thing about it he remembered the shouts of the kids and jens pleasure in being out of the house and the sense of the world being forgiving and wide with possibility then he saw the light the beam caught him and he blinked behind it he made out crouched shapes the weaver position shooting arm straight support arm locked underneath the posture somewhat bending the body shape dont you twitch mister goddammit show me your hands i dont think i can move em you better move em goddammit bud brought his hands into the light who are you sergeant bud pewtie oklahoma highway patrol ive been hit you got a shield yes sir dont you do nothing tricky now with that gun im going to reach in my pocket and get my shield out im unarmed i mean my guns are all upstairs you got medics on the way the whole world is on the way thats goddamned odell pye lying up there with a mess of holes in him he took some killing ill say said bud getting the badge out opening the folio to show it another light came on from the top of the steps bud jesus christ aint you a sight hes one of ours sheriff medic medic get them medics down here we got an officer down goddammit asap get em down here now the trooper came to him first and asked him where he was hit but in seconds two medics had arrived they gave him the quick onceover and determined that he hadnt taken any solid lifethreatening hits but you sure are cut to hell and gone one of them said and bud thought he recognized the man from various turnpike accidents looks like you got a face full of glass slivers and goddamn i can see something stuck under your skin up top your head thats the one that hurts boy ill bet she do trooper goddamn ill bet she do the medics got him on a stretcher and a team of sheriffs deputies and troopers labored to get him up the stairs out of the cellar he was pulled into a jubilee of lights more cars and trucks were arriving even as they wheeled his gantry toward the ambulance and now a van of fbi agents pulled up a tv truck had already shown hold on somebody said you pewtie yes sir said bud lon perry sheriff jackson county trooper i cant have you boys turning my county into a goddamned shooting gallery when some goddamned undercover op goes deaddick on youpecially since you aint even had the goddamned courtesy to tell me yous working my territory youre out of line sheriff a trooper sergeant barked hes hurt he just got the second most wanted man in the state and probably put a goddamned hole in the first most wanted and no citizen even got scratched you back off there were heated words but soon another man came over and separated the warring sides it was colonel supenski looking like hed just been dragged out of bed goddamn bud you get around dont you bud didnt feel much like answering any questions he just said what the hell took everybody so long to get here we had us a goddamned world war nobody called it in not a goddamned soul bud nobody to call it in jimmy ky crawled out of the bushes after lamar and pals departed waited ten minutes tried to call found out the goddamned car had torn out the phone lines and walked two miles into town to tell the sheriffs department lamar goddamn his soul got away damn said bud i know i hit him i seen blood i seen him drop his piece i hurt him bad that you did bud wilie bring em here bud take a look at your trophies a highway patrol technician came over with a plastic bag it seemed to contain two grisly pickles each somewhat tattered at one end what the hell are those bud wanted to know lamars fingers his last and secondtolast left hand digits you shot his fingers off bud you killed his cousin you stopped his tattoo and you shot off two fingers say you done a hell of a nights work bud chapter in comanche memorial hospital a young doctor and two nurses bent over bud in the emergency room operating theater and picked pieces of glass out of his face for nearly two hours during this time they also removed a ragged piece of bullet jacket from buds scalp where it had lodged just under the skin and a doubleought buckshot pellet that had drilled into the meat of his left calf that was the nasty one it hurt like a sonofabitch the painkillers they gave him helped some but nothing could blunt the force of the pain of a foreign missile blown deep into the muscle tissue by the time the first team was done an ophthalmologic surgeon had arrived by helicopter from tulsa to work on his blurry eye this gentleman probed for several minutes and then removed a particularly gruesome glass sliver from in side his left orbit where it had sunk into the subcutaneous tissue just under the orb itself he held it out for bud to see it looked like a blade of pure glass a vivid little knife youre lucky sergeant a millimeter to the right and you might have lost your vision permanently im going to prescribe antibiotics and give you an eyepatch but in a few days your vision will return to normal thank you doctor no thank you its an honor to work on a man as brave as you and he went on with some blahblah about bud being a hero but bud didnt feel like a hero it wasnt a thing of heroes it had no heroics to it that was for the movies where things happened clearly you could follow them they made sense the cleverness was apparent this was just a mad scramble like cats in a bag fighting luck happening or not happening no strength no cunning just the blind happenstance of where so many bullets happened to end up and knowing that he had to think you could have done better it was true if hed just taken a look through the window and made out who jimmy ky was decorating he could have gotten to a phone and called for backup and all of them would be locked up or in the morgue not just poor dumb odell no one had directly confronted him yet except for the odd nods from the troopers on the scene had he done well someone once said if youre still alive at the end of a gunfight youve won but bud didnt quite buy it hed almost gotten lamar almost once the doctors were done and bud was washed and dried he was rolled to a private room there jen and jeff waited she came over and just touched him lightly on the arm she didnt look quite real because with the patch he had no stereoscopic vision she looked like a picture and she was haggard having been awakened from a sleep at nearly five in the morning with the sketchy news that once again her husband had been shot up fortunately the news soon followed that he wasnt hurt bad oh bud she said he smiled wanly feeling his dry lips crack oh bud she said again jeff stood aloof in the corner of the room wheres russ hes not coming she said he went up to the lake with his friends i didnt call him they said youd be all right thats good let him enjoy the princeton thing this aint nothing when is it going to end it has ended he said i swear it presently a nurse came along and shooed them out they had to wait in the hall he needed his rest he was still in danger of shock and hed need to be sharp the next day anyway but alone in the dark at last he couldnt rest he lay there unsettled he tried not to think about it images from the fight kept flashing back on him hed think he was done with it and then it would come back to him blown up and in slow motion the slack look on odells face in that first second goddamn must have beat him to the draw by just a fraction of an instant thats how goddamn close it was it made him almost physically sick hed drawn the colt and thumbwiped the safety off and fired at a speed that had no place in time but it was so easy to screw up a presentation like that suppose he hadnt gotten his grip right and hadnt depressed the grip safety or hed missed the safety with the thumb or hed missed the shot but goddamn hed put out the telling shot and it kept him fighting any single little muff in that complex of movements and he was a goner hed fired so much suppose hed held back on the shooting maybe if hed placed his shots better and aimed more he remembered aiming once at lamars big hands on the colt how the blood exploded from them on the hit the gun flying funny in a gunfight they say that you concentrate on your opponents weapon and that hand and arm wounds are the rule not the exception that was it exactly there it was such a close goddamn thing is what it added up to physical violence with guns at close range always involved the fantastic the unbelievable every shooting was a kennedy assassination in replica a twisted mess of events where everybody was operating in an ozone layer of stress and nothing made sense funny bud had done all that shooting and had all that shooting directed back at him and he couldnt remember hearing a single shot but his ears rang like somebody was beating on them with a bat he had no sense of how long it took either an hour more likely three minutes or two all that shooting so much shooting and how few bullets actually found targets even the great lamar hadnt shot very well so much for your gunfighter myth it was the flashes that haunted him when the guns fired they produced huge clouds of burning gas that in the dark blossomed like star bursts blinding and disorienting everybody maybe thats why in all the shooting so few rounds had gone home who could see in the middle of the fourth of july but those flashes cruelly flaring out in the dark each blindingly white and hot each a potential death sentence hed see them for the rest of his life he thought hed never be finished with them but mostly bud couldnt get odell out of his mind it was like something from some horror movie the way odell kept eating up the lead and coming for him hed seen the boys heart explode seen his throat blown out seen part of his brain fly away but still odell came like some robot or something outside of pain beyond death what kept him going what reserve of pure animal fury or maybe it wasnt fury maybe fury couldnt get you through something like that maybe it was love only person in the world poor odell cared about was lamar and by all reports lamar cared back just as hard that kept him going beyond the collapse of his nervous system finally finished him with the and suppose he hadnt had the belly gun conceivably dying odell had enough strength left to crush the life out of him goddamn that little gun sure was worth the money hed laid out for it the next morning a new doctor came in and gave him a once over and confirmed that he probably wasnt going to die at least not in the next thirty years and then one by one the boys in suits came in colonel supenski was there representing the state police as well as two highway patrol investigators and an investigator from the jackson county sheriffs department but lt henderson of the osbi was missing the chief questioner was a tough young states attorney how did he feel he felt fine was he up to it he was up to it did he want his own attorney present now hold on started the colonelstrictly a routine question in a case involving death by force said the states attorney that settled it began slowly bud told the story trying to leave nothing out of the leadup except the detail of jack antelope runs then the gunfight in excruciating detail did you warn them before shooting warn them i was trying to kill them strike that from the record goddammit said colonel supenski he didnt mean that did you mean that sergeant pewtie no sir i was merely trying to survive there wasnt no time for a warning i saw a weapon in the perpetrators hands and i established that he meant to harm me and so i opened fire it went on for several hours where hed been what he remembered where lamar and odell had been and so forth and so on bud had a curious moment here as a realization reached him you know for three weeks i been packing three guns and spare magazines for each i had fiftyeight rounds of ammunition which i been bitching about like a old lady goddamn if id had fiftynine lamar would be dead meat today the lawyers left about six the boss after conferring with the investigators gave him the good news i think you did a great job sergeant mr uckley agrees with me no state indictments youre in the clear thank you that left bud alone with the colonel okay bud said the boss whod been holding his piece for a long time i have to say this you got guts to burn and what you brought off is a masterpiece of police work were so very proud of you but bud i told you and its beginning to grate on methis aint a goddamned private war you aint a cowboy you understand me its modern times we work in teams now bud i cannot have a lone wolf operator working on some personal revenge agenda i catch you on lamars tail again by god ill prosecute you i could even git you on carrying a concealed weapon since by all lawful interpretation you were not duly authorized to carry under those circumstances as you were formally on medical leave yes sir but i can only repeat it aint personal i never want to see that sonofabitch again except when i testify against him you understand then that youre on official administrative leave you aint to be hanging around or going places where you might run into lamar you are formally relieved of police duties its routine it dont mean a thing but i do mean to see that you hew to that line yes sir thats fine i just want to go home is all all right ill believe you on that another thing i got the prelim on odell want to hear it yes you hit him thirtythree times bud four s thirteens and sixteen s and most of em were good solid torso hits you even hit him three times in the head the doc says the hollow tips opened up like they should there wasnt much of him left he took a basket of killing thats for sure bud shivered a bit now what you dont know isnt going to make you happy ive had a report from our press officer whos been watching the tv and seen the evening paper from oklahoma city the press people are all excited about you shooting lamars fingers off like its a joke or something like youre annie oakley anyboy tell em how common hand hits are in gunfights you can tell em anything you want but they only listen to what they already know from movies thats how it is but this stuff could make lamar mad we want to move you and your family to a safehouse oh lord its best bud i have a boy hitting four hundred and another about to graduate with honors i cant take them out of their high school its the time of their lives they cant never get it back the colonel looked at him well he finally said maybe ill just assign a fulltime shift on your home that be all right most preciated i guess a tough old coot like yourself can look after himself colonel can i ask you something sure bud what is it the pid man c d henderson wheres he well they done retired him he spent a lot of the states money and came up with nothing you got more from a drawing of a lion than he did from half a million dollars worth of overtime he had a bad drinking problem you know it was time i hope i go out better though than he did bitter old coot sad actually how ugly it became they kept bud three more nights and he got through them with his old pal the bottle of percodan at ten on the fourth morning he was released to jens care the two of them drove home in her station wagon his leg still throbbed and though he no longer wore the eyepatch the vision in the one eye was blurry moreover it felt like every square inch of his body had a bruise or a cut on it now youre supposed to take it easy aint any other way for me to take it plenty of naps going to jeffs games that sort of thing bud the seasons almost over hes only got tomorrow night oh well thats another thing i didnt do very well is it i didnt pay attention to jeff is that why hes so grumpy lately bud whats going on what you mean somethings going on you arent hardly there anymore there in the house even when youre there youre off somewheres else you never talk to any of us like youre saving your best stuff for somebody else a flower of rage blossomed in bud he was at his worst when jen was picking at his secrets but he just clamped up its just this lamar thing hell ive been in two gunfights had a partner killed been on the road into and out of hospitals and killed a man myself thats were i been no bud its something else ive been watching you for twentyfive years i know somethings going on you have to tell me bud was acutely uncomfortable here was the perfect chance he thought tell her work it out now civilized friendlylike it didnt have to be a mess with screams and accusations of betrayal and tears begin to discuss it with her tell her you met somebody you care about her its time to make the change itll be all right its a new chance for everybody but bud couldnt even begin to form the words it was inconceivable to him no he insisted things are fine just want to get rested up and read in the papers that they got lamar i swear to you her silence expanded to fill the air in the car and drive any other possibility out they got home and bud saw a state car parked out front been there long he asked yes two men from the osbi theres another car out back i asked them in but they said theyd stay in the car and keep a watch out do you think hed try anything against us lamar i dont know i doubt it if you say so well you cant predict but these boys out frontll prevent anything bad from happening bud waved at the twosullen youngsters under huge cowboy hats with hooded eyeswho nodded in return and went back to eyeballing the neighborhood bud went inhe had a moment of bliss walking in his own front door even if each step felt as if it pulled him through a bucket of glass still it felt good to survive a goddamned gunfight and come back to this and see that everything was just as it had been that jens sense of order had made certain that it was neat that it was still a house rank with the odor of boys he felt as if a weight had been lifted he went to the gun safe in the downstairs closet spun the dial and the thing opened up his guns gleaming in the low light three short of course lay in there he decided to get a shortbarreled shotgun out just in case removed it slid five gauge doubleoughts down its tube but didnt crank the slide to jack a round into the chamber he locked the door and laid the shotgun to rest against the wall honey i got a shotgun out you just have to throw the pump if it comes to it in the closet next to the safe okay bud wherere the papers in the living room im going to take them upstairs she didnt answer bud got them and took them upstairs he slid out of his boots took another percodan and lay back in his bedroom he read all about it saw himself referred to by name as a highway patrol undercover officernow there was a joke and read quotes by the colonel and halfadozen other officials on what a good job hed done there was a murky official photo of him generally the press business was pretty favorable it treated him as some kind of hero and none of them mentioned that he was the patrolman jumped by lamar and odell three months back that was good it didnt make it look like this revenge thing as everybody seemed to think it would maybe the stupid reporters were too dumb to put it together but more likely someone had said to them dont stroke this angle and for once theyd agreed but he didnt like the games they played with the story of the fingers they almost seemed to think it was funny that hed done it on purpose if hed been an expert shot one bullet would have killed odell not thirtythree and the second one would have killed lamar around one he fell asleep at three he awakened saw that a note from jen was on the bureau shed gone out on errands russ and jeff would be back late they wanted to go to the meers store tonight was it all right or should they stay in bud rolled over and dialed hollys number hi he said howre you oh bud they say youre a big hero bud youre famous oh itll go away believe me these buzzards forget as soon as they write something youre all right im fine i swear to you im done with the eyepatch but i have scabs on my face and a bandage on my leg where theres still swelling and some pain but i seem to be tougher than beef jerky lamar just cant git me dead i cant git him dead either bud when can i see you i want to be with you so bad i want to help you through this no help needed im fine honey i told youit just depends a day or two when the ruckus settles down you can wait cant you were so damned close bud youre going to do this arent you you keep putting me off but youre going to be with me i couldnt stand to lose you bud i just couldnt im so afraid youre going to change your mind and go running back to whats easiest bud had never promised hed leave he knew that he could not force himself to hed promised to consider it the distinction may have been slight but it was powerful in his mind it was the difference between adultery and blasphemy at the same time there was such eagerness and underneath such despair in hollys voice how could she love him so was she crazy what would happen when she saw him as jen saw hima largely immobile and inert chunk of solitude who didnt give much and took a lot and whose idea of a good time was to reload s for the fall it scared him a little he wasnt quite sure he trusted it but he didnt have it in him to hurt her well im working on it when them boys was shooting at me it was you i was thinking about seeing okay good bud i have to hear that holly soon i swear to you he hung up and got up he walked around the empty house feeling the ache in each step he looked out the window at the black osbi car with its two radio antennae and the slouchy young men he was once again at complete loose ends too agitated to sleep yet not really able to go anywhere he went downstairs and turned on the tv for the six oclock news to see if there was anything on lamar there wasnt the big news was the lamar cult it had struck again that night at the high school someone had painted ode ll was murdered in huge letters on the blank brick wall of the gymnasium and next to that lamar will be back chapter lamar thought he could get through anything the hand wound coagulated and scabbed over and no infection set in it only hurt hurt like the devil but pain was no problem and the disappointment that lamar felt when he looked at his unfinished chest with the outlines of a lion just barely sketched in rough and crude incomplete was palpable but a man whos spent most of his life in prison has trained himself at least to patience and so he knew that his disappointment too would vanish eventually as all things did the grief was something else lamar had not known grief in his violent thirtyeight years his father died on the highway before he himself had even been born so he never knew to miss him then there was his mother a wan and sickly woman without much in the way of personality who passed him around to aunts and cousins and whatnot he was in reform school when she died a drunkards death in a ditch with a bad man he felt nothing not even a stab of loneliness when odells mama camilla died when he and odell were on a straight eighteen month slide for aggravated assaultpleabargained down from second degree murderhe felt a twinge shed been the best woman hed ever known kind and gentle and she had so loved her baby odell though not quite enough to stop her husband from chaining him up in the barn and beating him with a razor strop lamar had stopped that himself but that was more a single moments passing like a cold breeze through his insides here it came there it went it was gone forever but now odell he didnt think it would ever stop hurting he thought of it as weight it took the form of a fat black cat that crawled upon his chest suffocating him he got the idea that if he ever lay down and went to sleep that cat would kill him he imagined it having mousy breath and a white blaze between yellow saucer eyes that never blinked but only looked on him with utter stillness and without interest but it wanted him dead it would creep up during the night warm and cuddly and just plant itself on his chest acquiring weight as the night passed until he clawed for air but by that goddamned time the cat weighed a ton and its purrs had the quality of a files gritty grasp squashing him down into the feathers until he was no more goddamn cat was all lamar would say as to why he no longer slept but instead roamed the farm at night striding grimly about on the rolling open prairie amid the craggy mesquite trees that seemed to be trying to claw the moon from the sky in black rage sometimes he ventured as far afield as across the highway into some farmers grazing lands where he walked madly between the cattle who soon grew accustomed to his presence as he walked he tried to reconstruct odell in his mind as if in doing so he could keep that boy out of the cold and lonely grave there had been something solid about odell he expected so little he was almost unstoppable in most kinds of battle he knew no fear or remorse he simply lived each moment then forgot it forever lamar had taken care of him for years he understood his cousins strange language full of twisted words and broken sentences he understood the subtleties of odells face which most people regarded as utterly impassive and blank not lamar he could read odells mood from the set of his mouth the raggedness of his breathing through that incomplete septum and the essential sweetness of his character for at heart in some way though he had done terrible things at lamars dark bidding odell had retained his innocence he simply had done what lamar said and taken no pleasure from it he had had no need to dominate or kill or steal he had only needed to be paid a little attention and be fed and that had lasted him to the end of his days but lamar had dragged him along made him a pale instrument of his own criminal will and had now gotten him killed no no he told himself you cant believe that you da gone on for years you and odell you thinking odell happily following if it werent for that goddamned bud pewtie the thought of pewtie recalled the gun flashes in the dark and that made him think of odell hit on the floor his baby voice keening in pain and hurt his mouth shot away so that his tiny store of words had been reduced to an animal howl wahrrrr and then when the lights came on he saw the blood all over odell and the way his jaw was smashed and hanging sections of bone blown out and a torrent of blood squirting out of it that must have been the very first shot the jaw shot the lucky jaw shot that changed the whole nature of the fight that bud pewtie seemed to have the pye number all right something about him made him special to the pyes lamar remembered turning with the shotgun after the had run dry at the stepford place and pumping one last shell into pewtie it was like his back exploded blood from a butchered pig a big flycatching puddle of it and the bastard wasnt even badly hurt flesh wounds from birdshot pretty goddamned suspicious and the second time a second time bud pewtie big as life and dumb as an elephant came walking onto ruta beths farm and was just ten feet away and all lamar had to do was jump across that space and bury the hatchet in the lawmans brain it would have been so easy they could have stashed him taken his truck and driven to new digs in new mexico or texas or california or some such but noplayed it safe and got poor odell blown away what haunted him most as it haunted bud was odells insane lumber across the tattoo shop while pewtie shot pieces off him he must have hit him two dozen times as lamar just stared his own hand blown to shit so that he could think of nothing you could just see the bullets tearing through odell blowing off pieces of bone and flesh like he was nothing still something in odell drove him onward while pewtie put them into him odell goddamn was he a lot of man he may have been a baby to the world but to lamar he was a man because he had truly given up his life for lamars a sacrifice that was all but unimaginable to lamar hed never seen anything like it in all his years of prison it just wasnt done when a mans time came it came that was all so lamar roamed the fields at night thinking these things over working himself deeper and deeper into a titanic rage one night it rained and the lightning flashed all around but lamar didnt care he went up on a ridge and stood in the pouring rain his shirt off the lightning bolts detonating like artillery shells all around him when they went off their illumination brought the world into sharp instantaneous relief he could see the farmhouse and the highway far away and the abutments against the horizon that were the wichitas but the flashes were like gun flashes and the thunderclaps like the sounds of guns he should see a doctor said richard hell get a fever and die or hell go insane out there in all that rain and lightning and do something crazy and take us with him you shut up now richard said ruta beth blinking as a particularly vivid flash filled the dark kitchen with sudden shadows daddys in pain hes in real pain he needs time to get a grip he needs a doctor you dont get two fingers shot off and not see a doctor what little you know richard i heard that back in fiftyfour my daddys brother cy lost a whole hand to a threshing machine and there wasnt no doctor in these here parts so they just wrapped him up tightern a drum and few days go by and hes up and spry as a weed its only goddamned city folks need a doctor ever time their nose git a little runny how long did cy live well he died the next year of a fever but that dont have nothing to do with it ruta beth i the door blew open rain whistled in and at that moment as if in a cheap movie a lightning flash illuminated the ravaged features of lamar his hair a mottled and wild mess his eyes crazed his muscles tensed and hard against the sting of the rain with just the faintest outline oh ion on his chest richard he commanded i want you to git your art stuff i want you to draw me a picture boy draw me a picture as if your life depended on it i got to see that picture or im going to die richard richard leaped up yes lamar tell me what it is i can draw it ill draw like i drew before you just tell me and ill do it richard i want to see baby odell happy in heaven hes sitting at the lords right hand hes playing with a cat a little kitty hes got a halo then on the lords other hand theres jesus and hes just as pleased as punch because his new buddy odell done joined him up yyes said richard thinking it seemed a little ambitious for his modest talents yeah but thats only in heaven thats going on up top down here on earth richard down here on earth that goddamned bud pewtie hes being burned you know what i mean hes on fire his flesh is burning in the everlasting fires of hell hes screaming for mercy but they aint none no mercy for him do you get that yes i do lamar and you youre in the picture hell yes boy said lamar im the one with the match richard drew as if he were the one on fire he knew it was an absurdity but in some way it satisfied him to reach out and at last help lamar if only in this crazy way he tried to remember the sistine chapel for it had that crazed scope to itheaven and earth reward and punishment the duality of existences a classical renaissance theme he of course was no michelangelo but he doubted if lamar knew who michelangelo was so he doubted his plagiarism would get him in much trouble thats how he envisioned itan insane whitetrash sistine chapel full of pure rage and the criminals need to dominate and hurt and at the same time full of a kind of innocence it would be a lunatic masterpiece a crackpot piece de resistance of the sort that is rare but does in fact existthe works of celine for example or mahler a horrible man or sam peckinpah that deranged maker of nihilistic cowboy movies whom some actually believed to be a very great artist it was as if he had been liberated his fingers flew and discovered new and interesting ideas as they plunged ahead each new line leading to yet another line in a mad scramble a helterskelter a kind of artistic release whatever lamar had done for him or to him he had now at last released richards inhibitions no thought of what was proper attended his brain no reluctance no phony patina of sophistication he let the work flow from his idor from lamars heaven was a mountaintop purple and swarming with clouds our lord was a benevolent biker king a daddy cool aslouch on the throne of his harley his powerful features radiating justice and serenity at his left foot was his only son jesus as road captain his leathers glistening his narrow ascetic face made more prominent by a ponytail that hung down from a bandanna he had a tattoo that said jesus loves and he too radiated benevolence and forgiveness and baby odell it was with special affection that richard evoked the baby he cured his harelip and gave his eyes focus and wit he gave him not the slob by body of an overgrown farmboy but the sleek muscles of a weightlifter his mouth was no longer small and overshadowed by the dark fissure above it but firm and eloquent just as he now had cheekbones and spine and the one thing that poor odell never in life acquired for it requires some kind of primitive selfawareness dignity it was about halfway through that he realized he was reinventing odell as al capps lil abner but that was okay there was something barefoot and downhome to both abner and odell that made it appropriate it was nearly midnight when he finished the rough sketching for the first half of the drawing but now in a fever he could not stop he was consumed with fire as high as hed ever ever been before in his life oh mother he thought if you could see me now for bud pewtie he tried to imagine a pain so everlasting and consuming it would be almost beyond comprehension how does one get the total squalor of torture of ultimate and total degradation into a mere representation he tried to think of atrocitythe blownaway old people in this very house but more scenes from auschwitz the endless litter of scrawny corpses or the famous photograph of the searing flame of napalm in vietnam out of which with such utter delicacy the little girl had run leaving her mother and baby brother cooking behind the zapruder film frame in which kennedys skull explodes a fragment launching into midair and trailing a plasma gossamer a picture of the rent headless corpse of a thirdtrimester abortion that an anti choice zealot had once sent him yet none of this stuff really worked it didnt get him where he needed to be what is the worst he thought the worst thing you know or have ever heard of the screwball in silence of the lambs with his woman suit the german officer who forces sophie to choose which child shall live and which shall die the cries of the scottsboro boys as they were dragged to their trees knowing they were innocent no he thought the worst thing you ever heard of was the boy who blinded his mother he didnt have the guts to kill her he wasnt strong enough though he hated her almost as much as he loved her he tried to remember the mechanics of his strokes with his stiff arms his sudden explosiveness the sound of the blade cutting into the skin and into the sockets he remembered her wailing god how she wailed for mercy but she was so weak she had dominated him for so long but she was so weak the power hed felt the obscene sense of gratification after all those years there mother there now you know how it feels thats what hed said to her now trapping that sickness and storing it like a fossil fuel he began once again to draw lamar sat like rodins thinker watching the sun come up it crept over the rim of the plains out beyond the highway foreshadowing another hot clear oklahoma day this early it was still a farmers sun appreciated wordlessly only by men who rose before it to get a good part of their immense days labor finished before it got truly hot it was swollen and bloodshot and almost orange but still cool lamar regarded it dully it was as if hed spent his rage and collapsed finally after so many long sleepless days and nights battling fever and pain and that goddamned big cat that was still stalking him his face was slack his eyes dull he was shirtless the halflion looking almost abstract like a scribble on the planes of his chest his hair fanned wetly over his broad back he breathed through his mouth drawing the air over a dry dead tongue nothing moved on his body he looked as passive as a piece of stone though the veins on his muscular right arm were distended and now and then a rogue impulse caused one of his remaining fingers to twitch hed been sitting there since three oclock when hed returned from another of his long night walks richard approached gingerly he felt as if he were a small boy in the presence of greatness he stood waiting to be recognized after a long time lamar finally looked over richard saw two glistening tracks running down his cheeks which connected with no knowledge of lamar that hed ever had until at last he recognized that tears had left their mark lamar was weeping silently lamar are you all right oh im hurting something mighty richard lamar said im hurting so fierce i doubt if im agoing to make it please lamar what would we do without you you cant talk like that youve got to make it it always seems darkest just before the dawn goddamn richard that poor boy he neverd done a thing wrong if i hadnt asteered him to it its me should be lying on that slab not him and i promised him id take him to his mamas grave and i never done that and now he aint even going to git no funeral they going to dump him in some goddamned paupers grave and thats the end of it its so sad it kills me how sad it is lamar i finished the drawing ill put the colors in tomorrow if you like it he held it out to lamar who took it and examined it closely in silence for some time then richard heard a shuffle a choke a sob as lamar broke down completely richard stood there feeling as if hed violated some immense privacy of lamar to see a man so bold and strong and fearless weeping hystericallyit befuddled richard it was like seeing his own father crying when all the signals always said that fathers dont cry his never did mothers cry but his never did either but then lamar looked over and said richard goddamn what you done here thats wonderful the baby in heaven bud pewtie in hell goddamn richard you are a great artist just looking at that lets me imagine it in some way i couldnt before i do know that hes up there awaitin on me goddamn richard boy its like you done lifted a huge weight off my shoulders why thank you lamar said richard stunned at the response then lamar looked at the bottom part the hell part now whats this he said his features darkening i thought i told you he was supposed to burn like in hell lamar lamar i thought hard about it and i came up with something different something so strange it would make you famous famous forever its so horrible lamars features knitted as he tried to penetrate the image gradually they lightened his face he said you got me doing something to his face yes richard admitted shyly i dont get it richard what is a man lamar a man is many things and you can take them from him but the one thing if you take it you take everything everything yes everything not his life not his family not his balls buthis face im cutting his face off everything eyes nose tongue lips teeth youve taken his face youve left him without a face consider it its so extreme lamar looked at richard and a strange light came into his eyes and then richard saw that it was respect lamar suddenly embraced richard held him tightly richard i think you done helped me find the power you and the lord richard you both done helped me find the power you can go on go on hell boy we gonna git us a bud pewtie and his goddamned family and this time well leave a ruckus in the chicken coop they talk about in oklahoma for a hundred years you mess with the pyes theyll say and the pyes will have their day and well leave him for all to find without a face chapter they began to come in the night he could not deny them he wasnt sure if they were dreams or fantasies but they always came between the hours of four and six while he was in a semi wakeful state involving visions and positions as yet untried smoky memories these visions all of holly hed roll over and see jen sleeping and wonder why oh why arent you enough for me but the fact was she wasnt enough or at least now that hed had the other younger woman so often and knew how she tasted salty and how she smelled musky and the consistency of her hair tight and all the secret parts of her that he could touch to make her squeal and moan maybe it was just the closeness of the brush with death whatever now he needed flesh to confirm that he was unmistakably alive he wanted hollys flesh he did not god damn his soul to hell and goddamn his allegiances to hell want his wifes flesh i have to go he said to jen in the morning she just looked up at him she was a handsome woman near his own age with a square beautiful face now completely unimpressed and beyond surprise her eyes just bore into him he sensed her remoteness and her passage into a zone beyond disappointment as if to suggest there were few words left my guns he said i called that osbi lieutenant henderson theyre out of the state ballistics lab now they all been tested he says i can sign for em sure would feel better with my own guns and not somebody elses hed been given a department smith for selfdefense just in case but somehow it lacked the proprietary intimacy of the ones hed put so many holes in targets and odell with so youre going to go fetch them jen said suspiciously yes thought i might then i thought id stop at the range and run a box through each and see how it felt then ill be right back you havent been right back in four months but i suppose if you have to go you have to go bud tried a smile it didnt work he knew he shouldnt appear too anxious but whenever he acted he knew his movements seemed awkward and forced however today he knew he had to have holly and damn the consequences and so after dawdling over another cup of coffee and reading a sports section whose scores he already knew by heart he at last got up threw on his hat slid the generic smith into a belt holster and a jacket over that though it was hot and set out he blinked the percodan knocked out the sharp jabs but couldnt reach deep enough into his nervous system to shut down the more general throbbing in his limbs and joints that made him aware of every movement once again he felt ancient he no longer wore the eyepatch but some moisture came and he blinked it back as he slid behind the fords wheel as he climbed in he fired something off in his leg wound where the pellet had sunk so deep and a momentary flare of pain blossomed inside he shook it off and pulled the door shut it was bright now june and flecks of pollen hung in the air spring was a memory full oklahoma summer bore down its weight crushing all movement from the air he took an un airconditioned breath and it felt like sucking down steam then he turned the engine backed out and with a nod passed the dayshift bodyguards he drove to the city hall annex cd was not there to be found but instead there was a younger osbi detective and some boys holding court in the taskforce big room the boys wanted to meet bud two texas rangers still hoping to get a try at lamar two undercover state policemen from the headquarters unit and two or three osbi investigators the names and hands all thrown at bud in a hurry hell of a job you did there pewtie goddamn thats the kind of shooting this here country needs more of by a damn sightthat was the gist of the comments offered in several variants well said bud modestly i was damned lucky the social palaver done bud went into the office where once cd had drunkenly held court and the new boss opened a drawer and pulled his guns out one after another one colt commander acp serial number fc one beretta f mm serial number dz and one beretta serial number ey there sergeant pewtie just sign and theyre yours got your beretta shoulder holster and the colt gaico but i dont know what happened to the holster how the hell you carry that in my belly behind my belt buckle no holster at all hurt like hell but i was damn glad it was there when i needed it he looked at them his three guns all functional black combat pistols without a grace note or a gleam to them just tools a wave of sweetness came over him so powerful it almost made him want to faint no man whose life hasnt been saved by a gun can begin to imagine what a man whose life has feels when he confronts the instruments of his survival bud headed out but then he stopped feeling he had a thing or two still to do where would i find cd well sarge hes got a place way south of town out thirtyeighth street south of macmahon park he gave an address i ought to drop on by bud said learning that he felt it exactly as it popped out the old boyd probably appreciate that assuming you get him early enough before hes given himself up to the bottle bud looked at his watch did he have time for this why was he doing it if he got in and got out quick it shouldnt matter but time as always was the problem it might help him cover he went to see the lieutenant they got to talking the hours passed thats why he was late it was a dingy little suburban tract house in an unappealing development smaller even than hollys place way south of the airport and now and then a big jet would roar overhead its landing gear threatening to knock down aerials and chimneys there were no trees in the neighborhood he waited just a second to determine if he really wanted to do this or not it had the sense of a fools errand but there was something in the way it was shaking out he didnt likethat he bud pewtie had found lamar where the old man had not it wasnt really a fair interpretation he finally went up and knocked on the door the woman who answered was another bitter prune without a lick of softness anywhere to her drawn features or her immense fatigue im pewtie bud said is cd available she just fixed him with a wordless glare and then finally said you the lawyer about the settlement no maam im a highway patrol officer that worked his last case that damn johnny lawyer said hed be here yesterday we need the money damn fool cd lost all his two years back on a goddamn resort investment down at lake texoma sorry to hear that bud said well you go on back then but hes in a black mood as usual has he been of course you cant take that mans bottle from him but he dont get bad until around four bud walked back into a dark little room and found cd sitting under a pyramid of cigarette smoke his bourbon bottle and a paper cup before him he was watching a soap opera through squinty eyes his face all knit up a cigarette dangling from his lips on a shelf to the left stood a brass army of pistol marksmanship awards howdy there said bud bud goddamn the old man leaped up nice of you to drop by well damn just wanted to know how yous doing oh its okay gits a little draggy toward the end of day thats all you need anything no sir not a thing i aint quite as drunk as i was last time i saw you need a drink yourself son no lieutenant i just wanted to drop by to say so long well youre the only one of em man enough to do that close to fifty years and nobody even come by how bout a sandwich bud you want a sandwich honey can you git bud a sandwich no its all right lieutenant i already ate sure bud say that was good work on odell pity you couldnt have gotten lamar too i was one bullet shy goddamn his luck now bud henderson said ill be the only one of em who tells you the flatout truth you shouldnt have fired so much without aiming been in seven gunfights won em all only twice was i even hit you got to aim bud you cant spray and pray thats what old jelly bryce taught me and no man was better with a gun than he was youre right lieutenant i just couldnt think fast enough another thing jelly bryce taught me a man comes at you again soaking up lead like that you got to stay cool and break his pelvis with a big bore bullet break his pelvis down he goes hit him three inches inside the hip puts him down every damn time under them circumstances even a head shot is ifiy hell you can blow out the top half of a mans brain and his heart and he can still go for fifteen seconds on instinct ill remember that he took a drink from his glass the soap opera whined onward bud could smell the liquor and the smoke all of a sudden he just wanted to get the hell out listen lieutenant i do have to poke along i just wanted to say is sorry how it ended for you and i didnt want no hard feelings some are saying i found lamar and you didnt but we both know thats not how it was no bud that is how it was you did find lamar and i did not bud you going to bring those boys over id surely like to meet those boys of yours they sound like a damned fine set of boys sure lieutenant lets set a date bud ill get my calendar out maybe we could take em fishing lets pick a weekend in july we could go on up to the wichitas or no no out to lake texoma used to own a nice piece of land there i know where the damn fish are hiding that i can tell you lieutenant bud said ill have to check with them jeffs got legion ball and i dont know when exactly russ has to go east ill have to call you back on that sure bud now you positive you dont want no drink lieutenant i have to go okay bud anyways im sorry well is sorry too bud i wanted that lamar and by god if id gotten another break or so you can bet id have nailed him yes sir yes sir said the old man less to bud than to himself yes sir id have nailed him just couldnt get that last damned break when bud finally got back to his truck the full force of the days heat lay upon him he checked his watch dammit hed spent close to half an hour with the pitiful old goat when hed only meant to spend ten minutes he shook his head at what had become of the mighty lieutenant henderson he still felt a little woozy from the smoke and the dark claustrophobia of the place or maybe it was the force of his sexual anticipation anyway he got in and drove to hollys feeling hed earned it it took him twenty extra minutes to find the place and hed have to come up with an excuse to account for the time he knew but by the time he got there he wasnt thinking about such things he thought hed burst he pulled up nodded at a black kid on a yellow plastic trike on the sidewalk and bounded to the porch well damn my soul she said the hero himself bud looked around theatrically oh yeah theres a hero here always wanted to meet one of them boys shake his hand git you in here bud pewtie this very instant you can tell me how much you like my house and how sorry you are i had to move in by myself later she pulled him in and began to grope with him immediately coming upon his guns oh my well sir maybe we ought not to do a thing so as you dont have to readjust all your equipment id gladly dump em in the trash darling for a few minutes with you well i hope its longer than a few minutes and it was bud was in fine form today released of all his inhibitions driven forward by the peculiar intensity of his wants his pains vanished his legs were young again his lungs full of stamina the games started in the living room on a sofa moved up the stairs though pausing there for several minutes owing to the possibilities of the steep upward rake of the steps then continued in her upstairs bedroom where things got immensely tangled and complicated until at last the moment itself arrived exploded and then departed whooee wasnt that a time bud said you should do more of this mankilling bud it does wonders for you wasnt i the boy though he said you certainly were he laid around in her bed for another half an hour and then the mood came across him again squealing delightedly she accommodated him she was smooth and slippery as an eel and when that one was done he said well i think we broke in the new house right nice would say so want to see it bud knew he shouldnt too much time he was late already but she was so proud of the damn thing sure he said they dressed and she lugged him around room to room bud tried hard to keep his enthusiasm up but he knew he was doing a poor job and there really wasnt much to see her trailer furniture spread throughout a sixroom house looked sparse and for some reason the house looked grayer and dirtier than he had remembered it looking could he live here it wasnt nearly as nice as his wonderful and comfortable old place its a great little place honey he said youll help me paint it bud hated painting of course oh bud well be so happy here i know we will yes maam i know we will now uh ive i know bud and you dont want to do any talking at all okay bud will i see you tomorrow of course you will he said by god of course you will if bud drove home thinking of lies or rather expansions on the truth old cd now i had to go see him it aint right what they done to him and what theyre saying about him and you know how that man can talk she didnt of course he just jaws onward and onward and you cant slow him down any and hes so bitter i didnt want to insult him any further plus he had to hear the story of my famous shootout and of course he had a lot of comments and constructive criticism the time just flew away on me he actually mouthed the words out loud so theyd feel familiar in his mind you didnt want to be making stuff up in an escapade like this because you could just as easy as pie come up with something that invalidated something youd said before pick a nice simple believable story near to the truth as you can make it not very in this case but believable and stick to it he had a laugh here remembering an old story about a football quarterback who was out helling around and his wife caught him sneaking in around seven in the morning and he had a dandy all set up he told her hed come back at about ten the night before but since she was already asleep he didnt want to wake her so since it was such a nice night out hed decided to sleep in the hammock out there in the front yard and thats where hed been she said thats very nice but i took the hammock down two weeks ago so the fellow said well thats my story and im sticking to it bud pulled in the driveway and immediately one of the osbi youngsters got out and came up to him sergeant pewtie yes he said suddenly alerted by the youngsters gravity oh christ what was wrong sergeant your wife has been looking all over hell and gone for you whats wrong he said its your son my son bud watched him in horror thinking his whole life might be about to change lamar his son vengeance it all came together in a single horrifying moment your youngest boy jeff oh god thought bud he just been arrested by the city police assault he attacked two boys in school hurt em bad too chapter the papers in all their accounts of the famous gunfight at jimmy kys gave no personal details about this bud pewtie oklahoma highway patrol sergeant fortyeight that was all his name was in no phone book either but that was common cops seldom had listed phone numbers how are we going to find him daddy ruta beth asked oh said lamar therere ways hes left a trail a sly old dog like me hell ill sniff him out lamar stared at the photo in the paper and bud pewtie stared back it was a grave authoritarian face the face of a manhunter lamar had seen it on a few cops in his time but fewer and fewer of late as the cops had gotten younger and somehow sweeter but pewtie had the gray eyes and flat mouth of a hero type an asskicker a shooter and goddamn hed done some shooting lamar looked at the bandage swaddling his left hand two fingers just gone as if by surgery luck or talent lamar knew it was probably luck but it left him a little uneasy no man should be that lucky hes a scary man said richard richard when you hold a gun to a mans kid he aint scary no more and when you blow that childs brains all over the sidewalk let me tell you hes going to bawl like a baby oh then hell know the true cost of mixing up with lamar pye by god hell know lamar thought hes probably a family man looks like the father of a whole tribe lots of those square toughguy sonsofbitches was like thatthey were trained that the world was theirs for the taking and their job was to fill it with kids he thought of pewtie as the head of a tribe and saw him living on an estate though of course he knew how little cops made but the image was good it stoked the cold rage lamar knew he had to taste and hold to do the deeds that he had in mind that would teach the world how dangerous it is to take something from lamar pye now he said says here hes fortyeight years old wouldnt a stud like this one have kids wouldnt those kids be roughly in high school figuring he got married in his late twenties when he got out of the goddamned marine corps and got his training done he looked around at ruta beth and richard no doubt about it though ruta beth was as decent a girl as ever lived she was not bright she had some ofodells dullness in the face as she grappled with the idea richard on the other hand was too goddamned smart that was his whole goddamned trouble he could figure everything out and do nothing richard was about the most worthless man hed ever seen a bad thief gutless a goddamned mary jane he should have let the niggers make him their bitch before they killed him but no not lamar takes a boy under his wing and all these months later is still stuck with him richard got it first of course but when he said it ruta beth got it and her little dark eyes lit up with something like a babys glee sports his kids would do sports you know they would yes indeed richard i think you got it we go to the library look through old newspapers your high school sports page goddamn ill guarantee you this oned have a fullback or a pitcher or some other goddamned thing well find his name in the paper and well know what school he goes to yes sir that gives us the place old bud pewtie lives in we can hunt for that truck which we all got a good look at when it was parked here even though you two geniuses didnt recognize it in the parking lot it was dark lamar said richard it was dark lamar repeated lamar or maybe we send the boy somethingsay a basket of fruit because he done pitched a nohitter then we id him when he comes out and follow him anyway you cut it goddamn well have us the whole goddamn pewtie clan you betcha suppose hes guarded well then we wait a bit and we catch us a pewtie when the guard is down say a kid or maybe the mama then we call old bud and we say you either come on out to play with us or we going to start sending you fingers and ears oh hell come goddamn i know hell come it fell to richard and ruta beth to enter lawtons small branch library at thirtyeighth and cherry and take up the bound copies of the months of april may and june not yet finished for the lawton constitution richard paged through the grim newsprint his fingers darkening with ink stains every now and then a headline would reach out and snag his eye grange slates bake sale for example or safety record set at whiz plastics or recital set for tuesdaynot news stories per se but little announcements about this or that thing occurring somewhere in or about the greater lawton area they were like bulletins from another life richard had been raised to hold lower middle class society in utter contempt but right then it seemed the nicest thing he could ever imagine was to work accidentfree in the whiz plastics plant his whole life and go to the grange bake sale on saturday and his daughters recital on tuesday never was gone couldnt happen that life was sealed off he was special he had been trained from an early age smarter and more talented and see what it had got him why am i so damned smart he wondered pityingly why do i have to see through so much why couldnt i be banal like everyone else what the hell are you crying about ruta beth said you want us arrested for being weird they do that in small towns you know no its just that its so commonplace the contents of a newspaper theres nothing meaningful in it its so ordinary goddamn richard you are the goddamnedest weirdest man i ever did see dont see what lamar sees in you go on look for the goddamned name richard pushed his way onward his eyes roaming through the sports section pulsing through dreary tales of dreary games played all across the city and surrounding counties why did boys love games so it was a complete mystery to him take baseball for example point after all if you hit the ball or not in the long run what was achieved selfdefining systems full of two pewtie hits take lawton high p hed almost missed it but there it was the name pewtie big as life there couldnt be two of them sophomore jeff pewtie continued his hitting rampage the breathless copy read with a single in the first and a basesloaded double in the fifth since being promoted to lawton varsity in midmay the yearold sophomore has hit an amazing richard rushed through the pages in search of this young hercules labors and found them nearly every week when jeff didnt deliver mighty clouts his superb outfielding astonished the fans finally yes a picture the boy being clapped on the back after delivering a gamewinning hit this just from last week he looked carefully the face was young and square and handsome on a compact muscular body brimming with health and confidence he looked hard into the bone structure and tried to match it with the sergeants photo from the papers earlier that week after the shooting after a bit he came to see it it was the shape of the nose and the distribution of flesh between the eyes the subtle architecture of a face or rather of a genetic pattern reiterated though in a slight variant mutation father to son thats him he said bout time said ruta beth thats the kid richard looked at the boy a shiver came across him what a perfect gladiator how confident of his place in the world and expectant of the future and what woe awaited him in the parking lot they showed lamar a page theyd ripped from the newspaper with jeffs picture you were right lamar you were dead right now alls we have to do is go to the school like you said and do what you said and in a day or so well richard goddamn sometimes i dont think you got a brain in that head of yours not a one how careful you look at this richard hung his head in shame not very he said didnt think so richard tell me richard you ever looked at a sports page in your life or you only look at books with pictures of naked women in em iii dont like games richard said sullenly punching out his lower lip well on most sports pages they got what they call a schedule yes indeedy and all you need to do is lookiesee and there it is there what is the schedule of the games dont you think this old hero cop bud pewtie going to want to see his kid play ball i mean really dont you think he would daddy said ruta beth you damned betcha said lamar and according to this here schedule theres a goddamn game tonight he looked at the two of them better git your mitts boys and girls wes going to a ball game chapter bud got to the downtown police stationa twostory brick box on fourth street that only had a gaudy flower bed out front to break up its blanknessfast made his inquiries and was directed to juvenile he raced up the steps and down a bright green hall to discover the department opened an opaque glassed door to find the same vision of a thousand american police stations the cluttered bullpen room the green walls the bulletin boards littered with circulars that nobody ever looked at and in one corner there was jen standing next to an old friend a police lieutenant named howard who had done ten years on the highway patrol with bud before hed missed out on a promotion and left the state agency with bitterness he walked up to them jen my god what the hell is going on is he all right jen just looked at him something long and hurting in her eyes then she looked away now bud youd best take it easy for now said howard i wouldnt let them put him in the tank with the scum hes in a solitary cell and nobodys going to hurt him that i guarantee we got two detectives working on statements and witnesses and ive talked to both the other boys mothers and i know the juvenile justice and i think we can get everybody to agree to accept misdemeanor charges them boys was a part of it too everyones trying to behave well under the circumstances just tell me what happened howard jeff isnt the kind of boy to assault strangers anywhere much less in school we didnt raise him like that and he never been in fights or had any jd records or nothing bud he did attack those boys in front of others in class actually hes a strong kid you know he punched the jennings boy in the ribs and broke two and he broke the chastain boys nose bud just looked at howard in disbelief he couldnt begin to understand it i just dont they were the spray painters bud said howard they were the ones painting long live lamar and odell was a martyr and go lamar on the walls two real smart boys one going to norman the other going east like your son russell you know smartasses showoffs well it seems they have that angry edge all the young people have these days wanted to question authority they called it mischief i suppose most everybody knew it was them maybe even russell but jeff found out today in the locker room he just walked from classroom to classroom till he found them and started pounding on them ill say this they aint going to paint no more signs on no more school walls if you ask me jeff deserves a medal said jen bitterly no said bud you cant think like that what he did was wrong no matter the reason he has to take his punishment like a man and not let it wreck his life we need a lawyer a good lawyer my record sure as hell wont hurt the main thing is to avoid the felony conviction hell hes only fifteen you dont want a felony conviction on your record itll dog you for your whole life bud felt an immense melancholy settle over him poor jeff he saw in a flash how his mind had worked and how hed set out to avenge the family honor frankly what those two boys did made him sick he gritted his teeth and swore to himself that hed fight like hell to see that his boy got every damn break he could but he hated it the troubles of his life that he himself had invented dumped square in his poor youngest sons lap he put his hand on jens shoulder and she recoiled so he found a phone and called an assistant prosecutor he knew and got the name of the best defense lawyer in town a name he recognized as a man who was known for a good deal of flamboyance and charismaand publicity quickly he called and when he was told that mr oneill was in conference he said now listen here young lady this is sergeant bud pewtie of the oklahoma highway patrol the cop that shot it out with the pyes i think mr oneill would appreciate the fact that an officer as famous as i am chose him to call in an hour of need and hed want me to be put through right away it worked in a minute the lawyer was on the phone and in five hed promised to be down there before four got him a lawyer said bud believe me getting a good lawyer is nine tenths the battle all the scum has the best legal talent aroundno reason we shouldnt but jen didnt respond and just looked out the window bud walked up to her what the hell is wrong he said you are treating me like a piece of shit where were you she finally said just what the hell is going on i was he came up dry i was seeing and then he realized his mistake he couldnt say hed driven out to see c d henderson in his bitter retirement because hed already lied and told her he was going to see cd to get the guns back he hit the wall he came up blank he was out of lies i was just driving around thinking about what about how used up i feel oh stop it bud im not a fool i can tell when somethings going on she glared out the window then she turned you wait for the lawyer you get jeff out i cant stand this anymore im going home it took another hour for the lawyer to arrive the paperwork to be signed a quick hearing with the magistrate to be arranged and then at last jeff was released he looked so small so pale and wan theyd made him change clothes into those green prison belt less pants and shirt and given him paper slippers he looked like an intern he wouldnt meet buds eyes but the warder a hearty black man who also knew of bud acted as host of the party got jeffs clothes and took him into the mens room where he could change bud waited in the office and then jeff was brought back now looking somewhat better in his jeans and boots but still he wouldnt look at his father they walked down to the truck together you know jeff bud finally said i can certainly understand why you did what you did a certain part of me even says those boys had it coming but you cant assault them that sets you on a path that can lead to selfdestruction a fine young man like you it goes contrary to all your teaching jeff said dad i know then why did no i mean i know what youre doing its inexcusable bud looked at his sons profile across the seat from him saw the strong lean face the delicate lashes the intensity buried in the eyes about her jeff said little thud in buds heart the world fell out of focus and then came back jeff i but again he came up dry it was the phone dad about three months ago i heard you talking on the phone late at night low voice hushed the noise came up through the floorboards the next morning i looked at the phone for an hour and then i punched redial dont you know about redial how could you not know about redial it dialed the number and the voice answered a womans and she said hello and i said hello and i remembered her voice from the time you and mom had them over for dinner and i said mrs pepper and she said yes and i hung up and i heard youevery night i heard you heard that voice coming up through the vent you had to call her from the house you couldnt call her from someplace else but you had to do it from the house jeff i youre screwing this woman and then youre coming home and acting like everythings okay and then at night you call her and make plans for the next day and youve got it all figured out i bet how you and her are going off and youre just going to leave poor mom and the rest of us and we have to pick up your pieces and go on while youre out partying god dad how could you do that to her how could you bud swallowed hard jeff these things arent so black and white as you make them out to be no it is simple you got tired of us we bored you so you went somewhere else and every morning i had to wake up and wonder if this was the night you were leaving us he had begun to cry the tears ran down his cheeks his nose began to issue terrible liquids he hated to cry bud knew hated losing control but now he did and in seconds he was sobbing hysterically bud pulled over and put out a hand to touch him no jeff said recoiling savagely im sorry jeff bud said i never meant to hurt you i dont think i ever would have left not really it wasnt something i planned or dreamed about it just happened dad dad dad dad jeff one thing a son always has to learn is that his father aint a hero hes just another man trying hard and making mistakes like everybody else now i suppose i cut myself too much slack my old man was a drunk and he beat me up a lot too and he drove my mama out early so i always thought if i was better than him then id really accomplished something but now i see that being better than that dont mean shit they sat there for a long while well bud finally said at least i figured out what im going to do he took a deep breath and faced the future ill make it work i can make it work you know i can make it work are you just lying again jeff i never told you no lies yes i lied to your mother someday when youre an aging man and a pretty young woman takes an interest in you and you cant find it in your heart to say no then maybe youll know what it is the boy looked at him through a ravaged swollen face and said nothing dont you have a game tonight bud asked he nodded will they let you play i dont know well hows this ill take you to the game when the game is over ill go over to hollys and ill tell her the news i owe her that much i have to tell her straight up you understand then ill go to home and ill tell your mother what a bad husband ive been and ill ask her to forgive me and maybe she will and maybe she wont but the lying will be over that i swear to you all right the lying and the cheating its all over then pretty soon when school is out well all go on a nice trip we have some money saved up but i think the whole family going on a trip maybe thats more important i will set my house in order jeff i swear to you the boy said nothing then maybe he gave a nod chapter lamar stole a trans am out of the very same library parking lot and followed ruta beth and richard back to the farm when they arrived he had it all mapped out okay he said this is how we do it we dont do nothing at the game too many people too much traffic too much you cant control we hook onto goddamn bud pewtie though and we follow his ass home we wait till hes all snug inside with his goddamn family then we blow the doors down and start shooting we leave hair on them walls i want that kid and the mama dead and whoevers else in that house i want bud pewtie to know what loss is i want him to suffer as i suffered then ill cut his face off richard and then were out of here you got that all of them said richard queasily son you aint up for this work it dont mean nothing to you that i save you from being the niggers fackboy that i save your goddamn life in dennys and in the goddamn river and that this sonofabitch done shot poor baby odell full of holes richard this is a raid its mans work you got to go in hard and shoot straight and put all of them down yes all of them the whole goddamn family now either you going with us or well leave you here and you wont be a happy boy scout i can do it richard said in a funny way he now believed it it was after all only a mechanical thing you point the gun you pull the trigger there was no higher meaning you ruta beth cant do a job like this less you believe in it the whole goddamned way you with me yes daddy she said the kids the women all of them its for the baby well show them what it means to hurt a baby good now i want us to change into some uppity clothes we got to look like we got a boy playing ourselves any clothes from your daddy and mommy left honey theres a trunk can you and richard git it then well change and go what are you going to do daddy lamar smiled the guns he said im checking the guns lamar went upstairs and saw what there was to see the sig that hed taken off the texas ranger the smith magnum from pewtie and two other s from the stepfords and two sawedoff shotguns the browning automatic and the mossberg that had come from bud pewties cop car ruta beth had bought ammo grain hollow tips for the s grain hollow tips for the and six boxes of doubleought buck for the two shotguns he lovingly threaded shells into chambers and magazines thrilled as always at the fitting together of parts the slick cam ming of slides and pumps and bolts the heavy feel of them all until each gun seemed alive with its charges the sig one of the other s and the browning semiauto would be his hed give ruta beth the pump gun and a and poor richard could carry the then gathering them he went downstairs richard had washed up and changed into a nice pair of slacks and a striped sports shirt he looked like a lawyer at a party ruta beth looked almost cheery in a white polyester pantsuit that had once been her mamas and a pair of loafers lamar quickly changed into a nice leisure suit in gray and a colorful shirt he could keep his handguns out of sight that way he went to the mirror in the bathroom he saw the same old lamar with that thick friendly face that mashed nose where the cherokee deputies had pounded him all those years ago the open alert eyes what is wrong with this picture the hair thats what too much hair looked like a bjker or an indian or some other kind of trash ruta beth he called come cut all my hair off the team was already on the field in sweats when bud and jeff pulled in it was the last game of the season and already parents had begun to gather in the parking lot bud could see the other teams buseisenhower h it saidand knew their players would probably be in the locker room suiting up well here we are said jeff let me go long with you to talk to him this goddamned hero business may do us some good the two walked under the bleachers around a gap in the fence and around the edge of the dugout ahead of them on the diamond a lean black assistant coach was fun going grounders to the infielders bud watched the ball snap and hop across the green and watched as the boys bent gracefully to scoop it up always magically snaring it on the right bounce then pirouetting as they fired across the diamond to the first baseman who then fired the ball to the catcher who served it up to the coach in the outfield boys were drawing beads on descending balls gathering them in and then launching long throws bud and his son ducked into the dugout where an elderly man sat cross legged fussing with a lineup card coach the old man looked up well hello there jeff sergeant pewtie im out sir jeff said i was wondering if it was possible if i could play technically both boys parents have dropped charges against jeff said bud the magistrate released him in my care on my word wed find some counseling for him it turned out jeff didnt do no serious damage and their parents acknowledge that what they done was stupid and what jeff done while also stupid was understandable so you aint going off to prison doesnt look like it sir said jeff itd mean a lot to jeff if he got to play said bud well i think itd mean a lot to the team if jeff got to play let me make a call the coach stood and went to a pay phone a few feet down under the bleachers and dropped his own quarter and did some asking and some listening and some more asking and then came back well jeff he said youre to be suspended for three days i cant legally allow a suspended boy to participate in athletics thats the rule i see said jeff but the disappointment broke on his face like a wave he swallowed and seemed to tear up just a bit too well sir said bud thanks for giving us a hearing the rules are to be obeyed that they are sergeant pewtie the coach said and to a t and the t says that the suspension doesnt begin formally until tomorrow far as im concerned this boys still in school and he better get his ass out on that field before i start to chew on it jeff lit up like a candle ill go get my uniform he raced off youre not going to get in any trouble for this bud said hell said the old man i been here for thirtyfour years and won em seven state championships what can they do yell at me bud shook his hand i appreciate what youre doing for the boy hes a good kid he deserves a break yes sir sergeant pewtie i agreehe is a good kid and he does deserve a break i hope this helps him bud slipped out of the dugout the stands were beginning to fill he checked his watch it was five p and the game began at six would probably be over by eightthirty an overwhelming melancholy came over him well it was time he went to a refreshment stand that had just opened and bought a coke to fight the dust and the phlegm in his throat its cold sweetness plunged down his gullet momentarily energizing him but then it was gone the cup tossed into a steel garbage barrel and there it still was what he had to do he walked over to the same phone the old coach had used to call the school dropped in his quarter and dialed the number she answered on the third ring hi he said wanly well bud pewtie bless my heart my parts are still abuzzing for all the attention you paid them today fact is dont think theyll settle down until sun goes down aint felt this good in years well im glad was all he could think to say now what do i owe this honor to usually i dont hear from such as yourself until late at night her voice was so happy he could see her face all lit up the way the joy came into her eyes he had never been able to please a woman so it had been that way with them from the start ah he said im at jeffs game probably be here oh till eightthirty nine oclock its his last game of the season im hoping hell have a good one i know he will bud anyway jeffll probably go with some of the boys to a pizza place or something and i thought maybe id drop by after the game bud she said squealing with delight but then her delight stopped what is it is something wrong he lied what was the point of hurting her now of making her suffer for three hours until he could get over there he didnt have it in him no no nothing like that its just i have some time no ones going to notice where i am or why and i thought maybe we could have a beer or something oh bud its a date you havent taken me on a date in months i dont believe youve ever taken me on a date ill see you then yes you will he said hanging up lamar sat by himself up top of the lawton senior high bleachers he was aware of the cop nearly thirty rows away on the other side of the horseshoe of scaffolds and seats that embraced the basepaths of the diamond but he never looked directly at the man for he had a feel for the magic power of eyeswhatever it is that makes some men feel the pressure of eyes on them and turn at the last goddamn second to avoid the shank sweeping toward them to end their lives hed seen it on the yard enough times men who tuned their nerves and were always right on the goddamned edge prickly and fast and fucking dangerous others just didnt pay attention and when the reaper came for them they werent ready and it just split them open there where they stood but lamar knew from more than seeing it happen once a nigger trying to make a name for himself had jumped him blindside in the yard at crabtree state meaning to rip his guts out right there lamar often wondered if it was the hand of god or the breath of the devil blowing in his ear or some kind of animal thing that felt a push in the air he spun a cunt hair before the knife reached his spine caught it with his left wrist he would always wear the jagged scar and head butted the man to death in approximately thirty seconds piledriving the top of his skull into the bridge of the mans nose with all the power in his body until it was done it was judged selfdefense the only time lamar had ever won anything at a hearing he later heard the boy had come for him in order to impress the tulsa afriques the baddest nigger gang in that pen he was hoping to get in lamar sent him to his weeping mama in a bag and oddly enough toussaint du noir as the leading black punk of the afriques had renamed himself sent lamar a carton of cigarettes for getting rid of a wannabe but they were only kools and lamar traded them for a couple of blow jobs from a bitch named roy but lamar was sure that bud would have such an intuition too and therefore wanted to steer clear so he had told his crew to wait in the trans am which was parked a couple of rows behind buds easytoidentify ford lamar enjoyed sitting there he was with the fans from the visiting team lawton seniors cross town rivals all of them good hardworking people of the sort lamar had no problem with that goddamn pewtie kid was good lamar knew him almost right away from the squareness of his head and the same alert way his father stood he guessed bud had been a good athlete too for such things tended to run in families just as his daddy had been a hell of a prison ballplayer and he lamar had once been a good prison leagues center fielder when he still had his speed but this young pewtie could run anything down in left field and had a good arm christ though he could hit a ton it was the fifth inning and hed already drilled a double and a single but it was the way he attacked the plate when he hit unafraid legs apart head straight just waiting for the ball to come toward him so he could demolish it it was his hunger that lamar felt up there in the bleachers and that somehow made him hate the lawman even more it wasnt enough that he took from lamar the one person that hed cared about but that he had so much wife great kid a place in a world that would forever shun such as lamar pye it was a world that would only know him through fear lamar sipped a coke adjusted his baseball cap looking for all the world like just another workingclass dad watching the high school kids play ball all the while nursing his rage into something so hot it was cold it felt delicious it was coming as a present he looked across the way to the big state policeman sitting in the stands yelling after his boy and he thought goddamn mister what you got coming what you got coming a last popup seemed to rise until it would bring rain but then fell accelerating lazily in the bright night lamps light and an infielder nabbed it that was it game over not a bad one either jeff had gone two for four stolen a base and made two nice running catches in the deep outfield hed made a good throw too a special victory because his arm was the problematical part of his game lawtonwon easily eight to two and the game had essentially been over since the fourth inning when lawton put six runs on the board no drama thats how bud wanted it he looked at his watch it was eight thirtyfive plenty of time he milled through the departing crowd slipped through the fence and ducked into the dugout where boys and parents had gathered the coach gave a nice little speech about what a great team this had been even if they didnt make it to the state tournament and he may have had more talented teams but hed never had one that had worked so hard and that next year looked really good and he hoped all the sophomores and juniors would play legion ball this summer there was a polite smattering of applause then the team broke into its cliques and the players began to filter out in twos and threes some with parents others without jeff slipped up to him we were going to meet at nicks he said you know like we always do you have a ride im going with tom and jack and jacks girl dont stay out too late dont worry your mother any i wont dad the moment hung between them okay bud said now im going to take care of that business i told you about and everythings going to be all right i know dad you just go and have a good time dont stay too late no beer yes sir jeff slipped away engulfed in a tide of boys and bud knew it was time to go lamar was just a little bit nervous he left the parking lot and parked a hundred yards or so down the road so that he wouldnt have to start out of the nearly empty lot exactly as bud did because such a thing might give him away to a sharpeyed man he swallowed he was driving himself because he didnt trust ruta beth or richard but still it was a touchy thing to follow buds truck through traffic ever so gentle never losing touch never being too tight just close enough to track his rabbit to its hole it was plain oldfashioned hunting but hed helped things along after leaving the game in the seventh inning hed placed a piece of reflecting tape flat under each of buds taillights low on the bumper that way he could drop back a hundred or so yards and still keep sight of the truck by the unusual pattern he didnt have to see the truck proper only the lights he watched bud now leave the rinkydink stadium among the last the lawman was by himself moving with something akin to melancholy that lamar couldnt quite figure though he read hesitancy and regret in the body language before the trooper had seemed to swagger he was under a goddamn black cloud even ruta beth noticed it what the hell he so down for she wondered yeah lamar said richard you said the boy got lots of hits who knows asked lamar he thought he was sad now imagine what he was going to feel bud got in turned on the lights pulled out lamar turned on his lights and sped down the road so that he actually beat buds entrance into traffic making his man wait while he lazed on by bud pulled into traffic behind lamar but lamar wouldnt let himself look some little thing like that a look at the wrong time and the whole goddamned shaky thing could fall apart there he shut up richard goddamn it boy keep your mouth shut and look right straight ahead lamar slowed just a little with a hasty spurt bud dipped into the oncoming lane and shot by lost in his own thoughts goodthat meant bud couldnt have picked up someone coming into the traffic behind him then hooking up hed have to be a genius to pick up the cue lamar dropped a few car lengths behind can we turn on the radio asked richard shut up richard said ruta beth the cars ambled through the early evening traffic in the fading light up and down the streets the streetlamps and shop signs were coming on blurring in the windshield making it hard to track the set of lights that was buds truck but his concentration was so intense it was as if he were some other man he just saw the two red lights and the bright strips that were buds and nothing else in the universe then lamar saw a problem up ahead it just came all of a sudden from nowhere bud signaled a left just as his truck was moving into yellow lamar would never make the intersection before red and he knew if he blew through the light he might be spotted by a cop or even bud you cant be too careful lamar calculated quickly figuring the least risky of two very risky courses in a split second he took his left now down a side street that he didnt even know went through out of buds sight he hit the pedal raced wildly swerved by a slowpoke who honked frightened two women back on the curb wheeled right up another street and came to the street bud had turned left down there was a steady stream of traffic shit where was he he scanned the lights disappearing down the road goddamn it and saw nothing and felt a raging emptiness lamar i dont shut up richard daddys working then he saw it the small jot of red reflected light under a taillight that signaled bud lamar gunned his trans am slid through the traffic darted through two lefthand passes and soon enough fell in a hundred yards back in the right lane he aint seen shit he said hot damn bud pulled up outside the little house now glowing in the dark it looked merry and friendly the black kid with the trike was nowhere to be seen he climbed out waited by his car for a second that goddamn house she moved here to be with you and now you got to do this goddamn thing youre going to hurt her so you will hurt her and hurt her and then walk out he tried to put a nice spin on things it was better for her really she deserved a fresh start not some halflife with a retread full of lead and freighted with kids and guilt and his own memories of a betrayed wife and a dead partner who was her husband she deserved so much a little frog worked into buds throat as he looked at the house then it was time and he went in he walked up the walk it was only eight hours since his last trek up the walk what it had led to that time was sex with her smoke rose in his mind as images came to him there was the business in the living room on the sofa and then the business on the steps and the final business in the bedroom they had stretched it out moving from room to room as if to celebrate the freedom they now enjoyed after so many motel rooms interesting things happened in each room but the stuff on the stepshe didnt think theyd done anything like that before gone all gone an enormous sense of loss suffused bud had to do it he thought his sons his wife his family this was hard the hardest thing yet but he could do it and save his family and win it all back he climbed the steps and before he could reach the door it popped open well howdy there mr bud pewtie himself she said hi holly well get you in bud walked in same house same holly smell in it do you want a beer no i dont think so bud you have that doihavetogotochurch look on your face why dont you spit it out sos we can get to the nutcutting part oh holly she sensed the remorse in his voice a grave look came across her as if shed been slapped she knew instantly he could tell bud no were so close were not close buddont do this to me please sweetie holly i he stopped stuck for words again you what i never meant to hurt you that was the last thing i ever meant i wanted everybody to be happy but everybody cant be happy no they cant hollyjeffs found out my son is in so much pain im going to try to put his life together again bud holly you

have to be a better father to my son than mine was to me without that i aint shit and i know it i took something from him i want to give it back bud its not an eitheror thing you can have both im not saying itll be easy but you can have both holly im setting you free goddamn you can have anything anything you just wait your life is going to turn out swell youll see you get through just this little bit and then the good times start she stared at him furiously and after a bit began to cry he wanted to go to her and comfort her she had given him such comfort over the months she sat down i dont see how you can live a lie you go back and its some kind of fake thing where youre pretending to be noble and then im gone and youre stuck with a wife you dont love so then what have you got youll end up with nothing bud himself sat down now she put her head in her hands and began to sob help her he thought stop her hurting her face smeared and swelled and turned red and patchy her nose ran quiet racking shudders raced through her shoulders hed seen women cry that way on the turnpike when they looked at the carnage that had been their husbands or their children there was nothing you could do for them except hope that they healed and went on bud i love you holly it aint about love my son cant get another father and i cant get another family bud holly i cant be the kind of man who runs away thats where all this crime comes fromeverybody cutting and running i cant be that kind of a man you lied to me so many times maybe i did but i lied to myself too i thought we had a chance i aint the man to give you that chance you deserve the man wholl give it to you its so easy for you no maam its not its not anything like easy hollyi love you dont you see that oh bud she said why are you doing this to me lamar thought it would be a bigger house he was disappointed he knew cops werent rich unless they were crooked and he didnt think bud was crooked but he thought they did all right this little rundown house he cant be doing too well he said he aint doing as good as us said ruta beth this is a shitty neighborhood really said richard from the back its just a crummy civil service job he doesnt make twentyfive thousand a year i bet they were parked on the street half a block down from buds house they could see his big truck parked out front we going to hit them now daddy in out bang bang let me think some said lamar it was a sweet thought blow through the door just like at the stepfords catch him completely flatfooted and pump out gauge until nothing in the house lived then head out fast but he hadnt realized it would be in such a dense little neighborhood at the sound of shots thered be witnesses everywhere theyd get a fast id and before lamar could get them back to the farm the law would be on him second pewtie was fast himself that was the trouble he was wearing a coat he was probably carrying richard might panic who knew what might happen if he got to that goddamned colt all kinds of hell might happen plus he didnt know who was there maybe the whole goddamn swat team it was a swat team birthday party or something lamar had to fight to control that part of him that screamed to go in and leave hair and blood on the walls but he held steady letting the smart part of his brain take over okay he said we just going to stay calm now richard i want you to get out and mosey on down the street dont stop dont slow down none dont stare goddammit dont stare and then you come on back you let me know what you can see but dont you push it boy or ill have your balls for breakfast yes lamar richard got out of the car did not slam but rather eased shut the door maybe he was beginning to learn a little something he began to mosey on down daddy what you thinking i just want to play this sucker really right thats all hon then we done our duty to odell and we be off i cant wait ill do anything you want you know that daddy i know sweetie you are the best he felt her hand touch his neck gently i could come up front now and put my mouth to you you could have me in the mouth she said it would help you relax a bit i dont mind the idea didnt appeal to him not now he said we got work to do he watched as richard shuffled along the sidewalk slowly seemed to pause just a second and then moved on down the road then he repeated himself coming back it seemed to take forever but finally richard got in lamar started the car drove down the block and turned before he asked what hed seen theyre having some kind of fight or something hes yelling at her shes crying she came over to him he yelled something and she went away sounds like my mother and daddy said ruta beth you see anybody else said lamar turning another corner no sir no one you didnt see that boy of his no he must still be out okay okay lamar rounded another corner where we going daddy im just going to come in from another angle and park in a new place i dont want no citizen seeing peoples sitting in a car and calling the cops thats all we need goddamn i wish his boy was there thats what would make it really good he returned to the street and parked on the other side this time well beyond buds okay he said what the hell we go we get em both we blow em away man and wife and then its finished fair enough yes sir you up for this kind of mans work there richard i can do it lamar i want you in the back you go in the back anything comes your way without calling out your name you put a bullet in it but no ones coming your way im blowing them to hell and gone thats it lamar got out went back to the trunk opened it he slid out the browning semiauto just peeled the bolt back a bit to see the green doubleought shell in there and let the piece rest in his hand alongside his leg ruta beth had the other shotgun richard took out his revolver not yet you coonbrain not till you get in the house you ready yes sir you baby girl yes daddy then its butcher day we cant keep going over the same thing again and again were like cats in a damn bag it aint going to change so thats it youre just going to leave holly i i cant believe you can just leave i cant stay here forever it aint going to change oh bud he rose picked up his hat and walked to the door he opened the door then he turned she was still on the sofa she looked like hed beaten her her face was swollen and wet god holly he said i am so sorry you deserve so much you deserve so much more than i could ever give you she just sat there he tried to think of something more to say some magic sentence that would make it all better of course there wasnt one so in the end he merely turned and walked out if shed have cried out what would he have done a part of him badly wanted to go back a part of him didnt know what the hell he was doing he only knew he had to get out of there or hed never leave so he walked as if in a tunnel to the truck lamar was seventyfive feet away when the door of the house suddenly opened he saw bud big as life looking like john wayne in the doorway of a hundred westerns face grim broad stetson low over his eyes but bud didnt see him instead he walked in a straight line to the truck it was too far to shoot he could run at bud but bud would see or hear him again he fought his thirst for action and melted back sinking into the ground behind a hedge with his hand driving the girl and richard back they watched as bud climbed into the truck he was too far away to attack and they couldnt get back to the car in time to follow him bud started the truck and drove off wheres he going whispered richard shut up said lamar what do we do daddy what do we do lamar thought for a second and thought the same thing what do we do then he grinned i know he said holly sat there the sense of loss was on her like a heavy wool blanket the whole thing played out before her eyes and the words so close so close kept echoing in her mind but she could never get him to see it how perfect they were how theyd be more together than they ever would be apart then someone knocked on the door filling her heart with hope she rose and ran thinking bud bud bud and opened the door but it wasnt bud it was lamar chapter bud drove aimlessly through downtown lawton in the dark not really seeing anything except the blurred lights he followed no particular path and at various times found himself nearing the airport the great plains coliseum and gate number three even fort sill boulevard seemed desolate downtown those amber lights caught everything in a particularly harsh brown glow so that no true color stood out bud felt exactly the opposite of how he expected he thought hed feel liberated at last shorn of his secret life ready and willing to embrace with all seriousness of high purpose his old life which had been miraculously restored to him but no he just felt draggy slow morose grouchy he wanted to get in a fight impulses toward extreme anger flicked through him a part of him wanted to lash out maybe at jen maybe at jeff maybe at russ really at himself it wasnt depression so much as plain old regret images from all the sweet times with holly kept playing on a movie screen in his head so little to show shed given him so much and she got so little well holly let that be a lesson to you that will stand you in good stead sometime in the future no married men not worth it alls you get is promises and sex up front and pain and abandonment at the back end at last he turned down his own street and pulled into his own driveway jens station wagon was there in the carport he got out walked in the house seemed especially small and cheesy wasnt much of a house no room in it big as a motel room the furniture except what jen had been given by her mother was cheap bought on time in ruins before being paid off the linoleum in the kitchen was dingy the walls needed repainting his shop was a mess the lawn needed cutting for some reason it seemed to stink of a thousand meals tonight of backedup toilets and spilled beer and tv dinners and pizza kept in the refrigerator too long god how had all this happened how did he end up in a house he didnt love withwell she said about time all right jen he said so where is he hes with his friends i got him out in time to play and drove him over that coach said officially his suspension didnt start till tomorrow so the old geezer let him play git himself in a lot of trouble you ask me anyway jeff did fine a double and a single made a nice running catch late in the game it went into extra innings no no it didnt hes with his friends bud where were you oh i had some business what business bud whats going on her face was grave and her eyes locked onto him he could not meet their power ah it hung in the air finally he said look i understand i havent been the best of husbands lately jen i just had my head somewhere else okay ive told you some lies ive done some things i shouldnt have done but jen i want to tell you now flat out

bedroom his wife breathing heavily beside him all through the house it was quiet groggily he picked it up pewtie well howdy there bud came a voice from far far away it swam at bud from lost memories out of a pool of still green water he fought to recall it but its identity lingered beyond his consciousness who is this oh you know who it is bud its your old goddamned buddy lamar pye buds head

goddamn it bud barked oh and bud lamar asked in a voice rich in charm you want her back tell you what bring some guns he hung up bud jumped out of bed fought to clear his head but really there was no decision to make not one he could face anyway if he called headquarters he could play the game and sooner or later close with lamar with a swat team choppers snipers the works the professionals would handle it as well as they could but it wouldnt matter one look at other boys at his private party with bud and lamar would cut her up without so much as a byyourleave and take his goddamned chances with the lawmen he didnt give a damn he didnt fear his own death he only wanted buds bud pulled on jeans boots and a black shirt he grabbed a sports coat only to cover the guns hed be wearing bud what is going on i have to go bud you he faced his wife im sorry i have to go one last time if you love me you let me go you trust me you let me go then he raced downstairs opened the gun safe there they were he pulled on his shoulder rig and the high hip holster and then busily threaded rounds into the magazines all of them jamming them up with hollow tips if his thumbs hurt he didnt notice it just seemed to take so goddamned long he holstered the beretta and the the went behind his belt on his belly then he looked for a rifle knowing only a fool fights with a pistol if he has the choice but came up short until he remembered that lever gun outside still under the seat in his truck he closed the safe a shape loomed in the dark dad it was jeff jeff ive got to go fast dad whats never you mind dad jeff i love you no matter what you hear or what they tell you or what happens i love you i love your mother and your brother more than anything now i have something to handle and i have to handle it you stay here and take care of your mother itll be fine i swear to you dad jeff i have to go dad i love you bud grabbed his youngest son and gave him a bone squeezing hug he felt the boys ribs and beating heart under that sheathing of muscle go on now he said and dashed out bud got to the truck worried now absurdly that he was low on gas but he had gas he gunned it whirled out of the quiet neighborhood for geronimo fortyfive miles away he had about fifty minutes but suddenly a thought came to him goddamnedest thing from where he didnt know but an idea just flashed into his head he saw a gas station phone booth and stopped and ran to dial you have a number for a c d henderson out on thirtyeighth it took a few seconds that number isnt listed sir goddammit this is a police emergency im oklahoma highway patrol sergeant russell b pewtie id number rtwentyfour and i want that number give it to me or give me your supervisor soon enough bud had the number and called the phone seemed to ring and ring then a groggy womans voice answered the old woman and bud asked for the lieutenant carl he heard her say its some old boy for you hendersons raspy voice came on lo he said lieutenant its bud pewtie bud my god you still have your keys dont you you can still get into that goddamned office i could break in if i had to now what listen to me you drunken old goat you get your

and that god damed location now get cracking you old buzzard and dont you let me down bud something like a sob ran through the old mans voice bud ill try i aint the man i once was well goddamn which of us is except for goddamned lamar bud hung up checked his watch saw that he was down to fortyfive minutes he jumped in his truck and gunned it so said lamar your old man whats he like you know in the sack you pig she said tell him she thought hes made a mistake he came to the wrong house he got the wrong woman and then what then he just kills me thats all and he still gets bud how big is he is he real big or is he just normal ill bet hes just normal she shook her head with disgust yeah hes just normal here you want to see something you want to see something like you never seen before look at this hold her ruta beth they had hollys hands tied behind her tightly and her feet tied she felt so helpless and sick he was the man whod killed her husband it was this grotesque whitetrash tough boy with stumps for fingers some malnourished little weasel of a farm girl and the other one a soft and delicate manboy with tussled hair and the look of no guts at all on his prissy plumplipped little face now ruta beth went behind her and held her head lamar stood and undid his trousers oh god moaned holly and fought to look away but ruta beth had surprising strength and governed her head until it was locked in the proper direction lamar pulled his shorts down and unfolded what looked like an electric cable it was a penis the size of a reptile slack and coiled its foreskin capping it hah you see anything like that you look at daddy said the girl go on you look at the king you aint never seen nothing like that thats the king she thought shed gag you just dream about it honey you just go on and dream until your husband shows up bud reached the exxon station with a minute to spare but lamars call was late by five minutes when it came he ripped the phone off the hook yeah well howdy bud how you doing you have a rough old time cut the shit pye bud biggest mistake i done made is not walking over to you when you was bellydown and capping you with that think of the trouble itd saved us both where are you oh i aint atelling you got a long night ahead of you maybe ill bring you to me and maybe i wont maybe ill run you into an ambush maybe im on a goddamned cellular phone right now looking at your ass through the scope of a rifle just twitch my finger and its all over he laughed he was extracting immense pleasure from it you havent hurt her honey you tell your husband what you just saw there was the muffled struggle of someone being pushed to the phone bud holly oh bud he made me look they forced me to look holly i at his dick they made me look at it the fury rose in bud like steam he wanted to slam the phone against the booth until it broke dont lose it he warned himself thats what he wants hell toy with her hell torture her in infantile ways to show his powerthe size of his pecker petty pains maybe drawing on her skin hell do it so that she can tell you so that you go crazier and crazier and at the end you are hopelessly jangled and unable to operate it doesnt mean a thing the only thing that counts is getting there and getting her out but he knew too that lamar expected him crazy he lost something if he didnt let pye know how nuts this was making him pye he screamed pye you sonofabitch ill kill you dont you fucking touch her dont you touch her lamar laughed again bud you still there you got to git all the way to snyder to the eleven on north of snyder you best git you going old bubba yes you best git a move on or ill do more than show her the lizard ill make her pet it maybe even give it a lil kiss lamar hung up quickly bud dialed c d hendersons old office in the city hall annex but there was no answer the old detective heard the phone ring hed been there five minutes what was the point of answering it he opened his coat and removed the bottle of i w harper only about a third left he opened it took a taste liquid flame bright and deep immediately a tremor passed through him knocked him into a blurred state and then pulled him out again he reached under his coat and his fingers touched something hard and cold it was the curvature of the grip of a revolver he pulled it out feeling its oily heft a colt frontier model with an ivory grip in special as manufactured in new haven connecticut in the year the rainbow of the casehardened colors had long since worn off turning the piece almost brown his grandaddy had carried that gun before oklahoma was a state and his daddy had carried it too both as lawmen cd opened the loading gate pulled the hammer to half cock and rotated the cylinder to see the primers of five tarnished rounds sited in the cylinder so that the firing pin rested on an empty chamber the way any sensible man carried a colt only fools carried a sixshooter with six shots sooner or later theyd thump the hammer accidently and blow a foot off cd was no fool but he didnt think for a moment he could help bud and he had some idea that a terrible terrible weight rode on all this hed fail a drunken wasted old man people would die bud whoever else was involved and lamar would go on and when that happened cd thought he might thumb back the hammer of the old colt put the muzzle in his mouth and pull the trigger he felt so used up he was hardly there his life was a waste things were changing so fast that he couldnt keep up he was sixtyeight years old and should have retired five years back and enjoyed his time but no vanity anger whatever had driven him okay you old goat he told himself do some detecting think think you got a new dot to connect a third point a third piece of evidence a girl a young girl how does that help a category that is not a category a young girl how do they connect how could they connect original theory lamar would go for help or find help in the criminal community in one of its forms they would always go to their own kind so he would go to the cycle gangs or the indian boys running scams against their own tribes on the reservations or the organized crime interests in tulsa or ok city or the drug networks supplied by south american gangs but run by niggers in the inner city hispanics or italian groups otherwise or that small shifting mobile culture of armed robbers professional contract killers enforcers and tough guys who serviced the bigger gangs on a strictly freelance basis but hed gone to none of those or at least none of those that could be demonstrated to have corresponded with the one known empirical clue the tire tread that could only be worn by a small japanese car a hyundai or a nissan or a toyota in three model years nothing nada maybe it was just wrong the assumption maybe hed found somebody not in the life at all but no lamar however extravagant was a type and types run to pattern and lamars pattern was simple he was a professional criminal a longterm convict he would only feel comfortable with his peers whoever he was bunking with would in some way be in the culture would have stepped beyond the parameters of the law and would be on the computer network but there was nothing the old man snapped on his computer terminal it had access to oklahoma department of motor vehicles and criminal records at the state felony level he could define a field and see what he got so he tried the most basic thing he requested that the computer churn out a listing of all females between the ages of sixteen and thirty who registered or had registered a car in the known range searching searching searching the computer blinked at him for a few minutes and then a list of names rose against its blue background he was not adroit at the mechanics of the computer he could not physically manipulate the cursor without thinking so he simply ordered the goddamned thing to print out it clicked and chattered across the room and he went to the printer ripped the page out and then examined what he had it was a list of eightythree names all of them meaningless all of them unknown maybe one of them maybe not he went next to the known felons listingthat is the felons who also had registered the right carsand hoped there might be some correspondence a co registration that possibly suggested a daughterfather thing there was none no young woman with a car in the range could be linked to a known felon with the same car at least according to the records then very slowly he typed each of the eightythree names into the computer and commanded felony record check it took the better part of an hour resultszero richard said lamar come over here shyly almost richard advanced richard how long since you had a woman ah lamar thats private oh god moaned holly now lady lo okie here at richard now whats he got this bud pewtie you married aint got hes a fine upstanding man hes got a true talent a godgiven thang hes loyal and hardworking hes educated richard you went to a college didnt you richard said yes see hes a smart man he could do you proud you know if you play your cards right when this is all over i might be able to git you a date with richard lamar exploded once again into laughter then he said you know richard you could touch her a little really she wouldnt mind would you hon please said holly oh god dont hurt me or touch me oh it wouldnt hurt a bit richard would you like to touch this young woman some place or maybe just look at her you could look at her all you wanted at least for a little while have you ever seen a girl this pretty without no clothes on richard i mean a real one not in no book the terrible thing was richard did want to touch her and look at her she was a really beautiful young thing hed never had any woman of course it just hadnt worked out not that he was a homosexual he was sort of a zero sexual but now he looked at her and the deep stirrings of lust tingled in him it was her helplessness that excited him the way the rope cut into her white freckly skin the way her flesh blossomed around the raw pressure of the rope the way her neck was faintly reddish as she squirmed the look of complete horror on her face and her goddamned prettiness she wore bermuda shorts nikes without socks and a polo shirt she looked like some kind of coed or something but then he thought why is she so young lamar why is she so young what you mean look at her she isnt thirty she isnt twentyfive how could she have that son who plays baseball did she marry him when she was ten she was in his house she got a wedding ring they was fighting who else could she be but then lamar squinted and looked closely at holly how old are you im twentysix she said i am his wife but that aint your kid no jeff is not my son bud and i havent had our children yet he had his two boys with his first wife but she died and he married me two years ago its the happiest two years of my life hes a wonderful kind decent man hes brave hes strong you ought to be ashamed of what youre doing well aint you a goddamned miss mouthful that sonofabitch shot my cousin over twentyfive times just blew the life out of that boy you are such scum she said you may get me and you may get bud but they will get you in the end lamar leaned close dont you get it he said i dont give a shit i aint got much of a string to play out anyways i just want to settle up you think im afraid to die boy then you aint never been in no hard places i tell you and you dont know what hard places do to a man in this room were all going to be dead tonight or by noon at least but by god i will settle my dues and leave this world without no uncashed lous in my jeans bud blew through speed limits like a man in flames and toward the end gave up on red lights it was near two fortyfive the streets deserted he charged up and down hills cut across dirt roads traversing tillman and comanche counties on sheer instinct then hit just beyond cache for a straightline run to snyder he hit the eleven just beyond the town and found it still open and someone on the phone he pulled his badge police business we need this phone free an indian boy looked at his badge and spat on the ground and went back to his call bud pulled the and rammed it into the boys throat you sonofabitch you git or you and i will have serious business and you wont like that a goddamned bit in the face of the weapon and buds fury the boy melted hung up the phone and ran off into the dark now bud felt a moment of shame having given in to the cops worst temptation the display of brute power to require obedience you cant just pull guns on civilians on another night it was grounds for suspension not tonight fuck it tonight he looked at his watch it was five after three shit maybe lamar had called while the indian was on the phone he sat breathing hard his mind empty the seconds clicked by suddenly it was ten after christ he thought blew it but the phone rang pye oh bud sorry is late just gittin to know your lady here dont you hurt her damn shes a pretty one let her go youll have me let her go well see if youre a good boy who knows maybe ill cut you some slack if you got attitude bud i may have to let her have a taste of some discipline you know shit maybe shell even like it goddamn you pye best hurry on bud you got to get all the way to toleens by four oh you going to be a busy boy lamar hung up bud stared at the phone in sick fury toleens toleens where the hell was that he hoped he had a map in the truck but instead he dropped a quarter and dialed the police annex hendersons number hello lt henderson bud bud could tell from the tragic tone in the old mans voice nothing im trying the old man said i just aint had no luck christ said bud they have a hostage theyll kill her youve got to figure this thing out bud you give me the okay ill put the call in you go bout your business we can track by air a chopper ill have two busloads of the best swat operators in the business ten minutes behind you well take that place down and the hostage can walk free hed hear the goddamn chopper you know he would lieutenant you cant play straight and outsmart lamar hes too goddamned good he may even be watching me now and knows im pulling something you have to come through you have to only the sound of the lieutenants raspy breathing came you havent been drinking son i drink every damn day of my life i won four of my seven gunfights drunk all right all right ohtoleens you ever heard of it a town its on between gotebo and cooperton had a murder there in fiftynine yeah got it theres a pay phone in the town hell boy the pay phone is the town git on your way the lieutenant stared at the phone listening to the dial tone in the seconds after bud hung up then he placed it down on the cradle and put his fingers on the bridge of his nose between his eyes and squeezed the flare of light as his optic nerves fired somehow pleased him then the room returned deserted green junky a police station room like all the ones hed spent a long life in he felt used up lacking will a woman at least would die tonight maybe bud too a woman a policeman dying too young why should tonight be any different than any other night it happened the world over why was it his responsibility to intercede he tried to tell himself it didnt matter not cosmically but it did it mattered so goddamn much he wanted to cry he looked at the list eightthree names of young women who owned a car possibly linked to the robbery a category that wasnt a category was it all an illusion was he a vain fool trying to tease meaning out of random events was there no pattern at all break it down two elements young and woman what did woman tell him a daughter of a criminal possibly a criminal herself not in the records no correspondence to the records he had a laugh how much of it depended on the records so much of police work was simply accountancy human accountancy the recording of accessible fact that may on faith in some distant time tell us something when we most need it woman nothing what about young what could there be about young about youth about immaturity that fit into this or that touched on any issue of the central conceit a category that isnt a category how would a young girl get to know lamar who had been in jail for years and years how could she meet him only way she could write him hmmmm why would she write him how would she hear about him maybe she was one of those strange desperate creatures who wrote to convicts sent them money proposed to them it was a sickness but it was there and if that was it thered be no category for her or wouldnt prison officials have noted it that was where they started their investigations when a prisoner escaped once again nothing he returned again to the component young what could that have to do with it a young woman would probably not be attracted to convicts it was more of a twisted spinster thing why a young woman she had to be a daughter but presume he told himself since the daughter route appeared to lead nowhere presume she is not a daughter or a sister or a relationship she is a young woman she is involved with convicts what would involve her with convicts other than her relations what he paused something floated in the dark just beyond him translucent ghostly in the still air there seemed to be a sudden stillness as if the night itself had ceased to function time had stopped what would involve her draw her to them what she was a victim that would drive her away what she committed a crime herself it was so simple and in the next second wholly it detonated in all its beauty into his mind he saw into it now clearly and absolutely a category that isnt a category a minor who commits a capital crime but the court records are sealed because shes a minor theres no category for that one cannot access it through normal channels cd blinked opened the bottle and swallowed a well earned blast of harpers if the court records are sealed i cant get into them maybe tomorrow but not now it angered him so close and yet so far who else would have records and then the next step easy as pie the newspaper cd opened a little black book he carried with him always and located the number of the managing editor of the lawton constitution he didnt give a damn what time it was as he called hello came the groggy voice parker parker its goddamned c d henderson cd what in hell never you mind you got anybody down at the paper tonight ahsure skeleton crew night telegraph editor night photo editor late makeup sports desk probably a few odd bodies lying around aint you all on some sort of computer system nexus its called i thought listen here ill give you a scoop and a half you do me a favor you call whoevers in charge down here you tell him i want the name of all convicted female teenaged murderers in the last ten years out of your records not the court records your records i want it fast okay parker iwhat is never you mind parker you just git me that information and ill take care of you have them call me heresoonest i mean soonest lives at stake were going to try and save an innocent woman and put a guilty man into the ground where he deserves to go the joy of it was that he could watch bud without risking himself or even leaving lamar lay in the gully with a pair of binoculars just down the road from the red dirt turnoff that led to ruta beths house he looked at his watch if bud had left the exxon station twenty twentyfive minutes ago on the way to toleens the only road he could take was this one and hed be heaving into sight in a few minutes and then what a chopper overhead a swat bus and convoy ten minutes behind would his truck have an aerial suggesting he was in radio contact it was all very interesting to lamar but of course the hard part was not shooting bud would roll by it would be so easy to nail him with four or five gauge blasts take him down and do him here on the spot lamar saw it the crashed truck the holes in the door the smell of gasoline broken glass everywhere the lawman in pain begging for mercy lamar putting the shotgun muzzle up close to him feeling him squirm a bit and then the blast the blood spatters pieces everywhere oh so nice it seemed imagination big word pictures in your head but lamar knew they could have done him at the ball game or at any of the pay phones lamar forced himself into the hunters patience check it out he told himself use the edge you got yourself dont rush things do it right make him pay make him pay real bad imagination far off he saw headlights their swift approach indicated reckless speed lamar was able to tell quickly enough it was a ford f blue and white and as it approached he dialed buds tense face into focus squareheaded man eyes hooded under the stetson dark clothes driving fast but well steady as a rock there was a set to his face that lamar remembered from the stepford farm as poor bud walked up toward the house and he and odell prepared to take them down he looked so body proud so full of his own self and he still had that bullnecked swagger to him though now cut through with so much tension that he hardly seemed human he flashed by lamar toward his destination still a good twenty miles down the road not knowing how close he was to being reeled in next lamar looked at how the truck rode which appeared to be normal it didnt ride low on its tires which meant he wasnt carrying a big load which meant a trooper swat team or gaggle of texas ranger snipers wasnt hunkered down in the truckbed it had no extra aerial lamar watched the taillights grow tiny then fade and listened till the whine of tires on asphalt died away he put the glasses down and listened hard no sound he waited and watched only the low night wind pushing across the wide plains now and then the squawk of some night creature no choppers followed bud a thousand feet up and the road itself remained empty for the longest time a flat blank ribbon glowing ever so slightly in starlight no convoy appeared nothing satisfied lamar rose and headed back toward the farmhouse enjoying the power he felt under the wide night sky it was like being invisible like being a god he felt a stirring in his crotch at the promise of action he hardly ever thought about such things for they were so much a part of the way he was but now he felt it pure and blood deep he was the lion he was the king and he was about to feed bud hit toleens which was exactly one decrepit old general store windblown and nearly barren of paint with two gas pumps out front and a pay phone next to the front door he pulled over and waited checking his watch nearly four hed just made it he waited until ten after now what was wrong goddammit he began to grow nervous this was the perfect setup at any moment gunshots might explode out of the dark taking him down lamar might be just across the road watching him twit nervously on the porch before blowing him away at leisure but the phone rang finally yes well old bud how are you cut the shit lamar you havent hurt her not yet anyway prove it now dont you go using that attitude on me lawman i dont have to prove nothing you want your woman you better do what i say or the hell with her and then i will hurt her where are you oh not yet pewtie we aint done playing tag you got a bit more running around to do i want to be real sure tell me no sir i want you headed east now toward chickasha town called anadarko thats your next stop another gas station on a phillips you got a hour ill never make it in an hour sure you will then well talk some more and maybe you can come git me and maybe you cant he hung up quickly bud dialed the annex he got a busy signal goddamn he felt like throwing the phone that old goat what the hell was he up to now what leave and drive like hell to anadarko which was just barely makable in an hour or give goddamned c d henderson another few minutes stretching it out even further he raced to the truck started the engine but then he turned it off he ran back to the phone dialed again the phone rang once and cd picked it up bud who else would it be yes just got a call from a newspaper reporter in a fifteenyearold gal shot and killed her mama and her papa and served seven years before being released from the kingsville hospital for the criminally insane i called there and talked to a night nurse who knew her well she continually wrote to people who had killed or assaulted their parents richard richard she wrote to richard and no one never bothered to check on what letters came his way in prison as he was the passive partner and only there a few months but theres your connection bud i checked her out against the list of car owners shes registered in a ninetyone toyota tercel holy christ she lives on a place right off in kiowa county way out where its empty and barren just the far side of the wichitas her name is ruta beth lull i just drove by it he ran me by it to check me out now hes going to bounce me around for a bit just to get me completely tired its half an hour away you better get there bud you got work to do thank you old man you are one hell of a detective i believe i am son i believe i am now im going to give you ten minutes thats all thats what i owe you then the cavalry is coming fair enough and bud remember front sight center mass put em in the ground bud all of em chapter holly tried to clear her head but it buzzed with fright she couldnt stop staring at them lamar was big and oily and somehow engorged with testosterone he couldnt stop grinning he was like a movie star on the other hand that poor pitiful sally who was his girl ruta something some oldfashioned farm name was nervous as a cat she was really the scary one a tight grim scrawny little mouse with the smallfeatured face she associated with the inbred but the prize was the one they called richard god shed laugh if she wasnt so scared richard had dreamy puffy tussled hair and though he was big he was soft he had creamy hands like a piano players and a little dance in his walk when he moved all these rhythms were unleashed he was of no known sex with his prissy parched little lips and his strangely disaffected way of moving as if he heard everything a second later what a trio these insane fools had killed her own husband as he lay on the ground and then terrorized oklahoma for two months they seemed like some hill clan white trash who hadnt ever seen a toilet that flushed she almost laughed they were so unbearably squalid and she knew theyd kill bud that was the terrible part theyd take his life without hesitation and theyd take her life what you looking at baby girl lamar suddenly demanded bringing his face close to hers what scum you are she said you are the worst scum lady he said you know i could rape you did it for years and years to any woman i could find oh the things i done the law only knows but a third they could punish me for a thousand years and be nowheres near even out on the deal but you wont whys that cause a tiny part of you is scared of bud pewtie you only got the best of him oncethen he got the best of you its third time coming up and maybe you aint quite the stud you think you are lamar laughed damn he said you got a mouth on you half a mind to keep you around for comedy you could help ruta beth with the cooking ruta beth you need a helper no daddy said ruta beth furiously sorry said lamar we aint hiring today then he laughed again eyes glinting in the low light bud put his lights out and flew by the dirt road entrance he saw nothing on except the light of a beatup old house a mile away against the darkness of the prairie here and there the blotch of a grove of mesquites or scrub oaks undulating prairies and crests and the faroff mountains he drove a half mile and slowed to a halt careful not to let his brakes squeak he tried to think did he want to park by the road and come in over the fields did he want to try to go down the entrance road slow lights out he could probably get pretty close but surely lamar would have someone looking out as for the walk in it seemed so long he glanced at his watch ten to four he wanted to make his move before they called and got no answer going off the schedule just a little would set lamars hair to bristling hed begin to sniff things out you have to move now and fast he thought you cannot fuck around you have to go in and shoot lamar in the first second without lamar they would fall apart though he thought hed have to shoot the girl too he had no illusions if shed sold her soul to lamar she was a target and had to be hit and maybe richard too though he had fewer worries about richard richard had no guts and would quit in an instant if lamar was gone bud eased ahead another quarter mile and came to another long straight dirt road that seemed to lead nowhere it simply vanished in the darkness he thought its only a half a mile down and roughly parallel i can drive down it turn right go into fourwheel buck my way through the grass and scrub and any barbed wire i find then hed close from the rear shoot lamar with the rifle from outside kick in the door and take his chances with the girl and richard maybe holly would make it maybe she wouldnt it was the best chance she had as long as he committed to it went in hard and shot to kill okay he thought time to go his vest he hadnt taken time to put on his vest i hope my luck holds he thought but he doubted it would lamar watched the slow tick of the minute hand as it swept its way around the face of the big clock on ruta beths mantel round and round it went sucking seconds off the face of the earth drawing bud pewtie nearer to his fate hed done his homework at four bud would be in anadarko lamar would bring him back toward odette looking for a signal bud would never know where it would be so hed be looking hard spooked and tired theyd bring him on in to the farm hed sit in the truck cab with his wife trussed up in plain view then slowly hed have to get out and go toward her thats when theyd take him down hard with buckshot in the legs under the vest he was sure to be wearing then lamar would crown him once twice maybe three times with the shotgun butt and drag him into the barn the hard work would be done in the barn it would take most of the morning no one would hear the screams then when he was gone lamar decided hed have the woman have her all the ways there were to have her it excited him that shed know it would be her last thing maybe hed give a taste to richard didnt know yet then hed kill her out of kindness hed decided to shoot her in the head daddy yes its about time he looked back toward the clock five till oh give him a few more minutes baby he said let him enjoy hes got some things acoming like a freight train richard was very nervous he kept licking his lips and trying not to look at the woman whose helplessness and fear excited him hed never had such a response to a woman before but he was also very frightened this pewtie was a tough customer hed stood up to and killed odell and not even the violent and fearless black inmates would stand against odell as usual it was his imagination that betrayed him he could not quiet it he saw that lamars great gift was his ability to concentrate and act whereas he richard was always bedeviled by rogue thoughts erratic impulses suppose the buckshot didnt knock pewtie down suppose he got a gun into action suppose lamar tripped as he rushed toward him it could go wrong a hundred different ways although when lamar planned something it usually didnt go wrong lamar just got things done that was all but this was the last hard thing for a while lamar had said they would leave find new territory lamar wanted also to find a skin artist to get the tattoo finished and he wanted richard to work really hard at that richard didnt want to disappoint lamar lamar was a god to him lamar stood above him and dominated the sky scape like a tyrant king richard had yielded in all totality replacing a mother he feared and loved with a man he feared and loved i am a slave he thought i love being a slave he looked at the girl again and felt a twitch in his dick then he touched the heavy revolver in his belt and looked at king lamar on his throne and swore eternal fealty bud drove without his lights on in low gear guided by starlight wishing there was a moon but there was no moon he watched the tick of the odometer and when at last the ninetenths mark turned over into a new mile he halted he got out and locked the warn hubs on the front axle it was as dark as a convicts dream the wind always the wind snapped across the dry prairie he looked saw that the gulch between the road and the field didnt look bad climbed back in he eased into fourwheel drive pushed slowly ahead and felt just the faintest sense of resistance a fence wire it went down with the sound of metal pranging against metal he lurched ahead and the truck sank abruptly at a wretched angle shimmied down a bank and seemed to come to a rest shit bud thought dropping into low range and giving the gas a feather touch the engines muttering deepened and the truck bucked a bit then began to pull itself out of the gully it shuddered free with a last grind of tire against earth and he was on clear ground he zoomed up into the field and began to pick his way across it no resistance the truck rumbled almost silently along and he steered by a compass on the dashboard avoiding the stunted mesquite trees bypassing the low hollows clotted with scrub oak the prairie was boundless but like the surface of the sea its flatness was illusion bud rose and fell through crests and dips in the earth itself before him only the most basic of pictures darkness that was air and slightly less darkness that was land and the line of demarcation between them too vague to make out but at last he seemed to come to a crest and he halted he could see ruta beth tuns place a flicker of heat lightning lit the sky briefly illuminating the farm it had a strange familiarity about it as if from a dream why did he know it then he realized hed been here before when they were searching for the tires lamar must have fooled him that day he tried to remember the girl and got no image why couldnt he remember he saw the barn he saw the house freshly painted white in the starlight a single light was on it was about three hundred yards away it occurred to him to try and drive closer no too risky they wouldnt see a man approaching particularly if he kept the barn between himself and them but the truck might make a noise or create too much motion it was too risky bud returned to the cab he slipped out of his coat and laid his hat on the seat this wasnt hat work no sir then he reached behind the seat and slid out the winchester carbine model of though this one was manufactured in gently he eased the lever forward cam ming a soft point into the chamber closing the lever he groped again behind the seat found the box of ammunition and extracted one more round which he inserted in the loading gate there that brought it up to eight rounds a carbine wasnt the best for this kind of work but it wasnt so bad either he could fire fast it was accurate and that soft point bullet would splatter like a pancake as it moved through whatever it hit hopefully lamars brain hell texas rangers had carried them for years and they always got their man he touched his other guns counting them off beretta mm colt beretta all loaded all with spare mags jammed with hollowpoints bud returned to the ridge studied the farm glad that he recognized it and that hed be making his fight on ground hed at least seen before there was nothing else to think of or do oh yeah a prayer hey he said looking upward old man please help me tonight you know i need it bad then he swallowed and went off to meet lamar he scurried down the slope jogging trying not to breathe hard watching as with surly inevitability the house and barn grew larger as he moved down the slope his angle on the house changed and it seemed to disappear behind the barn new fears assaulted him what if lamar had recruited a gang what if not three awaited him but ten twenty well then you die he thought and so does holly but so be it in half an hour the swat people would arrive the gunfight would leave no survivors at all like that crazy thing in wacopeople eaten up in the insanity of the moment he got to the barn again encountering familiarity he saw the oven that was a kiln the wood tables the racks of drying vessels the cans of paint glaze whatnot the brushes stored carefully in jars glinting softly in the starlight all strange all familiar yes now he remembered she was a potter he bought a pot from her he remembered the pot with its jagged flashes of color it was the only colorful thing about her he now saw her a drab scrawny young woman he saw exactly how she could fall for the power and the glory of a lamar especially as she herself had already known the sick thrill of standing over something that had been alive until just a very few seconds ago but still she was a girl bud hoped he could kill the girl just kill her shoot her dead in the head or upper torso and think nothing of it but that little bit of doubt upset him not that she was poignant and needy but only that she was such a drab little creature un stirred by lifes possibilities he shook his head as he slid through the barn crouching in its doorway he studied what was before him the house was twentyfive yards off and he could see the back door and dim light from the firstfloor windows two cars had been parked in the yard around toward the front of the house and he could also make out what appeared to be a rickety porch out front he first thought of the cars escape backing out of the barn he circled around again in a wide low arc and slithered up to the cars neither was locked one was the toyota that had so bedeviled everybody and the other a black trans am gingerly bud opened each leaned in and reached up under the dash to a nest of wires he didnt have time to find the ignition wire but simply with a hard yank pulled them all nobody was driving anywhere tonight he next crawled to the side of the house the window was tall and he couldnt quite see in but from the low secondary light he gauged the room to be empty and dark probably the kitchen its only illumination a doorway into the larger room or hallway he snaked around back to find a door he tried it it was locked he looked around quickly for something to secure the door from this side figuring after he shot lamar richard would head for the nearest exit and could be counted on to come to rest against a locked door ready to give up clothesline he ran to it and cut it free with his pocketknife then came back and swiftly wrapped loops about the doorknob drew the rope tightly to the clothesline post and tied it securely a good working cowmans knot richard wouldnt be able to get shit open maybe hed go out a window and into the fields theyd find him thirty yards out nursing a broken ankle bud glimpsed at his watch four a no two ways about it time to go he slid around the base of the house to the edge of the porch and peered in the front door was open though a screen door blocked entry the screen would be easy to shoot through though he drew closer to the doorway and peered into the blaze of light and sensed bodies but couldnt get a clear look he stepped out a bit further until at last he saw lamar pye big as life its own self standing by the couch lamar gripped the phone tightly behind him was ruta beth a dark blur bud couldnt see richard but figured he was there somewheres and he made out a head crumpled in one corner of the couch holly the rifle came up to buds shoulder he kneeled looking for support the light wasnt great but it was enough he could see the bead of the front sight it wobbled described a filigree in the air and bud sought to capture it too hard driving it wild he exiled a chunk of air from his lungs and willed steadiness into his limbs kill lamar throw lever kill ruta beth two easy shots a second apart lamar dies with his brains blown out ruta beth wont react in time to move and shes the next easy target into the chest then dump the rifle draw the beretta and blow into the house if you see richard pop him otherwise grab holly and flee yet even now he paused just a second dwarfed by the coldness of it all no goddammit he told himself do his ass send him to hell for breakfast bud concentrated on the front sight as he pressed the trigger and the bead was right there on lamars broad almost handsome face he felt it break and there was perhaps a tenth of a second as the hammer fell when bud sensed the world suspended like a note held too long beyond human endurance time had stopped there was no sound no movement no sense of life anywhere the rifle fired its flash draining details from the dark night and the door to the house shattered into a billion pieces a sleet of bitter chaosgoddamn not a screen but a goddamn glass storm door in the middle of hot summer whod ever have imagined thatand lamar sank instantly from view but with such goddamned energy and purpose that bud knew the bullet had been deflected and that he had not been hit lamar had tried again the phone rang and rang now what the hell was wrong with that boy wheren fuck is he he demanded maybe he had a flat or an accident said richard not this old boy he aint that goddamn type he is a accident darkening with fury and frustration he stood in the room what the fuck the ringing grated through the earpiece of the phone but no one picked up he tried to run through ways it could have gone wrong had he been too fancy should he have done the fuck as he drove along the road is there any way any way at all they could be on to him no hed been too careful they werent that clever he stood watching the girl curled beneath him bound and gagged helplessly he could sense ruta beth behind him richard was off some goddamned place fretting over some goddamned thing the door exploded next thing lamar was on the floor how he got there he didnt know just his fast reflexes taking over getting him down there flat and safe lamar it was ruta beth standing dumbly geddown he screamed they here ruta beth hit the floor im hurt daddy goddamn said lamar oh shit said richard from the kitchen you hit bad baby girl neck oh daddy it hurts you gotta shoot back goddammit or we are cat piss he himself pulled holly off the couch and to him as a human shield he felt her heart beating against her ribs like a trapped little bird a temptation came to put a bullet in her head but he knew that was stupid he slithered to the window dragging her with him and snuck a peek out to see nothing smelled just the faintest whisper of smoke hanging in the air he calculated swiftly a swat sniper wouldnt have missed not hardly and by now thered have been dozens of gum balls flashing big boys on loudspeakers choppers the goddamned whole world getting ready to kill him but he didnt see a goddamned thing he knew who it was how the hell did he find him goddamn richard boy the lights get em out lamar i goddamn boy get them out only a scream would get richard moving somehow the worthless piece of shit began to flutter around and in a second the lights had vanished another second passed and suddenly lamar heard a high keening sound sounded like an animal being burned in a fireplace or something but under the whine of fear and slobbery peepants panic he recognized richards tones locked locked locked richard was sobbing he meant the back door lamar thought fucking pewtie had locked off the back door smart motherfucker no other way out except the side window ruta beth you okay oh daddy it hurts so bad i got blood every damned place can you shoot baby girl what can you shoot goddammit ruta beth got to answer him its that fucker pewtie youre all i got not really he had the girl too he felt her squirm under him i dont think so lamar i got blood on my hands so slippery she was losing it fast thats okay baby girl it dont matter youre still the goddamn champ listen here i want you to slide out the door he aint going to shoot he sees youre wounded you yell for help hes going to say put your hands up and when i hear his voice i can nail him ruta beth crawled by him leaving a black slime of blood she got to the doorway and somehow pulled her way up then she stepped out on the porch stood under the bright porch light lamar kneeled on buds wifes neck calmed himself and studied the darkness out the window waiting for a scream he had five doubleoughts in the browning cut down when it came hed flash to the area and pump the gun empty if it was only one man as he now suspected hed at least hurt him bud had fallen back behind the trans am almost directly to the left of the house goddamn goddamn it had all fallen apart now what lamar knew he was there and would just as sure as winter be calculating counter moves if he hadnt already cut hollys throat but what bud saw astonished him it was the girl ruta beth tun she stood groggily her hands up she was drenched with blood he hadnt even fired a second shot then he realized the comedy king was having a good time tonight with the play of whimsy he had decreed that the screen door turned out to be a storm door and it would deflect buds bullet from lamar but the same laugher saw that it hit ruta beth dont shoot she said is bad hurt she took a step forward bud put the front sight right on her head the range was thirty feet he could hit her in the face easy dont shoot she said taking a wobbly step forward he felt the trigger strain against his finger do it he told himself do it and move on to the other keep your hands high and come out and lie face down in the the window lit bright with harsh flame as someone fired five fast shotgun blasts at him bud had no consciousness of drawing back only a sense of an explosion all around him as the buckshot tore into the hood of the car and spalled spastically against the windshield blowing shreds of glass outward as it turned the sheet into webbed quicksilver abruptly the left side of his face went to sleep for what must have been a whole second then began to sting he touched his face blood but had anything penetrated he felt a core of ache spread through his brain and the suffocating odor of gunpowder swirled around him but he seemed not to be mortally hit next he heard the crash of a window from the other side of the house lamar had jumped free lamar knew the lawman would do the right thing which was the wrong thing he couldnt just shoot poor ruta beth and indeed lamar saw a shape hunkered by the left front fender of the trans am bending over a rifle and in a second hed brought the sawedoff browning up and unleashed its whole tube of shells the bright fireworks of the gun flashes ate up the world and lamar now wished for half a second he hadnt cut it down for with a fullstocked and barreled weapon the highway patrolman would have been easy meat but the gun bucked in his hands and he struggled to bring it back on line and each fresh blast lit the night for what seemed miles though curiously so intent was he on the mechanics of it he didnt hear a thing then the gun came up dry the smoke seethed in the air and he thought hed hit but he wasnt sure only one thing remained now to get clear to get out nothing else mattered if he got out of the house and across the fields he could flag down a truck and commandeer it or steal a car from some square john or some such but his ticket out was the goddamned girl though shed slow him somewhat but pewtie wouldnt spray in his direction with the little wife along come on sweetheart he said rising and pulling her up the now useless shotgun fell away he had a sig with seven cartridges but no reloads too bad didnt have time to look for other magazines now in one powerful motion he pulled her along to the side window and threw her out she smashed through the glass caught her foot and fell with a horrible thud to the earth he leaped out and pulled her up come on goddammit or i will put a bullet in your head and think no more of it he yanked her off into the darkness bud stepped out from behind the car but then remembered ruta beth still in the doorway he drew back and put the rifle on her once again get out goddammit and go face down but the woman just stared at him then slowly she seemed to be raising her hands but she stopped midway and pointed something at him was there a gun in it or what bud didnt have time to think the carbine fired he threw the lever and fired again he didnt see the bullets strike but with the second one ruta beth seemed to deflate all the air went out of her as she tumbled sideways and she seemed to hit the floor with sickening force her arms and legs flung loosely akimbo he wanted to race out after lamar but where was richard where was richard was it a trap maybe it was richard who had gone out the window and lamar reloading just waited for him to show himself no it was lamar only lamar would be smart enough to get out the window that fast richard would be inside in pieces richard wasnt a factor that was clear richard lay on the kitchen floor sobbing it was so unfair why did things always have to happen to him now the police were here and they would kill him he hadnt done anything didnt they understand that he was innocent no blame should be attached to him it wasnt like he wanted any of this to happen he actually tried to prevent it in the restaurant he had heroically screamed trying to save the womans life ruta beth had killed her not him richard tugged on the door again it wouldnt budge he turned and crawled to the door and peeked into the living room the shooting had stopped the windows were all blasted out and there was no sign of lamar lamar he called no answer he looked toward the door and saw ruta beths boots laying splayed on the floor of the porch he suspected after all the shooting that ruta beth was still in them he crawled over and peeked around ruta beth lay on her stomach in a huge and spreading black satiny puddle of blood she was utterly inert utterly without signs of life hed never seen anything so still in his life he faced the darkness he raised his hands i surrender he said there was no answer it was the worst possible thing now he had to pursue an armed and very violent man across unknown terrain in the dark he couldnt shoot because hed hit holly at any time lamar could double back to ambush him you fool he told himself you stupid fool you dont have the sense of a buck worm more out of anger than anything he plunged ahead trying to control his breathing trying to regain his night vision after it was blown to hell by the gun flashes but then he thought lamar is blind too lamar wont be able to see shit for a good five minutes bud raced ahead low he tossed the carbine it was useless in the closequarter stuff that was coming up this was straight cop work an inclose gunfight with an innocent body in the way he knew the statistics from police marksman magazine the average gunfight now took place between twenty and twentythree feet with an exchange of between and shots so he took out his commander the bullet being a harder hitter and the gun being easier to shoot straight and well it would be a close thing if it happened at all one two shots not like in the tattoo shop with them all blazing away as if in a war movie the guns familiar grip somewhat comforted him its known contours its safety exactly where the safety should be its short trigger taut and sharp against his finger the way it settled into his palm and the way his fingers clenched about itall these things had their pleasures in the tension of the moment he hunched looking for signs in the field thinking of course that lamar would head for the nearest clump of trees so as not to be caught in the open the prairie was empty and barren but ahead on the right he saw a clump of trees in a fold the only feature in the emptiness there was no other place to go no other route of escape and he knew lamar would move fast because hed have figured thered be fleets of cops there in no time or maybe he said fuck it strangled the girl and now had just flattened himself into the earth and waited for his blood enemy to approach no lamars not like that hes a professional whatever else he is and would put first priority on escaping to steal and kill another day on another chance to get bud and get away he wasnt one for sacrificing himself bud crouched lower and hurried onward the girl was slowing him down he wanted to smash her to the earth but the girl was the only card he had so he had to hold her he assumed pewtie was following him what choice did the lawman have but when he looked back across the fields he could see nothing or nothing real spangles of light blue and orange like pinwheels from a fourth of july when he was a boy still danced before his eyes from the nearness of the shotguns fireworks thats the trouble with a goddamned sawedoff once the girl went to her knees but he pulled her savagely up you stay with me girly or i will finish you here quiet like and then do your husband and go on my happy way he saw terror and felt her squirm she made a sound low and raw behind the gag but she could not meet his power and looked away her eyes bugging the veins in her throat standing out like ropes she was bleeding too from the fall out the window shed hit her head hard tough shit it was going to be a hard night on everybody he pulled her along he could see the dark line of the trees ahead only a hundred or so yards and happily accepted the fact that cop cars and choppers and whatever hadnt yet arrived maybe pewtie hadnt called them had tried to do the whole thing on his own some john wayne kind of deal but no pewtie would call for backup and then come in alone lamar knew the plan kill him and walk out with the girl knowing the others would fade now lamar was but fifty yards from the tree line a sudden spurt of energy came to him and he roared ahead pulling the girl she seemed wasted without much fight but in some mixup of limbs she went down and he got tangled in her and he went down too with a thud tasting dirt as he fell there was a slight moment of concussion and suddenly she squirmed savagely and ripped away from him with more power than he ever thought she had she raced away goddamn you he hissed and brought the gun up and began to press the trigger but stomped on the impulse knowing the flash would give him away instead he rose and leaped after her slipping once in the mud but in three short bounds had her he tackled her feeling his weight and strength bring her down but she kicked and bucked under him and he tried to push her face in the mud but somehow his hand slid off her face just enough to dislodge the gag bud bud over here she screamed as he finally pushed her face into the mud but before he could do anything more he saw pewtie on the crest line he drew up the pistol and fired he couldnt stop shooting the mesmerizing pleasure of it drawing him onward as the gun leaped in his hand and the gun flashes blossomed like a tulip of light pewtie disappeared he didnt think hed hit him come on he yelled pulling her up but again she pulled away and this time instead of running after he simply watched her run and then himself turned and headed to the trees bud saw movement and brought the gun up to fire he took the slack out of the trigger as the phantasm wobbled desperately to him but saw in the next second it was holly holly here she slipped as she turned and he ran to her i got away he didnt shoot me oh bud i knew youd come he got out his knife he cut her arms free she threw them about him oh jesus bud you have saved my life sure he said nothing you do love me you came for me god bless you mister you are a man yes well he said bud you must love me what you risked for me holly take me out of here you have to do that yourself i want you to go into the field and just lie down flat no matter what happens we got everybody coming in on this thing in a minute or two youre safe you made it i got you out youre done bud oh please dont do what i think youre going to i have to finish it up now ive got to go get lamar bud hell kill you i have to bud i have to go but she pulled him toward her as if to draw him in forever to make him hers now that it was so close so easy andhe hit her with his open hand hard left side of the head driving her down no one had ever hit her before his nostrils flared his eyes were wide and strange and fierce she saw nothing in them at all that she could recognize dont you get it yet he almost screamed its over goddamn it i am quit of you and you are quit of me now get out of here i got mans work to do and without looking back he set off down the crest for the trees knowing that he had another few minutes until lamars eyes regained their night vision he saw the dark band of vegetation up ahead dense and beckoning and otherwise silent wait for backup the rules all said not this time he thought this time we get it done lamar crouched in the trees no moon no stars it was so damned dark his eyes still werent working right shooting at the cop had been stupid like an amateur like something littlebittydick richard would do the gun flashes again so close to his face had blasted his vision to hell and gone everywhere he looked he saw stars and pinwheels dragons breathing fire lions manes flashing in the sun time he had no time he also had almost no ammunition now the gun hadnt locked back but he slipped the magazine out and felt its lips and realized they were empty that meant he had but one cartridge the one in the chamber damn he thought he saw the man coming down the slope through the strobe effect but there was no way it was a clearenough image to shoot at and he couldnt even see his gun the only way was to get in close real close put the gun up to him so the muzzle touched flesh and then blow him away with the last bullet but lamar didnt like that either it depended on pewtie getting close and once he got in the goddamn trees there was no way of telling which way he would go and pewtie saw better than he did because the rifle hadnt flashed nearly so much as the shotgun and he hadnt fired in quite a while and lamar couldnt just wait the longer he was here the surer it was hed get caught no sir got to bring him to me and kill him fast and get on out of here before the posse shows an idea flashed before him the gun the gun the gun yes secure the gun in the crotch of a tree with a branch or something wedged into the trigger guard let pewtie come when he approaches fire the last shot pewtie will then fire back on the gun flash with every damn thing blowing his own eyesight to hell and gone then hes blind and you aint in the second after hes done you hit him hard and low and take him down it becomes a thing of man on man strength against strength and lamar knew that there was no man who could stand against him one on one if pewtie had any doubts he could ask junior jefferson lamar slipped back and in not much time found what he needed a young sapling with a stout crotch maybe five feet up lamar wedged the sig into it slipped off his belt and secured the gun tightly he looked around and then up and with a snap broke off a fourfoot length of branch ever so delicately he wedged the tip into the trigger guard so that it just about filled the gap between trigger and guard force it another half an inch and it would trip the trigger and the gun would fire lamar slipped down waiting for the sounds of his quarry ill still get him he thought bud had reached the trees no sir dont like this a bit he reasoned now that if he had to shoot it would be in response to fire and he wanted a lot of chances not a few so he restored the commander to his high hip holster and reached up and unslung his beretta with a thumb he snicked the hammer back then finger on the trigger he began to snake ahead hes in here goddammit just waiting till his vision clears enough got to move fast or im a dead man he slid into the brush his night vision was clear as it could be before him he saw only a thin maze of trees ground cover the furrow that was a stream beyond a fence and beyond way beyond that the humps of the wichitas but no lamar he was so slow he was sure lamar couldnt see him he eased ahead almost soundlessly scanning as he went seeing nothing lamar he called lamar give it up theyre on their way you dont have to die tonight like your poor girlfriend silence lamar theyll just send you back to the house youll be a big man youll have it all youll be the king lamar didnt respond was he yelling to a ghost had lamar sped through the trees and was he closing in on some fine family to murder and steal a lincoln continental and get clean away no he couldnt have moved that fast lamar a gun flash blossomed before him spangling his vision but lamars best shot missed and bud drew the beretta onto the fire and returned the gun bucked and rose in his hand but bud was in love with shooting it the gun flashes illuminated the cathedral under the trees etching each detail in the bright light if only for a millisecond bud fired eight or nine times now he was pretty much goddamn blind but he heard the scrape of something moving before him and before he could stop himself he fired again the flashes even larger this time like flares or star shells that seemed to turn the night to day catching in their shards of blaze the seething smoke damn he thought and then lamar hit him full in the chest lamar watched him come he had a moment of doubt in his course for so slow and clumsy was the man he seemed an easy target but not at night when you couldnt see your own gun to aim and you only had one shot youd have to wait until he was at contact distance and maybe he wouldnt ever come into contact distance you figured fine he thought he watched as pewtie hesitated caught in doubt cant make up your goddamn mind boy then pewtie put one gun away and got another out now what was that all about some secret meaning in the guns didnt matter what mattered was that lamar now knew bud was carrying two one in hand and one high on his right hip bud gently entered the trees then he halted and yelled something at lamar lamar couldnt quite make it out because he was so low into the forest floor about six feet to the right of where his pistol was wedged into the crotch of the tree he controlled the sapling that reached its trigger with his left hand but he was concentrating real hard on not making a sound not hardly breathing on not hardly being alive at the same time he tried to focus his mind on bud to somehow reach out through the trees and take over the lawmans brain to bring him on so far it was working bud moved in closer and yelled something else he seemed to pause unsure which way to head then he seemed to make up his mind and pivoted as if to head off to the right if he got too far lamar could never reach him okay lamar he told himself do it now do it and be done with it but something in lamar now held back what fear regret whatever lamar just watched as the man twentyfive feet away seemed to turn in slow motion just a dark shape in the woods almost not there unless youd seen him come in do it lamar he told himself with his hand he nudged the stick forward and it didnt take long the report was crisp and not loud the flash momentarily lighting the lawmans taut face and then disappearing pewtie fired back almost instantaneously lamar looked into the earth to preserve his gradually returning night vision and heard the cracks and the echoes lashing out almost like a whip snapping over his head so many so fast oh you scared you so scared not two shots not three but six seven pray and spray motherfucker a moment of silence then absurdly pewtie fired again like a crazy man rushing forward on the surge of adrenaline and under the roar of the shots lamar rose like a lion and bounded the few feet to him on an oblique angle and if pewtie ever saw him coming it was too late for he thundered fully against the man and felt the surprise and the shock disorganizing pewties body turning it to water and lamar was on him crushing his thrashing body under his own first thing was the gun hand which he controlled with his own left then slithering up to gain control he hit the cop a hammer blow in the face because with two fingers gone no way could he make a fist he hit him right over the eye and thought he felt a bone in the face break as the man screamed and with his other hand rose to ward the blows off it was like terrible fag sex the two strong men pumping against each other in a rising fog of body stink and fear lamar saw how it would go in a second and knew hed win easy hed pound the head of the man he controlled for another ten seconds smashing him into submission then twist across the body to get both hands on the gun wrist and corkscrew the automatic out of his grip and pull it back and shoot the lawman with his own gun but buds hand shot up to his throat and began squeezing the thumb driving desperately for the adams apple lamar gagged then threaded his hand under buds and gave him a knuckle thrust to the fleshy side of the neck feeling the body beneath him go rigid in the awful pain he hit again and thought he felt the tremor of surrender quivering through his opponent quick as a big cat he pivoted and now had both hands on buds gun wrist cranking it counterclockwise to rip the pistol from the grip seeing the hands turn white as they lost their purchase something hit him lightly in the leg and then the gun fired its flash blinding him gain but it didnt matter for the slide didnt lock back and the recoil further weakened the mans grip and now he had it it was in his hand he leaned back fiddling to get it in his hand right and then thrust the muzzle against the mans body and pulled the trigger richard heard shots they seemed to come from out beyond out on the prairie he looked around again seeing nothingness and then headed toward the sound he walked in the darkness and paused for just a second to see the farm spread behind him and before him only the darker band of the trees a shape suddenly appeared before him lamar he said but it was only the girl who looked at him in horror and then slipped off he watched her disappear and wondered why she had such revulsion on her face he stood there for a few seconds wondering what to do the world had never seemed so empty to him as it did at that moment then he saw a single shot coming from ahead in the trees by a trick of fate he had been looking exactly where the flash so briefly blossomed it occurred to him lamar may need help he walked toward the shot i have to help lamar he took out his gun bud felt his strength vaporizing and with it all his will he had nothing left to fight with and lamar had hit him so hard in the face and throat he was seeing nothing but flares of light as his throbbing optic nerves shot off but still he clung to the beretta knowing it held his purchase on survival lamar was above him over him hitting him gigantic hammer blows against which he had no defense his face swelled like a rotten grapefruit he saw his sons before him in the strobe effect of the optic nerve and for just a second forgot where he was lamars face was a savage mask so rigid with hatred and power it seemed like something from ancient times lamars dark eyes glowed and his nostrils flared and bud could smell sweat and dirt and blood and then lamar hit him a giant clout on the nose breaking it filling buds mind with red mist lamar pivoted and bud felt lamars other hand coming onto his wrist lamars weight still pinning him and the gun was being corkscrewed from his grasp until it was only a second before he lost it magazine button he thought he pushed it with his thumb and felt the magazine slide out and then he pulled the trigger the gun firing pointlessly off toward nowhere as lamar then seized it and with a blast of triumph broke contact with bud and pivoted to jam the pistol against his ribs and squeeze the trigger lamar must have pulled the trigger ten times before he realized the gun wasnt going to fire couldnt no magazine in the interim bud balled his fist he hit lamar in the throat and felt his antagonist sag back he rolled just a bit and grabbed his commander from the high hip holster and tried to bring it up against lamar but lamar was too fast on the recovery and with his own left hand grabbed at the pistol the two men began to slide through the mud down toward the stream hopelessly locked each desperately seeking leverage strength hope as they tried to control buds commander buds thumb was over the safety trying to get it down lamars below it trying to keep it up their faces were inches apart suddenly fast as a snake lamar seemed to leap out he sunk his teeth into buds nose the pain scaled the heights of his spine and he screamed but in the same terrible second he remembered i shot his fingers off with a jab his thumb lanced out against lamars fist hit bandage dug through it and felt scab yielding to blood and heard a new scream not his own bud tore the automatic free and rammed it into lamar but when he pulled the trigger it would not go lamar had got a finger between hammer and receiver you fucker you fucker you fucker lamar was saying bud got the gun free and with his thumb cranked back the hammer but again lamar snared his wrist the gun in buds hand was like a bayonet as each tried to gain control and drive it into the others heart it rose and rose wavering this way and that now bud ahead now lamar the two of them locked in each others arms squeezing and biting and batting at each other with their skulls up and up the gun came until it seemed to touch buds chin he felt it hard and cold and saw lamars merciless eyes but from somewhere some last ounce of rage unleashed a last ounce of strength the gun fired the flash erupted in buds face the light was incandescent and unyielding and seemed to fill all the corners of the earth and as the tide of brightness roared through his brain it destroyed his vision a thousand bits of powder and lead drove into his skin he fell backward isolated in his blindness seeing nothing feeling nothing bud was helpless hed lost the gun he was blind his ears rang hes going to kill me he thought and waited for the next shot almost welcoming it for it would stop the pain that now began to throb in his head and it would let him rest at last but no shot came he blinked and groped and still saw nothing but only heard some unidentifiable sound a rasping a moaning whatever he drove his fists into his eyes and pressed them hard backing sightly up the bank he opened his eyes waiting to die but ever so slowly he identified the sound it came from a hulk just before him sunk to the knees in the stream hands clasped over face lamars hands came away and another flash of heat lightning crackled in the distance and bud saw that the bullet a hollow tip had blown through lamars chin upward and like a plow had gouged a furrow up what had been a face the teeth and most of the tongue were gone the nose had been eviscerated and as the bullet had opened and surged upward it had destroyed both of lamars eyes and opened his forehead so that pulsing dark matter showed amid the bone it had erased his face liilmu iiilmu iiilmu lamar moaned and bud knew it was kill me kill me kill me bud finally found the beretta though it had slipped down almost into his underpants in the struggle he raised it and aimed he was three feet away he fired twice into lamars head and he fell sideways into the creek and did not move bud stared at him for just a second then sat down as an exhaustion so total it seemed to penetrate to his heart overcame him he felt numbness everywhere except where he hurt the little gun slipped out of his hand and he did not even look for it holly crying bitterly had made it nearly all the way back to the farmhouse when she heard the roar she turned to the west and saw them or rather their lights three helicopters roaring in over the tree line lights flashing dramatically then from the other direction she saw the vehiclesstate police cruisers vans ambulances a whole convoyracing down the road to the farm the vehicles and the helicopters reached the house almost simultaneously and from each there poured a crowd of blackgarbed men in hoods with fancy guns it was all theater like a movie it had nothing to do with anything she walked toward them as the men completed their dramatic performance kicking in doors presumably racing through the house ready to hose anything that moved down with their machine guns but there was nothing to hose down she reached the perimeter help she said in seconds policemen surrounded her theyre out there she said pointing bud pewtie and lamar over there in the trees i heard some shots youd better hurry lets go said an old man who seemed to be in charge please hurry she said but they were already gone we were so close she thought bud climbed up the bank through a fog of exhaustion he could make no sense of the rising dust the roar of the helicopters the flashing of their navigation lights his mind worked imperfectly it closed on one thought it was over a light came onto him he blinked there he is shouted the pilot over the intercom cd looked and yes the light came onto bud who groped blindly then sank to his knees cd saw the blood all over him focused a pair of binoculars on the face and saw how battered it was put it down goddammit he screamed the bird hit with a thud listen you get back to the house and see if theres a goddamned doctor in the cars or at least a goddamn paramedic get him here fast that boys hurt bad then you call comanche shocktrauma and tell them to expect incoming mark the place with a flare lieutenant so we can find it on the way back goddamn right i will said cd and bring some more men to secure the area he rolled from the deck of the huey and someone handed him a flare which he ignited with a yank the flares red fire blossomed carrying it he raced down to bud as the helicopter roared away into the night he ran down the slope and came to bud dropping the flare bud bud got him lieutenant hes down there blew his face off oh christ i hurt take it easy bud he tried to comfort bud holding him close putting his hand to the highway patrolmans chest to check the heartbeat bud fell forward then caught himself in the flickering magenta of the flare the blood all over his face looked almost black and the swelling had all but buried one of his eyes the man was shivering and saliva and phlegm ran out of his bloody mouth i killed him oh fuck is he dead bud was saying good work bud you got him great goddamn job now settle down help is but suddenly someone else was before them he thought it was another cop but as the figure drew nearer and acquired clarity out of the darkness he recognized its size wheres lamar asked richard cd was close enough now to see how swollen the mans face was had he been hit did lamar beat him but richard sniffled and cd knew hed been crying its all over he said its finished wheres lamar dead said cd richard held something up cd saw that it was a smith wesson bud almost laughed richard with a big gun like that his own gun richard boy its all over put the gun down you dont want to hurt nobody not now cd was saying richard looked at the gun almost amazed to find it there bud heard vehicles revving roaring toward them a chopper suddenly hovered overhead throwing out a searchlight beam that lit the three of them and beating up a storm of dust richard blinked ii began richard there now richard its all over you just put that old gun down so nobody gets hurt cd crooned richard looked up at cd and then at bud in the light bud saw huge eyes webbed with red and full of fear trembling lips drops of dew on the nose richard put the gun down those boys mean business its all over nobody has to get hurt now not you not nobody you were a victim too he made you do them things richard nodded numbly drop the gun richard said bud suddenly anguished afraid the troopers would shoot this poor pitiful child richard took a step toward them seemed to turn and watch the men from the helicopter racing at them and turned back to bud and cd he faltered as though he were losing his grip cd reached out to help him richard started to bend to set the gun down as the troopers surrounded him and it was fine it was great it was the happy ending everybody dreamed about but something suddenly came into richards eyes from nowhere daddy he cried and raised the pistol and fired chapter long after the funeral which was one of the biggest in the history of the state long after the newspapers and the television had lost interest long after people had stopped asking about it the ford f pulled into the parking lot of a small cemetery in kiowa county it was november the day before thanksgiving when oklahoma turns chilly and ocher and seems somehow drained of its brightness the wind snapped through the air and russ pewtie step ping out of the passenger side pulled his jacket tight around him when he breathed ragged plumes of breath leaked from his nostrils and his eyes began to issue tears from the cold hed just flown in that morning from a surprisingly more temperate new jersey beside him his brother jeff who had driven up to oklahoma city to pick him up also shivered damned cold said russ damned cold said jeff russ was back from his first two months in the east he hadnt had an easy time of it and had already dropped a course but he felt better and knew that somehow hed make it through jeff was looking good hed gotten his grades up and now a junior with a drivers license his own inherited truck he even had a girlfriend a pretty young woman who was the daughter of a colonel at the fort he was working out every day after school to get ready for ball in the spring the two young men left the truck which smelled so of their father they looked around shifting a little on their feet to stay warm but without much luck russ looked at his watch we may as well go on out there he said yeah said jeff get it over with they stepped between gnarled scrub oaks and through a frail metal gate and walked among the gravestones on the prairie there were so many of them the wind rose and whipped and snapped and the high grass bent in its force out here always the wind there was no wind like this back in new jersey thought russ theres no wind like it anywhere after some minutes of hunting they came at last to the stone which was one of but many in a neighborhood of stones like its companions it was nondescript polished granite about as austere a symbol of a life as could be imagined completely without frill or sentimentality russ tried to feel something but he really couldnt he felt phony ridiculous absurd he looked down at the marker which summed up a mans life in a set of years and beneath that the inscription a law enforcement officer and beneath that another inscription he did his duty poor old bastard said jeff i wonder why he did it said russ and below that the name carl d henderson he did it because he thought it went with the job said their father rising from the other side of cds gravestone where hed been alone for some time and then he said thank you boys for coming i appreciate it much hi russ youre looking great thanks dad im okay i didnt see your car i didnt feel like driving today that little thing with its piddly automatic mommy dropped me off she had to go to pick up the turkey russ looked at his father and remembered the last time hed seen him near death in the hospital the survivor was a graver man thin and solemn his skin still almost gray now and then a faraway look would come over him the bullet that had gone through cd hendersons aorta had then struck bud breaking his clavicle and destroying the nerves in his right arm then coursing downward to destroy a lung before coming to rest behind his spleen thank god thered been a doctor on the chopper hed taken one look at cd and known it was all over cut buds chest open there in the grass and massaged his heart back to life before they medevacked him to comanche general shocktrauma where hed fought the reaper for three months until finally pulling out of it youre looking great dad lied russ this goddamn retirements got me cranky as a mule bud said but ill get used it well you boys ready for the party yes sir said jeff bud pulled out a fresh bottle of i w harper and cracked it open without much ceremony he took a long smoky swallow he passed it to russ and then to jeff who each took a gulp wow said jeff blinking at the power of the fluid i ever catch you doing that on your own ill wale the hide off you bud said taking the bottle from jeff then he turned and poured the rest of the liquor into the ground next to cds stone the old goat was always trying to git me to drink with him bud said well now i finally got around to it and i brought my boys too just like he wanted this ones on you old man then he turned and looked at his two sons russ for once wasnt wearing the habitual scowl of the young intellectual and jeff looked a little wobbly for his first taste of hard liquor all right he said lets go home some time that same week richard blinked and blinked again as the doors opened and he stepped out of the ambulance onto the sidewalk of prison boulevard with his guards he had a little impulse to shield his eyes though it was impossible handcuffs and ankle cuffs bound to an iron belt held his limbs secure the wind was chilly the sky bright he shivered and felt phantom aches he too had recovered from his wounds which were surprisingly minor given the fact that four state troopers had fired at him in almost the same second that he had fired into henderson and pewtie what was it lamar had said aint nobody knows how to shoot no more well another thing lamar had been right about one bullet broke his rib another passed cleanly through his chest and two more through the fleshy part of his leg hed known he wasnt going to die in fact what hurt the most was that one trooper had kicked him in the head as he lay on the ground he thought they were going to let him bleed to death but he disappointed them and would not die most of the last months had been passed in the confines of a friendly institution the kingsville hospital for the criminally insane where loving doctors had tended him and cared for him but something had changed he was remote and unresponsive and theyd tried so hard to reach him but he just looked at them they seemed from another planet somehow and in the last months when he was ambulatory theyd urged him to draw again but he just stared at the pencils and the paper and saw blankness the adjudication was simple sparing the state the expense of trying him his lawyer pled him guilty to first degree murder on the proviso that he not be given the death penalty his lawyer told him he couldnt be considered for parole for seventeen years he wasnt charged in the escape because his lawyer convinced the court that lamar had forced him to go along and he wasnt charged in the murder of the guard or the delivery man or any of the citizens or policemen in the robbery of the wichita falls dennys his greatest character witness was old john stepford who told prosecutors he didnt do a thing he just sat there and cried while lamar and odell did the terrible things to my poor wife and i richard was a damned coward couldnt hurt a flea if richard had an opinion he kept it to himself he had become a near mute a sullen watcher slow to move his face sealed off from human expression who knew what danced behind his eyes for they too had become dull and hooded there it is richard said the head of the guard detail just like you left it it hadnt changed a bit mcalester state penitentiary loomed above him its high white walls blazing in the sun giving it the aspect of a camelot a fabled moorish city a walled fortress in tibet the mac the big mac it would have him back at last he blinked again from here he could only see the walls and just the briefest half a top story of the cellblock that had been his world for four months before lamar had taken him on that mad crazed dash he looked around but there was nothing to see except walls the mac he thought i am back now i have to pay he knew he would probably die the blacks would get him probably it would be the blacks his whiteness would inflame them theyd be on him in a second fuck his ass and kill him and laugh about it he could try and punk for a big con but seventeen years of blow jobs maybe the mexicans the cholos they loved to cut up gringos in the showers they would get him fast or the red guys those impassive mongol savages with their elaborate tattooed biceps bracelet ndnz but he knew it would be the blacks the doors clanked open a lieutenant he recognized waited well howdy there richard known youd come back sooner or later they all do richard said nothing hell lamar and odell are back theyre over there in the goddamned prison cemetery who elsed have em aint going into a graveyard with quality folks thats for sure richard remembered the cemetery vaguely a nondescript parcel of junk land off to the west beyond the agriculture center where members of the prison community bull and con alike were interred id like to see them sometime richard said well well have to see about that richard said the guard some things are more possible than others they aint going anywheres thats for sure richard just nodded bitterly wondering how it would happen processing was indifferent and efficient he had no belongings really to confiscate and just gave himself over to the institution now with an armful of clothes and in new prison dungarees he entered the cellblock and walked along the catwalk to where he would spend the rest of his life again the immensity of it it towered over him he thought of a cobras flared hood the sense of darkness enveloping there was no daylight out on the yard things were progressing as normal he heard the shouts from the basketball and handball courts the clunk of heavy iron being pumped by inmate body builders other rogue sounds latino music cheesy and loud soul music country and the yammer the gibber of many men talking seething bucking clawing for space and individuality and survival in the most primeval of places smells farts sweat bile vomit shit iron and stone everywhere the slight vibration of the grid of the catwalk beneath him the cells slipping by on the right each festooned with pictures of various saints and sluts until at last home here you go richard dfiftyeight sorry there aint no doubles you in with a rapist a road captain of a cycle gang and a guy who likes to cut people not your average sunday school choir richard knew where theyd put him too back bunk upper where the farts coalesced in the air and in hot weather the atmosphere was most like the inside of a sub while in the winter it was the coldest every square inch of wall would be taken up with pictures from the inner lives of other men and hed have no say in anything his own cellmates might even kill him just for the shit of it when they got tired of jacking off or butt slamming each other richard slipped in hmmmmm it must be some mistake he didnt get it dont ask me richard we let you boys work out who sleeps where there was an open bunk but it wasnt the rear upper but the front lower hmmmmmmm the best bunk in the cell and all the pictures had been scraped off the wall he could hang anything he wanted he looked at it dully nothing showed on his face okay richard you on your own you be a good boy now and if you git in trouble you call us sure the detail left and richard was alone he sat on the bunk then he looked at the two desks and again was astounded normally the desks belonged to the two strongest men and fuck the two weakest sometimes a deal could be worked out where all four shared if all four were of equal power but both desks stood vacant the materials they had previously contained stacked neatly over to one side of the room as if it was up to him to choose the best one richard sat for a number of hours trying to work out the puzzle he had one little task to perform he carefully un folded a print hed ordered and then hung it scotchtaping it precisely centered above the desk then in time he had to go to the bathroom it used to terrify him in the stallless bathrooms naked to the world you were at maximum vulnerability hed trained himself only to go when lamar or odell went but there was no lamar and odell they were in the ground a mile away yet once again he was amazed at his own torpor the trip to the bathrooms didnt particularly frighten him he just got up and went what would happen would happen and maybe sooner was better than later he stood left his cell and walked along the catwalk until he reached the john he ducked in a scrawny black man looked at him said nothing and departed richard sat and shat then he rose buckled his pants and took his time washing his hands he walked out and then he saw them there were four of them big and black they came from nowhereor actually out of a cell suddenly they blocked off the catwalk ahead of him he looked about far above a guard with a mini patrolled on the shooting walk but he was looking in another direction and so he thought here it is at last my fate one of them was immensely puffed up from working out his ebony muscles sculpted and glowing stood out on his body like haunches of beef or inflated sausages he wore a red bandanna another was lanky and sullen with michael jacksons pretty hair a gold necklace and ropey veiny arms his eyes were deader than coal the third was just a kid eager to impress his face drawn in tight and impassive to broadcast the word tough to the world he looked at richard with haughty eyes and the fourth was the famous headboss nigger rodney smalls rodney looked at him through narrow eyes rodney was an immense man sagacious and violent a magnificent despot who ruled with an iron hand rodney rarely ventured out of his cell preferring to run things among the blacks from there but now richard got it he had to pay for junior jefferson he had inherited lamars burden of guilt he tried to keep his own face dull he just stared at them as they approached okay he thought is this it he wasnt particularly frightened for some odd reason they were on him hey richard yeah give them nothing dont let them see your fear what you say man im okay he said how you doin you need anything man you need smokes i can get you smokes cool richard said shit man we aint got no beef with you just want you to know that up front richard you okay that richard said rodney to his young charge he smoked two goddamned troopers a lieutenant and a sergeant blew their etlooking white motherfucking asses away cold stood up there like the motherfucking man and put them smokeybear cocksuckers down you git em both richard i capped the lieutenant said richard goddamned sergeant had more lives than a cat but ill tell you this he hasnt had a good nights sleep since he ran into me the four black men laughed richard you okay man you got the stones you cold motherfucker you ice man someone clapped him on the back he felt their warmth their love their respect you go cool richard for a dirty white boy you aint half bad he watched them walk away the young one made a gun from a finger and aped blowing a state trooper away and they all burst out laughing richard he turned a pale white man stood before him maybe five years younger richard my name is aaron miles im one of your cellmates i was wondering did i talk to you motherfucker said richard ahno its just that its just that nothing motherfucker if we talk and note i dont say when we talk but only if we talk we talk when i say so do you understand fuck boy yes sir now i want half your cigarettes instructed richard every week i get half get it or i become interested in you and you dont want that yes sir now get the fuck out of my sight the boy scurried away richard watched him go he had a nice ass now for the first time in months he felt something an actual sensation slid through his bones a small tight smile played across his face he stepped back into his cell and saw his print captured in a few deft pen strokes the creature crouched on some featureless plain swaddled in muscle its head twisted almost as if in a feeding frenzy its tiny eyes black and cunning a spasm of blood lust throbbing through it lion tour ne vers la gauche la fete levee by delacroix who richard realized had gotten the neck right
