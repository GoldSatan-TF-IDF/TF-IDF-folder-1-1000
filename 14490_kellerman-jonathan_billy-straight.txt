jonathan kellerman billy straight the first book in the petra connor series to faye for faye at the core its always faye unique is she my constant dove my perfect one song of songs in the park you see things but not what i saw tonight god god i wanted to be dreaming but i was awake smelling chili meat and onions and the pine trees first the car drove up to the edge of the parking lot they got out and talked and he grabbed her like in a hug i thought maybe they were going to kiss and id watch that then all of a sudden she made a weird sound surprised squeaky like a cat or dog that gets stepped on he let go of her and she fell then he bent down next to her and his arm started moving up and down really fast i thought he was punching her and that was bad enough and i kept thinking should i do something but then i heard another sound fast wet like the butcher at stater brothers back in watson chopping meat chuck chuck chuck he kept doing it moving his arm up and down i wasnt breathing my heart was on fire my legs were cold then they turned hotwet pissing my pants like a stupid baby the chuck chuck stopped he stood up big and wide wiped his hands on his pants something was in his hand and he held it far from his body he looked all around then in my direction could he see me hear me smell me he kept looking i wanted to run but knew hed hear me but staying here could trap me how could he see anything behind the rocks theyre like a cave with no roof just cracks you can look through which is the reason i picked them as one of my places my stomach started to churn around and i wanted to run so badly my leg muscles were jumping under my skin a breeze came through the trees blowing up pine smell and piss stink would it blow against the chiliburgers wrapping paper and make noise would he smell me he looked around some more my stomach hurt so bad all of a sudden he jumped ran back to the car got in drove away i didnt want to see when he passed under the lamp at the corner of the parking lot didnt want to read the license plate plyr the letters burned into my mind why did i look why im still sitting here my casio says am i need to get out of here but what if hes just driving around and comes back no that would be stupid why would he do that i cant stand it shes down there and i smell like piss and meat and onions and chili real dinner from the okirama on the boulevard that chinese guy who never smiles or looks at your face i paid and now i want to throw it up my jeans are starting to get sticky and itchy going over to the public bathroom at the other end of the lot is too dangerous that arm going up and down like he was just doing a job he wasnt as big as moron but he was big enough she trusted him let him hug her what did she do to make him so mad could she still be alive no way impossible i listen carefully to see if shes making any sounds nothing but the freeway noise from across the east side of the park and traffic from the boulevard not much traffic tonight sometimes when the wind blows north you hear ambulance sirens motorcycles car honks the citys all around the park looks like the country but i know the difference who is she forget that i dont want to know what i want is to put tonight on rewind that squeaky sound like he took the air right out of her for sure shes gone but what if she isnt even if she isnt she will be soon all that chucking and what could i do for her anyway breathe into her mouth put my face in her blood what if he comes back while im doing it would he come back that would be stupid but there are always surprises she sure found that out i cant help her i have to put this all out of my mind ill sit here for ten more minutes no fifteen twenty then ill get my place two stuff together and move where to place one up near the observatory is too far and so are three and four even though three would be good cause it has a stream for washing that leaves five in the fern tangle behind the zoo all those trees a little closer but still a long walk in the dark but its also the hardest one to find okay ill go to five me and the animals the way they cry and roar and smash against their cages makes it hard to sleep but tonight i probably wont sleep anyway meantime i sit here and wait pray our father in heaven how about no more surprises not that praying ever got me anything and sometimes i wonder if theres anyone up there to pray to or just stars humongous balls of gas in an empty black universe then i get worried that im blaspheming maybe some kind of god is up there maybe hes saved me lots of times and im just too dumb to know it or not a good enough person to appreciate him maybe god saved me tonight putting me behind the rocks instead of out in the open but if he had seen me when he drove up he probably wouldve changed his mind and not done anything to her so did god want her to no he just wouldve gone somewhere else to do it whatever in case you saved me thank you god in case youre up there do you have a plan for me monday am when the call came into hollywood division petra connor was well into overtime but up for more action sunday shed enjoyed unusually peaceful sleep from am to pm no gnawing dreams thoughts of ravaged brain tissue empty wombs things that would never be waking to a nice warm afternoon she took advantage of the light and spent an hour at her easel then half a pastrami sandwich and a coke a hot shower and off to the station to finalize the stakeout she and stu bishop rolled out just after dark cruising alleys and ignoring minor felonies they had more important things on their minds selecting a spot they sat watching the apartment building on cherokee not talking usually they chatted managed to turn the boredom into semifun but stu had been acting weird lately remote tightlipped as if the job no longer interested him maybe it was five days on graveyard petra was bugged but what could she do he was the senior partner she put it aside thought about flemish pictures at the getty amazing pigments superb use of light two hours of buttnumbing stasis their patience paid off just after am and another imbecilic but elusive killer hooked up now she sat at a scabrous metal desk opposite stu completing the paperwork thinking about going back to her apartment maybe doing some sketching the five days had energized her stu looked halfdead as he talked to his wife it was a warm june well before daybreak and the fact that the two of them were still there at the tail end of a severely understaffed graveyard shift was a fluke petra had been a detective for exactly three years the first twentyeight months in auto theft the remaining eight in daytime homicide with stu her partner was a nineyear vet and a family man day shift suited his lifestyle and his biorhythms petra had been a nighthawk from childhood before the deep blue midnights of her artist days when lying awake at night had been inspirational well before her marriage when listening to nicks breathing had lulled her to sleep she lived alone now loved the black of night more than ever black was her favorite color as a teenager shed worn nothing but so wasnt it odd that shed never asked for nighttime assignments since graduating the academy it was adherence to duty that brought about the temporary switch wayne carlos freshwater crawled out at night scoring weed and crack and pills on hollywood side streets killing prostitutes no way was he going to be found when the sun shone over a sixmonth period hed strangled four streetgirls that petra and stu knew about the last one a sixteenyearold runaway from idaho who hed tossed in an alley dumpster near selma and franklin no cutting but a pocketknife found at the scene yielded prints and led to a search for freshwater incredibly stupid dropping the blade but no big surprise freshwaters file said his iq had been tested twice by the state and not that it had stopped him from eluding them male black thirtysix years old fivefootseven multiple arrests and convictions over the last twenty years the last for an ag assaultattempted rape that sent him to soledad for ten years cut down of course to four the usual sullen mug shot bored with the process even when they caught him he looked bored no sudden moves no attempt at escape just standing there in a rancid hallway pupils dilated faking cool but after the cuffs went on he switched to wideeyed surprise whud i do officer the funny thing was he looked innocent knowing his size petra had expected some napoleon full of testosterone but here was this dainty little twerp with a dainty little michael jackson voice neatly dressed too preppy brandnew gap stuff probably boosted later the jailer told her freshwaterd been wearing womens underwear under the pressed khakis the tenyear soledad invitation had been for choking a sixtyyearold grandmother in watts freshwater was released angrier than ever and took a week to get going again ratcheting up the violence level great system petra used the memory of freshwaters moronic surprise to get herself smiling as she completed the report whud i do you were a bad bad boy stu was still on the phone with kathy home soon honey kiss the kids for me six kids lots of kissing petra had watched them line up for stu before dinner platinum heads sparkling hands and nails it had taken her a long time to be able to look at other peoples kids without thinking of her own useless ovaries stu loosened his tie she caught his eye but he looked away going back on days would be good for him he was thirtyseven eight years petra s senior looked closer to thirty a slim nicelooking man with wavy blond hair and goldhazel eyes the two of them had been quickly labeled ken and barbie even though petra had the dark tresses stu had a taste for expensive traditional suits white frenchcuffed shirts braided leather suspenders and striped silk ties carried the most frequently oiled mm in the department and a screen actors guild card from doing bit parts in tv cop shows last year hed made detectiveiii smart ambitious a devout mormon he and pretty kathy and the halfdozen tykettes lived on a oneacre spread in la crescenta hed been a great teacher for petra no sexism or personal garbage a good listener like petra a work fiend driven to achieve maximal arrests match made in heaven till a week ago what was wrong something political the first day they partnered he informed her he was thinking about shifting to the paper track eventually going for lieutenant preparing her for goodbye but he hadnt mentioned it since petra wondered if he was aiming even higher his father was a successful ophthalmologist and stu had grown up in a huge house in flintridge surfed in hawaii skied in utah was used to good things captain bishop deputy chief bishop she could imagine him in a few years with graying temples cary grant crinkles charming the press playing the game but doing a solid job because he was substance as well as style freshwater was a major bust so why didnt it matter to him especially because he was the one whod really solved it the oldfashioned way despite the joe clean demeanor nine years had made him an expert on streetlife and hed collected a stable of lowlife confidential informants two separate cis had come through on freshwater each reporting that the hooker killer had a heavy crack habit was selling stolen goods on the boulevard at night and scoring rock at a flop apartment on cherokee two giftwraps precise address down to the apartment number and exactly where the dealers lookouts hung out stu and petra staked out for three nights on the third they grabbed freshwater as he entered the building from the back and petra got to clamp the cuffs delicate wrists whud i do officer she chuckled out loud and filled the arrest forms inadequate spaces with her elegant draftsmans hand just as stu hung up his phone petra s jangled she picked up and the sergeant downstairs said guess what barbie got a call from the park rangers over at griffith woman down in a parking lot probable tag youre it which lot in griffith east end back behind one of the picnic areas its supposed to be chained off but you know how that goes take los feliz like youre going to the zoo instead of continuing on to the freeway turn off the bluesll be there along with a ranger car do it code sure but why us why you the sergeant laughed look around see anyone else but you and kenny blame the city council she hung up what said stu his carroll company foulard was tightly knotted and his hair was perfectly combed but tired definitely tired petra told him he stood and buttoned his jacket lets go no gripe stu never complained i pack up my place two stuff in three layers of dry cleaners plastic and begin walking up the hill behind the rocks into the trees i trip and fall a lot because im afraid to use the penlight until i get deep inside but i dont care just get me out of here the zoos miles away it will take a long time i walk like a machine that cant be hurt thinking what he did to her no good i have to put it out of my mind back in watson after trouble with moron or any kind of difficult day i used lists to keep my mind busy sometimes it worked here goes presidents in order of election washington adams jefferson madison monroe quincy adams jackson martin van buren the shortest president oh shit here i go again down on my knees i get up keep going back in watson i had a book on the presidents published by the library of congress with heavy paper and excellent photographs and the official presidential seal on the cover i got it in fourth grade for winning the president bee read it about five hundred times trying to put myself back in time imagine what it was like to be george washington running a brandnew country or thomas jefferson an amazing genius inventing things writing with five pens at one time even being martin van buren short but still boss over everyone books became a problem when moron moved in he hated when i read especially when his chopper was busted or mom had no money for him little fuck with his fuckin books thinks hes smartern everyone after he moved in i had to sit in the kitchen while he and mom took up my sleeper couch watching tv one day he came in the trailer totally blasted while i was trying to do homework i could tell because of his eyes and the way he just kept walking around in circles making fists and opening them making that growling noise the homework was prealgebra easy stuff mrs annison didnt believe me the one time i told her i already knew it and she kept assigning me the same work as the rest of the class i was speeding through the problems almost finished when moron got a container of bean dip out of the fridge started eating it with his hands i looked at him but just for a second he reached over and pulled my hair and slammed the math book on my fingers then he grabbed up a bunch of notebooks and other textbooks and ripped them in half including the math book thinking with numbers he said fuck this shit and tossed it in the trash get off your fuckin ass you little faggot do something useful around here my hair smelled of beans and the next day my hand was so swollen i couldnt move the fingers and i kept it in my pocket when i told mrs annison id lost the book she was eating corn nuts at her desk and grading papers and didnt bother to look up just said well billy i guess youll have to buy another one i couldnt ask mom for money so i never got another book couldnt do homework anymore and my math grades started going down i kept thinking mrs annison or someone would get curious but no one did another time moron ripped up this magazine collection id put together from other peoples trash and most of my personal books including the presidents book one of the first things i looked for when i finally located the library on hillhurst avenue was another presidents book i found one but it was different not as heavy paper only blackandwhite photographs still interesting though i learned that william henry harrison caught a cold right after his election and died bad luck for the first william president this is working my heads clear but my heart and stomach feel like theyre burning up more taylor fillmore pierce james buchanan the only president who never got married must have been lonely for him in the white house though i guess he was busy enough maybe he liked being alone i can understand that lincoln johnson grant mckinley another william president did anyone ever call him billy from his picture bald and squinty and angrylooking i dont think so no one ever called me william except teachers on the first day of school and soon then they switched to billy too because all the kids laughed at william billy goat billy the goat william bradley straight its a plain name nothing special about it but better than some of the other things ive been called chuck chuck oops i stumble but dont fall place five is still far its a warm night i wish i could take off my pissstink clothes and run through the trees naked a wild strong animal who knows where hes going ill breathe ten times to cool down my heart better more lists tropical fish platys swordtails neon tetras guppies angelfish oscars catfish tinfoil barbs arowanas never had an aquarium but in my magazine collection were old copies of tropical fish hobbyist and the pictures filled my head with color one point the fish articles kept making was you have to be careful setting up an aquarium know who youre dealing with oscars and arowanas will eat all the others if theyre big enough and if the arowanas get really big theyll try to eat the oscars goldfish are the most peaceful but theyre also the slowest and get eaten all the time my stomach still burns like someones in there chewing at me breathe animals you see in the park birds lizards squirrels snakes once in a while i ignore them same for people at night you sometimes see homeless crazy guys with carts full of garbage but they never stay long also mexicans in low cars playing loud music when they stop its over by the trains junkies of course because its hollywood ive seen them drive up sit at one of the picnic tables like theyre ready to have a meal tie up their arms jab in needles and stare out at nothing after the dope really gets into their blood they sigh and nod and fall asleep and they just look like anyone napping sometimes couples park at the edge of the lot including gay guys talking making out smoking you can see cigarettes in the distance like little orange stars everyone having a good time thats what i thought they were going to do tonight someones always cutting the chain and the rangers take weeks to fix it the cops dont patrol much because its park ranger territory the parks huge in the library i found a book that said it had acres it also said the park got started in a weird way a crazy guy named colonel griffith tried to kill his wife and he had to give the land to the city in return for not going to jail so maybe theres something about the place thats unlucky for women six hundred forty acres is a square mile so with were talking major humongous i know because ive walked most of it sometimes the rangers stop and smoke and talk too a few weeks ago a man and a woman ranger pulled over to the picnic area just after midnight got out sat down on their cars hood and started talking and laughing then they were kissing i could hear their breathing get faster heard her go mmm and figured theyd be getting it on pretty soon then the woman pulled her head away and said come on burt all we need is for someone to see us burt didnt say anything at first then aw spoilsport but he was laughing and she started laughing too they kissed some more and felt each other up a little before they got back in their car and drove away my guess is they didnt forget about having some sex probably waited until work was over and then went somewhere else to do it maybe to one of their homes or one of those motels on the boulevard where you pay for rooms by the hour and the prosties wait out in front now i stay away from those motels but when i first got here a prostie a fat black one wearing bright shorts and a black lace top with nothing underneath tried to sell herself to me she kept saying cmere boychild it sounded like me bocha me bocha me bocha then she pulled up her blouse and showed me a gigantic black tit her nipple was lumpy big and purple like a fresh plum i ran away and her laughter followed me the way a dog follows a chicken in a strange way she made me feel good that she thought i could do it even though i knew she was probably kidding i remember that nipple the way she stuck it out at me like here take it suck on it her mouth was wide open and her teeth were huge and white she was probably joking on me or just needed money bad and was ready to do it with anybody most of the prosties are junkies or crackheads the way those two rangers laughed was a little like the way the prostie laughed is there such a thing as a sex laugh being treated like a kid can be good or bad when you go into a store with money even if youre in line ahead of adults the adults get served first a bigger problem is the boulevard and all the smaller streets full of weirdos and perverts out to rape kids once i found a magazine in an alley and it showed pictures of perverts doing it with kids putting dicks up their butts or in their mouths some kids were crying others looked sleepy you dont see the perverts faces just their hairy legs and their dicks for a long time it gave me nightmares those kids the way their eyes looked but it also made me careful ive had guys pull up in cars when im walking even in bright sunlight waving money or candy bars or even their dicks i ignore them and if they dont butt out i run used to be when i was in a bad mood because of no dinner or a night full of bad dreams id flip them off before id run but a month ago one of them tried to run me down with his car i got away from him but now i keep my finger to myself theres no telling whatll cause problems a week ago two guys got into a car accident on gower just a small dent in the front car but the guy got out with a baseball bat and smashed the other guys windshield then he went for the other guy who ran away youve got maniacs yelling and screaming at everyone and no one gunshots all the time at night ive even seen guys walking around during the day with bulges in their pockets that could be guns the only dead person i saw was one of the old shopping cart guys lying in an alley his mouth open like he was sleeping but his skin had turned gray and flies went in and out between his lips nearby was the dumpster i was going to dive but i just got out of there no more appetite that night i woke up really hungry thinking i was stupid to let it get to me he was old anyway when i get enough food im full of energy superfast when i run i feel jetpropelled no gravity no limits sometimes i get into a running rhythm and its like a music beat in my head baboom baboom like nothing can stop me when that happens i force myself to slow down because its dangerous to forget who you are i also slow down anytime im about to go into the park way in advance i always look around to make sure no ones watching me then i head in relaxed like i live in one of the huge houses at the foot of the park one of the books moron ripped up was by a french scientist named jacques cousteau on octopus and squid one chapter talked about how octopi can match their colors to their backgrounds im no octopus but i know how to blend in i take things but that doesnt make me a thief i found the same octopus book in the library borrowed it brought it back i took the presidents book and kept it but no one had checked it out for nine months thats what the card in back said back in watson the library was pathetic just a store next to the vfw hall that nobody used and it was mostly closed the lady behind the desk always looked at me like i was going to take something and the funny thing was i never was at the hillhurst library theres also an old one but she mostly stays in her office and the one who actually checks books out is young pretty and mexican with really long hair she smiled at me once but i ignored her and the smile dropped from her face like id torn it off i cant get a library card because i have no address my technique is i go in there looking like a kid from king middle school with homework to do sit down by myself at a table and read and write for a while usually math problems then i go back to the shelves ill return the presidents book one day even if i kept it forever no one would miss it probably an advantage of looking like a harmless little kid is sometimes you can go into a store and take stuff without being noticed i know its a sin but without food you die and suicides a sin too also people arent scared of kids at least not white kids so if you ask someone for spare change the worst they usually do is shine you on i mean what are they going to say to me get a job junior one thing i learned back in watson make people nervous and youre the one who gets hurt so maybe god helped me by making me small for my age i would like to grow eventually though mom before she got sadder would sometimes hold me under the chin and say look at this like an angel a damn cherub i hated that it sounded so gay some of those kids being raped in the magazine looked like angels theres no way to know whats safe i avoid all people and the parks perfect for that acres of mostly peace and quiet thank you crazy mr griffith the way he tried to kill his wife was by shooting her in the eye in eight months petra had worked twentyone other homicides some fairly sloppy but nothing like this not even the hernandez wedding this woman looked shredded washed in blood dipped in it like fruit in chocolate the front of her dress was a mass of gore glossy gray tubes of entrail popping out from slashes in the fabric silky fabric not great in terms of latents the blood would be a good cover too try lifting anything from skin maybe the jewelry if the killer had touched it she and stu arrived in darkness encountering grim faces radio static a blinking symphony of red lights they took reports from the rangers whod found the body waited for sunrise to have a careful look at the victim the blood had dried redbrown streaking the skin and the surrounding asphalt running down the parking lot in rivulets some of the spatters still tacky petra stood by the corpse sketching the surrounding terrain and the body tabulating the wounds she could see at least seventeen cuts and that was only the front bending and getting as close as she could without messing anything up she examined torn flesh the lower lip almost completely severed the left eye reduced to ruby pulp all the damage on the left side if you could see your squeamish kid now dad twentyone previous bodies notwithstanding viewing this one in sunlight jolted her with nausea then something worse hit her the pain of sympathy poor thing poor poor thing what led you to this outwardly she maintained no one watching would have seen anything but trim efficiency shed been told she looked efficient an accusation thrown at her by nick implying competence wasnt sexy along with all the other garbage hed dumped on her why hadnt she realized what was going on she liked being thought of as businesslike had found a business she liked a month ago shed gone to a melrose salon ordered the reluctant stylist to lop off six inches of black hair and ended up with a short ebony minimalcare wedge cut stu had noticed right away very becoming she thought it framed her lean pale face pretty well her clothes were picked for nothing but practicality now good pantsuits bought on sale at loehmanns and robinsonsmay that she took home and tailored herself so that they fit her long frame perfectly mostly black like today a couple of navys one chocolatebrown one charcoal she wore mac lipstick deep red with a brown tint a little eye shadow and mascara no foundation her skin was white and smooth as notepaper no jewelry nothing a suspect could yank the victim wore foundation petra could see it clearly where the crimson hadnt settled traces of blush powder mascara applied a little heavier than petra s to the eye that remained intact the damaged eye was a sightless blackcherry hole the eyeball collapsed to folded cellophane some of the jellylike humor leaking out and specking the nose nice nose where it hadnt been slashed the right eye was wide blue filmed over that dull dead look you couldnt fake it there was nothing like it flight of the soul leaving behind what a casing no more alive than a snakes molt she continued studying the corpse with an artists precision noticed a small but deep cut on the left cheek that shed missed eighteen she couldnt flip the body till the crimescene photographer was finished and the coroner gave the okay the definitive wound count would be the pathologists once he had the corpse stretched out on his steel table she added the cheek wound to her drawing might as well be careful the coroners office was a zoo doctors made mistakes stu was over with the coroner an older man named leavitt both of them serious but relaxed none of that tasteless joke stuff you saw on cop movies the real detectives shed met were mostly regular guys relatively bright patient tenacious very little in common with cinema sleuths she tried to look past the blood get a sense of the person beneath the carnage the woman appeared young and petra was pretty sure shed been goodlooking even savaged like that dumped in the parking lot like refuse you could see the fineness of her features not tall but her legs were long and shapely exposed to midthigh her waist narrow in the short black silk dress big bust maybe silicone nowadays when petra saw a slender woman with a healthy chest she assumed surgery no sign of any bizarre leakage in the torso though with all that blood who knew what would happen to silicone breasts when slashed what did silicone look like anyway eight months in homicide the issue had never come up panty hose ripped but it looked like asphalt wear no obvious sign of sexual assault or posing no visible semen around the ruined mouth or the legs big hair honeyblond good dye job a few dark roots starting to show but nice expertly done the dress was a jacquard with hand stitching and the way it was pulled up and bunched around the shoulders petra could read the label armani exchange the shiny things petra hoped would yield prints were a diamond tennis bracelet on the left wrist with nicesize cut stones a sapphireanddiamond cocktail ring a gold lady rolex small diamond studs in the ears no wedding band no purse either so forget instant identification on this one howd she end up here out on a date big hair minidress a callgirl lured onto the streets by an extra bonus the purse gone but the jewelry hadnt been taken the watch alone had to be three grand so not a mugging unless the mugger was an evenstupiderthanusual street fool whod taken the purse and panicked no that made no sense all these wounds didnt spell panic or robbery this piece of dirt had taken his time snatching the purse to fake robbery not thinking about the jewelry she pictured someone ripping away out of rage deep wounds no defense cuts but defense cuts were rarer than most people thought and a decentsize man wouldnt have had much trouble subduing a woman this slender still it might indicate someone she knew the wound overkill sure did had the blond woman been caught off guard petra s brain flooded with fastmotion images she quelled them it was too soon to theorize god it looked ferocious a predators attack the massive frontal disemboweling wound was her guess for the fatal one but most of the punishment had been concentrated on the face gutting the woman then trying to wipe away her beauty such intense hatred an explosion of hatred something personal the more petra thought about it the more that made sense what kind of relationship had led to this husband boyfriend some reasonable facsimile of a lover a beast let loose petra unclenched her hands jammed them into the pockets of her pantsuit dkny saks overstock lightweight crêpe true black comfortable so shed worn it to the freshwater stakeout the blond womans dress had just a touch of blue in it blueblack rinsed in rusty water two women in black the mourning had begun stu continued to confer with leavitt and petra stayed by the corpse a selfappointed guardian protecting a molt as a little girl in arizona on summer digs with her father and her brother dick shed found plenty of shedded skins the lacy donations of snakes and lizards collected them tried to braid them fashion lanyards theyd turned to dust in her hands and shed started to think of reptiles as fragile too and somehow less frightening but they continued to poison her dreams for years as did scorpions wildcats owls horned toads flying beetles black widows the seemingly endless stream of creatures that came in off the interstate poor dad sentenced to hourlong nightly routines stories and dumb jokes and obsessivecompulsive checking rituals all so his youngest child would sleep and allow him some singleparent quiet time when he finally got some solitude what did he do with it knowing dad any spare time was spent grading papers or working on the textbook that never got finished a tall glass of chivas for fortification she knew he kept a bottle in his nightstand and that it was emptied often though she never saw him really drunk professor kenneth connor physical anthropologist of medium repute now fossilized by alzheimers dead prematurely twenty months ago she remembered the day had been chasing a stolen mercedes all the way down to mexico when the station patched through the hospital call cerebral accident fancy name for stroke the neurologist suggesting dads brain had been weakened by placque dad had specialized in invertebrate genetics but collected shells skins skulls shards and other bits of organic antiquity their tiny highwaybordering house outside of phoenix crammed with detritus and relics smelling like a neglected museum a kind man a caring father petra s mother had died birthing her but never once had dad showed any resentment though she was certain he must have felt something shed certainly punished herself turning into a wild angry teenager setting up confrontations till dad had been forced to send her to boarding school and she could luxuriate as a victim his will specified cremation and she and her brothers had complied tossing his ashes over a mesa in the dead of night each one of them waiting for the other to say something finally bruce broke the silence its over hes at peace lets get the fuck out of here dad the tissue collector reduced to gray particles maybe one day millions of years in the future some archaeologist would find a kenneth connor molecule and hypothesize about what life had been like back in the twentieth century now here was this lump of dead flesh right next to her fresh and pathetic petra guessed the womans age at twentyfive to thirty the tight jawline said not too much older no tuck scars behind the ears that she could see good cheekbones judging by the right side the entire left side was crimson mush probably a righthanded killer the head rolling to the right as he cut her except for freshwater her twentyone previous cases were the typical stuff bar shootings onejab knifings beatings stupid men killing other stupid men the ugliest had been the hernandez wedding a saturday affair in a vfw hall near the border of rampart division the groom killing the brides father at the reception using a brandnew pearloidhandled cake knife to slit the older man from sternum to groin just filleting him as his new eighteenyearold wife and a hundred other people watched in horror some honeymoon petra and stu found the groom hiding out in baldwin park served the warrant brought him in a nineteenyearold gardeners assistant the knife hidden in a fertilizer sack in the back of his bosss truck the idiot look dad i solved it no heebiejeebies she imagined her fathers surprised smile at the trajectory of his shuddering phobic baby efficient she swallowed morning air sweet you could smell the pines suddenly she was tired of waiting around itching to do something learn something finally stu walked away from dr leavitt and passed behind the tape into the outer region of the parking lot where the police and coroner vehicles had grouped being his usual methodical self telling the techs what to do what not to do what to take back for analysis the coroner drove away and the morgue attendants stayed behind listening to rap music in their van the bass thumping everyone waiting for the photographer and k units to arrive so the body could be taken away and the dogs could check out the wooded area above the parking lot stu talked to a uniform barely moving his lips profile noble framed by sunlight chief bishop if he didnt get a big movie role first two weeks into their partnership hed taken out his wallet to pay for lunch at musso and frank and shed seen the sag card next to a frequentflyer visa youre an actor his celtic skin reddened and he closed the wallet purely by accident they came to the station a few years ago filming a murder street on the boulevard wanting real cops as extras they bugged me till i finally agreed petra couldnt resist so when do your hands and feet go in the cement stus swimmingpoolaqua eyes softened its an unbelievably stupid business petra incredibly selfcentered do you know how they refer to themselves the industry as if theyre manufacturing steel he shook his head what kind of roles have you had minor walkons it doesnt even cut into my routine a lot of the filming goes on at night and if im still in town leaving later makes the freeway ride shorter so i dont really lose any time he grinned it was protesttoomuch time and they both knew it petra smiled back wickedly got an agent stu turned scarlet you do if youre going to work you need one petra theyre sharks its worth the ten percent to have someone else deal with it ever get any speaking parts petra was genuinely interested but also fighting back laughter if you call freeze scumbag or ill shoot speaking petra finished her coffee and stu worked on his mineral water she said so when do you write your screenplay come on give me a break he said opening the wallet again and taking out cash but the next week he took a part as an extra out in pacoima everyone in la even a straight guy like stu wanted to be something else except her shed come to california after a year of state college in tucson to attend the pacific art institute got a fine arts degree with a specialty in painting and entered the workplace with a husband sharing her bed nick had a great job designing cars at the new gm future lab she earned chump change illustrating newspaper ads sold a few of her paintings out of a coop gallery in santa monica for the price of supplies one day it hit her this was it things were unlikely to change in any big way but at least she had nick then her body failed her nick showed his real soul or lack of leaving her baffled broken alone a week after he walked out someone broke into her apartment and stole the few valuable things she owned including her easel and her brushes she sank into a twomonth depression then finally dragged herself out of bed one november night and drove around the city limp deadened defenseless thinking she should eat her skin looked terrible and her hair was starting to fall out but she wasnt really hungry the thought of food made her sick finding herself on wilshire she turned around headed for home spied an lapd recruitment billboard near crescent heights and amazed herself by copying down the number it took her another two weeks to call the police commission said the department had to actively recruit women she got a nice warm welcome entering the academy on whim thinking it a stupid incomprehensible mistake shed surprised herself by liking it then loving it even the physicalfitness challenges learning to use her flexibility rather than brute strength getting over the wall avoiding the turtle squad and learning she had good reflexes a natural talent for using leverage to floor handtohand opponents even the uniform not the wimpy powderblue top and navy pants of the cadet the real one all navy all business she whod bucked so many boarding school fascists over issues of rank conformity ended up attached to her uniform lots of the guys in her academy class were buffed jocks and they had their blues tapered to secondskin tautness emphasizing biceps deltoids latissimi boys version of a pushup bra one night impulsively shed customized her own uniform using the old chipped singer sewing machine shed brought with her from tucson one of the few things the burglars had left behind she was fiveseven pounds with slim legs boyish hips big square shoulders a butt she thought too flat and a small but natural bust that shed finally come to appreciate growing up with a father and four brothers shed found it valuable to learn how to sew she worked mostly with the shirt because it bagged around her waist and with those hips she needed some shape the result had flattered her figure without flaunting it after graduation she was even happier though she didnt invite anyone to the ceremony still nervous about what dad and her brothers would think a month into her probationary year she told them and they were all surprised but no one put her down by then she was in the groove everything about police work felt right keeping fit cruising roll call shooting on the range even the paperwork because one thing boarding school had taught her was good study habits and proper english and that put her ahead of most of the buffjocks with their pencilchewing agony over syntax and punctuation within eighteen months she made detectivei earning the right to guard a molt a new car joined the others in the parking lot subcompact with a department emblem on the door a woman police photographer came out lugging a professional polaroid camera young around the victims age in sloppy clothes and long tooblack hair four pierces in one ear two in the other just holes no earrings plain face sunken cheeks a spot of acne on each combative generationx eyes as she approached the body petra constructed a hypothetical identity for her like petra an artistic type gone practical at night she probably put on black duds smoked dope and drank stingers at sunset strip clubs hanging out with failed rock musicians who took her for granted she opened her camera looked down and said my god i know who this is petra said who as she waved stu over i dont know her name but i know who she is cart ramseys wife or maybe its exwife by now i saw her on tv around a year ago he hit her it was one of those tabloid shows showbiz exposé she made ramsey out to be a real asshole youre sure this is her hundred percent said the woman peeved her photo badge idd her as susan rose photogi this is her believe me they said she was a beauty queen and ramsey met her at a pageant god look at her what a sick fuck the hand holding the camera tightened and the black box swayed stu came over and petra repeated what susan rose had said youre sure he said jesus yeah very susan began to shoot pictures rapidly thrusting the camera forward as if it were a weapon on the show she had a black eye and bruises fucking bastard who said petra ramsey hes probably the one who did this right cart ramsey stu said without inflection and petra found herself wondering if stu had ever worked on ramseys show what was it called the adjustor some privateeye hero who solved the problems of the downtrodden wouldnt that be cute susan rose removed a cartridge and dropped it into her case petra told her thanks well get verification meanwhile do your thing its her believe me said susan rose irritably can i turn her over i already got all of the front two hours of walking im not tripping as much the way he stabbed her plyr theres a bar on the boulevard called players where pimps hang out maybe they call themselves that because they fool around dont do real work what he did to her makes me think of something i saw in watson out in one of the dry fields behind the orange groves these two dogs were passing each other one was white with brown spots full of muscles kind of like a pit bull but not exactly the other was a big black mutt that didnt walk well the white dog looked calm happy with life had almost a smiley face maybe thats why at first the black dog didnt seem afraid of him then the white dog just turned without barking jumped on the black dog got his jaws around the black dogs neck twisted a couple of times and the black dog was dead that fast the white dog didnt eat the black dog or lick the blood or anything he just kicked the dirt with his hind legs and walked away like hed done his job he knew he had the power i was wrong im not close yet my feet weigh a ton and i start to feel stupid for living in the park tell myself im not its a smart decision whats the choice something like the melodie anne thats a building on selma just off the boulevard burntout from a fire with the windows boarded up lots of kids crash there and late at night you can see them bringing older guys in there sometimes you actually see them giving the old guys blow jobs right outside in the alley boys and girls i would rather kill myself than do that suicide is a sin but so is living the wrong life i check the casio i must be close no matter how many lists i try my head is filled with terrible pictures men hurting women dogs killing dogs planes blowing up kids snatched from their bedrooms driveby shootings blood everywhere i think about mom but see moron instead and now im thinking about the way he called mom a whore all the time and she took it just sat there on bad days he hit her i used to close my eyes grind my teeth try to beam myself somewhere else for a long time i couldnt understand why she took him in then i figured out she thinks shes not worth much cause shes got no education and hes what she deserves she met him at the sunnyside which is where she finds all the losers she brings home she wasnt working there anymore but she was still going there to drink and watch tv and joke with the guys shooting pool the other losers never stayed long and they ignored me the first night she brought moron home he stank up the trailer with body odor and motorcycle grease the two of them got stoned i was out on the sleeper couch could smell the joints they lit up hear them laughing then the bed squeaking i put my fingers in my ears and got totally under the blankets the next morning he came out into the front room naked holding his shorts in one hand flaps and folds of tattooed fat all over his body i pretended to still be sleeping he opened the door grunted put his shorts on and went outside to pee when he finished he said yeah and cleared his throat and spit on the way back to moms bed he tripped and his knee came down on my back it felt like an elephant crushing me i couldnt breathe he came back went into the kitchen got a box of capn crunch and scooped cereal into his mouth spilling it all over i pretended to wake up he said oh man a rug rat hell sharla you didnt say you had onea them mom laughed from the bedroom we wasnt talking much was we cowboy moron laughed too then he held out a hand for a high five his nails were black around the edges and his fingers were the size and color of hot dogs motor moran bro whore you for such a big guy he had a high voice billy billy what billy straight ha same as her so you got no daddy little fuckin accident huh i lowered my hand but he grabbed it shook it hard hurting me looking to see if id show it i ignored him this your cereal bro kind of well too fuckin bad that made him really laugh mom came in and she giggled along with him but her eyes had that sad look ive seen so many times before sorry honey what can i do i dont protect her either so i guess were even he punched my arm hard motor moran little bro dont fuckin use it up tossing me the cereal box he went to the fridge and got beer and salsa got any chips woman sure cowboy then move your ass and fix me some dip you got it cowboy she calls all the losers she brings home cowboy moran thought it was all for him back in the saddle baby we goin gallop motor moron his real name is buell erville moran so you can see why hed want a nickname even a stupid one i saw it on his drivers license which was expired and full of lies like his height being sixfour when its maybe sixone and his weight being two hundred when its at least twoeighty in the picture he was wearing a huge red beard by the time mom brought him home hed shaved off the chin hairs and the mustache and left humongous sideburns that stick out really stupid he wears the same thing every day greasy jeans smelly black harley tshirts and boots trying to make like hes a hells angel or some big outlaw biker but he has no gang and his chopper is a rusty hunk of junk usually broken all he does is fool with it alongside the trailer get blasted watch talk shows and eat eat eat and spend the afdc and the disability checks the afdcs are basically mine aid to families with dependent children my money at least im not dependent anymore mom changed when i turned around five she was never educated but she used to be happier more interested in how she looked using a hot comb and makeup and wearing different outfits now its all tshirts and shorts and even though shes not really fat she kind of droops and her skins pale and rough she used to work the sunnyside weeks and only drink and toke on weekends i dont want to blame her shes had a hard life started picking in the fields when she was fourteen had me when she was sixteen now shes twentyeight and some of her teeth are gone because she has no money to take care of them she never had much schooling because her parents picked fruit too traveling up and down with the crops and they were alcoholic and didnt believe in education she can barely read and write and she doesnt use good grammar but i never said anything to her about that it really didnt bother me she had me nine months after her parents died in a car crash her dad was drunk coming back to watson from seeing a movie in bolsa chica and he drove off route straight into a power pole mom and i passed by the exact spot lots of times on the bus every time we did shed say there it is that damn pole and start rubbing her eyes she didnt die because she was out partying with some grove workers instead of being with her parents at the movies she used to tell me the whole story over and over especially when she was drunk or stoned then she started adding stuff to it the party was at some fancy restaurant with big shots from the farm workers union then it turned from a party into a date her and some rich union guy and she was all dressed up looking hot then she really got going saying the rich guy was handsome and smart a lawyer who was a genius one night she got totally blasted and made this big confession the rich guy was supposed to be my father her version of cinderella only she never got to live in the palace having a rich smart handsome father would be a cool thing but i know its bull if he had money why wouldnt she go after it when she got that way she sometimes pulled out old pictures of herself showing me when she was slender and pretty and had thick dark hair that hung down past her waist she has no pictures of the amazing rich guy big surprise when she told moron the story he said cut that bullshit sharla you fucked a million assholes cant remember nonea them mom didnt answer and morons face got dark and he looked over at me and for a minute i thought he was going to come after me too instead he just laughed and said how you ever gonna know which gleam in the eye produced this little piecea shit mom smiled and twisted her hair i just know buell a woman knows thats when he backhanded her she fell back against the fridge and her head snapped back like it was going to come off i was sitting at the table eating the little hed left me of a jumbo can of hormel chili and all of a sudden fear and anger were burning through me and i looked for something to grab but the knives were across the kitchen too far away and his gun was under his bed with him right in the way mom sat up and started crying cut the bullshit he said shut the fuck up he raised his hand again this time i did stand up and he saw me and his eyes got really small he turned red as ketchup started breathing hard made a move toward me maybe mom was trying to help me or maybe she was just helping herself but all of a sudden she was in his lap wrapping her arms around him saying yeah youre right baby it is bullshit total bullshit i dont know jack sorry ill never lay that bullshit on you again cowboy he started to shake her off but changed his mind said you gotta cool it with that bullshit mom said i aint arguin cmon baby lets scoot into town and party he didnt answer finally he said fucking a looking over at me he licked her cheek and slipped his hand under her tank top moving his hand in slow slow circles lets party right here baby he said starting to pull the tank top off of her i ran out of the trailer hearing him laughing saying looks like the rich guys kid got all hot he started off with more hand squeezes tripping me pinching my arm when he saw he could get away with that he started slapping me for stupid reasons like when i didnt get him a pickled egg fast enough it made my head buzz and i couldnt hear right for hours the worst time of the day was when i came home from school hed be outside the trailer working on his bike hey you rich guys jizz get the fuck over here there was only one door to the trailer and he was in front of it so i had to do it sometimes he bugged me sometimes he didnt and that was almost worse cause i kept waiting for it to happen rich mans kid fuckin rug rat snottylittleasshole thinkyouresmartern everyone then he started with the tools putting a chisel under my chin sticking my thumb in a lug wrench and tightening it on the bone watching my eyes to see what i would do i worked hard at not moving my eyes or any other part of me the wrench felt like when you catch your hand in a drawer but at least thats over fast this kept throbbing and throbbing i could imagine my bones cracking and breaking and never healing again going through life with broken hands and being called claw boy next time was a screwdriver he tickled my ear with it pretended to jam it in with the heel of his hand laughing and saying shit i missed a few days later his hacksaw blade went up against my neck and i could feel its teeth like an animal biting me after that i couldnt sleep well would wake up a bunch of times a night and in the morning id have a sore face from clenching my teeth why didnt i just sneak over to their bed and get his gun and shoot him part of it was being scared hed wake up get to the gun first and even if i did shoot him whod believe i had a good reason id end up in jail ruined forever even when i got out id be an excon with no right to vote i started thinking about running away the thing that decided it for me happened on a sunday sundays were the worst because he sat around all day drinking and smoking weed and popping pills and watching rambo videos and soon hed feel like being rambo mom was in town getting groceries and i was trying to read he said get the fuck over here and when i did he laughed and pulled out a pair of wire cutters then yanked down my jeans and my shorts and put my dick between the blades the sac too billy noballs i almost peed but forced myself to hold it in because if i wet him i was sure hed cut it off rich guys kid got a little one dont he i stood there trying not to feel wishing i could be somewhere else lists lists nothing was working he said snip snip go sing in the fuckin popes choir he licked his lips then he let me go two days later when they were both at the sunnyside i went through the trailer looking for money all i found at first was eighty cents in change under the couch cushions and i was getting discouraged and wondering if i could leave without money then i came across the bathroom miracle some money mom had been hiding in a tampax box under the sink i guess she never really trusted moron figured he wouldnt look there maybe she felt trapped too wanted to get out one day if i messed up her plans im sorry but she still has the afdc and it was my balls between the blades of that cutter and if i stayed longer he wouldve killed me which would make her feel terrible and probably get her in trouble for child neglect or something so by leaving i was doing her a favor the money in the tampax box came out to i wrapped it in two ziploc bags put them in a paper bag tied with four rubber bands and stuffed it all in my shorts i couldnt take books or too many clothes so i just put my most comfortable stuff in another paper bag buckled my casio on my arm and walked out into the night there are no street lamps in the trailer park just lights from inside the trailers and at that hour most people were in bed so it was nice and dark its not really a park just a dirt field next to a grove of old twisted orange trees cut low by the wind that dont fruit anymore and one long curvy open road that leads to the highway i walked the highway all night staying on the grass far as i could from the road so cars and trucks couldnt see me it was mostly trucks big ones and they just zoomed by creating their own storms i must have walked twelve miles because the sign at bolsa chica said its that far to watson but my feet werent hurting that bad and i felt free the station was closed because the first bus to la was at am i waited around till some old mexican went behind the counter and he took forty of my tampax dollars without even looking up i bought a sweet roll and milk at the station and a mad magazine from the news rack was first on the bus sitting in the last row everyone else was mexican mostly workers and a few women one of them pregnant and moving around in her seat a lot the bus was old and hot but pretty clean the driver was an old white guy with a crushed face and a hat too big for him he chewed gum and spit out the window started off slowly but once he got going we were rolling along and some of the mexicans took out food we drove by some usedcar lots on the outskirts of bolsa chica all these windshields reflecting white light like mirrors then some strawberry fields covered with strips of plastic when id passed them with mom shed always say strawberry fields just like the song i thought about her then made myself stop after the fields came nothing but road and mountains a little while later we passed the place where moms parents drove off the road i stared at it watched it disappear through the back window then i fell asleep stu drew petra aside cart ramsey if its true she seemed sure he glanced at susan rose loading her tripod back in her car she looks like a stoner but she does have a certain conviction my first thought seeing all that overkill was someone the vic knew stu frowned im calling schoelkopf right now get some guidelines any idea where ramsey lives nope thought you might me why oh his smile was thin no never did his show have you ever seen it never he plays a pi right more like a oneman vigilante squad fixing stuff the cops cant charming bad even for tv it started out on network got dropped went indie managed to pull some syndication i think ramsey owns the show he shook his head thank god i never got called for it cant you just see the fun some f lee bombast would have with that his lips twisted and he looked ready to spit as he turned his back on petra whats especially bad about the show she said he faced her wooden dialogue weak story lines no character development ramsey cant act need more it fills space in a latesunday time slot so the station probably picks it up at budget price meaning ramseys only a minor gazillionaire stu thumbed a suspender and looked over at the body now covered ramseys ex means media carrion while i call schoelkopf would you please go over to ms rose and ask her to keep her mouth zipped till the bosses have weighed in before she could reply he started for their car a uniform began waving frantically from the far end of the parking lot and they both hurried over found this right over there the cop pointed to some brush near the entry gate didnt touch it a black ostrich purse a tall young tech named alan lau gloved up and went through it compact lipstick also mac that made petras stomach flutter loose change a black ostrich wallet inside the wallet were credit cards some made out to lisa ramsey others to lisa boehlinger california drivers license with a picture of a gorgeous blonde lisa lee ramsey the birthdate made her twentyseven years old fivefive matched the corpse address on doheny drive an apartment beverly hills no paper money emptied and tossed said petra a robbery or wanting to make it look like one stu didnt comment just headed for the car again as lau began bagging the contents petra returned to the body susan rose was near the feet capping her camera lens finished she said want me to shoot something else maybe the hills up there said petra were waiting for the ks depends on what they find susan shrugged i get paid either way she reached under her grubby sweatshirt drew out a necklace and began playing with it guitar picks on a steel chain bingo for detective connors intuition play music said petra susan looked puzzled oh this no my boyfriends in a band what kind of music alternative you into it petra kept her smile within bounds and shook her head tonedeaf susan nodded i can carry a tune but thats about it listen said petra thanks again for the id you were right course i was but no big deal you wouldve found out soon enough the photographer turned to leave one other thing susan who she is complicates things so wed appreciate it if you dont talk to anyone about this until we work out a plan for handling the press susan fingered the necklace sure but someone like this everyonell know before you can say senseless murder exactly weve got a narrow window of opportunity detective bishops calling the brass right now trying to get a plan were also going to need to inform cart ramsey any idea where he lives calabasas said susan petra stared at her the photographer shrugged it was on that tabloid show like lifestyles of the rich and famous sitting in the jacuzzi drinking champagne a little putting green her in some beauty pageant bathing suit competition or something then after he beat her up with a black eye split lip you know before and after a beauty queen said petra miss something they showed her playing the saxophone look where her talent got her hey herere the dogs two k officers one with a german shepherd the other with a chocolate labrador took instructions from stu and started up the slope above the parking lot captain schoelkopf was in a meeting at parker center but stu managed to get patched through when schoelkopf found out who the victim was he let out a stream of profanity ending with a warning not to fup stus cleansed translation doheny drive was a jurisdictional mess cutting through la beverly hills west hollywood a lucky break lisas apartment was lapd territory and uniforms were dispatched a maid was working there and she was detained with no knowledge of other relatives stu and petras immediate assignment was to notify the exhusband now they watched as the dogs circled and sniffed and made their way upward methodically toward a wooded area thick with cedar and sycamore and pine fronted by outcroppings of boulders a stone ridge midway up the slope some of the rocks graffitied most worn smooth and shiny the labrador was ahead but both dogs were moving fast closing in on a particular formation something up there thought petra no big deal this was griffith park there had to be tons of human scent all over the place pulling tire marks from the parking lot was useless for the same reason the asphalt was one giant mural of black rubber soon theyd be heading out to calabasas sheriff territory that edged the whole thing up another notch on the complication scale cart ramsey what a name had to be a fake his real one was probably something like ernie glutz which would play havoc with the mr rockjaw image she rarely watched tv but she was vaguely aware ramsey had knocked around on the tube for years never achieved major stardom but the guy did seem to work pretty steadily a bland type shed always thought was he capable of this kind of brutality were all men given the proper circumstances her dad had once told her it was a lie that only people murdered chimpanzees and other primates did sometimes just to dominate sometimes for no apparent reason so was bloody homicide aberrant behavior or just basic primate impulse taken to an extreme pointless timefilling conjecture headgame horseshit her brother bruce used to call it though not the oldest of the connor boys he was the biggest the strongest the most aggressive now an electronics engineer for nasa in florida he thought anything that couldnt be measured with a machine was voodoo when shed finally confessed her new police status to the family dick eric and glenn had been stunned muttering congratulations and telling her to be careful bruce had said cool go out and kill some bad guys for me the cop with the shepherd came out in front of a boulder pile and said youd better take a look at this nature had arranged the rocks in a tight u like a backless cave the boulders were high seven or eight feet tall and there were cracks where the rocks pressed up against each other invisible from below but petra could look between them and see the parking lot clearly perfect vantage point for an observer and thered been someone there observing recently the floor of the u was a soft bed of leaves petra was no forest ranger but even she could see the bodyshaped compression nearby was a piece of wrinkled yellow paper darkening to brown translucence where grease had saturated it food wrapper specks of something that looked like ground beef the shepherd had sniffed out bits of shredded lettuce barely wilted amid some dry leaves a few inches from the paper petra sniffed the wrapper chili sauce last nights taco dinner then the dog began nosing frantically at one corner of the u and stu summoned a tech over to check it out probably body fluid said the shepherds handler he acts that way when he smells body fluid alan lau came over petra noticed he had nervous hands a few minutes later the field kit results urine on these leaves human human or ape said lau well said stu unless some chimp got loose from the zoo and bought himself dinner its probably safe to say homo sapiens lau frowned probably anything else any other fluids like blood like anything alan lau flinched not so far check it out please lau returned to swabbing dusting probing susan rose was summoned back to take pictures of the rocks petra sketched them anyway then drifted away all that scientific work going on but it was she who had the next find twenty feet above the rocks where shed gone to explore because there was nothing for her to do and the dogs had moved on but theyd missed something half concealed by leaves and pine needles flash of color beneath the green and brown red at first she thought more blood uhoh then she bent and saw what it was looked around for stu he was back at the car talking on his cell phone the minuscule one his father the retired eye surgeon had given him for christmas petra beckoned lau he sifted and found nothing around the red object and susan snapped away they left and petra gloved up and picked it up a book thick heavy hardcover rebound in red leatherette library call number on the spine our presidents the march of american history she flipped it open la public library hillhurst branch the los feliz district checkout card still in the pocket not much action on this one seven stamps in four years the most recent nine months ago stolen deacquisitioned she knew the library got rid of stock all the time because back in her starving artist days shed filled her bookshelves with some great rejects she flipped pages no deacquisition stamp but that didnt prove anything petras mental camera began snapping had some homeless guy with an interest in us history found himself a nice little natural leanto where he could read and eat a taco and take a leak in the great wide open only to witness a murder but no grease on the book so maybe it had no connection to the person who sacked out behind the ushaped rocks or maybe mr taco was a neat eater even if the book was his no big deal there was nothing to say hed been around precisely when lisa ramsey was being butchered except for the fact that the urine was fresh within twelve hours according to lau and dr leavitt had estimated the murder at between midnight and am a witness or the murderer himself the fiend from the hills hiding behind the rocks waiting for the perfect victim susan rose had made the logical assumption that wifebeater ramsey was the prime suspect but other theories had to be considered but what would have brought lisa boehlingerramsey to griffith park at night and where was her car jacked was robbery the motive after all would someone this vicious need a motive a nut crime then why had the money been taken why not the jewelry something didnt mesh she just couldnt see a woman like lisa coming alone to the park at that hour all made up wearing jewelry that little black dress it spelled date out for the evening and shed detoured or had been detoured why by whom something hushhush buying drugs there were lots of easier ways to score dope in la a date with the murderer had he driven her here with intent if lisa had gone out on the town with a man maybe someone had seen the two of them together one thing was sure if it was a date the lucky guy hadnt been some loner who read old library books and ate tacos and peed behind rocks crashing in the park no indoor plumbing spelled homeless modernday caveman staking out his spot behind the rocks and marking it a spot from which he had a vantage view of the murder scene or maybe hed wet himself out of fear seeing it looking between those rocks and seeing it almost there for sure now the sun is out and i feel uncovered like a target on a video game something small that gets eaten i can walk forever if i have to all ive done in la is walk the bus let me off in a station full of people and echoes outside the sky was a strange brownish gray and the air smelled bitter i had no idea which way to go in one direction were what looked like factories power poles trucks going back and forth people seemed to be going the other way so i followed them so much noise everyone staring straight ahead between each block were alleys full of garbage cans with weirdlooking guys sitting against the wall some of them watched me pass with cold eyes i walked three blocks before i realized i was being followed by one of them a real crazylooking guy with rags around his head he saw me spot him and came at me faster i ran and slid into the crowd feeling the money in my shorts bouncing around but making sure not to touch it or look at it everyone was taller than me and i couldnt see too far in front of me i kept pushing through saying excuse me and finally two blocks later he gave up and turned around my heart was going really fast and my mouth was dry people kept piling onto the sidewalk mostly mexicans and a few chinese some of the signs on restaurants were in spanish and one huge movie theater with gold scrolls over the sign was playing something called mi vida mi amor a bunch of guys were selling fruit ices and churros and hot dogs from carts and now my mouth filled with spit i started to wonder if i was dreaming or in some foreign country i walked till i found a street where the buildings were cleaner and newer the nicestlooking building was something called the college club with us and california flags out in front and a pinkfaced guy in a gray uniform and hat with his arms folded across his chest as i walked by he looked down his nose as if id farted or done something rude then a long black car pulled up to the curb and all of a sudden he was just a servant hurrying to open the door and saying how are you today sir to a whitehaired guy in a blue suit i made it to a little park that looked nice with a fountain and some colorful statues but when i got closer i saw that the benches were full of more weird guys right next door was a place called the childrens museum but no kids were going in i was tired and hungry and thirsty didnt want to spend any more of the tampax money till i had a plan i sat down on a corner of grass and tried to figure it out i came to la because it was the closest real city i knew but the only neighborhoods id heard about were anaheim where disneyland is beverly hills hollywood and malibu anaheim was probably far and what else was there besides disneyland id seen a tv show about hollywood that said kids still came there looking for movie stars and got into trouble beverly hills was full of rich people and the way the guy in the gray uniform had looked at me told that wouldnt be safe that left malibu but that was the beach nowhere to hide maybe something near hollywood would be okay i wasnt like those other kids thinking life was a movie all i wanted was to be left alone no one putting my dick in a wire cutter i sat there for a long time thinking id been crazy to leave where would i live what would i eat where would i sleep the weather was good now but what would happen in the winter but too late to go back now mom would find out about the money and think of me as a thief and moron my stomach started to hurt really bad i started to think people were looking at me but when i checked no one was my lips felt like sandpaper again even my eyes felt dry it hurt to blink i stood up figuring id just walk then i saw two people coming through the park holding hands a guy and a girl maybe twenty or twentyfive wearing jeans and long hair and looking pretty relaxed i said excuse me and smiled asked them where hollywood was and malibu just to play it safe malibu huh said the guy he had a fuzzy little beard and his hair was longer than the girls my parents are in there i said pointing to the museum they took my little brother in but i figured it was boring they promised to take me to the beach and hollywood if we can find it wherere you from said the girl kinderhook new york the first thing that spilled out oh well hollyweirds about five six miles that way west and the beach is the same direction another fifteen miles after that kinderhook huh that a small town uhhuh i had no idea all i knew was it was martin van burens birthplace you a farm boy not really we live in a house oh she smiled again even wider and looked at the guy he seemed bored well tell your parents hollyweird is weird all kinds of freaks be careful you know during the day if youre with your parents it should be okay but not at night right chuck yeah said chuck touching his little beard if you go check out the wax museum on hollywood boulevard little dude its pretty cool and the chinese theater ever hear of that sure i said where the movie stars put their hands and feet in the cement yeah said the guy laughing and their minds in the gutter they laughed and walked on the first bus i got on the driver said i needed exact change so i had to get off and buy a lime snowcone and get change which was fine because it took care of my thirst and put a sweet taste in my mouth half an hour later another bus came along and i was ready with the right coins like someone who belonged the bus made a lot of stops and there was so much traffic i could see the sky turning grayishpink through the tinted bus windows by the time the driver called out hollywood boulevard it didnt look that much different from whered id just been old buildings with cheaplooking stores and theaters same noise too waves of noise that never stopped watson has its sounds dogs barking trucks rumbling over the highway people yelling when theyre mad but each noise is separate you can make sense of things here in la everythings one big soup at the trailer park i could walk around at night look in windows ive even seen people doing sex not just young people old ones too with white hair and flabby skin moving around under a blanket with their eyes closed and their mouths open holding on to each other like theyre drowning i knew places in the groves where it was always quiet hollywood didnt look like a place where i could find quiet but here i was i walked up hollywood boulevard looking out for the freaks chuck had warned me about not sure who they really were i saw a big tall woman with huge hands that i realized was a man and that sure qualified teenagers with rooster hair and black lipstick more drunks some of them pushing shopping carts black people brown people chinese whatever the restaurants sold stuff id never heard of like gyros and shwarma and okidogs the stores sold clothing costumes and masks souvenirs boomboxes fancy underwear for girls lots of bars one of them called the cave had a row of harleys parked in front and guys coming in and out big and ugly dressed like moron seeing them made my stomach burn i went past there really fast i saw a hamburger stand that looked normal but the guy inside was chinese and he didnt look up when i stood there one hand kept frying meat and his face was half hidden by smoke and steam two dollars fortytwo cents for a burger i couldnt spend anything till i had a plan but i did manage to take some ketchup packets lying out on the counter i ducked behind a building opened them and sucked out the ketchup then i kept walking to a street called western avenue and turned right because i saw some mountains in the distance to get to them i had to pass a porno theater with xxxxxs all over the front and posters of blond women with big open mouths then some really dirty buildings with wood over the windows i saw women in short shorts talking on pay phones and giving each other cigarettes and guys hanging nearby smoking the mountains were pretty and by now the sun was behind them with a yelloworange glow shooting up and spreading on top like a hat made of melted copper a block later i had to cross the street because teenagers were laughing and pointing at me i passed another alley no weird drunks here just lots of garbage dumpsters and the back doors of stores and restaurants a sweating fat guy wearing a stained white apron came out of a place called la fiesta holding armfuls of bread wrapped in plastic he threw them in a dumpster and went back inside i waited for him to come back but he didnt looked around to make sure still no one was watching and went over to the dumpster to get a look inside i had to stand on a cardboard box that didnt feel too strong and keep hitting flies away once i got up there the smell was terrible the bread sat on top of rottenlooking vegetables with brown edges wet paper scraps of meat and bones and hunks of uncooked white fat little white worms crawled all over the meat which smelled worse than a dead dog but the bread looked clean hot dog buns still totally wrapped probably stale when people go to restaurants they want everything superfresh one time the only time mom and moron and i went to a restaurant it was a dennys in bolsa chica and moron sent his fried chicken back because he said it tasted like warmedover shit the waitress called the manager who told moron not to use that language moron stood up to show he was taller than the manager with mom holding on to his arm saying cowboy cmon cmon finally the manager agreed to give us our food to go for free if we left i reached in and grabbed two packages of buns almost falling into the dumpster and getting some crud on my tshirt but i had the buns and they were clean after looking around some more i walked a ways into the alley found a dark spot between two other dumpsters tore open the first package bit into a bun stale all right but my chewing mushed it up and by the third mouthful it started to taste sweet then the smell of the dumpster came back to me and i started to gag i got up walked around took deep breaths and told myself it was my imagination pretend these were homemade buns right out of the oven baked by some tv commercial mom with a wideawake smile and a strong interest in nutrition it worked a little the rest of the bun didnt taste great but i got it down back to the mountains as i climbed the road got steeper and i started to pass houses mowed lawns and all sorts of trees and plants and flowers but no people i could see not a one now after four months in la im used to that people here like to stay inside especially at night and anyone out there after dark is probably prowling for something at the top western curved and turned into another street called los feliz and these houses were huge behind high walls with fancy metal gates and surrounded by pine trees and palms this must have been what hollywood was like when the movie stars lived here the mountains were still far away but in front of them was a big stretch of clean green grass a few people lying on blankets some of them sleeping even with all the traffic noise behind the grass tons of trees a park i waited for traffic to slow down and ran across the street griffith park the sign said the only park in watson is a dry little square in the center of town with one bench an old cannon and a brass sign saying its dedicated to men whove died in wars this was different humongous you could get lost in here interesting said stu hearing about the library book but he sounded distracted hed been on the phone and now it went back in his pocket west la uniforms are with lisa ramseys maid its not beverly hills a few blocks away sunday was the maids day off she just got back lisa hadnt slept in her bed lisas porsche isnt in the garage so it looks like she drove herself somewhere either hooked up with the killer and switched to his vehicle or got jacked weve got to hustle over to ramseys place in calabasas to do the notification then return to interview the maid he wasnt at his studio office and protocol says we make every attempt to notify in person he lives in one of those gatedestate deals ive got the address they walked to their white ford it was stus day to drive and he got behind the wheel calabasas is tanshirt territory said petra as he started the engine he drove slowly as usual more slowly than any cop shed known tan as an anchorman he said schoelkopf called the boss sheriff out at the malibu station to define some ground rules but seeing as its a they punted to their downtown homicide boys the jurisdictions ours but they want to be there when we notify cause ramseys house is their turf they dont want to be perceived as out of the loop a couple of their downtown homicide investigators will meet us outside the gates big drive from downtown to calabasas said petra so on some level they do think theyre investigating it who knows maybe they can help us as in getting hold of ramseys domesticviolence history that anything as they got on the stretch of road that ran between the park and the freeway stu said schoelkopf gave me the kind of lecture i havent heard since i rookied dont go in without permission dont climb any walls treat him a hundred percent like a grieving ex not a suspect no searching of any kind dont go to the john if it can be construed as a search no asking questions that might incriminate anyone because then youd have to mirandize the guy and i dont want even a hint that hes a suspect what about getting hold of that tv tape not even that yet because it would show clear signs of suspicion come on its public domain said petra stu shrugged petra said when do we get to detect when we know more but were not allowed to look for more stu gave a tight smile petra said all this smoke because ramseys vip welcome to locustland i love my job till recently he had what was going on he entered the freeway heading north a mile later petra said what about the book and that food wrapper potential witness if whoever was eating andor reading just happened to be there when lisa was killed my religion tells me to believe in miracles but andor could be two separate guys even if its one the scene spells homeless guy or woman lau said the body impression was small a bag lady said petra whoever it was didnt call so if heshe was there it shows a certain lack of civic responsibility dont hold your breath waiting for someone to come forward so many bag ladies are schizophrenic said petra witnessing a murder would be terrifying to anyone but someone already over the edge stu didnt answer petra let him drive awhile before she said i was also thinking i know its remote what if whoever was behind the rock killed lisa he thought about that then rattled off the same objections petra had come up with plus he added i agree with your first impression all that facial damage the overkill implies passion someone she knew if what susie shutterbug said about ramsey beating up lisa is true he sure fits that bill but we cant treat him like a suspect but we can psych him out while playing sympathetic public servant during the notification which is why im glad youre here hes an actor a bad one but even bad ones are better at hiding their feelings than the average person what does that have to do with me said petra youre good at reading people not at reading you she thought soon after they got on the west they got stuck in traffic common enough situation and whenever petra found herself in a jam she fantasized about flying cars of the future those vwwithpropeller gizmos predicted in dads old popular mechanics just sitting there drove her crazy and both of them knew it stu was a calm driver sometimes maddeningly so we could take the shoulder she said hed heard it a hundred times before and smiled wearily we could at least put on the lights and the howler she added sure he said shifting the car into park and gunning the engine lets use our guns too shoot our way out so what approach should we take with ramsey sympathetic like you said be there with tissues for his crocodile tears crocodile he said so youve decided hedunit if mormons gambled where would you put your money he nodded turned his head in order to suppress a yawn and they crawled a quarter mile then stopped again rubbing her eyelids petra created twin kaleidoscopes behind the thin flesh a headache was coming on she had to learn to deal better with frustration all these years working hollywood stu said and i never had a celebrity murder closest i came was this old guy alphonse dortmund german émigré character actor used to play nazis in world war ii movies got strangled in his apartment on gower real dump he hadnt worked in years drank let himself go uniforms responding to a bad odor call found him all tied up in his bed hogtied with the rope around his neck complicated knots sexual asphyxia that was my first impression but i was wrong he didnt do it to himself turns out he picked up a fifteenyearold on the boulevard showed the kid how to truss him then the kid decided to take it further choked him out ransacked the apartment howd you catch the kid what do you think he bragged to anyone he could find my partner at the time chick reilly and i went to all the usual places talked to all the usual people and everyone knew what had happened it made us feel like rubes just off the farm he laughed thank god most of them are idiots wonder how smart ramsey is said petra any particular reason he wouldnt be in his office youre thinking he rabbited already no we cant assume that hes not filming all this years shows are already in the can his show specifically or all of the shows all the main ones said stu he could be playing tennis soaking in the jacuzzi or on a chartered jet to the south of france wouldnt that be inopportune indeed hey maybe we should shoot our way out of this fortyfive minutes later they got off the freeway at calabasas road and took a curving road north into the santa susanna mountains smooth rolling slopes sported groves of live oaks that had survived progress the trees were acutely sensitive to overwatering and irrigation had killed hundreds of them before someone had caught on and designated them protected fires had fun out here too petra knew racing through dry brush and chaparral devouring the big vanilla retrospanish houses that seemed to be the thing in upscale west valley neighborhoods no matter how much money went into them they never looked anything but retro they passed several tracts of vanilla now some behind gates twinpaddock horse setups small corrals alongside tennis courts and stoneandwaterfall swimming pools the air was good the lots were generous and once you got away from the freeway it was quiet but petra knew it wasnt for her too far from bookstores theaters museums las meager cultural mix too calm also cut off from the pulse not to mention the commute two hours of your life each day spent studying the white lines on the wondering if this was success calabasas was popular with what petra secretly a snob thought of as the nonthinking rich athletes rock stars overnight entrepreneurs actors like ramsey people with long blocks of leisure and a melanomabedamned view of sunshine petra suspected the free time caused problems a recent parker center memo had warned of white valley teenagers starting to emulate the innercity gangbangers what did kids do out here except get into trouble back in her artist days shed sometimes fantasized about what her life would be if she ever made it big twenty thousand a canvas no need for commercial jobs half the year in la half in london it had never come to that of course shed sketched and tsquared twelve hours a day just to pretend she was contributing financially to the marriage telling nick what he earned was his how noble how stupid here we are said stu ranchhaven sat atop a knoll planted with golden poppies high scrolled gates on pink columns behind the wrought iron were the biggest haciendas theyd seen so far scattered thinly on multiacre lots an unmarked dodge was parked on the side of the road twenty yards before the gates nofrills wheels and multiple antennae made it every bit as obtrusive as stu and petras ford they pulled up behind it and two men got out one was hispanic fortyfive fiveten heavyset with a gigantic swooping black mustache and a tie full of birds and flowers his partner was white much younger same height thirty pounds lighter also with lip hair but his stache was clipped and yellowgray both wore gray sport coats black and navy slacks respectively the white deputys tie was narrow and maroon and he had a pleasant boyish face just short of handsome they introduced themselves as de la torre and banks greetings all around nice and friendly so far what exactly happened said de la torre stu filled them in ugly said banks petra said your boss never told you banks shook his head we were told ramseys wife had been killed but not how the order was to get here wait for you we were also told it wasnt our case we should just be here so later no one could say we werent whered it go down griffith park just took my kids to the zoo there last sunday said banks shaking his head he looked bothered and petra wondered how long hed been in homicide think he did it said de la torre stu said our info is he beat her up last year and they got divorced soon after theres a couple of high riskers for you one thing for sure said stu it was no streetidiot mugging megawounds megafury someone took cash out of the purse but left credit cards and her jewelry we figure someone she knew or less probably a sex fiend whoever it was either drove off in her car or took her there in his what did she drive said banks porsche targa four years old black we put a want out for it to some people thats worth killing for maybe said stu but stabbing her two dozen times for wheels why bother silence for a few seconds cash no jewels said de la torre attempted fakeout ever watch ramseys show i did once stinks petra said it would be good to know if he ever caused problems around here we can check with the locals for you said banks offering her a brief puzzling smile that would be great so exactly how do you want to proceed said de la torre i mean seeing as were just here for the chorus line we dont want to screw up your solo appreciate it said stu so whats the plan stu looked at petra low profile she said no treating him like a suspect no biasing the case prematurely ramseys an actor so everyones got to put on a performance dont you just love this town said banks okay well just hang behind be discreet think you can do that hector de la torre shrugged and said me no know in a cartoon mexican voice hectors an intellectual said banks earned a masters degree last summer so now he thinks hes entitled to have opinions masters in what said petra communications thinks hes going to do sports on tv one day said banks or the weather do the weather for them hector de la torre smiled goodnaturedly and looked up at the sky high pressure hitting a low pressure coming down and encountering a medium pressure possibly leading to precipitation also actors beating on their wives possibly leading to murder both unmarkeds pulled up to the pink column the gates had a green pseudopatina on the left column was a talkbox and a sign that said deliveries twenty feet up the drive on the other side of the gate was a guardhouse stu leaned out pushed the button on the box and said police for mr cart ramsey the uniformed guard stuck his head out and came forward stus badge was out and by the time the gates slid open petra could see from the guards body language that he was ready to cooperate help you he said older guy round gut deep tan lots of wrinkles hair dyed beige walkietalkie and baton but no gun we need to talk to mr ramsey said stu privately i guess you understand how highly mr ramsey and his neighbors value privacy the guards eyes widened oh sure so we can count on you officer dilbeck to be discreet sure sure should i call ahead to tell him youre coming usually thats what we do no thanks said stu as a matter of fact please dont tell me officer has mr ramsey entered or exited ranchhaven today not during my shift thats from eleven oclock on the normal thing would be to ask whod been on night shift instead stu said thanks how do we get up there keep going to the top and take the first left which is rambla bonita go up again straight to the top and thats his place big pink place just like these columns pink petra repeated pink as it gets when he bought it it was white but he and the wife repainted ramsey have any problem with that not that he told me but he dont say much at all like that character he plays dack whatever his name is strong and silent said petra you might say that dilbeck stepped aside as they reached the top of the first rise petra said well that clinches it doesnt it its always the quiet ones the park took me in like a friend i learned things like what times the rangers patrolled and how to avoid them which restaurants threw out the freshest food and how if you worked in the dark you didnt get bothered while dumpsterdiving who people were the guys on western were drug dealers and all they wanted was to do their business without being annoyed so i stayed on the other side of the street after about a month one of them crossed over and said smart boy and gave me five dollars i learned how to get stuff if you go far enough east on los feliz the fancy houses stop and there are apartments on sunday the people who live in the apartments sell stuff out on their front lawns and if you wait till the end of the day you can pick up things extracheap because they dont want to bother packing it up i bought a green blanket that smelled of wet dog for one dollar and a sleeping bag for three and i got the guy who was selling the sleeping bag to throw in a pocketknife with three blades one of them a screwdriver for free sometimes the people selling looked at me strangely like whats a kid doing buying underwear but they never turned down my money i bought a flashlight two packets of aa batteries some old tshirts a sweater and a round couch pillow that was hard as rock and rotted a total waste i spent thirtyfour more tampax dollars the first month adding the five i got from the dope dealer that left fiftyfour dollars i found the five places and spread my stuff around them i learned when to smile when not to who to look at who to ignore found out money is a language i made mistakes ate bad food and got sick one time really bad throwing up for three days straight with fever and chills and sure i was going to die that time i was in a cave in three living with bugs and spiders and not caring on the third day i crept out before sunrise and washed my clothes in the brook my legs were so weak it felt like someone was kicking me in back of my knees i got better but since then my stomach hurts a lot i learned about prosties and pimps and saw people doing sex in alleys mostly women down on their knees sucking on guys who didnt move just groaned i realized that to get enough money so no one would use me id have to be educated but how was i going to do that living in the park the answer i came up with was teach yourself meaning schoolbooks meaning a school a junior high because back in watson i was in seventh grade even though a counselor visiting from bakersfield once showed me some puzzles and told me i could skip to eighth if mom signed some forms she said she would but she never did and then she lost the forms and the counselor never asked so i stayed in seventh and unless i let my imagination race around i was so bored my mind felt like wood i found a yellow pages in a phone booth took it back to the park and looked up schools there were no junior highs listed and that confused me so the next day i called the school board making my voice as low as possible and saying id just moved to hollywood with my twelveyearold son and he needed a junior high the woman on the other end said one second maam and put me on hold for a long time then she came back saying thomas starr king middle school on fountain avenue and she gave me the address i walked over at noon it turned out to be around two miles away from place three in a grungylooking neighborhood and gigantic all these pink buildings with bright blue doors a humongous yard surrounded by high fences i watched from across the street and learned that school ended at pm with tons of kids flooding out of the yard laughing and punching each other that gave me a pain in my throat one pm dismissal meant i could walk around in the afternoon and not get busted i made a schedule mornings would be for washing up eating whatever id put away the night before for breakfast reading and studying checking out the places to make sure no one had found the stuff i hid afternoons would be for getting new food and whatever else i needed i went back to king middle school again during ten oclock recess kids were out in the yard and the teachers i saw were talking to each other i slipped in through one of the gates and walked around like i belonged there were two separate supply rooms where the books were stored it took eight visits to get what i needed it was easy whod suspect a kid would take books i got myself textbooks for seventh eighth and ninth grade some pens and pencils and pads of lined paper english history science math all the way up to algebra without rowdy kids or moron distracting me i could concentrate it only took two months to get through all the books even algebra which id never had before and looked hard all those letter symbols that didnt make any sense at first but the beginning was all review and i just moved ahead page by page i liked the idea of variables something meaning nothing by itself but taking on any identity you wanted the allpowerful x i thought of myself as xboy nothing but also everything i took all the books back to king middle school one night and left them at the fence except the algebra text because i wanted to practice equations i knew i had to keep my mind busy or it would get weak but i was tired of schoolbooks wanted some vacation different types of knowledge encyclopedias biographies of people whod succeeded i missed my presidents book no storybooks no science fiction i dont care about things that arent true i found a library right off los feliz just a few blocks down on hillhurst a strangelooking place with no windows stuck in the middle of a shopping center inside was one big room with colorful posters of foreign cities trying to imitate windows and just a few old people reading newspapers i was dressed neat and had the algebra book pencil and paper and a backpack sitting at a table in a far corner i pretended to be doing equations and checked the place out the woman who seemed to be the boss was old and sourlooking like the librarian back in watson but she stayed up front talking on the phone the young mexican with the really long hair was in charge of checking out books and she did notice me came over smiling to ask if i needed help i shook my head and kept doing equations ah she said in a very soft voice math homework huh i shrugged just ignored her completely and she stopped smiling and walked away the next time i came in she tried to catch my eye but i kept shining her on and after that she ignored me too i started to show up once or twice a week always after pm starting with phony homework then examining the shelves till i found something and reading for two hours sometimes i could finish a whole book in that time on the third week i came across the exact jacques cousteau book id had back in watson and thought i am definitely in the right place i found the other presidents book soon after it was the first one i took its the only one i kept and im still not sure why i took excellent care of it wrapping it in dry cleaners plastic so there was no real crime still i felt bad about it kept telling myself that one day when i was an adult and had money id give books to the library sometimes i wondered if id last long enough to be an adult now after what ive seen everything seems shaky maybe its time to leave the park but where would i go my foot catches on a rock but i keep my balance finally heres five the smell of the zoo blowing through the fern tangle time to hide get some rest do some thinking ive got to do some serious thinking seeing ramseys house petra thought back to her architectural history course and tried to come up with a label confused spanish pseudopalladian postmodern mediterranean eclectic hotshot hacienda one big heap of stucco the structure sat atop a peak so steep petra had to crane to see the top pink as the guard had promised a rosy hue darker than the columns behind another set of columns and gates cage within a cage the driveway up to the house was stamped to look like adobe bricks lined with mexican fan palms through the posts she saw a shiny black lexus parked in front they drove up to the gates and now petra could see at least an acre of sloping front lawn the house was two and a half stories tall the half being a bell tower above limedoak double entrance doors a reallife bell looked to be a knockoff of the one in philadelphia wings flared at oblique angles like those of a turkey that had cooked too long and loosened lots of oddshaped windows some leaded and stained verandas and balconies were fronted by verdigrised iron railings and the roof tiles had been artificially antiqued rustgold to the right of the limed doors was a fivedoor extradeep garage room for ramseys studiosupplied limo she supposed no other houses nearby king of the mountain more palms rose behind the house their fringed tops extending above the roofline like some kind of new age buzz cut petra could smell horses but she couldnt see any the santa susannas were chalky blue in the distance no live oaks here too many sprinklers stu nosed the ford close to the box ready o ye messenger of doom oh yeah he pushed the button nothing for a second then a womans voice said ya mr ramsey please who this police silence hold on a long minute passed during which petra looked back at the sheriffs car hector de la torre was at the wheel saying something she couldnt read banks was listening but he saw her and gave a small wave just as a short stout hispanic woman in a pinkandwhite uniform came out through the double doors she walked halfway down the driveway stared at them fifty to sixty years old and conspicuously bowlegged she wore her hair tied back tight and had a face as dark and static as a bronze casting she pressed the remote the gates opened and the cars drove onto the property all four detectives got out the air was a good ten degrees warmer than in hollywood and now petra spotted a section of posts and stakes to the left of the house a corral brown patches of equine flesh moved in and out of view dry heat her eyes felt gritty off to the north a small plane hovered over the mountains a cloud of crows burst out of a thicket of sycamore then dispersed squawking as if in fear maam said stu showing his badge to the maid she stared at him im detective bishop and this is detective connor no answer and you are maam estrella last name please maam flores do you work for mr ramsey ms flores yes is mr ramsey here ms flores playing de golf she looks scared thought petra immigration anxiety unless ramsey planned on running for office he didnt need to worry about checking papers so she could easily be illegal or something else did she know something problems in the ramsey household ramseys comings and goings last night petra wrote down the womans name and then an asterisk be sure to recontact closing her pad she smiled estrella flores didnt notice mr ramseys not here said stu if so it was a contradiction of what the guard had said no here he is here yes the woman frowned hes playing golf here de golf in back hes got his own putting green said petra remembering susan roses recollection of the tv show may we speak to him please ms flores the woman glanced at the two sheriffs a few feet away then back at the wideopen doors to the house inside petra saw cream walls and floors wan come in said estrella flores only with mr ramseys permission maam puzzlement why dont you go tell mr ramsey were here ms flores petra smiled at her again lot of good it did estrella flores bowlegged herself back to the house not long after cart ramsey came running out followed by a blond man the tv sleuth wore a bright green polo shirt jeans and running shoes good shape for a guy his age which petra figured to be fortyfive fifty sixtwo with big shoulders narrow hips flat gut tight waist no love handles black curly hair tv tan the jaw the mustache what was his characters name dack price his companion was about the same age just as big the same kind of halfback shoulders but wider hips more of the typical middleaged setup here significant swell of belly above the belt looseness at the jowls jiggling of the breasts as he ran the fair hair was thinning longish at the back pink skin showing at the crown he wore little round sunglasses with black lenses his bright blue silk shirt was longsleeved and oversized and his pleated black cotton pants were tight around the waist ramsey outpaced him easily and reached the car breathing normally police what is it deep tv voice stu showed his badge im sorry sir but weve got some troubling news ramseys blue eyes startled blinked froze very pale blue dramatic against the ruddytan skin though up close petra could see that the hair was too sable to be real and the skin was grainy with open pores in the cheeks and veins spidering the nose too many dressingroom vodkas or all those years of pancake makeup what kind of news what are you talking about ramseys voice had started to thicken with panic your exwife lisa what happened im afraid shes dead sir what bugeyed ramseys big hands tightened into huge fists and his biceps swelled petra put on a sympathetic look as she looked for cuts and bruises up and down his arms nothing de la torre and banks were doing the same thing but the actor didnt realize it he was bent over and covering his face with one hand the big blond man in the blue shirt arrived huffing shades askew his hair was too blond another probable tint job whats going on cart ramsey didnt answer cart ramsey spoke from behind his hand they lisa his voice choked up between the two words lisa said the blond man what happened to her the hand dropped and ramsey turned on him shes dead greg theyre telling me shes dead oh my god what how gregs mouth gaped as he looked at the detectives shes dead greg this is real ramsey roared and for a moment it looked as if hed haul off and hit the blond man instead he turned back suddenly and stared at them at petra youre sure its her im afraid so mr ramsey how can you i cant she how this is crazy where what happened what the hell happened did she total her car or something she was murdered mr ramsey said petra found this morning in griffith park murdered ramsey sagged and covered the bottom of his face this time with both hands jesus god griffith par what the hell was she doing there we dont know sir it was an opening for ramsey to fill but the actor just said this morning oh god i cant believe this early this morning sir ramsey shook his head over and over griffith park i dont get it why would she be there early in the morning was she how was she blond greg came closer and patted ramseys shoulder ramsey shook him off but the other man didnt react used to it lets go inside cart he said they can give us the details inside no no i need to know was she shot said ramsey no sir said stu stabbed oh christ ramsey sank an inch do you know who did it not yet sir ramsey rubbed his head with one hand liver spots petra noticed but a big stronglooking hand fingers as thick as hour cigars with sturdy squaredoff nails oh shit lisa i cant believe it oh lisa what the hell did you do ramsey turned his back on the detectives walked a few steps doubled over as if about to vomit but just remained in that position petra saw a shudder course along his broad back the blond man let his hands drop limply im greg balch mr ramseys business manager ramsey wheeled around suddenly did it have anything to do with drugs a second of silence then stu said did mrs ramsey have a drug problem no no just a while back actually shes not wasnt mrs ramsey anymore we got divorced six months ago and she took back her maiden name it was friendly but we didnt see each other he shielded his face again and began to cry big wracking baritone sobs petra couldnt see if there were any tears balch put his arm around ramsey and the actor let himself be guided into the house the detectives followed a moment later when ramsey made eye contact it was with petra and she saw that his eyes were dry steady the whites unblemished the skycolored irises clear the house smelled of bacon the first thing petra noticed once she got past the fifteenfoot ceilings and the junk art and all that endless cream furniture like being dropped into a vat of buttermilk was the fivedoor garage because a wall of plate glass offered a view from inside the house this was a garage like da vinci was a cartoonist fifty by twenty with truewhite walls megabuffed black granite floor black track lighting five spaces but only four were filled and no limo these were all collectibles tomatored ferrari roadster with a predatory nose charcoalgray porsche speedster with racing numbers on the door blackandmaroon rollsroyce sedan with wonderful swooping fenders a gigantic ostentatious chrome grille and a crystal hood mascot probably lalique bright blue early corvette ragtop probably s the same blue as business manager greg balchs silk shirt in the fifth space only a gravelfilled drip tray on the walls were framed racing posters and airbrushed depictions of penile cars stu and the sheriffs had stopped to look men and cars petra was one woman who actually understood that syndrome maybe it was four brothers maybe her sense of aesthetics an appreciation of functional art one of the reasons shed hit it off with nick was because she was able to stroke his ego and mean it no stretch the bastard had no soul but he could carve masterpieces his favorite was the stingray the apex of design he called it when petra told him she was pregnant he looked at her as if she were an edsel greg balch was a few feet ahead squiring ramsey into the next room as the detectives pulled themselves away from the glass wall balch sat ramsey down on an overstuffed cream silk loveseat and the actor remained hunched as if praying head down hands laced together on his right knee bulky neck muscles tight the four detectives took places on a facing ninefootlong sofa moving around pastel throw pillows to find space one cushion ended up in de la torres wide lap and his stumpy brown fingers drummed the glossy fabric banks sat calmly not moving a coffee table composed of a granite boulder with a slab of glass on top marked the space between ramsey and the cops balch took a side chair petra scanned the room grotesquely big she supposed it was a den it looked into three equally cavernous spaces each with the same pale overscale furniture bleached wood accents huge terrible pastel abstractions on the walls through glass doors she saw grass and palms a rock pool with waterfall a fourhole putting course the grass mown to the skin nearly gray de golf two chrome irons lay on the nubby grass behind the green was the corral and a cute little pink barn where was vehicle number five hidden so it could be cleaned scrubbed of blood and they couldnt even ask about it shed seen how long it took the techs to go over a vehicle carefully if the investigation ever got to the point where they had a search warrant just doing all the ramsey wheels would require a major crew for days her eyes drifted back to the corral bales of hay piled up neatly two horses lolling one brown one white she imagined lisa on the white one wearing a tailored jacket and custom jodhpurs honey hair streaming had the woman been a rider she knew nothing about her two horses five cars and a partridge in a what belonged in the empty spot ramsey remained bowed and silent de la torre banks and stu were studying him without being obvious balch looked uncomfortable the helping hand not knowing how to help de la torre looked back at the cars again grimfaced all business but managing to take in the chrome the lacquer paint the oiled leather licoriceblack tires banks saw him smiled made eye contact with petra and smiled a little wider stu just sat there the blanktablet look he called it let the interviewee fill in the spaces maybe he found it easy with ramsey because he had no car lust not that hed shown to petra anyway his civilian ride was a white chevy suburban with two child safety seats and toys all over petra had been a passenger a few times the bishops dinner guest if you could call transporting six children to chuck e cheese dinner the video games were fun though she liked kid stuff she found herself touching her flat belly stopped and directed her attention back to ramsey black curls bounced as the actor kept shaking his head as if telling himself no petra had seen that so many times denying or pretending to the guy was a tv private eye actors did research he had to know the drill greg balch patted ramsey on the back again the business manager still wore that helplesslackey look petra watched ramsey some more thought what if hes clean what if this is the worst kind of whodunit then she reminded herself that hed beaten lisa up played parts for a living she gazed at the huge formless rooms den den den how many dens did a wolf need finally ramsey straightened and said thanks for coming over guess id better call her folks oh jesus he threw up his hands where do her folks live said stu cleveland a suburb chagrin falls her fathers a doctor dr john boehlinger i havent talked to them since the divorce i can call them said stu no no it should be someone who do you usually do that i mean as a normal part of procedure yes sir oh ramsey breathed in and let the air out wiped his eye with a pinkie no it should still be me although the problem is were not exactly lisas folks and me since the divorce you know how it is tension said stu i dont know if my calling will make it worse i mean i really dont know what my place is in all this ramsey looked miserable officially i mean were not married anymore so do i have an official role in terms of said stu identifying her arrangements you know lisa and i we loved and respected each other but we were apart up went the hands again im rambling must sound like an idiot and who gives a fuck about arrangements ramseys hand slammed into a palm he turned to the right and flashed a profile what a chin thought petra in his world love and respect meant a black eye split lip his lower lip began to shake and he bit down on it could he be posing she said if theres anything you could tell us about lisa it would be helpful sir ramsey swiveled slowly and stared at her and petra thought she saw something new in his pale eyes analysis cold thought a hardening then a second later it vanished and he looked griefstricken again and she wondered if shed imagined it in the interim ramseys eyes had moistened he said she was a great girl we were married for nearly two years what about the drug situation sir said petra ramsey looked at balch and the blond man shrugged no big deal said ramsey i shouldnt have said anything the last thing i want is for the media to get hold of that and smear her as jesus they will wont they oh shit its ridiculous she was no bigtime addict just he looked down at his lap youre right sir said petra sooner or later itll be out so we might as well know the facts with drugs theres always the possibility of violence so if you could tell us again his eyes changed and petra was certain he was appraising her were the other ds noticing not overtly de la torre was ogling the cars again and both stu and banks just sat there noncommittal petra touched her hair and crossed her legs ramsey kept his eyes at face level but he blinked as the black crêpe rustled she let her ankle dangle theres nothing to tell he said it really wasnt any big deal said greg balch his eyes were blue too but an insipid cloudy shade suffering by proximity to ramseys lisa had a little coke problem thats all ramsey glared at him goddamnit greg they might as well know cart holding on to the glare ramsey took a deep breath all right all right coke was basically what finished our marriage though to be honest the age difference was an issue too im from another generation when party still meant you went to a party and talked and danced i drink socially but thats it lisa liked to sniff jesus i cant believe shes gone he started to hide his face again and petra spoke a little louder to stop him how old was lisa mr ramsey his eyes rose dropped to her knees then back to her face was he said was i cant believe from now on its always going to be was she was twentyseven detective connor twentyseven detective connor i met her four years ago at the miss entertainment pageant i was mcing and she was miss ohio she played sax and had a great voice we dated for a while lived together for a year got married got divorced first time for both of us guess we needed practice is there anything else cause this is he touched his neck im feeling lousy i really need to be alone guys said balch can we let mr ramsey have some privacy ramsey continued to stroke his own neck his color had faded and his face had taken on a shellshocked numbness petra softened her voice im sorry sir i know this is stressful but sometimes things that come up during periods of stress are really valuable and i know you want us to find your wifes killer saying wife not exwife to see if ramsey would correct her he didnt just nodded feebly balch started to speak but petra broke in any idea who she got her drugs from mr ramsey no i dont want to make it sound like she was some kind of addict she sniffed for fun thats all for all i know she never bought just borrowed from who no idea it wasnt my world ramsey sat up straight getting dope in the industry is no big challenge im sure i dont have to tell you folks that was there something about what happened that makes you suspect drugs no sir were really starting from scratch ramsey frowned and stood up suddenly balch did a peterepeat edging right next to the boss sorry ive really got to rest just got back from a location trip to tahoe not much rest for two days read scripts on the plane then greg had me signing papers we both collapsed pretty early now this jesus offering a detailed alibi without being asked thought petra fatigued but bright and bushytailed the next morning playing de golf all four ds were listening actively no one spoke no one was allowed to probe too deeply balch filled the silence it was a long couplea days we both crashed like test dummies you stayed here for the night mr balch said petra knowing she was treading on dangerous ground she glanced at stu he gave her a tiny nod yup i do it from time to time live in rolling hills estates dont like making the drive when im wiped out ramseys eyes were glazed he stared at the floor stu nodded again at petra and all four detectives stood up stu held out his card and ramsey pocketed it without reading everyone headed toward the front door petra found ramsey next to her so youll call lisas folks detective yes sir even though stu had made the offer dr john everett boehlinger her mothers name is vivian he recited the number and waited as petra stopped to copy it down balch and the other ds were several feet ahead approaching the glass garage wall chagrin falls ohio she said funny name isnt it as if everyone regretted living there lisa sure did she loved la petra smiled ramsey smiled back measuring her but not as a cop as a woman the grieving exhusband was giving her the onceover it wasnt a judgment she jumped to easily she didnt view herself as gods gift to men but she knew when she was being evaluated la was for lisa said ramsey as they resumed walking she loved the energy level they made it to the glass petra extended her hand thanks sir sorry you have to go through this ramsey took it held it squeezed dry and warm i still dont believe it happened its unreal like a script he bit his lip shook his head let go of her fingers i probably wont be able to sleep but i guess i should try before the vultures swoop in the media its just a matter of time you wont give out my address or number will you before petra could answer he called out to balch tell the gatehouse no one gets close call them now you bet balch hurried off petra touched the glass raised her eyebrows made a show of staring at the cars ramsey shrugged for a middleaged man he did boyish pretty well you collect toys then realize they dont mean much still said petra nothing wrong with having nice things ramseys blue eyes flickered guess not what years the ferrari seventythree said ramsey daytona spider used to be owned by an oil sheikh i picked it up at auction it needs to be tuned every week and an hour behind the wheel kills your back but its a work of art his voice had picked up enthusiasm as if realizing it he grimaced shook his head again trying to keep her voice light petra said what goes over there in the empty slot my everyday wheels the lexus he looked over at the entry hall where the three other ds had congregated no thats gregs car mines a mercedes thanks for your kindness detective and for calling lisas folks let me see you out both cop cars left the development and cruised down a quiet side road stu drove until houses gave way to fields then motioned the sheriffs over to the side when they got out de la torre was smoking gave himself an alibi he said here all night with old greg and all that shit about not knowing where he fit in that said banks could have been trying to dissociate himself from it both for our sake and in his own mind stu said coulda been and looked at petra she said all thats interesting and so is the way he brought up the subject of drugs first thing then he gets all prissy and reluctant protecting her reputation when we want to discuss it i think hes dirty as hell said de la torre the alibi especially bugs the hell out of me i mean your old lady gets sliced up youre clean cops show up to notify do you feel a need to tell them you went to bed early the night of the murder i agree said petra except here weve got a domesticviolence thing thats gone public in the postoj era he knows hell come under scrutiny has a reason to protect himself still said de la torre too damn cute the guy does a crime show probably thinks he knows all the angles he grunted and smoked petra thought of the way ramsey had checked her out then sidled next to her none of them had mentioned it should she no point i hate cop shows said de la torre bastards catch all the bad guys by the third commercial and damage my selfesteem hes not a cop on the show said banks hes a pi this macho dogooder who protects people when the police cant even worse de la torre pulled his mustache lots of tears but he turned pretty businesslike when he ordered balch to call the guardhouse banks said the wifes not even cold and hes covering his rear with the media hey said de la torre hes a big fucking star he blew smoke at the ground so what can we do for you guys check out local files see if thereve been any other domesticviolence calls or anything else on him said stu but quietly at this point we cant afford even a hint that hes being investigated so what was that a condolence call with four ds you bet hell buy that maybe hes used to special treatment okay said banks we flip paper quietly anything else not that i can think of said stu open to suggestions though my suggestion said de la torre is we keep the hell outta your hair go to church and pray for you because this aint gonna be any slam dunk petra said pray away well take any help we can get banks smiled at her i noticed you talking by the glass he say what the fifth car was petra studied his eyes for a moment his daily wheels a mercedes think its spongeandsolvent time could be said petra with all that blood thered be a good chance of transfer what about shoe prints at the scene nothing said stu he managed to avoid stepping in the blood meaning he stepped back or pushed her away either would mean he was prepared stu thought about that his lips compressed id like to warrant that mercedes all right but were not even close to that without evidence what if the guy learned something from his show said de la torre some ultrahightech way to really zap something clean these celebrities theres always someone to clean up after them some walkingaround guy manager agent guesthouse bum whatever but hey what am i moanin about its your case good luck handshakes all around and the sheriffs were gone they seem decent said petra they returned to the ford as stu started it up she said did i go too far in terms of leaning on ramsey hope not whatd you think about all those other hot rods predictable people in the industry are in an eternal quest for the best he sounded angry think hes it probably ill notify the family when we get back i can do it said petra suddenly craving contact with lisas family contact with lisa no i dont mind he began driving his starched collar was tinged with grime and his blond beard was coming in like new straw neither of them had slept for over twentyfour hours petra felt fine no sweat for me either stu ill call she expected an argument but he sagged and said youre sure absolutely you did notification on gonzales and chouinard and chouinard was no party dale chouinard was a construction worker beaten to death outside a cahuenga boulevard tavern petra had informed his twentyfouryearold widow that her four kids under six were orphans had thought shed done okay comforting the woman holding her letting her sob it out then in the kitchen mrs chouinard went berserk striking out at petra nearly clawing out an eye she said at least no one can slug me over the phone i really dont mind doing it petra he said but she knew he did hed told her early in their partnership that it was the part of the job he hated most maybe if shed go the extra mile hed see her for the perfect partner she was and open up about what was bugging him im doing it pard if its okay with you ill talk to the maid too lisas i meant ramseys if i can get her out of the house without being obvious about making ramsey a suspect but i can do lisas too wait on ramseys said stu too tricky he pulled out his notebook and flipped pages lisas maid is patricia kasempitakpong he enunciated the unmanageable name very slowly probably thai the blues are holding her but if she asks to leave they cant stop her from flying back to bangkok or calling the national enquirer ill go right after i call the family he gave her the doheny drive address she said cooperative of the sheriffs letting us lead with ramsey all the bad press both departments have been getting maybe someones finally getting smart maybe last month the sheriffs had been exposed for releasing several murderers through clerical error giving countyjail prisoners gourmet food at taxpayer expense and losing track of millions of dollars half a year before that some deputies had been busted for offduty armed robbery and a rookie had been found naked and dazed roaming the hills near the malibu substation stu said the address reminds me just a few blocks from chasens which theyre tearing down in order to build a shopping center aw gee said petra no more celebrity dinners for us pard i actually got to go there once he said handled security for a wedding reception big entertainment lawyers daughter major stars all over the place i didnt know you did that kind of thing also years ago mostly it was a drag that time though at chasens was okay they fed me chili ribs steak great place class atmosphere reagans favorite restaurant all right youll take the thai maid and notify the parents ill try to figure out a way of discreetly asking some industry types about ramsey run dmv on the mercedes check back with the coroner and the techs before i go home if they come up with any good forensics ill let you know so far so good ill also call the phone company pull lisas records good idea basic procedure stu if ramsey is the guy how can we touch him no answer petra said i guess what im saying is whats the chance of something like this improving the quality of our lives and how do we do our best by lisa he fooled with his hair straightened his rep tie just take it step by step he finally said do the best we can just like what i tell my kids about school were just kids on this one in a way the monkeys are the worst screamers its only am and theyre already complaining in four hours the zoo will open ive been up here when its full of people heard mostly noise but sometimes i catch words like little kids whining for something ice scream lions when people are in the zoo the animals get quiet but at night they really go at it listen to those monkeys screech and heres another one deep something heavy and tired maybe a rhino like let me out of here were stuck here cause of people dont people suck if they did ever get out the carnivores would go straight for the herbivores the slow ones the weak ones killing and eating them and picking at the bones about a month ago i explored the barbed wire fence around the zoo found a gate up on top above africa a sign said zoo personnel only gate to be locked at all times and there was a lock on it but it was left open i took it off walked through put it back found myself in this parking lot full of little tan dunebuggy things the zoo people drive around in across the lot were some buildings that smelled like animal shit with cement floors that had just been hosed down on the other side were more thick plants and a pathway with another sign authorized access only i made like i belonged and walked right into the zoo climbed into the big walkin birdcage with all the people saw the little kids whining then i checked out the whole zoo i had a pretty good time that day studying and reading the signs that teach about their natural habitats and diets and endangered species i saw a twoheaded king snake in the reptile house no one looked at me weird for the first time in a long time i felt relaxed and normal id brought some of my money roll with me and bought a frozen banana and caramel corn and a coke i ate too fast and got a stomachache but it didnt matter it was like a clear patch of blue sky had opened up in my brain maybe ill try to get in today maybe i shouldnt i need to make sure im not an endangered species i cant stop thinking of that woman what the guy did to her horrible horrible the way he hugged her chuck chuck why would anyone want to do that why would god allow it my stomach starts to kill and i take five deep breaths to quiet it down walking all night my feet didnt hurt too much but now they do and my sneakers feel tight i pull them off also my socks i must be growing the shoes have been getting tighter for a while theyre old the ones i came with and the soles have thin spots almost worn through ill give my feet some air wiggle my toes before i unroll my plastic ahh that feels good theres no water up in five for bathing wouldnt it be cool to get into the zoo jump in the sea lion tank and flip around the sea lions freaking out not knowing whats going on i have to control myself not to laugh out loud i stink from piss i hate stinking dont want to turn into one of those shoppingcart guys you can smell them a block away i always loved to shower but after moron moved in the hot water was always gone not because he used it mom wanted to smell good for him so she started taking half an hour in the shower then putting on perfume spray the works why would she want to impress him why would she want to be with all those losers ive spent a lot of time wondering about that and the only thing i keep coming back to is she doesnt like herself very much i know thats true because when she breaks something or makes any kind of mistake like cutting herself shaving her legs she cusses herself out calls herself names ive heard her crying at night drunk or stoned calling herself names not so much since moron moved in because he threatens to smack her i used to go into the bedroom and sit next to her touch her hair say whats the matter mom but she always moved away from me and said nothing nothing sounding angry so i stopped trying then one day i realized she was crying about me about having me without planning to trying to raise me figuring she wasnt much good at it i was her sadness i thought about that for a long time too decided my best bet was to learn as much as possible so i could get a good career and be able to take care of myself and her also maybe if she saw i was doing okay she wouldnt feel like such a failure the sun is up all the way hot and orange through the trees im really tired but theres no way im going to be able to sleep time to unroll the plastic i use plastic dry cleaning bags to wrap and carry things and to protect them from rain and dirt each sheet is printed with a warning that babies can suffocate in them and theyre thin easy to tear but if you layer them three at a time theyre really strong and excellent for protection mostly i find them in the trash keep them rolled up in all five places under rocks my cave wherever one good thing about five is a tree a huge eucalyptus tree with round silverblue leaves that smell like cough drops i know its a eucalyptus because that time in the zoo i went to the koala house and it was full of exactly the same species and they were labeled eucalyptus polyanthemus silver dollar gum the sign said koalas ate eucalyptus polyanthemus could live off them and i wondered what it would be like if i got stuck up in five with nothing to eat but trees i asked a zoo girl and she smiled and said she didnt know but she preferred hamburgers this particular tree has a trunk so thick i can barely reach around it and branches droop down touch the ground keep going inside its like being in a silverblue cloud and hidden behind the branches right next to the trunk is a big flat gray rock it looks heavier than it is and i can lift it and prop something underneath it to keep it partly open the way you jack up a tire it didnt take long to scoop out dirt and create a hiding hole once the rocks back down it works like a trapdoor lifting it now is a little harder because my arms are sore from carrying my place two stuff all night but i use one of my shoes to prop up the rock and pull out my five stuff wrapped in plastic two pairs of calvin klein underwear that i got last month at a los feliz yard sale too big with larry r inked inside the waistband after i soaked them in the fern dell stream they came out gray but clean a spare flashlight and two aa batteries an unopened package of beef jerky that i took from a pink dot on sunset a halfgallon bottle of coke and an unopened box of honey nut cheerios that i bought the next day at the same market cause i felt bad about taking the jerky some old magazines i found behind someones house on argyle street westways people readers digestand the old percentfat knudsen milk carton that i use to keep pens and pencils folders rolledup notebook paper and other stuff in theres a boys face on the carton a black kid named rudolfo hawkins who was kidnapped five years ago the picture is from when he was six years old and it shows him wearing a white shirt and tie and smiling like at a birthday party or some other special occasion it says he was kidnapped by his father in compton california but could be in scranton pennsylvania or detroit michigan i used to look at the picture and wonder what happened to him after five years hes probably okay at least it was his father and not some pervert maybe hes back in compton with his mother ive thought about mom looking for me and cant get it straight in my head if she is when i was young five six she used to tell me she loved me we were some pair just us against the fucking world then her drinking and doping got more intense and she paid less and less attention to me once moron moved in i became invisible so would she look for me even if she wanted to would she know how not being educated moron would be a problem hed say something like fuck the little prick split sharla he didnt give a shit fuck him gimme those nachos but even without moron i cant get it straight how mom would feel maybe shes sad i left maybe angry or maybe shes relieved she never planned to have me i guess she did the best with what she had i know she took good care of me in the beginning because ive seen pictures of when i was a baby that she keeps in an envelope in a drawer in the kitchen and i look healthy and happy we both do theyre from christmas theres a tree full of lights and shes holding me up like some trophy with a great big smile on her face like hey look what i got for christmas my birthdays august tenth so that would make me four and a half months old i have a gross fat face with pink cheeks and no hair mom is pale and skinny and shes got me dressed up in a stupid blue sailor suit shes wearing the widest smile ive ever seen her wear so some of her happiness must have been because of me at least at the beginning because her parents died in that car crash before i was born what else would make her smile like that on the back of the photos are stickers that say good shepherd sanctuary modesto california i asked her about it and she said it was a catholic place and even though were not catholic we lived there when i was a baby when i tried to ask her more about it she grabbed the pictures away and said it wasnt important that night she cried for a long time and i read my jacques cousteau book to block out the sound i must have made her happy back then enough of this stupid stuff time to unroll the place two plastic here we go toothbrush and colgate gel free samples i got out of someones mailbox no name on it just resident so it really didnt belong to anyone another pair of underpants out of a garbage can behind one of the huge houses at the foot of the park a bunch of the ketchup and mustard and mayonnaise packets taken from restaurants my books only one book algebra wheres the presidents book from the library got to be somewhere inside the plastic i used three layers no not here did it fall out when i unpacked no did i drop it nearby i get up look nothing i backtrack for a while no presidents book i must have dropped it in the dark oh no shit i was planning to give it back one day now i am a thief stu dropped petra off behind the station and drove off back at her desk she called cleveland information for a backup work number for dr boehlinger at washington university hospital the home number was in the book too maybe folks were more trusting in chagrin falls she dialed got a womans recorded voice the time difference made it afternoon in ohio was mrs boehlinger out shopping some surprise petra would have for her she visualized lisas mother shrieking sobbing maybe throwing up she remembered ramseys show of grief the nearly dry eyes bad actor unable to produce copious tears the boehlingers tape machine beeped not the time to leave a message she hung up and tried the hospital dr boehlingers office was closed and a page produced no response feeling no relief only an ordeal postponed she called the phone company and went through a couple of supervisors before finding a sympathetic voice lots of paperwork would be necessary for a full years worth of lisas records but the woman promised to fax over the latest bill when she found it petra thanked her then she drove to doheny drive ready for lisas maid patsy whateverhernamewas sunset was clogged and she took cahuenga south to beverly boulevard and got a clearer sail as she drove she played one of her private games composing a mental picture of the thai maid young tiny cute barely able to speak english sitting in another creamcolored room terrified of all the cops who were playing strong and silent not telling her a thing the building on doheny was ten stories tall and shaped like a boomerang the lobby was small four walls of goldstreaked mirror some plants and mock louis xiv chairs guarded by a nervouslooking young iranian in a blue blazer nametagged a ramzisadeh kept company by a uniform petra showed her badge and inspected the two closedcircuit tvs on the desk blackandwhite long view of hallways nothing moving the picture shifting every few seconds the guard shook her hand limply terrible poor miss boehlinger it would never happen here petra clucked sympathetically whens the last time you saw her sir i think yesterday she come home from work six pm not today no sorry howd she leave without your seeing her each floor has two elevator one to the front one to the back the back lead down to garage straight down to the garage most people call down to have car brought around but ms boehlinger didnt no she always drive herself go straight to the garage petra tapped one of the tv monitors does the closedcircuit scan the garage sure look ramzisadeh indicated a slowly scanning blackandwhite view of parked cars murky spaces glints of grille and bumper there he said do you keep tapes no no tapes so thered be no way to know exactly when ms boehlinger left no officer petra walked to the elevator and the cop tagged along big help huh he pushed the button up at the top tenseventeen the door to lisa ramseys apartment was closed but unlocked and when petra walked in she saw the maid sitting on the edge of a couch the physical similarity to petras mental image threw her so hard she almost lost her balance ten points on the esp meter patricia kasempitakpong was fiveone tops maybe a hundred pounds with a pretty heartshaped face under a thick mop of long layered ebony hair she wore a beige cotton knit top blue jeans and black flats the sofa was as overstuffed as those in cart ramseys house but not cream petras prophecyfest ended there lisa ramseys apartment was a study in color red and blue velvet couches with tasseled skirts parquet floors stained black a zebraskin rug thrown across the wood a real zebra rug the animals head pointed toward a black glass vase filled with yellow daffodils from what petra could see the apartment was small the kitchen just a cubby of white lacquered wood and gray tile counters the ceilings were low and flat basically the place was just another la box but the tenthfloorcorner location and sliding glass doors gave it fantastic views of the west side all the way to the ocean beyond the door was a skimpy balcony no furniture no potted palms a cigar of smog floated above the horizon two uniforms were enjoying the view and they turned to petra just long enough to see her flash the badge on the wall behind patricia kasemwhatever was a black metal shelving unit housing black stereo equipment and a twentyfiveinch tv no books petra hadnt seen any in ramseys place either nothing like common apathy as the basis for a relationship the hardedged color scheme suggested that lisa had tired of pastels or maybe shed never liked them in the first place had cream and pink been ramseys idea of tasteful interesting she smiled at patricia and patricia just stared petra went over to her and sat down hi the maid was scared but loosened up after a while fluent english americanborn dont even bother with my name they call me patsy k shed only worked two months for lisa couldnt see how she could help a onehour interview produced nothing juicy lisa had never said why shed left ramsey nor had the domesticviolence episode come up she had mentioned once that he was too old for her that marrying him had been a mistake the maid slept in the spare bedroom kept the place clean ran errands lisa was a great boss lisa always paid on time was neat and tidy herself a real neat person patsy k had no trouble crying on the subject of spousal support the maid said lisa received a monthly check from a firm called players management the cards there on the fridge petra retrieved it address on ventura boulevard in studio city gregory balchs name at the bottom financial manager ramsey paying through his company any idea how much the checks were for patsy blushed no doubt recalling an indiscreet peek anything you can tell us would be really helpful said petra seven thousand a month nod eightyfour thousand a year enough to pay the rent and some bills and have some fun but not much of a dent in ramseys sevenfigure income still things like that chafed paying money to someone you resented someone whod humiliated you on national television it spelled tension but was far from probable cause so lisa had thought ramsey too old for her hed alluded to a generational rift too did lisa and mr ramsey talk on the phone not that i ever saw is there anything else you can tell me patsy the maid shook her head and began to cry again the uniforms on the balcony were watching the sunset didnt even bother to turn she was nice sometimes it was like we were more like friends eating dinner together up here when she wasnt going out i know how to cook thai and she liked it did lisa go out a lot sometimes two three times a week sometimes not for weeks whered she go she never really said no idea at all movies i guess screenings she was a film editor whod she work for empty nest productions theyre over at argent studios in culver city when she went out who was it with guys i guess but since ive been here she never brought them up here she went down to meet them patsy nodded and petra said but you assume they were guys she was beautiful had been a beauty queen patsy eyed the officers out on the balcony during the two months you worked here none of her dates ever came up one guy came up but i dont know if he was a date she worked with him i think his name was darrell a black guy how many times did he come up twice i think maybe it was darren when was this patsy thought maybe a month ago can you describe him tall lightskinned for a black guy i mean short hair neat dresser facial hair no i dont think so how old i guess around forty another older man patsy had a blank look in her eyes the irony had eluded her lisa searching for dad what was lisas work schedule she worked all hours said patsy whenever they called her she had to be ready and mr ramsey never showed up here not when i was here and no phone calls lisa hardly spoke to anyone on the phone she didnt like the phone used to disconnect it so she could have peace and quiet okay said petra so your day off is sunday saturday night till monday morning when i got here at eight lisa was already gone i thought maybe she got a night call then the officers showed up patsy held herself tight and began to rock coughed gagged on her own saliva petra got her a pellegrino water from the miniature white fridge there were three more bottles in there and fresh grapes three cartons of nonfat raspberry yogurt cottage cheese lean cuisine in the freezer patsy drank when she put the bottle down petra said youve been very helpful i appreciate it whatever i still cant believe patsy swiped at her eyes now im going to ask you something tough but i have to was lisa into drugs no she not that i saw the pellegrino bottle shook patsy the first thing im going to do after we finish talking is search this apartment from top to bottom if theres dope here ill find it personally i dont care if lisa used im homicide not narcotics but drugs lead to violence and lisa was murdered very violently it wasnt like that said patsy she wasnt a head she used to sniff a little but that was it any other drugs besides cocaine just some grass downward glance meaning maybe lisa had shared her cannabis with patsy or the maid had pilfered she hardly used anything patsy insisted it wasnt regular how often i dont know i never actually saw it the coke what about the grass sometimes shed smoke a joint while watching tv whered she do the coke always in her room with the door closed how often not often maybe once a week every two weeks the only reason i know is id see powder on her dressing table and sometimes she left a razor blade out and her nose was pink and she acted different different how up hyper nothing crazy just a little hyper grumpy silence patsy sometimes it made her a little moody the tiny woman curled up but basically she was great petra softened her tone so once a week in her room she never did it in front of me im not into anything like that patsy licked her lips any idea where she got her drugs from no way she never said never and there were no drug transactions up here no way never i assumed at the studio whys that because its all over the industry everyone knows that did lisa tell you that no said patsy you just hear about it its on tv all the time right okay said petra im going to look around now please wait a while longer she stood and looked toward the balcony beyond the railing the sky was a strange deep sapphire blue streaked with orange and the two cops were transfixed suddenly petra heard traffic from doheny it had been there all along shed been wrapped up in work interview hypnosis she went into patsys bedroom first a glorified closet really with a single bed small oak dresser and matching nightstand clothes from target the gap old navy a portable tv sat on the dresser two books on cosmetology and an old copy of people in the nightstand drawer one bathroom shared by both women cramped with black and white tiles a black whirlpool tub petra learned from the medicine cabinet that patsy k had taken cortisone for a skin rash and that lisa ramsey suffered from periodic yeast infections for which an antifungal had been prescribed no birth control pills though maybe they were in a drawer the rest was all overthecounter mundanity she went into lisas bedroom twice as big as patsys but still far from generous all in all a tight little apartment maybe lisa had wanted the refuge of simplicity after the pink hacienda the bed was queensize with a bright red satin throw and black linens black lacquer furniture a black crosscountryski machine tucked in the corner perfume bottles gio and poison on the dresser bare walls very tidy just as patsy had said she found the dope in the bottom drawer of the bedroom dresser white granules in a glassine envelope and another packet with three small neatly rolled joints tucked beneath ski sweaters and pants and other winter clothes still no birth control pills no diaphragm maybe lisa really had wanted peace and quiet she tagged and bagged the drugs called over the cops from the balcony showed them the cocaine and asked them to get it over to hollywood evidence atop the dresser was a jewelry box full of shiny things mostly costume pieces along with two strings of cultured pearls so lisa had been wearing her best stuff last night hot date petra moved on to the lower drawers they bore victorias secret lingerie alluring but not trashy a couple of sensible plaid flannel nightshirts cotton and silk underwear tshirts and shorts sweaters and vests and three pairs of crisply laundered madeinfrance blue jeans from fred segal on melrose the walllength closet was full of krizia and versus and armani exchange pantsuits dresses and skirts and blouses sizes to lots of black some white some red a spot of beige one bright green jacquard wraparound that stood out like a parrot in a dead tree thirty pairs of shoes were lined up in three precise rows on the floor of the closet toes out the pumps were all ferragamo the casual stuff kenneth cole two pairs of white new balance running shoes one nearly brandnew in the nightstand drawer petra found a citibank checkbook a beverly hills branch home savings passbook and tucked into the check register the business card of a broker at merrill lynch in westwood morad ghadoomian whose name and number she copied down three thousand dollars in the checking account twentythree thou plus some change in the savings account with two conspicuous monthly deposits the seven thousand spousal support and another thirtyeight hundred probably filmediting salary checks a pair of regular monthly withdrawals too twentytwo hundred that had to be rent and twelve hundred which petra guessed was patsy ks salary variable expenditures ranged from two to four thousand a month over eleven thou in each month five six out leaving a nice sum to play with for a single girl taxes on the salary were already withheld those on the spousal support would probably soak up some of the gravy and coke and designer duds could consume a lot more but given the fact that lisa had managed to stash away twentythree thousand petra was ready to believe her dope habit hadnt been monstrous occasional hits at home maybe at work too supplied by pals from the industry in return for what ramsey was the prime suspect but there were plenty of blanks to fill she was finished by threethirty took down the name of a friend in alhambra where patsy k would be staying had the uniforms watch as the maid packed up her belongings the next two hours were spent going door to door on lisas floor and the two stories immediately above and below and on the side streets that flanked the building of the few people home no one had seen lisa leave sunday night or early monday morning nor had they spied the black porsche fivethirty now she had to try the boehlingers again why hadnt she let stu do it ms samaritan he hadnt shown much gratitude the smartest thing to do was return to the hollywood station and use a department phone for the notification call but she just didnt feel like seeing the office again and drove to her apartment on detroit avenue just east of park la brea once inside she tossed her jacket on a chair and realized she craved a cool drink but instead of indulging herself she called the boehlinger home evening in cleveland now busy signal she hoped someone else hadnt reached the family first taking a can of root beer out of the fridge she kicked off her shoes and sat drinking at the dinette table contemplating dinner though she wasnt really hungry her fathers voice gently prodding reverbed in her head nutrition pet got to keep those amino acids nice and rich hed raised her since infancy had a right to mother when she thought about his cruel rotting death it hurt so bad quickly she chased his picture from her mind but the resulting blank space felt horrible too nutrition force down a sandwich dry salami on stale ciabatta mustard and mayo something green a kosher pickle that qualified there you go food police fixing a plate but not eating she tried the boehlingers a third time still busy could the story have hit the news that fast she switched on the tv channelsurfed nothing the radio preset to kkgo offered her someones symphony while she nibbled the stiff sandwich her own tight little apartment less than half the rent of lisas she and nick had started out sharing a west la flat but right after the impulsive vegas wedding theyd leased a much bigger place upanddown studio on fountain near la cienega leaded windows parquet floors courtyard with fountain gorgeous spanish architecture more than enough space for both their workspaces nick insisted he needed room to stretch and claimed the master bedroom for his studio theyd never furnished lived with boxes and crates slept on a mattress in the smaller bedroom petras easel and paints ended up downstairs in the breakfast room eastern exposure she dealt with morning glare by drawing the blinds now her easel was in the living room and she still had almost no furniture why bother she was seldom here except to sleep had no visitors the triplex she lived in was just south of sixth street a charming old place with thick walls high ceilings crown moldings waxed oak floors moderate crime in the neighborhood at eight hundred a month a bargain because the landlord a taiwanese immigrant named mary sun was thrilled to have a cop tenant confided this city all the blacks very bad museum row was a short stroll as were the galleries on la brea though petra had yet to visit any of them when she had sundays off she scanned the papers for auctions flea markets antique shows even garage sales when they were in good neighborhoods pickings were slim most people thought their garbage was treasure and she was more of a browser than a buyer but the few things she had bought were good lovely iron headboard probably french with an impossibletofake patina two birch nightstands with floral stenciling and yellow marble tops the old woman shed bargained with had claimed they were english but petra knew they were swedish a few old bottles on the ledge of the kitchen window a bronze statue of a little boy with a small dog also french and that was about it she got up and put her plate on the counter the tile was clean but old and cracked in a few places the kitchen at fountain had featured a euro range and blue granite counters cold counters nick had two ways of making love plan a was telling her how much he loved her caressing her softly sometimes too softly but she never protested and eventually he got around to exerting the right pressure kissing her neck her eyes her fingertips as he kept up the romantic patter how beautiful she was how special what a privilege it was to be inside her plan b was hoisting her up on blue granite hiking her skirt sliding off her panties while managing to unzip himself placing both hands on her shoulders and plunging in like an enemy in the beginning shed been excited by both a and b later she lost her taste for b later all he wanted was b suddenly the remains of the salami and the bread and the mustard and the mayo looked like lab supplies pushing the plate away she picked up the phone this time a man with a cultured middleaged voice answered dr boehlinger remote but calm so they hadnt found out petras heart was racing would telling the mother have been worse doctor this is detective connor of the los angeles police de lisa sir its lisa right im afraid so doctor she dead unfortunately doc dear god goddamnit goddamnit that bastard that goddamn bastard that bastard who doc who else

loved the movies had her goddamn career now look where it got her oh jesus god my little baby girl my baby my baby my baby sharla straight queasy still half stoned sat on the couch in the trailers front room as buell motor moran ate cold beef stew out of the can and finished the last beer she was still sore hed been rough with her doing her from the back clawing her buttocks her thoughts cleared partially and she pictured billys face her sweet little motor grunted and destroyed her thoughts he liked doing it that way because he could stand not put weight on his hands or strain his back the only benefit to her was she didnt have to see his face even from the back he smelled like unwashed clothes her whole life smelled like unwashed clothes her head hurt tequila wasnt good for her specially the cheap stuff motor got at the stop shop beer was better beer and weed the best of all because it made her feel far away from things but they were out of weed and he hogged all the beer he was a hog one big mean hairy pig even bigger than daddy remembering his nails digging into her hips knowing they were black around the edges she kept thinking dirty hes dirty im dirty did she have to end up like this or was there some other way she didnt know she just didnt know the hot dead haze that passed for air in the trailer felt smothering the piece of cloth shed nailed up to cover the small window over the bed had fallen half loose but all she could see was a square of black everyone in the park was asleep must be late what time was it anyway what time was it where billy was if he was somewhere and not four months since that terrible day and when she let it the memory stuck her like a knife worrying about him lying in some ditch or cut up by some sicko or run over by a truck on some lonely road that small skinny white body so small hed always been so small except when he was a baby and had that fat face cause she nursed him she didnt want to stop nursing him even when nothing came out and her nipples bled but the nuns made her stop one of them the tall one whose name she forgot ordering her stop girl youll have plenty of opportunity to sacrifice billy gone it had taken her almost two days to realize it was really true he wasnt there when she and motor got home that night but sometimes he took walks by himself so she just fell asleep not waking up till ten and then she figured hed gone to school when it got dark the next day she knew something was wrong but she was already stoned and couldnt move the next morning no one to bring her instant coffee she realized it had been way too long like a big knife the panic cut through her and she started screaming silently to herself oh no cant be where why who why she never said anything out loud never showed the way she felt to motor to anyone that day after motor went out she left the trailer for the first morning in maybe a month the sun hurting her eyes aware now that her dress was dirty and one of her shoes had a big hole in it looking all around watson walking till her feet hurt a real hot day plenty of birds out people she never really looked at cats and dogs and more people she covered every field and grove the stores the stop shop the sunnyside even the school because maybe he just spent the night somewhere and went to school by himself even though that made no sense at all why would he do that but lots of times things didnt make sense shed learned a long time ago not to wait for things to make sense so she kept walking looking checking it all out buying a pepsi at the stop along with a payday bar just to keep fueled those peanuts were good energy not asking anyone if theyd seen him just looking because she didnt want anyone to think she was that bad of a mother not telling the sheriff for sure because he might get suspicious go through the trailer find the stash that night she told motor and he said big deal it was just a fucking runaway situation happened all the time hell hed run away when he was fifteen after beating the shit out of his old man and hadnt she done it too everyone ran finally the little shit had developed some balls but billy only twelve looking younger so small that wasnt the same thing as her running or a big hog like motor no way the day she looked everywhere no one asked what she was doing where billy was not the first day the second the third never not once four months now still no questions not the school the neighbors for sure no friends because billy never had friends probably her fault because when he was little she was living all by herself out in that even worse trailer with some people she was still trying to forget about man shed been wasted she didnt think anyone had hurt billy hed always been a quiet kid even as a baby so quiet youd never know he was even there tears flowed from deep inside her head flooding her closed eyelids swelling them and she had to open them a little to let the water out when she did she was almost surprised to find herself back in the trailer nothing changed seeing the dim outlines of the kitchenette motor sitting there stuffing his face dirty dishes sour more sour everything sour where was her little man the day after he disappeared she had a nightmare of it being some dark damp place a torture chamber some crazy person finding him walking in the groves one of those guys you hear about cruising near schools other places snatching kids doing what they want with em cutting em she woke up shaking and sweating her stomach burning like shed swallowed fire motor snored as she watched the sun lighten the cloth over the trailer window too afraid to move or think then thinking about the torture chamber and getting sick to her stomach rushing to the john and throwing up trying to do it quietly so as not to wake motor every night for a week she woke up sweating from the dreams careful not to move or say anything to wake up motor sick with guilt and fear the horrible person she was the worst mother in the world never shoulda been a mother never shoulda been born herself all she caused in the world was misery and sin she deserved to be pronged from the back by a hog the nightmares went away when she found the tampax money missing and knew what had happened escape a plan shed saved that money for a long time keeping it from motor and all the others before him her own stash for what just in case in case what nothing better billy should have it lets face it shed never use it didnt deserve to use it the worst mother in the whole world maybe not the worst that crazy girl who drove those two babies into a lake that was worse and shed seen on tv about some girl jumping off a building holding her baby that was worse some people burned their kids or beat em she sure knew about that but it didnt say much for her that the only worse thing she could compare herself to was stuff like that did it the truth was she was bad enough no wonder billyd had to escape no escape for her she wasnt smart enough good enough just like daddy had said something missing tapping his head with one hand trying to say she was stupid or crazy she wasnt but she could think fine when she wasnt stoned okay reading was hard for her so were numbers but she could think she knew she could think she herself didnt understand the things she did sometimes but she wasnt crazy no way better not to think but where would billy escape to so small and skinny no surprise there look where hed come from weird the way it had happened because she usually liked the big ones big like daddy hogs like motor and others names and faces shed forgotten all those high school football players and wrestlers doing to her just what daddy suspected they were doing daddy beating her ass even though he could never prove it shed wanted to explain it to daddy it aint hotpants its the only chance to get close to people with goals you didnt explain to daddy goals it had been a long time since shed thought about the future too many years of sour notes mixed in with one solitary sweet night the prettiest little baby those nuns had been grumpy but pretty good to her she appreciated that even though she knew they wanted her to give billy up no way what was hers was hers she fed herself a little gumdrop memory of billys fat baby face she deserved a little sugar didnt she that night the night of shed been so much younger prettier skinnier lying alone in the grove after midnight her choice to be alone maybe thats where billy got it from so maybe they were the same in at least one way she found herself smiling remembering that night how shed actually felt something the warmth between her legs all over her the hard dirt didnt even hurt her back the orange trees green as bottle glass in the moonlight snowy with flowers because this was the blossom season the whole grove smelling so creamy and sweet a beautiful sky dark with a halo of nice light overhead because the moon was big and fat and gold and dripping with light like a buttersoaked pancake lying there after he kissed her and said sorry have to go her skirt still up floating then a vibration loud close as fastmoving clouds blocked out the moon cicadas millions of them swarming through the grove shed heard stories about them but had never seen them never seen them since either a onetime thing maybe it had been a dream that whole night a dream huge bugs like that should have been scary twice as huge as the shiny black wood bees that freaked the hell out of her when they zoomed out of nowhere the cicadas were even noisier so many of them she should have been all froze up with fear but she wasnt just lay flat on her back feeling sweet and female one big package of pollen and honey watching as the cicadas settled on row after row of orange tree covering the entire grove like bunches of graybrown blanket what were they doing eating the flowers chewing away at the tiny green oranges bitter and hard as wood but no all at once they were all gone zipping up into the sky and disappearing like some cartoon tornado and the trees looked exactly the same night of the cicadas magic almost like it had never happened but it had she sure had the proof where was billy lisa you cokesnorting bitch dance with me and this is what happens dance around me and this is what happens oh the joy ode to joy wasnt that bach he hated bach in the hospital where theyd taken his mother when she had to wear a football helmet they played bach and other classical crap trying to soothe the patients patients inmates is what they really were lisa had tried to drive him crazy tried to lead oh the look on her face dance with me darling the domesticviolence tape played on all the eleven oclock news broadcasts lisa and cart ramsey both smooth and tan immersed in jacuzzi bubbles lining up putts on the home green doing a roy rogersdale evans number on sleek horses smooching for the paparazzi lisa as a beauty queen and a gorgeous bride cut frantically with closeups of her postbeating face then somber reporters intoning about the brutality of the dead womans wounds followed by the department spokesman a photogenic parker center captain named salmagundi fielding questions without really answering them petra watched it at her dinette table hunched over another sandwich feeling violated after getting off the phone with dr boehlinger shed tried to paint a desert landscape shed been working on for months swirls of sienna and umber highlighted with acra red the faintest hints of lavender nostalgic flashes of hikes with her dad as she dabbed she was certain it was working but when she stepped away from the canvas she saw only mud and when she tried to fix it her strokes felt clumsy as if her hands had suddenly seized up washing her brushes she turned off the tv and thought some more about dr boehlinger and the mother who had yet to come home what it was like to lose a child a real child what it would be like to have a child that opened up the gates of hell as she remembered what pregnancy felt like the almost crushing sense of importance suddenly she was crying just gushing tears uncontrollably except for one tiny corner of left hemisphere that watched and scolded what the hell has gotten into you what indeed she took several gasping breaths before she was able to stop gave her eyes a brutal swipe with a paper napkin lord what a spectacle disgustingly maudlin poor john everett boehlinger and his wife have lost a human being and you go on like the thing you expelled from your womb was close to human a grapesize piece of pulp in bloody soup a mass of bloody potential floating in the toilet as shed kneeled and retched and cramped in agony hating nick enough to kill him for bringing it on because he had she was sure of it the stress the cold disapproval walking out on her exactly what he promised hed never do because hed been made to understand that shed grown up without a mother that her father was wasting away in a tucson sanatorium that being alone would be true hell he must never never walk out on her maybe hed been sincere when he promised a fertilized egg changed everything i thought we agreed petra we were using birth control for gods sake ninety percent effective isnt one hundred honey so why didnt you use something more reliable i thought it was good enough apologizing was she really apologizing great petra fuck around with our lives like that youre an educated woman how could you do anything so stupid bloody potential cramping so badly she felt she was being torn apart shed rested her cheek on the cold porcelain rim of the toilet flushed listened to it whirlpool away alone barely able to stand she drove herself to the hospital tests a d and c more tests three days in a semiprivate bed next to a woman whod just birthed her fourth baby two boys two girls family members all around cooing and ahing the postcard from nick came two weeks later brilliant sunset over sand santa fe taking some time off to think she never saw him again the hole that opened in petras consciousness expanded hollowing her lowering her immunity more cramps fever an infection back to the hospital outpatient followup feet in stirrups too drained to feel demeaned dr franklins sad sympathy lets talk in my office charts and pictures unable to focus any better than she had during all those mindnumbing boarding school health classes she played dumb what are you saying im sterile franklin averted his eyes dropped his glance to the floor just like suspects did when they were about to lie no one can say that for sure petra we have all sorts of procedures nowadays shed flushed away life flushed her marriage gravitated toward a career full of death using the grief of others as a constant reminder of how bad it could get her situation was okay right in that sense the more brutal the better bring on the bodies so why the hell was she crying she hadnt cried in years this case it had barely begun she had no feel for the victim then she heard lisas name and her aching eyes flew to the screen as the story flashed feeling stupid for being surprised how could it be any other way now millions of people were viewing sixty seconds of tape that stu and she hadnt been allowed to ask for had stu seen it she knew he got to sleep as early as possible especially when making up for lost nights if he hadnt seen it hed want to know she supposed she phoned his house in la crescenta kathy bishop answered sounding subdued did i wake you sorry no were up petra we just watched it too heres stu none of the usual small talk kathy usually liked to chat something different with both of them a marital thing no couldnt be the bishops were poster children for marital solidity dont disillusion me lord stu came on just got off the phone with schoelkopf quote we dont want another fing oj my office eight am something to wake up for yeah howd the notification go spoke to the father he hates ramseys guts is positive ramsey did it he back that up with anything the beating and he says lisa was scared of ramsey scared of what he didnt say aha okay eight am what do you think about the broadcast silence i guess it could help us make ramsey a de facto suspect and get the brass worried about looking stupid if we dont press him a little good point she said silence okay i wont keep you just one more thing dr boehlinger runs an er probably a takecharge kind of guy im sure he and his wife will be coming out asap he hates ramsey what if he decides to get proactive hmm he said as if it were mildly interesting same way hed reacted to the library book was she off her game share it with the captain hes such a sharing person tuesday am edmund schoelkopf looked more latin than teutonic a short trim man in his early fifties he had moist black eyes thick artificiallooking black hair combed back from a flat shallow forehead and delicate lips his skin was the color of allbran he wore knockoffs of armani doublebreasteds and aggressive ties looked like a former cop whod gone on to corporate security but hed spent every moment of his work life in lapd and would probably never leave till mandatory retirement his office was unimpressive the usual mix of cityissue and community donations he let stu and petra right in coffee his bass voice was morningthick barely into the human register on the walls behind him were the usual graphs and pin charts tides of crime that could be surfed but never tamed the coffee smelled burnt they were supposed to refuse it and they did schoelkopf pushed back his desk chair and crossed his legs tugging up knifecrease slacks tell me he said the basso corseted now stu caught him up on the visit to ramseys house and petra summed up her talk with patsy k the search of the apartment and the doortodoor the notification of dr boehlinger presented that way it sounded as if shed done a lot more work than stu she had he didnt seem to care kept looking around schoelkopf seemed distracted too even when petra talked about the discovery of lisas dope the father blames it on ramsey sir she said he really hates ramseys guts wouldnt you so youll follow up with that black guy at the studio darrell right away what if dr boehlinger tries to get involved schoelkopfs black eyes fixed on the center of her forehead well deal with that if and when it occurs lets concentrate on getting some data i know the labs got all the stuff but is there anything even remotely resembling physical evidence yet petra was about to shake her head when stu said petra found something interesting a library book hundred feet or so above the body and there are some other indications someone could have been up there recently theres a rock formation ive seen the crimescene photos said schoelkopf what other indications petras hands had tightened she tried to catch stus eye but he focused on the captain something interesting schoelkopf said tell me about the other indications barbie food wrappers she said like from a fastfood joint specks of ground beef maybe tacos and urine on one of the rocks schoelkopf said someone eating and peeing and reading what kind of library book presidents of the united states that seemed to annoy him checked out recently no sir nine months ago oh cmon that sounds like bullshit he tossed coffee down his throat the mug was steaming it had to hurt what makes you think this person was up there recently the meat wasnt dried out sir a speck of meat a few specks ground beef how long does it take for ground beef to dry out i dont know sir i dont either but ill bet it varies depending on how much fat in the meat temperature humidity who knows whatever the fuck else what about the urine the crime techs thought it was its a park said schoelkopf people come up there to eat and relax maybe they take a leak when no ones watching there are picnic tables not far from there right yes but not right there sir these rocks sometimes people dont bother going to the john is there a john nearby just past the picnic tables people are lazy okay i can see you liking the food and the pee but the book tells me youre barking up the wrong tree because it was dark barbie why the hell would anyone be out there reading in the dark the person could have arrived earlier stayed till after dark what some intellectual with an interest in political science is reading about the presidents god knows why theyre all scumbags eats takes a leak and lays his head down on a rock and falls asleep and just happens to wake up to see the girl get sliced fine so where is he your witness were not saying the book was even related to the food she said it was found a ways up from the hey said schoelkopf you want a gift from santa claus fine but for all we know it was ramsey behind those rocks munching a burger and taking a leak sitting in wait for her she shows up he jumps her the way she was dressed sir she seemed to be out on a date with who maybe ramsey his everyday car a mercedes was gone when we visited his house if were allowed to ask questions maybe we can find out where it is schoelkopf shot forward in his chair you dont think youre being allowed petra didnt answer stu said we have been told to be careful and what the fucks wrong with that ever hear of orenthal james asshole remember what happens when people arent careful silence schoelkopf drank more coffee but remained slanted forward youll proceed appropriately once the evidentiary basis has been established lets get back to your scenario assume she was having some kind of date that ended in a meeting at the park ramsey dope or shes trysting with some married guy or cruising some fucking whipsandchains club who the hell knows and lets say your potential witness was behind the rock what kind of witness bunks out in the park at night and pees on rocks sees a brutal murder and doesnt call us that sound like joe citizen petra said maybe a homeless person exactly said schoelkopf a lowlife a mental case no sane person no legit person would be out at night alone in griffith park meaning weve got a bum or a wacko or even the bad guy himself hell ill go for a scumbag who reads about the presidents but till you get me a lead im not gonna authorize any media release for the info because we are not going to look like idiots on this one i wouldnt expect you to sir said petra schoelkopf stroked his upper lip had he ever worn a mustache okay so what youre telling me is weve got fucknothing run forensics on all of it food book pee but dont get sidetracked because its weak and find the vics goddamn car meanwhile heres what i did for you in the real world made sure the coroner assigned a competent pathologist and not one of those slicerdicers i asked romanescu to personally supervise the post and he agreed but who the hell trusts him he used to work for the communists same for the crime techs ive asked yamada to oversee we dont want mumblebums screwing everything up another fucking travesty like youknowwho and you better believe the media would love to turn it into one they should have some prelims soon keep in touch what im saying is every bit of fiber and juice gets microanalyzed up the yin dont tell me ninetynine percent of the time forensics is useless i know it is but weve got to cover all bases also there were no defense wounds on the girls hands but that doesnt mean she offered no resistance at all so lets pray for transfer one damn molecule of body fluid with a story to tell he scratched a front tooth with a fingernail no cuts on ramsey huh nothing visible said stu well said schoelkopf dont count on getting the guy to take his clothes off anytime soon the black eyes dropped to the phone messages at least the race thing isnt an issue so far so far sir picking up the empty mug schoelkopf looked into it meditating this black guy darrell wouldnt that be lovely what else do we know about him the maid said he worked with lisa and that he was older than her just like ramsey so she wants to fuck her dad write a psych essay schoelkopf put the mug down stared at both of them then avoided their eyes next item ramsey called me last night at ten pm himself not some lawyer the page operator wisely decided to put him through first he pours on the grief says anything he can do to help then he tells me about the domesticviolence thing its going to be on the news tonight he wants to explain that it only happened once he wasnt making excuses but it was only once he says the true story is she pushed him and he got pissed he said it was the stupidest thing he ever did he felt ashamed schoelkopf waved a finger around and around etfuckingcetera covering his rear said stu he never mentioned the dv to us hes a star petra half muttered goes straight to the top schoelkopfs color deepened yeah the bastards obviously trying to finesse calling with no legal shield that tells me he thinks hes smarter than he is so if we do get some physical evidence maybe therell be a way to wedge him open not that wed be able to talk turkey without his getting a lawyer mouthpiece fastern michael jackson gets new faces but meanwhile we finesse too thats what i meant by context no premature hassling no getting accused of tunnel vision petra said the news broadcast gives you a good reason to talk to him about all sorts of things but at the same time you need to do an exhaustive check of all similar homicides im talking two years worth make it three all city divisions keep precise written records petra was stunned this was scut work hours days of it she looked at stu he said how closely related are we talking about start with girls cut up with multiple wounds said schoelkopf girls killed in parks blondes killed in parks whatever youre the ds and make sure to check if any new slashers have been operating in noncity areas that border the park like burbank atwater maybe glendale pasadena yeah definitely glendale and pasadena la canada la crescenta start with those neither stu nor petra spoke dont give me that surly shit said schoelkopf this is insurance for you yes mr pusswipe defense attorney we looked into every goddamn nook and cranny before we busted mr ramseys ass thinkabout your faces on court tv old mark fuhrman sitting around in idaho because youre the ones on the line unless the case gets too big and we dont produce and they kick it over to downtown robberyfuckinghomicide which they could do anyway said stu schoelkopfs grin was murderous anythings possible ken thats what makes this job so charming he began thumbing through the phone messages whats the procedure with ramsey said stu do we wait to look into all those similars before approaching him or are we allowed to start now allowed again you two think this is being imposed on you just trying to get the rules straight schoelkopf looked up the only rule is be smart goddamn yes you talk to ramsey if you dont well be in a sling over that just do the other stuff too thats why god invented overtime he picked up a message slip and the phone but stu remained seated and petra followed his cue stu said in terms of ramseys background ive got some sources at the studios i can see a problem there said schoelkopf looking up movie people are looselipped assholes the fact that your sources blab to you means theyre not real good at keeping their mouths shut right thats true of any case this isnt any case whats to stop them from talking to the press anyway captain said petra what if the tabloids start throwing around money and a real feeding frenzy develops do we keep birddogging the nightly news schoelkopfs top teeth gnashed his bottom lip okay pick one or two sources ken he said as if petra hadnt spoken but know this you will be graded talk to that black guy see what hes all about sooner rather than later have a nice day my eyes are closed and im thinking when i feel it ants are crawling over me they probably smelled the honey nuts i jump to my feet and slap them off stomp as many as i can someone watching me would think im crazy after what i saw i dont feel great even being in the park but whats my choice for a second i imagine him finding me chasing me cornering me hes got the knife the same one grabs me and stabs down my heart jumps up to meet the blade why would i think that its am have to take my mind off it i open the algebra book do equations in my head ill try to eat maybe a piece of beef jerky and at pm ill go down to that place along the fence see if the locks still off made it superquiet up in africa five dollars in my pocket the rest of my moneys wrapped up and buried hot summers coming early lots of sleepy animals most of them hiding in their caves not a lot of people some tourists mostly japanese and young moms with babies in strollers ive got a notebook with me and a pencil to make it look like some kind of school assignment my smell isnt too bad out in the open no ones looking at me weird and someone actually smiled a couple of tourists a man and a woman americans old kind of geeky with lots of cameras and this zoo map they cant seem to figure out i probably remind them of their grandson or something i keep going to the top of africa most of the animals are sleeping but i dont care it feels good to walk without having to one rhino is out but she just gives me a dirty look so i head for the gorillas when i get there its a scene two of the young moms are there freaking out one of thems brushing off her blouse and screaming oh god gross and the others wheeling her stroller backward fast then they both race away toward north america i see why right away shit all over the ground near the fence that blocks off the gorilla exhibit five gorillas are out four sitting around and scratching and sleeping and one standing the way they do bent over with his hands almost reaching the ground a girl the males have humongous heads and a silver stripe down their backs she starts walking around stops to check out the other gorillas scratches walks some more then she bends and picks up a giant piece of shit and throws it it misses my head and lands on the ground right next to me exploding into nastysmelling dust some of it gets on my shoes i try to kick it loose and another chunk flies by me and another you idiot i hear myself scream no ones around the gorilla folds her arms across her chest and just looks at me and i swear shes smiling like this is some terrific gorilla joke then she points at me then she picks up another hunk i get out of there the whole world has gotten crazy i buy a lemonade from a vending machine and walk around drinking hoping all the shit dust comes off because im really tired of gross things maybe ill visit the reptile house its cool and shaded and seeing another twoheaded king snake would be cool on the way in i meet those same two grandparent tourists coming out and they smile again still looking confused i cruise by the boas and the anaconda adders and lizards rattlesnakes vipers and cobras spend some time looking at an albino python huge and fat with pinkwhite scales and weird red eyes will its ugly pale face get into my dreams tonight that wouldnt be bad if i could get it to eat plyr i stand there thinking of myself as the snakemaster communicating with reptiles through mental power calling the albino python to wrap itself around plyr crushing him squeezing him like a juice orange knowing whats happening to him thats worse than just dying knowing a little while later near the edge of the zoo next to a playground that i guess they keep for little kids who get bored with the animals is a vegetable patch with a rope around it corn and beans and tomatoes and peppers the sign says its for the animals so theyll have fresh food ive seen chimps eating corn so gorillas probably do too and that gets me thinking i also love corn steamed sweet but we never had it at home once when i was in sixth grade the school threw a thanksgiving brunch out in the play yard turkey and corn and sweet potatoes with marshmallows for anyone who paid everything piled high on long tables moms in aprons spooning it out i went into town to have a look even though i had no money to buy anything i hung around till the end found a couple of loose quarters and played some skibowl but lunch was out of the question five dollars but one of the pta ladies saw me looking at the corn and gave me a whole ear daisyyellow and shiny with butter along with a turkey leg big enough for a family i took it under a tree and ate and that was the best thanksgiving i ever had now i move closer to the vegetable patch and look around clear quickly i hop over the rope go straight to the corn break off three ears and stuff them in my pockets they stick out so i tuck them under my tshirt hop back over like nothing happened and walk slowly till i find a bathroom i go into one of the stalls close the door sit on the toilet lid and take out one of the corns peeling off the leaves and that hairy stuff and wondering what itll taste like raw its pretty good hard crunchy not nearly as delicious as steamed corn with butter but it does have a sweet corn taste i eat two ears quickly the third more slowly chewing hard and getting every bit down while reading the cussword graffiti all over the walls when im finished i lick all the corn taste from the cobs toss them into the corner of the stall take a leak and use the bathroom sink to wash my face and hands then i roll up my jeans and wash the sides of my legs too my stomach hurts but differently too full i pigged out your lunch is now mine gorilla revenge is as sweet as corn walking back to the squad room stu said he only beat her once what a guy going over us to schoelkopf said petra manipulative being collegial then telling herself to hell with it say what was really on her mind she stopped and leaned against a locker whyd you bring up the book stu leaned too it was something tangible and i didnt want one of his lectures on wishful thinking versus evidence we got a lecture anyway he shrugged she said he thinks the books bull you agree with him dont you he straightened and with one hand pinched the knot of his tie do i think its thunder and lightning no but the lab will run prints on the book and if its a homeless guy theres a chance hes got a file somewhere so maybe we can locate him if it turns out to be nothing were no worse off she didnt answer he said whats the matter it threw me your bringing it up like that hey even i can be full of surprises his eyes didnt yield he walked away not looking back to see if shed followed petra stood there hands clenched she recalled kathys curtness last night on the phone if it was a marital thing she couldnt expect him to let it ride okay cool down concentrate on the job but she hated surprises of the twentyfive other hollywood detectives on the morning roster six were at their desks sorting mug shots typing at newly donated and stillbaffling computers muttering into phones reading murder books all looked up as petra and stu entered and shot sympathetic looks any detective who loved mysteries going into the job had a quick change of heart the ramsey case was the worse kind of whodunit the room smelled exactly like what it was a windowless space seasoned by mostly male frustration a black dii named wilson fournier said knew you were gonna have fun when the boss came in early chewing gum but with no gum in his mouth petra smiled at him and he resumed scanning gangbanger photos stu was at his desk facing hers at the rear she sat down and waited stu said what do you want to do about looking for similars not much he hooked his thumbs under his suspender straps his mm was nestled in a high shoulder holster petra was wearing hers the same way it hurt her arm and she removed it the way i see it said stu weve got two choices go over to parker and pull microfiche all week then wed still have to get on the horn in order to check out burbank and atwater and glendale or any county district or do it all telephonically with every homicide d we can find schoelkopf said two or three years lets do two we could get lucky and move through it within the week personally id rather talk to real people than deal with the files downtown but its up to you the realer the better said petra how do we prioritize do i call around first or try to reach this darrell lets devote mornings to the scut do real work in the afternoon he glanced at his watch you check out darrell and ill start nosing around the studios petra stared down the length of the room speaking of real people we can start with our colleagues here its a waste of time but sos the rest of it charity begins at home go for it she stood up pushed hair back from her face cleared her throat dramatically three of the six detectives looked up gentlemen she announced and the remaining three stopped what they were doing as you know detective bishop and i have been assigned a fascinating case one so fascinating that word has come from above to be extra thorough in order to establish the proper context snickers because we will quote unquote be graded grim looks all around detective bishop and i desire a good grade and so we request your help in locating the unknown perpetrator of this nefarious crime who of course is totally unknown and must be sought out with the utmost care so as not to prejudice the investigation knowing smiles she described the crime scene lisas wounds and said any s within the last two years bear any resemblance head shakes a detective named markus said where was oj at the time laughter thank you gentlemen she sat down to light applause stu was clapping too he looked fine now the blue eyes warm again maybe he was just sleepdeprived six down he said a few hundred to go how about we divide up the districts on the vertical i take east of here and you take west there was lots more crime east of hollywood more detectives more files he was giving himself the lions share of the scut feeling guilty petra said youve got all the studios ive only got darrell ill take east no its okay he said i told kathy not to expect me soon he blinked rapidly as if his eyes hurt and picked up the phone a divorce after all this time petra wanted to reach out to him she said noon break before we go our separate ways musso and frank he hesitated then sure we deserve it starting to punch numbers he stopped himself someone should also call those sheriffs guys de la torre and banks find out if they learned anything about lisas dv complaint the news broadcast said she never filed a formal complaint there you go said stu the news broadcast always tells the truth she called downtown sheriffs homicide and asked for hector de la torre or detective banks not remembering or knowing the younger ones first name banks came on the line greeting her with surprising warmth thought you might call whys that last nights news unfortunately ive got nothing for you so far agoura substation has no previous complaints on file not even the one she went public on so it looks like she never called it in okay thanks my pleasure he said sounding nervous no messy interdepartmental competition here our guys beat your guys in boxing last month so were feeling secure anyway you have my sympathy they replayed it on the news early this morning too made the house look even fancier than it was nothing on his little car museum though what a gabby guy just jacuzzi bubbles and horses and golf interesting isnt it said banks people getting life handed to them on a platter and still manage to mess it up royal anything else you need actually she said suddenly inspired if youve got time weve been directed to do a file search on similar homicides over a twoyear period do you have easy access to county data banks laughed this is la nothings easy but sure weve learned to walk without scraping our knuckles on the sidewalk similars as in the unknown lurking perp why the brass is nervous oh sure ill check for you really appreciate it detective banks ron this is scut ron dont put your schedule out of joint do you have a direct number she gave it to him and he said by similar im assuming crimescene layout wound type and quantity idiosyncrasies victim characteristics anything unusual about the crime scene i should know about no she said feeling protective of her information just your basic butchery okay then get back to you if anything comes up either way thanks ron sure um listen i know this kind of case there isnt going to give you much spare time but if some does come up i mean if you want to get together maybe just for a cup of coffee if im out of line just say so stumbling like a high school kid the warmth of his greeting made sense now he wasnt remotely her type whatever that was she could barely remember his face had been concentrating on ramseys had he been wearing a wedding ring he had mentioned taking his kids to the zoo at least he had kids didnt hate kids she must have taken too long because he came back with listen im sorry didnt mean to no no thats fine she heard herself saying sure when things ease up a bit that would be fine god help her paragon studios took up three blocks of the north side of melrose east of bronson a confusion of faded tan towers and corrugated steel hangars all surrounded by fifteenfoot walls one of the last major film lots actually located in hollywood the rococo front gates were open and stu bishop anxiety polluting his head tried to look businesslike as he inched the unmarked ford toward the guardhouse two vans in front of him one of them taking its time petra had left the station before him taking her personal car petra trusted him a little less than she had yesterday couldnt blame her the way hed tossed the library book thing at schoelkopf without warning her impulsive had the noise in his life finally gotten too loud truth was he didnt think the book was worth a darn had used petra to fend off the captain schoelkopf had preached anyway all the preaching stu had endured teachers elders father easton bishop md was never more at home than when declaring absolute truths to a mute audience of eight kids stu had avoided that kind of authoritarianism with his children trusting them to learn by example knowing kathy was the main influence kathy dear god stu believed in a forgiving god but he lived his own life as if the lord were a harsh unyielding perfectionist it made him careful a sin avoider so why now at this point in his life was everything coming apart stupid question the second van passed through and stu drove right up the guard ernie robles was someone he knew from his four weeks as a bit player nonspeaking squad room inhabitant lots of typing and phoning on la cop decent fellow relaxed attitude no police experience just a rentacop from way back he was scribbling on his clipboard as stu stopped and let the ford idle hey hows it going detective bishop beautiful day huh and it was warm and clear the sky as blue as one of the mattepainting backdrops the film crews used to make la look heavenly stu hadnt noticed he said gorgeous ernie robles picked up the clipboard got a part where where do you think the cop lot theyre not filming nope all wrapped for this year but theres someone ive got to see oh by the way heres something i picked up for you at the station he handed robles what looked like a thin glossy magazine bright yellow letters rimmed with red blared the sentinel at the top below that was a highquality photo of a nastylooking black usp semiautomatic pistol with silencer and blacktipped brass bullets promo from heckler koch stacks of them left at each police station stu had thumbed through it at a red light features on benelli shotguns hk training the psga rifle worth it stu appreciated what guns did but found them boring robles was already thumbing through looking at the pictures hot off the press ernie look at some of this stuff hey man thanks stu drove through he parked and walked to the element productions complex where he found scott wembley easily enough the assistant director was stepping out of a low unimpressive bungalow long arms dangling licking his lips lunch hour wembley was alone probably headed for the commissary stu came up from behind him hi scott wembley turned and stopped and his long pale face froze stu hey like most ads wembley was just a kid a couple of years out of uc berkeley with a fine arts degree tolerating the low pay and long hours and abuse by those who mattered for the impressivesounding title and the chance to make connections like many kids he lacked spine and judgment they shook hands wembley was wearing filmlot preppy baggy gap jeans and an oversized plaid buttondown shirt that looked too warm for the weather and too expensive for his budget a steel rolex made stu wonder even more the kid looked even thinner than last year had a bony somewhat androgynous face fit for a calvin klein ad pimples on his cheeks that was new the palm stu grasped was soft and cold and wet sweat beaded wembleys unlined forehead toowarm shirt longsleeved shirt buttoned at the cuffs and of course the eyes those pupils poor scotty hadnt learned a thing during stus month on the set wembley had tried to get next to him asking questions incessantly wanting to know what the streets were really like because he was doing a screenplay like everyone else even though his real dream was to be scorsese directors had all the control stu had answered him patiently finding the kid a touching combination of genx bravado and utter ignorance then the last friday of the shoot after working hours hed stuck around to finish some paperwork using an empty soundstage as his office loud sighs brought him to a corner of the giant room where he discovered wembley huddled on the floor half hidden by prop walls a spike of heroin embedded in his arm the kid didnt hear him approach had his eyes closed veins popping like angelhair pasta on his long skinny arm the needle was one of those cheap plastic disposable things stu said scott sharply and the kids eyes opened on a junkies worst possible scenario yanking out the needle wembley tossed it to the ground where it plunked and spotted the concrete with milky liquid oh man said stu wembley burst into tears moral conundrum in the end stu chose not to bust the kid even though that was a clear violation of departmental regulations upon witnessing a felony pretended to believe wembley when the kid insisted it was his first time he was just experimenting two other puncture marks on wembleys arms proved otherwise but both had the sooty look of old tracks so at least the kid wasnt mainlining regularly yet stu confiscated the dope kit he found in the pocket of wembleys bomber jacket and tossed the works in a dumpster on the lot putting him in greater legal jeopardy than wembley but thank god the kid wasnt smart enough to know that he drove wembley to gojis coffee shop on hollywood boulevard plunked him down in a rear booth and filled him full of strong black coffee technically as much of a drug to stu then let the stupid kid glance around the putrid restaurant and see what advanced junkies looked like the load in the syringe must have been light because wembley was rattled and cleareyed or maybe fear had outadrenalized the opiate he ordered the kid a hamburger forced him to eat while he delivered the requisite stern lecture soon wembley was mumbling sad biography the horrors of growing up with affluent multimarried marin county parents who refused to set limits postcollege loneliness and alienation and fear of the future stu pretended to take it seriously wondering if his own kids would be like that when they reached that age by the end of an hour wembley was taking solemn vows of chastity charity and loyalty to the flag stu drove him back to the studio the kid looked ready to kiss him almost girlishly grateful and stu wondered if he was gay on top of everything else after that wembley avoided him on the set it didnt matter wembley was in his debt bigtime and if the kid didnt drop out and move back home he was someone stu might be able to use one day and now the day had arrived ta dum good to see you scott you too the kid lied miserably his mouth trembled and he sniffed red nose those eyes stupid little idiot howve you been great what can i do for you detective stu put his arm around wembleys bony shoulder actually quite a bit scott lets find somewhere to talk he ushered wembley to a bench and said i need information on cart ramsey discreet information all i know is whats been on the news no rumors around the lot why would there be because no one gossips more than industry folk well if there is gossip i havent heard it youre telling me no ones said anything about ramsey wembley chewed his cheeks just whatever everyone else is saying which is he did her why do they say that scott he beat her up right maybe he wanted to get back together and she said no that your theory or someone elses everyones isnt it yours said wembley otherwise why would you be here does ramsey have any sort of reputation wembley snickered not as an actor no i dont know shit about him the whole thing doesnt interest me well said stu now it does scott it interests you a lot i had a pretty good time today getting that corn and being left alone ill go back to five make some plans i head back toward the open fence see someone waving the geeky grandparents standing right where the road curves off the old guy holds up his camera theyre both waving and the woman calls out young man could you help us for a second i dont want to attract attention by running away or acting weird so i go over to them hey big fella says the guy what a dork hes wearing a dodgers tshirt and shorts and socks and shoes and a light blue hat his skins pink and he has a big lumpy nose like the guys at the sunnyside his camera is huge in a big black case full of buckles and snaps and his wifes got one just like it sorry to bother you my friend but you seem like a nice guy he says giving me a smile full of yellow teeth thank you sir polite she says smiling not everyone weve met is polite im sure he can do it honey he clears his throat and taps his camera case this is a nikon camera from japan my wife and i were wondering if you could do us a favor and take a picture of us so we could have one together sure thanks a lot son he reaches into his shorts and takes out a dollar bill you dont have to pay me i say no dear we insist says the wife and even though her eyes are hidden behind sunglasses something changes on her face just for a second her mouth turns down like shes sad full of pity like she knows i need the money im thinking maybe if i look poor enough shell give me more and i hunch over a little but all she does is pat my hand take it please i pocket the dollar all righty he says so now weve got a business deal more teeth okay hon wheres the best spot right where we were the suns perfect she points and walks up the hill a bit stamps her foot and touches her own camera why they need two cameras is a good question but i guess some people dont trust machines or their memory they probably want to make sure they capture everything they see maybe to show the grandkids she says okay kind of sings it out shes short skinny wears a mans jacket over her dodgers tshirt and green pants he takes his camera out of his case and gives it to me and goes up next to her it looks expensive and im nervous holding it dont worry she says its simple and you look like a smart young man i look at them through the viewfinder theyre too far away so i come closer its preset son he says just push the button i push nothing happens i try again still nothing whats the matter he says i shrug i pushed it she says oh no did it jam again let me take a look he says coming down again i give him the camera and he turns it around uhoh same problem oh for petes sake she says stomping her foot i told you it was a good idea to bring mine along when we get back home first thing im doing is going straight back to that dealer and tell him to fix it right this time he gives me an embarrassed smile like he doesnt like her bossing him around she joins us smelling of some kind of soap he smells of onions sorry sweetie this will just take a minute she says opening her camera case and taking out something big and black but not a camera its a gun i cant believe it and all of a sudden shes jabbing it really hard into my belly button and i cant breathe and shes pushing it there like shes trying to force it right through me and her other hands around my neck squeezing hard she didnt look that strong but shes really strong and hes holding me too pinning my arms to my sides theyre on both sides of me like theyre my parents and the three of us are a family only i cant breathe and theyre hurting me and shes saying now just come with us street trash and dont make the wrong move or well kill you we really will smiling again not pity something else the same look that was all over morons face before he went for the tools they lead me toward the open fence they know about it too not a secret place im so stupid her face is like a mask but hes breathing hard excited his mouths open his skins pink as a pencil eraser the onion smells blowing on my face and theyre dragging me toward five and hes saying youre gonna get done kid like you never been done petra stayed at her desk calling her phone com pany contact about lisas records and being assured theyd arrive today she began the preliminary paperwork on the court order for the extended records phoned the coroner and the criminalists no medical findings yet no prints retrieved from lisas clothes or body or jewelry maybe a glove the tech opined fortified by vendingmachine coffee petra checked all the approved police tow yards and consulted rosters of found autos lisas porsche wasnt listed time to go back on schoelkopfs scut line shed already talked to dozens of detectives covering the day watch from van nuys to devonshire then west la now she started in on pacific each time the same reaction youve got to be kidding everyone knew who the bad guy was on this one but they also understood brassgenerated busywork and after the laughter died down she had their immediate sympathy the end result no similars meanwhile cart ramsey got to hit golf balls soak in the hot tub enjoy the chrome and polish of his little car museum while his exwife was laid out on the coroners table getting her face peeled off the mercedes was probably scrubbed and steamed and vacuumed cleaner than an operating room she thought about lisas body that gaping bloodfilled hole in the abdomen protruding entrails what had been done to the young womans face and wondered what it took to turn love to that could it happen anytime passions ran high or did the guy have to be twisted domestic bliss domestic blood thered been one moment an eyeblink instant when shed been capable of murder why was she thinking about the past deal with it kid she tortured herself with memories a twentyfiveyearold art student pretending cool but so blindly dumbly in love shed have been willing to shed her skin for nick that rush of feeling passion like shed never felt before lovemaking till she couldnt walk postcoital pillow talk lying flank to flank her vagina still humming nick had seemed such a good listener it was only later she figured out it was phony he kept quiet because he refused to give her anything of himself she told him everything growing up motherless the irrational guilt she felt about causing her mothers death driving her father crazy to the point where boarding schools were the only solution half of her adolescence spent in musty shared rooms the other girls giggling and smoking talking about guys sometimes masturbating petra could tell by the rustle of comforters petra the weird silent girl from arizona just lying there thinking about killing her mother shed entrusted nick with the secret because this was true love then one night she told him a new secret guess what honey patting her tummy shed expected surprise maybe some initial resentment knew hed melt eventually because he loved her his eyes froze and he turned white the fury glaring at her across the dinner table with contempt shed never imagined the special meal shed prepared just sitting there his favorites ostensibly to celebrate but maybe deep down shed known he wouldnt be pleased maybe the veal and the gnocchi the twentydollar chianti classico had been nothing more than bribes he just sat there not moving not talking those thin lips shed once thought aristocratic so bloodless the hateful mouth of an old nasty man nick how could you petra nick honey you of all people how could you be so stupid you know what childbirth does nick fuck you if shed had a gun then she opened her eyes realized for the first time that theyd been closed squad room noise blew back at her the other detectives busy doing their jobs what she needed to do she got back on the phone prepared to waste more time but four pacific detectives later something did come up a threeyearold unsolved cutting of a pretty blond girl on the southern tip of venice near the marina handled by a dii named phil sorensen who said you know when i heard about the ramsey girl it struck me but ours was a german girl lufthansa stewardess on vacation and our leads pointed to an austrian boyfriend baggage handler returned to europe before we could talk to him we put wants out with the austrian police interpol all that good stuff never found him what made him a suspect said petra the girlfriend the vic was traveling with another stew said he showed up unannounced at their hotel all upset because the vic ilse eggermanns her name had left vienna without telling him ilse told the friend theyd fought a lot the boyfriend had a bad temper roughed her up she dumped him the last straw was having to work in first class with a black eye still when the boyfriend showed up in la he was able to convince her to go out with him they left at nine pm she was found at four am body dumped in a parking lot near ballona creek we traced the boyfriends flight hed come in on lufthansa the previous morning employee discount no checkedin luggage and he never registered at any hotels or motels here in la so he intended it to be a short trip said petra accomplished what he wanted and split thats what it looked like sorensen sounded like an older man gentle voice slow talker slightly hesitant stew not flight attendant how was ilse dressed when you found her said petra a nice dress dark blue or black black i think very pretty girl she looked very nice considering sorensen coughed no sexual assault we didnt need to sherlock to establish her being with the boyfriend karlheinz lauch that night the waiter who served them dinner antoines on the pier at redondo beach he remembered them because they didnt eat or talk much or tip we figured lauch was angling for reconciliation it didnt work he got upset drove her somewhere killed her and dumped her what he drove i dont know because we could never trace a rental car and he had no known associates in california sorensens voice had risen a bit lots of details at his fingertips for a threeyearold crime this one had stayed with him she was found at four said petra any idea when she was killed the guesstimate was two twothirty early morning just like lisa dumped in a parking lot and the ballona creek marshlands were a county park like griffith lots of stab wounds twentynine clear overkill which would also fit the boyfriend add the domesticviolence history and it seemed pretty clear sound at all like yours there are definite points of similarity detective sorensen said petra keeping her voice steady looked at a certain way it was a damn xerox well you know these guys he said the womanhaters tend to fall into patterns true she said where did this lauch handle baggage vienna airport but he had family in germany after the crime he didnt return to work or to his hometown we checked with other airlines too but no dice he could have changed his name or just rabbited to some other country would have been nice to go over there and nose around personally but you know the chance of prying a european trip out of the budget so we had to rely on the austrian police and the germans and they werent all that interested because the crime took place here if lauch is working baggage under another name hes eligible for an employee discount said petra maybe hes still flying back and forth and ended up in la again and did a repeat i sure hope not phil but with what youve told me it looks like were going to have to check him out all over again could you please fax me his data give me an hour said sorensen wouldnt that be something the guy having that kind of nerve of course first youd have to establish lauch was here when the ramsey girl was killed then youd have to connect him with her meanwhile youve got dv on the husband sounds like fun big fun thanks for your help phil hey he said if by some miracle it ends up helping you itll help me too it always bothered me not being able to close that one she was a nicelooking girl and he turned her into something horrible it was pm time to start looking for darrelldarren the film editor but now she wanted to wait around until karlheinz lauchs data came through the fax the ilse eggermann news was a surprise but sorensen was right the points of similarity could be explained by domesticviolence patterns the same old tragedies all the way back to othello or statistical fluke seek and ye shall find something over a threeyearperiod la saw well over three thousand homicides one similar in all that time wasnt the stuff of the guinness book meanwhile shed reach the rest of the pacific detectives do followup on some valley ds shed missed the first time around maybe pay another telephonic condolence call to lisas family in chagrin falls see if mrs boehlinger was available find out when the parents were coming out to see what was left of their daughter did mrs b feel as strongly about ramsey as her husband petra sorted out her own feelings about the guy providing an alibi right off letting them know about lisas drug problems going over their heads to schoelkopf the subtle don juan stuff hed thrown her way it smelled of ego real narcissism did that make him someone whod go berserk if a woman angered or rejected him hard to say but in her mind ramsey had done nothing to dispel suspicion despite ilse eggermann the actor was clearly the main man she played out a scenario in her head lisa like ilse eggermann like so many battered women had somehow allowed her ex to talk her into a date renewal of old passions or maybe ramseyd tossed her the ultimate female bait the chance to talk things out because once upon a time thered been chemistry between them and chemicals didnt disappear they just faded because memories could be selective and women kept hoping men would change a date where not at a restaurant somewhere private romantic secluded not the calabasas house too risky even if greg balch was lying for his boss someone else could have taken note the guard a neighbor the maid petra remembered how squirrelly estrella flores had been definitely worth a recontact but how to do it without alerting ramsey and something basic needed to be added to the list talk to the nightshift guard at ranchhaven a glaring omission the handsoff policy was really mucking things up so many things to do she returned to her lastdate melodrama where would ramsey have taken lisa did he have another home a weekend hideaway didnt actors always have weekend places the beach the mountains arrowhead big bear or up north santa barbara santa ynez lots of industry folks had gotten into the ranch thing the beach would probably be malibu waves crashing smooth sand what could be more romantic she made a note to search records for every real estate parcel ramsey owned go with the beach for the moment she pictured it ramsey and lisa on an overstuffed sofa in some woodandglass thing on the sand the three cs champagne caviar coke maybe a nicely hissing fireplace ramsey turning on the charm lisa responding that sexy little black dress riding up on her thighs chemistry helped along by fish eggs moët chandon and medellíns finest or another kind of incentive money lisa had a job but ramsey still provided the bulk of her income the purchase of love same old story petra felt sad then reminded herself not to judge if her own phone rang on a particularly lonely andor horny night and it was nick on the other end saying hey pet what would she do hang up on the selfish fuck and wish she could make his ears bleed back to malibu tides crashing tender reminiscence the nudge toward intimacy ramsey makes his move but lisa changes her mind resists shuts him down ramsey seethes feels like slugging her but remembering the way she went public he keeps his rage to himself stays cool drives her home malibu to doheny drive hills would mean pacific coast highway to sunset or the freeway through the valley then down one of the canyons but instead of hooking south he continues east maybe laurel canyon down hollywood boulevard up western to los feliz then over to griffith park that hour not much traffic he drives to the parking lot lisa knows somethings wrong tries to escape he holds out for one last embrace then a steel kiss no sexual assault because hed had a blood orgasm it felt right to petra it also depended on gregory balch lying straightfacedly about ramseys alibi shed have to learn more about balch too eventually along with ilse eggermann and karlheinz lauch a similar unbelievable she imagined schoelkopfs grin the disgusted look on stus face when shed left he hadnt looked up just muttered a halfhearted goodbye the librarybook thing so out of the blue stu was compulsive megaorganized maybe it wasnt his marriage maybe it was career anxiety the chance to apply for lieutenant suddenly coming up and he found himself stuck with a bigtime loser whodunit for petra just another case for him do or die would he bail on her sacrifice her if he needed to for eight months theyd ridden together eaten together worked side by side stu spending as much time with her as he did with kathy sometimes more and hed never laid a hand on her never made a suggestive comment not even the slightest hint of double entendre shed thought she knew him but eight months wasnt very long was it she and nick had been together over two years about the same as lisa and ramsey men and women once when she was fifteen home for summer vacation shed woken up at am on a long night in arizona hearing imaginary things finally realizing it was the hot desert wind scraping the side of the house itchy jumpy shed walked out to the hallway spied the familiar splinter of light under the door of her fathers office knocked entered the tiny dim detritusclogged room dad was sitting low in his oak chair facing his royal manual blank sheet in the roller he saw her gave a slack smile and when she came closer she smelled the scotch on his breath saw the dullness in his eyes and took advantage of it as only a teenager can getting him to talk about what he hated talking about the woman whod died birthing her aware that it would cause him pain but damnit she had a right to know and talk he did in a low slurred voice anecdotes remembrances how gawky kenneth connor and gorgeous maureen mcilwaine had met on the long island ferry and found true love the same old stories but she thirsted for them could never get enough that night she sat at his feet on the warped hardwood floor motionless silent afraid any distraction would cause him to stop finally he did grow quiet staring down at her then slapping his hands over his face and holding them there daddy the hands dropped into his lap he looked so sad thats all i remember sweetheart mother was a wonderful woman but then he began crying and had to hide from her again men hid when they cried petra came over and hugged his broad bony shoulders oh daddy im so she was wonderful baby one in a million but it wasnt perfect pet it was no storybook situation he opened a desk drawer and peered down at what had to be the bottle when he turned back to petra his eyes were dry and he was smiling but it wasnt any of the smiles petra knew not the warm protective one or the wry sarcastic one or even the softaroundtheedges drunk one that used to bother her but no longer did this was different flat hollow frozen as statuary in her tenth grade english class they had learned about tragedy and she was sure this was it defeated that smile as terrifying as a glimpse of eternity daddy he scratched his scalp shook his head hiked a droopy sock up a pale ankle the thing is pet no matter what i guess what im saying sweetheart is men and women are really two separate species maybe thats the anthropology talking but its no less true one little scrap of dna separates us heres something funny the x chromosomes really the one that counts petra the y doesnt seem to do much but cause problems aggression understand what im getting at sweetheart we men arent really worth that much oh daddy mom and i had our problems most were my fault you need to know that so you dont romanticize things expect too much out of demand too much from yourself understand baby am i making sense here taking hold of her shoulders the light in his eyes almost maniacal you are daddy yes he let go now the smile was okay human the point is petra there are big questions out there cosmic questions that have nothing to do with stars and galaxies waited for her response she didnt know what to say and he went on questions like can men and women ever really know each other or is it always going to be one stupid clumsy dance around the interpersonal ballroom he flinched suppressed a belch sprang up went into his bedroom and closed the door and she could hear the latch turn and knew hed locked himself in the next morning her brother glenn the only one still living at home got to the breakfast table first and said whats with dad what do you mean hes gone went out on a field trip must have been before sunrise left me this waving a piece of notebook paper that said out to the desert kids just one of his bone hunts said petra glenn said well he took his camping stuff that means a long one did he mention anything to you cause yesterday we were talking about going over to the big five and getting some hockey stuff actually he did she lied great said glenn thats just great he tells you but never mentions it to me im sure he meant to glenn yeah right great fuck i really need a new stick do you have any money i can borrow she phoned seven more detectives endured seven more youvegottobekiddings no more similars from the far end of the room the fax machine started humming and she jumped up and was there in a second snatching papers out of the bin moving so quickly a couple of the other ds looked up but not for long they were busy too this room this city the blood never stopped karlheinz lauch was big sixfootfour and ugly small dark squinty eyes popped like raisins in a pasty misshapen crêpe of a face the merest comma of a lopsided mouth a mustache that looked like a grease squirt straight fair hair the stats called it brown so probably dishwater styled in that modified shag some europeans still wore to petra he appeared a grubby loser the photo was from a fouryearold vienna mug shot lots of fiftyletter german words and umlauts sorensens typed note said lauch had been busted for assault in austria the year before ilse eggermanns murder barroom brawl no time served in the photos lauch looked mean enough for anything wouldnt it be something if the bastard had come to la cruising for goodlooking blondes somehow connected with lisa wouldnt it be amazing if lauch stuck around so they could pick him up a nice easy solve so stu could get his promotion and she could add brownie points to her file fantasies kid she studied lauchs face some more and wondered how someone like him could get lisa to put on a little black dress and diamonds on the other hand he had gotten close to ilse eggermann who by phil sorensens account was also a looker but a stewardess wasnt the exwife of a tv star whod experienced the good life then again lisa had opted out of the good life and some women even beautiful women liked to bottomfish turned on by whatever was crude and brutish a man below them on the social ladder beauty and the beastly lisa taking risks with rough trade and paying for it petra kept staring at lauchs photo the thought of allowing his flesh to come into contact with hers turned her stomach she liked her men intelligent considerate conventionally handsome probably because her father was an intelligent nicelooking gentle man for the most part a gentleman what was ilse eggermanns father like what was dr john everett boehlinger like when he wasnt crazed with grief enough with the psychoanalysis shed taken it as far as she could for the moment she inserted the eggermannlauch data in lisas murder book crossed the room to the nehiorange lockers opened hers and took a snickers bar from the bag she kept on the top shelf above her gym shoes and sweats and the cheap black sweaters she kept handy for cold nights and messy corpses death mops she called them acrylic that looked like acrylic attention kmart shoppers our fullstyle cardigans now on sale for in a wide range of colors she bought five at a time always black threw them out the moment they got gory in eight months shed been through ten she hadnt worn one to lisas crime scene because the call had been an offschedule surprise she hadnt been stained by lisas corpse hadnt gotten close enough move move move keep moving you little bastard hisswhispering in my ear they squeeze me poke me push me shes the angry one he sounds afraid nervous he even trips a couple of times come on she sticks the gun in my ribs and when i cry out she sticks me harder and says shut up not nervous at all shes in charge as we get closer to where all the buggies are parked i start to pray for some zoo person to be there this time but theres no one should i scream no the gun is up against me it wouldnt take much for her to pull the trigger and blow up my insides now were at the fence the lock is on and its clamped do it she orders as she looks in all directions she keeps the gun on me and he takes a key out of his pocket and opens the lock they know this place theyre prepared they will rape me he comes back grabs me breathes into my ear and suddenly my stomach starts turning over and over hard fast painful like i have to go to the bathroom they push me forward again its like im drifting along in some movie playing a part and now i realize the fear is gone and something else has taken over my mind its like being asleep and awake at the same time like being in a dream but knowing youre in one and you can control everything if you just concentrate make it come out the way you want maybe thats what its like after you die we go through the gate and start climbing up into the trees hes making these low wet grunting noises you he says squeezing my arm harder like ive done something wrong i keep my head down seeing my shoes his okay come on come on she says waving her hand as we walk into the fern tangle through the same path i took down what i used to think was my secret they keep pushing me telling me to move faster lead me toward a big tree not my eucalyptus another one also with low branches we go past it walk a ways till were in front of another tree and its so quiet no ones around even if i scream no one will hear me she stands to one side still aiming the gun looks at her camera case holding on to my arm he takes out her camera and gives it to her okay she tells me i dont know what she wants so i dont speak or move she walks up and slaps me hard across the face and my head spins around but it still doesnt hurt as much as it should do it you little shit what i say but it sounds like another kids voice like im out of my body watching myself move around in some robot movie she raises her hand to hit me again and i try to protect my face with my arm he knees me in the back and that hurts off with the pants streetsmarts let him pull em down honey he lets go of me as she keeps the gun on me i touch my pants but dont pull them down he pulls his down lets them fall around his legs hes wearing baggy white boxers and now he reaches into the fly hole i turn away what she laughs something you havent seen before yank em down show us your good side i dont move she slaps me again if she didnt have the gun id stomp her face twist her head off she laughs again obey and itll all be over before you can say ouch a little owie thats all she makes kissy noises and he does too sure that other kids voice says sure i know what you mean only only what she moves closer puts the gun up against my nose it feels cold and it smells like a gas station the corner of my eye sees that his boxers are all the way down but still around his ankles like he doesnt want to really take everything off hes moving his arm back and forth only the kid says i it like i i can do it sure okay but you it like now first ive got to got to what the gun waves in front of my eyes you know i dont know what got to shit silence hear that she says to him yeah he says very quietly and im thinking oh no does he like that even better did i just make a big mistake she turns and looks at him and for a second i think of running for it but then her face is back right in front of mine and i dont know why i think this but the way she looks she could be a teacher someones mother or grandma its not my fault so she asks him um not today okay trash she tells me go ahead and do your thing use your shirt to wipe your ass then youre gonna show us your good side i pull down my pants and even though its a warm day a beautiful day a lemonade and corn day my legs feel like stone so white he says cmon go go her voice is thick and i understand his sickness is doing it to kids hers is being in charge watching undies off goddamn you off off come on finish up i pull down my shorts bending down i manage to move a little farther away from her but only inches all around its so quiet so green even the leaves dont move its like the three of us are part of one big photograph or maybe this is the last moment before god destroys the world and why shouldnt he get going or ill kill you the gun and the camera are aimed at me shes going to take pictures of everything im her souvenir the problem is before i had to really badly but now i cant its like my organs are blocks of ice jammed up against each other do it or ill shoot it out of you the sound of her voice the thought of being shot gets my stomach going again and i do it then i reach behind with one hand to catch it gross i hate doing it but i tell myself its just digested food stuff that was already inside me look at that she says you disgusting little animal disgusting he says but he means something else i look up at her and nod and smile shes surprised wasnt expecting a smile and for a second she looks away i reach back and even though i was never good at sports i aim and throw bam right in her face and all over her camera over her blouse shes screaming and stumbling back and slapping at herself and hes tripping over his shorts confused he straightens up and charges me but shes the one to watch because shes got the gun shes still screaming and slapping i yank up my shorts and pants and even before theyre completely in place im runrunrunning through branches that scratch my face through space through green green that never stops time that never stops running tripping flying floating i hear a loud hand clap dont stop nothing hurts im okay or maybe im not i dont feel it cant feel anymore that wouldnt be bad that wouldnt be bad at all i throw myself through green thank you gorilla if i could breathe id laugh just as petra was about to call empty nest pro ductions for darrelldarren another fax came through lisas last phone bill patsy k was right the woman really had hated the instrument fifteen calls the whole month one longdistance on the first to chagrin falls three minutes long brief chat with mom just once a month not a close relationship three toll calls all to alhambra the number matched one in petras notes one of patsy ks friends the rest were all locals three to jacopos in beverly hills for takeout pizza two to the shanghai garden same city for chinese one each to neimanmarcus and saks the last four calls were to a culver city exchange that turned out to be empty nest petra phoned it and asked for darrell in editing the receptionist said darrell breshear yes one moment ill connect you breshear had no receptionist just a machine his voice was pleasant patsy k had said he was forty but he sounded like a young man rather than leave a message petra decided to call back later and ran breshear through a superficial ncic check clean laughing to herself because they hadnt run ramsey she phoned the county assessor and after hassling with a snotty clerk managed to learn that h carter ramsey owned more than a dozen pieces of property in la all in the valley the house in calabasas commercial buildings on ventura boulevard and on busy encino sherman oaks north hollywood and studio city cross streets one in studio city matched the address she had for greg balchs office at players management nothing in malibu or santa monica nothing that sounded like a romantic hideaway but maybe when ramsey got away he really wanted distance go north young woman and if that didnt work the eastern mountain resorts at the ventura assessors she got a more cooperative clerk but nothing next came santa barbara even more hassles than la but bingo h carter ramsey what did the h stand for anyway was the deed holder on a house in montecito copying down the address she ran his name through dmv full name here herbert herb herbie c ramsey that just wouldnt do for the adjustor tracing vehicle ownerships she came across all the vintage cars shed seen in the little museum plus a mercedes personalized license plate plyr plus a twoyearold jeep wrangler plyr that one was registered to the montecito address players management plyr the fact that ramsey used vanity plates was interesting most celebrities craved anonymity maybe he sensed his fame was fading felt he needed to advertise plyr fancying himself quite the stud something else hed mentioned the mercedes but not the jeep because the jeep was stashed in montecito or was the omission deliberate was the fourwheeldrive the murder vehicle the mercedes a red herring could the guy be that devious devious but stupid because that kind of ruse wouldnt work long hed have to know theyd run a dmv early on but if petras lastdate scenario was correct the crime had been impulsive up to a point the instant where ramsey packed a knife as he got into the car so maybe hed acted out overwhelming rage was now scrambling to do what he could montecito the neighborhood was ultratony multiacre estates like calabasas older classier no cozy little piedàterre for ramsey he craved space lord of two manors greedy guy in more ways than one if i cant have her no one can it brought to mind a thomas hart benton in an art book shed pored over as a child the ballad of the jealous lover of lone green valley a rawboned stetsoned hick with psychopath eyes stabbing a woman in the breast country musicians playing a sad score in the foreground verdant earth dipping and swooping evoking the victims vertigo it had scared the hell out of her for all she knew had colored her view of men and romance maybe even her career choice the jealous lover of calabasasmontecito for all the hollywood angles this one would probably play out as the same old story and she realized that if she stayed in homicide shed be spending her life inhaling the worst of clichés the lunch plan had been to meet stu at musso and frank but at he phoned in and said sorry im getting hung up do you mind relieved she said no problem anything earthshattering all im getting so far is no one respects ramsey as an actor how about you she told him about the montecito place and the jeep then said guess what a similar and gave him the details of the ilse eggermann murder wonderful he said phil sorensens good if he didnt solve it it was probably unsolvable maybe we should let robberyhomicide take it now she knew something was wrong stu had little use for the downtown hotshot elite considered them arrogant not nearly as good as they thought they were losing a big case was always a sore point for all but the laziest divisional detectives and stu had never occupied the same continent as lazy now he was willing to let rh roll over him and her if it was a career thing pending promotion that didnt make sense unless he was certain this one was bound to end badly figured early damage control was better than being the globalvillage idiot youre kidding she said sharply yeah i guess i am he said wearily i just didnt want to hear about a valid similar but no big deal well ride with it she heard him inhale okay beep me if you need something no news yet of lisas car nope id like to check out ramseys montecito place silence before we get that assertive we should clear it with schoelkopf i dont see why we need to said petra what i got from the meeting this morning was once we do the scut were free to be reallife detectives he admitted if we dont talk to ramsey soon well look like boobs i think we need to arrange another facetoface soon no lackey to run interference if ramsey refuses to speak to us without a lawyer that tells us something if he doesnt we come on friendly but try to pry him i think you misunderstood schoelkopf petra for him its not about getting things done its about selfprotection and we need to think that way too stu hear me out who got burned on oj ds not the brass the moment we ask to get a close look at ramseys houses and his cars even just an informal request no warrants ramsey becomes the prime suspect and its a whole other game if someone finds out you dmvd him itll be a whole other game i dont believe this believe fine she said you know better i dont petra he said in the most mournful tone shed ever heard him use i just know we have to be careful she left the station fuming was three blocks away when she realized she was driving to see darrell breshear without setting up the appointment using a pay phone she called again this time she talked to the taped message giving her name and title and asking breshear to call her at the soonest opportuni this is darrell mr breshear thank you im working lisa boehlingerramseys murder and would like to talk to you about her because we were friends odd response exactly sure he said sounding anything but certain what would you like to know if you dont mind id prefer a facetoface meeting mr breshear oh any particular reason because i want to study your facial expressions evaluate your eye contact see whether youre sweating or twitching or looking at your feet too frequently because thats a clear sign of lying procedure she said he didnt answer mr breshear well he said i guess so could we not do it here at the lot may i ask why its id prefer to keep a low profile at work and the police stomping in is bound to attract attention i promise you i dont stomp sir he didnt think that was funny you know what i mean i understand sir she said the guy was antsy why where would you suggest um how about a coffee shop or something like that there are plenty of places around here pick one how about the pancake palace on venice near overland lets say tomorrow at ten am the pancake palace is fine mr breshear but i was thinking sooner like in half an hour oh well the problem is im elbowdeep in a big project final cut on a picture theres a screening i understand sir but lisa was murdered yes yes of course okay the pancake palace half an hour may i ask who told you id be worth talking to about lisa various people said petra see you there sir and thanks for your help she got back in the car and drove as fast as safety would allow down western to olympic hoping the guy would show and not complicate her life further blue walls brown booths the toosweet fumes of fake maple syrup darrell breshear wasnt hard to spot at this hour the pancake palace was almost empty and he was the only black man in the place sitting in a corner booth looking miserable young voice but indeed older patsy k had said forty but petra pegged him at fortyfive to fifty hed already started on a cup of coffee for all his attempts to delay hed showed up early definitely antsy he was thin and sat tall had closecropped graying hair skin nearly as pale as petras african features he wore a black polo shirt under a gray herringbone jacket bags under his eyes made him look weary when she got closer she saw the eyes were amber a few freckles dotted the bridge of his nose he saw her and stood sixone mr breshear detective they shook hands his was dry coffee he said indicating his halffull cup more like halfempty judging from his expression sure breshear waved for service and ordered for petra saying please and thank you and getting the waitress to smile sorry to play hardtoget he said lisas murder shocked me and then to be part of an investigation he shook his head so far youre a very small part of the investigation mr breshear she took her pad out began writing then sketching his face good his eyes wandered to the left so rather than answer petra drank coffee breshears eyes started bouncing around please tell me about your relationship with lisa ramsey sir we worked together youre a film editor too im a senior editor lisa worked on my team senior editor said petra so youve been doing it for a while twelve years i did some acting before that really nothing big not film musical theater back east guys and dolls breshear smiled did that one and others it taught me one thing whats that i wasnt as talented as i thought petra smiled back did you hire lisa empty nest hired her and assigned her to me she was good considering how new she was she learned fast intelligent what happened to her is unbelievable breshears shoulders dropped and now he maintained eye contact petra said did she have prior experience as a film editor she was a theater arts major in college took some editing courses how long did she work with you sir about half a year up with the eyes he sipped kept his cup in front of his mouth blocking it from view are editing jobs easy to come by not at all but lisa got one because of her college training i not exactly said breshear the cup continued to shield his mouth petra shifted forward and he lowered it she i was told she got the job through connections told by who my boss steve zamoutis hes the producer connections with who ramsey he made a call and she got hired six months ago said petra right after the divorce breshear nodded doing favors for the ex did it confirm ramseys claim of a friendly parting or had he carried the torch for lisa tried to get back with her let me get something straight sir was lisa qualified for the job yes breshear answered quickly considering her inexperience she was very competent petra wrote and sketched breshear said thats not to say there werent things she needed to learn it took a second for petra to untangle the double negative was breshear a complex thinker or was he looking for something other than a coffee cup to hide behind and you taught her tried my best so you and she worked together on the same movies two pictures he said naming them petra had never heard of either breshear added they havent been put into release yet what kind of pictures are they comedies no murder mysteries huh breshear gave a snorting laugh that he seemed to regret because he inhaled deeply tried to compose himself not hardly he looked at his watch what else can you tell me about lisa she said thats about it she had no problems on the job when i found out she was murdered it made me sick any ideas about who might have killed her everyones saying it was ramsey because he beat her up but i dont know did lisa talk to you about that never petra put the finishing touches on his portrait shed drawn him nervous with haunted eyes not even once not even once detective his name never came up period did you ever see lisa use drugs breshears mouth opened and shut out came another snort laugh i really dont is it absolutely necessary to get into that yes it is sir petra moved closer again sliding her hand across the table so it was only inches from his he pulled back let me say this lisa wasnt a heavy doper but in the industry people tend to yes i saw her snort a couple of times a couple meaning two maybe more three or four but thats it and this was at work no no he was light enough to blush good down went the eyes he said not at work strictly speaking i mean we werent actually working im her supervisor anything that happens on my shift is my responsibility i understand mr breshear youd never have allowed cocaine to interfere with her work but you saw her snorting three or four times on the lot after work where exactly in the editing room but it was after hours may i ask why you want to know this do you think what happened was related to dope because its not some kind of crazy scene around here were all business have to be without us the picture doesnt get made long speech the heightened color remained lessening the contrast between freckles and background skin where else besides the editing room did you see her snort at in my car that took me by surprise i was driving and she just pulled out this little glass tube waited till i stopped for a red light and sucked it up through her nose in your car petra wrote watching as breshears eyes did a little ocular roller coaster where were you going i dont remember breshear snatched up his cup and emptied it the waitress came by and poured some more and he started drinking petra declined the refill and when she and breshear were alone again she sketched some more inserting shadows and contours making him look older so you dont recall where you were going how long ago was this down went the cup id say one maybe two months ago were you two dating mr breshear no no we were working together late thats the way it is in editing they call you you cut you cut the word choice sailed right by him so you and lisa were working late and he didnt fill in the blank and petra said howd you end up in your car i was probably taking her home or maybe out for a bite may i ask why youre questioning me were questioning all the men lisa knew mr breshear someone told us youd dated lisa and were following up thats wrong we never dated so i guess our source is mistaken she smiled guessing that the existence of a source would rattle him he colored again and his eyes bounced around this guy was no smooth psychopath but he was hiding something guess so he said can you tell me where you were on the night lisa was murdered he stared at her touched his forehead wiping it though it was dry now his eyes were big and frightened exactly the expression petra had drawn on her pad look dad im a prophetess too i was with another woman saying it just above a whisper could i have a name please breshear smiled a sick guilty dirteating totally unattractive smile thats kind of a problem whys that sir because im married and the woman wasnt my wife if she can be discreet so can i mr breshear petra waved her pen id rather not he said look im going to be straight up with you detective connor because i dont want you finding out somewhere else and thinking i was hiding anything lisa and i had a shortterm thing but it was no big deal a thing we slept together seven times hed counted a scorekeeper seven times she said a oneweek thing she wanted to say now tell me darrell was it once a day for seven days or did you double up a few days and take a break a oneweek thing thats it the amber eyes bounced actually we really didnt even sleep together strictly speaking god this is embarrassing what is talking about the details i guess if you were a man it would be easier she grinned sorry about that he was staring into his coffee cup again and looked ready to slide under the table so said petra how long into lisas employment did this thing occur a month ago six weeks that matched patsy ks recollection so you were intimate said petra softening her voice trying to keep him on the edge but still willing to talk but you never slept together right said breshear i never stayed over at her place and obviously i couldnt take her to mine whered you go the blush was deeper than ever a nice rusty mahogany it gave him some depth actually made him more appealing jesus is this really necessary if it relates to your relationship with lisa and to your whereabouts the night she was murdered im afraid it is sir and you have to write this all down if what you tell me shows you had nothing to do with lisas death thered be no reason for anyone to find out a crock everything went into the file but she closed the pad anyway he rubbed his temples and studied his coffee some more man okay the night lisa was murdered i was with a woman named kelly sposito her place address please said petra opening the pad he recited a number on fourth street in venice apartment number that question seemed to bother him even more as if specificity drove home her seriousness no its a house and you were at ms spositos house from when to when all night ten pm to six am before that from around five to six we had dinner at a restaurant a mexican place near the studio the hacienda right down the block on washington boulevard ms sposito works with you nod shes an editor too ah the rub lots of rubbing on the job so you never went home and your wife didnt suspect anything my wife was out of town shes a salesperson travels a lot mr takechargepolitely darrell was emerging as the editing room stud meaning there were probably plenty of other things he didnt want unearthed do you have to call kelly he said yes sir do you know where she is at work is that it almost said petra can you tell me who lisas coke source was no he said absolutely not no one at the studio i have no idea no one at empty nest thats for sure because because i know everyone and they dont deal drugs okay said petra but i imagine it probably wouldnt be any big deal finding someone at the studio to supply would it oh come on he said angry now you think cause its the industry were just running around partying all day its a business detective we work hard as hell ive never seen anyone on the lot try to sell anyone else dope and lisa never talked about her source in fact the first time she snorted she offered me some and i told her i dont want you doing that in my car but she continued to snort anyway said petra in your car well yes she was an adult i couldnt control her but i didnt want any part of it for me he held the cup with both hands you want a confession ill give you one ive had my share of problems with alcohol been sober for ten years and intend to stay that way the amber eyes were flashing righteous indignation that looked real or he should have been on film rather than splicing it or on stage singing his heart out all right said petra thanks for your time sure said breshear call kelly fine just not my wife okay because she was out of town couldnt help you lisa and i were friends thats all why would i hurt her just friends except for that one week that was nothing he said a passing thing she was lonely kind of down and it just so happened things werent going so well between me and my wife we worked late one thing led to another he gave a youknowhowitis shrug one thing had led to seven others seven things had led to another petra said but you never stayed together overnight unlike the situation with kelly sposito thats because lisa didnt want to it was a point of pride with her she was independent doing her own thing where did the two of you go nowhere just we oh jesus all right heres the complete picture it all happened in my car we went out for a bite and on the way back to the lot lisa asked me to take a little drive toward the beach we took pch ended up near the old sand dune club she asked me to park i had no idea what was going on then she pulled out that tube and snorted so it was powdered cocaine not crack breshear smiled only black people use crack right petra ignored that he said it was powder she snorted then what then she got kind of active physical then you had sex in your car said petra thats the way it ended up he said new tone of voice amused seven times said petra youd go out and shed snort and youd have sex in the car actually five of the times were that way twice the last two i followed her home and waited till she got ready then we went out for dinner but we never dated as in a real relationship both times she had to go home for something dope i dont know said breshear but he did they both did so far his story meshed perfectly with patsy ks breshear sucked in breath i dont know why im telling you this but you might as well know everything we never really had intercourse she just wanted to give to me looking right at her now sitting straighter challenging her to press for details because sex was his thing and once he got over the initial shame talking about it boosted his confidence petra said oral sex yes said breshear closing his eyes for a second first shed get high then shed do it seven nights once a night the same routine the eighth time she said i like you darrell but i didnt argue because to tell the truth i thought the whole thing was weird she wasnt nasty about it very nice just like time to move on i got the feeling shed done it before whys that just a feeling she seemed practiced petra didnt speak and breshears eyes saucered again what is it sir its hard to think of her cut up like that the news said it was brutal petra gave him more silence and he said she was a beautiful person i hope to god you catch whoever did it hope so too anything else you want to tell me mr breshear nope cant think of anything please dont call my wife okay everythings going real well between us now i dont want to mess it up after breshear left she called empty nest and asked for kelly sposito the current flame things going well with the wife meant only one on the side sposito was in had a high unpleasant voice that got shrill when petra identified herself and explained the nature of the call darrell are you for real but a moment later she verified breshears alibi so he was with you all night thats what i said listen youd better not put this in the paper or anything i dont need the grief im a detective not a reporter ms sposito i see my name in the paper i sue paper tigress what was with her why are you hassling darrell because hes black were talking to people who knew lisa ms sposito everyone knows who did it who right said the woman like you dont and hell get off because hes rich petra thanked her for her help hung up and drove the five blocks to the studio used her badge and a combination of firmness and charm to get in she got directions to empty nest from a guy with long hair who looked like an actor but wore a tool belt the production company occupied several white clapboard greenshuttered bungalows scattered between whitewashed soundstages and office buildings the entire place spotless with that tooperfect potemkin village look billboards for tv shows and movies stood on metal towers a field of satellite dishes resembled a giant crockery collection a woman in bungalow a told her breshear worked in d petra walked into a small empty reception area brass and glass and black wood floors three phones no typewriter or computer more movie posters cheapie flicks she didnt recognize the smell of fish through a door she heard voices and she opened it after the merest knock breshear and two women in their twenties were sitting at a long table mounted with several gray machines products of a mating between a film projector and a microscope in an open styrofoam takeout box were three sushi rolls one woman wore an oversized black sweater over skintight black leggings had a sharp pretty face bronze skin probably from a bottle and a mane of big black curls that trailed down her back the other was arctic pale and had thin blond hair held in place by a pink sawtooth clip pleasantlooking but not the buxom looker curly was breshear sitting between them started to shift his body backward distancing himself detective connor he said steaming mug in his hand gary larson cartoon silkscreened on the side the guy claimed he didnt dope but like many exalcoholics he had a caffeine jones hi said petra ms sposito curly said what and stood tall fivenine terrific curvy body evident even under the baggy sweater her dark eyes were ten years older than the rest of her she wore so much mascara her lashes resembled miniature wiper blades too hardlooking to be a model or an actress but definitely someone whod turn heads a lioness with that mane just thought id drop by and talk to you in person breshears head swiveled fast as he looked at his girlfriend trying to figure out what shed said over the phone that had complicated things sposito glared as she walked toward petra with big fluid steps the blond girl watched the whole thing baffled when she was two steps away sposito said lets talk outside to the blonde were gonna use your office cara oh sure said the blond girl should i just stay here yeah it wont take long out in the front room sposito put her hands on her hips now what your fault jungle girl all that outofproportion anger you had some pretty strong opinions about mr ramsey said petra oh for gods sake opinions is all they were everyones saying the same thing because mr ramsey was abusive its nuts to even consider that darrell had anything to do with lisa just because the two of them dated a couple times but okay you asked where he was i told you and thats all there is i take enough crap for being with darrell i dont need this crap from who everyone society racism kelly laughed just a few weeks ago we were at the rose bowl swap meet and some idiot made a rude comment youd think itd be different la the nineties i mean whos the richest woman in america oprah she frowned and lines formed around her mouth what darrell and i have is good and i dont want anything messing it up if you only knew honey i understand said petra any other opinions youd like to share about lisas murder lisa in general nope now can you please let me get back to work we do work around here why were movie people so defensive about doing honest labor how long have you been working here kelly kelly not ms sposito because this one would always try to dominate the wiper blades opened and shut a year so you worked with lisa not with her like on the same project she needed training so darrell worked with her ive always been on my own lisa was inexperienced kelly snickered she was a rookie darrell was always picking up her slack the whole six months she worked here no she learned she was okay but to tell the truth no forget it i dont want to put her down petra smiled and kelly bared her teeth petra supposed it was a return smile okay i opened my big mouth i was just going to say editing jobs are hard to come by you pay dues lisa was totally green i figured she had to have connections what kind of connections dont know something else darrell hadnt shared with the lioness suddenly petra felt sorry for her whatd you think of her as a person kelly she did her job i did mine we didnt socialize petra said did you like her kelly blinked honestly she wasnt my favorite person because i dont think she treated people well but i really dont want to speak badly about her now didnt treat who well the dark eyes narrowed im talking in general she had a sharp mouth thats probably what did her in what do you mean she was sarcastic had a way of saying something without saying it know what i mean looks tone of voice the whole body language thing she rubbed her hips bent one leg ballerinastyle flexing then straightening lisa thought a lot of herself okay and if someone didnt measure up shed be sure to let them know one way or the other you want my opinion maybe ramsey was trying to get her back and she shut him down arent those abusers always obsessed out of the mouths of hostile babes they can be said petra looking as fascinated as she felt so ramsey could have still been into lisa in a big way said kelly and lets say they got together and he tried to make it with her but couldnt get it up or whatever and she let him know what she thought about that in that lisa way of hers and he freaked petra hid her amazement the woman had gone from hostile resistance to criminological theory in five minutes offering a theory that buttressed petras finaldate scenario what makes you think ramsey was impotent because lisa said so at least she hinted at it it was about three four months ago we were eating lunch all of us darrell cara me lisa and another editor who works here laurette benson shes gay and the topic came up about actors how they get all the glory and how so many of them have totally warped personalities are totally screwed up but the public never knows it because everything they hear is bullshit created by the media and publicists anyway we started talking about how actors become sex icons bigger than human like madonna having that baby and everyones treating it like she was the other madonna and this was some kind of sacred birth right like all those idiots still looking for elvis or thinking michael jacksons gonna stay married we editors look at these people day after day scene after scene through the window of a moviola you see enough rough cuts see how many takes you need to get them to look good and sound smart you realize how few of them are even talented in the first place anyway we were talking about that and we got into all the sexual fantasies that the public develops about people who probably half the time cant even cut it in bed then laurette started in about how many actors were gay even the ones who the public thinks are hetero sex gods how sexuality and reality are like two completely different planets and lisa rolled her eyes and said you have no idea guys you have no fucking clue so we all stare at her and she cracks up and says take it from me you go in thinking youre eating at the hard rock cafe and it turns out to be the leaning tower of overcooked pasta then she laughs even harder then her face takes on this whole different expression really bummed angry and she just stomps out and goes to the bathroom and stays there for a while laurette says boy someones shorts got yanked then lisa comes back and her nose is red and shes in a toogood mood know what i mean she got high kelly pointed a finger gun you must be a detective did she do that a lot enough not that i paid attention so the topic of impotence upset her wouldnt it upset you said kelly sposito lifes tough enough all the crap you get from men when theyre at their best who has time for limp spaghetti it was after five when petra left the lot and she wouldnt have minded a long hot bath and a good meal prepared by someone else maybe some torture at the easel but she still needed to trade notes with stu and if he suggested they make their move on ramsey tonight she wouldnt argue she called the station stu wasnt back but lillian the civilian receptionist said some stuff came for you from the coroner barbie big envelope medium big i put it on your desk thanks she ate a tuna sandwich at the apple pan washed it down with a coke scanned the paper nothing on lisa drove back to hollywood as quickly as the traffic would allow by the time she arrived the night shift had come on but most of the ds were already out serving warrants and looking for bad guys and her desk was clear stu still hadnt checked in inside the brown envelope were preliminary postmortem findings signed by a dr wendell kobayashi countersigned as schoelkopf had promised by the head coroner dr ilie romanescu quick turnaround usually even preliminaries took a week she sat down and read the two typed sheets traces of cocaine and alcohol had been found in lisa ramseys body enough to intoxicate but not cause stupor meaning shed been easier to take by surprise no final autopsy report yet but the docs were able to provide a wound count and cause of death twentythree cuts close enough to ilse eggermanns twentynine so far the coroner was guessing that the fatal one had been the very deep abdominal slash petra had tagged point of insertion just above the pubic bone continuing eight inches upward a vertical wound that had sliced through intestines and stomach and liver bisecting the diaphragm cutting off respiration a gutting street fighters move as she drops he hits her twentytwo more times frenzy or fun or both dr kobayashi guessed that hed been standing close to her for that first lethal lunge meaning blood on him too and if they lucked out and got an exchange something hed left on her but fiber and fluid analysis would take several days no footprints as alan lau had noted either hed taken off his shoes or gotten lucky she thought about what darrell had told her about lisas sexual proclivities oral sex in the car like a throwback to high school had lisa been fixated at the cheerleader stage cheerleaders and older men kelly had described lisa as full of herself but shed ended up ministering to darrell wanting nothing for herself sex in a car the killer taking lisa somewhere in a car mr macho ramsey unable to function a chronic problem the date ramseys lastditch attempt to prove himself in the car because he and lisa had done it before in cars that damn car museum had it been more than just a millionaires trophy thing ramseys marital aid all that chrome and steel big engines reminding him he was rich handsome semifamous a gazillion dollars worth of toys all so the blood would remain in his penis breshear had said lisa seemed practiced with ramsey others after the divorce before but the phone records showed no contact with other men no apparent social life maybe shed used her work phone for personal contact getting those records would be a major hassle she was sure the production company was the legal owner shed start the paperwork tomorrow morning back to the murder night lisa dolling herself up the car in the car lets do it in the car and ramsey couldnt cut it cut there it was again unable to cut it so lisa unleashes the sarcasm and he cuts her after hed been such a nice guy forgiving the way shed blabbed to the tabloid show getting her the job at the studio and still sending her seven grand a month twentythree in cash a brokerage account at merrill lynch shed speak to the broker ghadoomian something else for tomorrow sex money failure failure in the car so hed used the car to kill her driving her to her final destination doing her in a parking lot how la she needed access to plyr and plyr and every other vehicle in ramseys collection for all she knew the death car had been one of the others that phallic ferrari sitting right there in front of them stu and the sheriffs guys gawking unaware they were looking at a slaughterhouse on wheels no too conspicuous even for la one of the others her phone rang had to be stu but it was alan lau calling from parker center and the criminalist sounded exhausted got some initial results on those food wrappers and the urine the food was a mixture of ground beef and ground pork peppers onions a tomatobased sauce chili powder garlic powder some other spices we havent identified yet bread crumbs too not mixed in separate probably the bun white bread chiliburger quite possibly the urine was definitely human but i hope you dont want any fancy dna on it cause we barely had enough to do a presumptive type even if we did it would cost a fortune and take a long time what else did you get said petra prints off the wrapping paper and also off that book you found the book was full of them fulls partials nice ridge impressions im no expert but it looked like some matches between the wrapper and book we sent it all to id and so far no matches to any files so looks like your reader isnt a bigtime criminal or a government employee also from the size of the finger pads it probably is a woman bag lady squatting on a rock thought petra eating furtively reading some old library book that probably fed some schizo fantasy who knew what the presidents meant to her sad if nothing turned up it might be worth checking with the park rangers and some hollywood patrol officers see if one particular street woman frequented that section of griffith thanks alan anything show up in the vacuum just a pile of dirt so far for all the blood this was a pretty clean one stu came into the squad room at pm looking like prey petra was snacking on her second snickers bar and wondering where ramsey was at this very moment what thoughts were going through his head did he regret what hed done or was he exulting in the memory of butchering lisa she asked stu how he was he said fine and reported on his day with the dutiful tone of a child giving an oral report visits to three studios three wells dug wait and see it didnt sound like enough to turn his normally clear irises rosy pink he removed his suit jacket and draped it neatly over the back of his chair no one had anything personal to say about him he doesnt seem to hang with any particular industry crowd the fact that he beat lisa up makes them assume he killed her ive got something personal petra told him about her talks with breshear and sposito lisas hints about impotence he said interesting as if all men went through it did they its a motive she said definitely too bad its tough to verify you trust sposito on breshears alibi i called her before breshear got to her and she wasnt the least bit hinky about it just pod at being questioned you dont want to keep working breshear do you no i just want to make sure we eliminate him cleanly lets keep a nice neat flow chart on this one he put his palms down on his desk and leaned stretching his fingers now about that german girl petra gave him the fax on karlheinz lauch he read it and put it down she said so where do we go with it the austrian police again other countries where they speak german and have airports which i guess would be switzerland also interpol us immigration though with a threeyear window good luck finding anything at passport control sorensen already did all that three years time lapse means we do it again now that weve found one similar we need to widen the net make sure we dont miss others that means orange county ventura santa barbara even san francisco if we find nothing id feel comfortable putting any notion of a local serial killer to rest but you never know there was a guy a few years ago jack unterhoffer an austrian as it turned out moved between europe and the us strangling women took a long time to see the pattern if we dont turn up other leads on lisa and schoelkopf gets really paranoid hell want us to go national so lets preempt him run lauch through ncic whatever else the feds have to offer almost as if he wanted to do scut that didnt fit her chanceforpromotion theory or did it fine she said surprised at the impatience in her voice but ramseys still clearly our main guy and now weve learned something that adds to his motive i know the impotence thing is hearsay less than hearsay lisa hinted in general terms but if we dont follow up on it its beyond malfeasance no argument he said sitting back and playing with his suspenders were not arguing here petra were prioritizing there are only two of us so either we ask for reinforcement which will mean robberyhomicide boots us out or we split the job how about i take the whole eggermannlauch thing and you talk to ramsey the phone work we continue to divide petra couldnt believe what he was saying giving her sirloin and keeping the gristle for himself you want me to do ramsey alone it might work to our advantage petra in what way if ramsey does have woman problems your presence could get him antsy open some cracks woman problems not potency problems not man problems she said okay but i dont mind some scut dont worry about it petra tell the truth he started to say something stopped falling into something hed taught her about when they started working together watch out for suspects who say truthfully or frankly or to be honest or tell the truth theyre usually hiding something i really think youre the best one to psych out ramsey he said not just the gender thing itd be better not to overwhelm him make it obvious that were interrogating him one person rather than two could help with that also back at his house he seemed to focus on you what do you mean he wasnt exactly coming on but there was interest at least i thought so it tells us something about the way his mind works his ex has just been murdered hes putting on the grieving husband bit and hes checking you out so he had seen it what else had he kept to himself im not talking bait petra if you dont want to do it alone i understand but youve got the talent for this one thanks why didnt she feel complimented was she growing truly paranoid she nodded okay then its all set he picked up his phone runningrunning running notbreathing no looking back trees jumping in front of me trying to grab me change direction tear through the branches they tear back my face my arms my legs all on fire i want to close my eyes hurl myself through space a missile i try and its good but then i fall and roll hitting rocks and branches and sharp things hurting my head opening up a hot wet cut on my arm it keeps bleeding i can feel it dripping down but it doesnt hurt nothing hurts am i made of clay of shit dont know where im going dont care just out of there the park was a traitor now i can breathe i can hear it in my ears fuzzy big bursts of fuzz that fill up my head in air out air fuzz air my chest hurts no more places nothings safe my hearts beating too hard too fast suddenly i have to throw up i stop bend over it shoots out of me like lava all over the ground burning my throat when will i have a clean life no more empty now have to be quiet have to be quiet i am quiet everythings quiet i taste and smell like something dead i run some more fall get up run walk start to feel better and stop to breathe but then i start shaking and cant stop im in a part of the park that ive maybe seen before but im not sure lots of trees leaves all over the ground rocks and dirt could be anywhere in the park i lie down and hug myself my throat is still on fire my teeth start knocking against each other dadadadadadadada it stops i want to sit up but so tired the ground is bumpy i find a rock a smooth cold one hold it in both hands squeeze hard then i throw it away and take a deep breath the bleeding cut has dried into this purple line with wet spots and goldcolored stuff leaking out probably plasma it helps you clot i start to hurt all over and find all the other cuts and marks on my arms my face i scratch raise some bloody spots watch them clot too my bodys working a bird cry makes me jump and my heart shoots up into my throat and i feel like vomiting again breathe breathe breathe now im dizzy breathe listen to the birds theyre just birds okay im okay time to start moving again finally the night comes im on a high spot almost a hill nothing to see but trees and behind them the huge black shadows of real mountains still in the park but not for long traitor ive got nothing now my books my clothes my plastic bags my food its all back at five all the tampax money except whats left of the five dollars i took to the zoo i reach down in my pocket and feel three bills and some change how did all this happen how did they know to go for me the park was their place too my fault stupid thinking i could relax nice and dark now darkness covers me time to move again i walk till i hear cars still cant see them but i must be getting closer to los feliz boulevard i keep rubbing the hand that held the shit against rocks and dirt and tree trunks and after a while theres no more stink the cars are really loud now and it is los feliz and i know where i am hiding myself behind a thick tree i think about what to do and she comes into my head the one who got chucked why do i keep meeting evil gross sick people is there some message i wear on my face like this kid is a loser he should get messed up do i look weak wimpy something to be hunted down am i giving off some kind of sign i cant see the way you cant tickle yourself do i need to be different one things for sure i need to be clean and gone at pm petra called ramseys house the spanish maid answered with wan min and put her on hold two minutes three five six was ramsey figuring out a way to avoid her had he shot a call to his lawyer on another line she prepared herself for a stonewall would duly note it and try the boehlingers again a voice came on detective connor the man himself evening mr ramsey have you learned anything afraid not sir but i thought we might talk again fine when and where how about your house as soon as possible how about right now she caught the tail end of the evening rush back to the valley some idiot had overturned a truckload of garden furniture near the canoga park exit and thousands of misery voyeurs just had to slow and stare at mangled lounges and shattered fauxcement birdbaths whats so fascinating about someone elses misfortune who was she to talk she earned a living off it use the time constructively psych out ramsey but there was no sophisticated plan no details to nail down because planning too precisely when you had no facts could be worse than no preparation at all one thing was clear no confrontation shed go in friendly and even if ramsey gave her a hard time or renewed the don juan thing shed stay friendly that was her strength anyway she was able to elicit confessions gently just as effectively as the bullies sometimes more so stu had built her confidence by letting her take over some serious interrogations use your inherent personality as a weapon petra the way a therapist does shed never thought of therapy as warfare but she understood the message it was all manipulation and the best manipulators didnt overact stus interview persona was kind but strict big brother a smart pleasant but essentially tough guy you were a little afraid of but admired and wanted to please hers was regular gal the kind guys liked to talk to not bait talent but stu knew damn well bait was a significant part of it ramsey a ladies man in his own mind so dangle a lady a player packing limp spaghetti no lawyers name had been mentioned yet but petra was sure there was one lurking in the background feeding ramsey lines just like they did when filming what did they call those guys prompters machines did it now teleprompters ramsey had years of practice mouthing words and making them sound right even a bad actor had it over the average suspect the typical sad soul she interrogated was so full of anxiety he gave you more than you needed even when he thought he was lying effectively and the key was to mirandize him right away get every last drop legally the exception was your basic stonepsychopath who had little or no anxiety but those guys were so boringly selfdestructive they usually managed to trip themselves up being clever so where did ramsey fit in a calculated killer or just some pathetic impotent loser whod freaked out give him lots of rope sit back look and listen a selfhanging was too much to hope for but maybe hed at least knot himself up she reached ranchhaven at got waved through by the guard before she drove through she asked him if hed been on night duty sunday and he said no that was someone else then he closed the guardhouse door she drove up the hill artificial lights bleached the pink house offwhite made it appear even bigger but just as architecturally confused a young hispanic woman not estrella flores answered her ring opening the door halfway what petra could see of the house was dark hello she said detective connor for mr ramsey jes the woman was pretty with a round face wide eyes the color of concord grapes and black hair tied in a bun about twentyfive same pinkandwhite uniform estrella flores had worn petra repeated her name and showed the badge the maid stepped back wan min same voice as over the phone where was the older woman is estrella flores here confusion the young woman started to turn and petra tapped her shoulder donde esta estrella head shake estrella flores la housekeeper no answer and petras attempt at a warm sisterly smile failed to alter the maids stolid expression como se llama usted señorita maria nombre de familia guerrero maria guerrero sí usted no sabe estrella flores no estrella no trabaja aqui no cuanto tiempo usted trabaja aqui dos dias two days on the job estrella gone knowing something she didnt want to know and rabbiting petra wished shed gotten to her sooner as maria guerrero turned again to leave a male voice said detective and ramsey appeared out of the darkness wearing a white seriously wrinkled linen shirt cream silk slacks cream loafers no socks a vision in pale tones im a good guy he held the door open for petra and she walked in the house smelled stale and only a table lamp at the rear of the big sitting room was lit the car museum was dark too the glass wall a sheet of black he walked two feet ahead of her to the lamp switched on another and winced as if the wattage hurt his eyes had he been sitting in the darkness till now his sleeves were rolled carelessly to his elbows and his curly hair looked lumpy and uneven please have a seat waiting till shed settled on one of the overstuffeds he picked his own spot at a right angle to hers their knees two feet apart placing his hands at his sides he sat there his face looked drawn older more gray hairs among the curls but maybe it was just the lighting or some dye wearing off thanks for meeting with me sir of course he said inhaling and rubbing one corner of his mouth petra took out her pad letting her jacket fall open so he could see the badge on her shirt pocket showing him the side of the pad with the blue lapd stamp trying to study his reaction to those small bits of official presence he was looking somewhere else at the big stone fireplace cold and dark would you like something to drink detective no thanks sir if you change your mind let me know will do mr ramsey she opened the pad hows everything rough very rough petra gave her best understanding smile i noticed you have a different maid than when i was here the first time the other one walked out on me estrella flores he stared at her yes how long had she been working for you two years i guess give or take she said she wanted to go back to el salvador but i know it was the what happened to lisa she liked lisa i guess all the when you people were here it must have upset her because that night she was busy packing he shrugged then all the media calls its been hard keeping my head clear have there been many calls tons all on the business line the number i gave you was my private line i had everything forwarded to gregs office hes not talking to anyone so hopefully itll taper off he rubbed his eyes shook his head so you got a new maid immediately said petra greg got her she sat there not writing giving ramsey some silence to fill but he lowered his head wide shoulders rounding as he slumped your classic grieving posture chin in hand now the thinker estrella flores liked lisa she finally said but she didnt go with lisa when lisa moved out nope said ramsey looking up whys estrella so important she probably isnt sir im trying to get a feel for lisas personality was there something about her that would have stopped estrella from going with her was she hard to work for doubt it said ramsey it was probably the money i paid her more than lisa wouldve wanted to social security withholding everything legal lisa had a small place she wouldnt need someone that expensive so floress nervousness that first day hadnt been immigration worries and now she was gone ramsey widened his legs a bit no lisa wasnt hard to work for she was bright full of energy had a great sense of humor sometimes she could get a little sharp with people but no i wouldnt call her hard to live with sharp sarcastic exactly what kelly sposito had said not in a mean way said ramsey just a bit of an edge part of it was her sense of humor she told a joke better than any woman ive ever he stopped himself pressed his legs close together guess that sounds sexist but i havent really known that many women who enjoyed telling jokes i dont mean your phyllis dillers or your carol burnetts women who arent pros and lisa liked telling jokes when she was in the mood you have no idea who killed her not yet sir were open to ideas it just doesnt make sense lisa hooking up with some maniac and going to griffith park for the most part she went for older guys conservative types not the type to get wild she went for older guys after your divorce i wouldnt know about that said ramsey but i do know that before we started dating shed had two older boyfriends back in cleveland a dentist and a high school principal how much older ancient older than me he said smiling she made a crack about going out with me even though i was too young for her at the time she was twentyfour and i was fortyseven making him fifty what were the names of these other men i honestly cant recall the principal was pete something i think the dentist was hal or maybe hank shed been dating pete right before she met me broke up with him the day of the pageant thats where i met her miss ohio entertainment i told you that didnt i petra nodded going senile he tapped his head one good thing about alzheimers you get to meet new people every day thinking of her father wasting away petra forced a smile onset at sixty one of the earliest the doctors had seen one of the quickest progressions too kenneth connor dust at sixtythree are you okay said ramsey pardon for a second you looked upset was it the alzheimers joke that was one of lisas if it was too sick for your taste im no not at all mr ramsey she said appalled what had he seen on her face so lisa liked jokes yes do you have any idea when there might be a funeral that would depend on the coroner mr ramsey and lisas familys wishes are they coming out to la i dont know sir by the way i ended up calling them myself thought it should be me not some not a stranger but all i got was a machine i got through to dr boehlinger he frowned jack he hates my guts always did probably told you i was a terrible husband you should be investigating me rope she waited hes a tough guy but not a bad sort said ramsey lisa marrying me really blew his mind he touched his mustache tracing a vertical line through the center stroking the left side then the right bisecting again he didnt approve said petra he went crazy didnt come to the wedding it was just a small civil thing at their country club jacks and vivians vivian came and lisas brother john jack junior he works for mobil oil in saudi arabia and he came not jack senior though he called me a week before tried to talk me out of it said i was robbing lisas youth she deserved better babies a family the whole nine yards you didnt want children i wouldnt have minded but lisa didnt want them i didnt tell him that of course but lisa made that clear right from the outset she was the least domesticated girl ive ever met but jack thought she should be some highachieving housewife hes a very domineering guy surgeon used to giving orders he was tough on lisa when she was growing up tough in what way perfectionistic high standards lisa had to get straight as go out for every extracurricular activity excel in everything she told me when she was twelve jack bought her a horse so she had to learn jumping dressage compete whether or not she wanted to not the pageants though those were vivians idea sounds like a lot of pressure on all sides lisa said it was hell thats probably why she married me what do you mean when we were together lisa could do whatever she wanted sometimes he waved a hand sometimes what sir ramsey sat straighter sometimes i think i was too easygoing and she thought i didnt care i dont want to tell you how to do your job but i cant say i see the point of all this biography detective connor lisa was murdered by some maniac and were sitting here talking about her childhood a topic you brought up sometimes its hard to know whats relevant sir well he said i just dont see the point petra drew an oval on her pad and placed a horizontal line twothirds of the way down a few more pen strokes turned it into ramseys tailored mustache she sketched in his blue eyes tilted them downward a bit made him look sad any other reason for dr boehlinger to hate you other than your being too old for lisa i dont know he said jack and i never had any hassles so i honestly dont know no problems at all none why he mentioned something to me mr ramsey the incident that said ramsey sharply and now she saw something different in his eyes wary hardened i figured wed get around to it do you know why lisa went public in addition to hurting me why sir money the show paid her fifteen thousand she called it adding insult to injury she must have been pretty mad at you beyond mad lisa has jacks temper present tense again on some level she was still there with him tell me about the incident mr ramsey you dont watch tv id like to know what really happened his lower jaw slung forward and he clicked his teeth what can i say it was sleazy tawdry inexcusable it still makes me sick wed been out to dinner came home had words i dont even remember about what bet you do thought petra it heated up lisa started shoving me hitting me with a closed hand not the first time i put up with it because of the difference in our sizes this time i didnt there was no excuse what can i say i lost it he looked at his fist as if unable to believe it had ever caused damage petra remembered the news clip lisas black eye and split lip it only happened once once he said one single solitary time thats it he shook his head one stupid moment you lose control and its forever as good a description as any of murder i felt like crap just like absolute filth seeing her on the floor like that i tried to help her up but she screamed at me not to touch her i tried to get her an ice pack she wouldnt have anything to do with me so i went out to the pond and when i came back her car was gone she stayed away for four days during that time she went to inside story but she never told me about it came back and acted as if everything was fine then a few days later we were eating dinner and she turned on the tv and smiled and there we were in the hot tub and she gives me this grin says insult to injury cart dont ever lay a fucking hand on me again ramsey studied the offending body part again opened the palm i never did im going to get something to drink sure you dont want positive he was gone for several minutes came back with a can of diet sprite popping the top he sat back and drank petra said you just mentioned going out to a pond i dont remember seeing one out back thats because it was our other house our not my another indication he hadnt severed all the ties nor had he lapsed into distancing language the way murderers sometimes do in the middle of their chronologies starting with we and switching to she and i petra had read an fbi report claiming linguistic analysis could offer major clues she wasnt convinced but she was openminded ramsey drank more soda looked genuinely miserable your other house said petra we have a weekend place up in montecito actually a bigger house than this its pretty nuts maintenancewise theres a little pond there i used to find peaceful used to dont go there much anymore thats the way it is with second houses ive heard the same thing from other people they dont get utilized he nodded you think youre getting yourself some refuge and it just becomes another set of obligations the place was too damn big in the first place god knows this one is too so you dont go up there much last time had to be he looked at the ceiling months ago suddenly his body jerked an almost seizurelike movement that snapped his head down and brought his attention forward his eyes met petras wet he wiped them quickly the last time lisa and i were up there together he said was that time we never went back together a few days after the show aired she moved out again and i got served with papers i thought everything was patched up petra kept the poignancy at bay and thought the dv episode had gone down in montecito shed call ron banks and save him more searching ramsey rested his chin in his hand again okay she said this is helpful now if you dont mind lets talk about the night lisa was murdered mildred board would have liked to scrub the kitchen floor years ago shed accomplished the task every single day a onehour commitment up to the elbows in soapy water from six am to seven excellent thinking time no distraction from the slosh or the circular movements of cotton rags on yellow linoleum once the arthritis set in all that stooping and rubbing became unbearable and she was lucky if she was able to attend to the floor once a week the dining room parquet required attention as well the wood was faded buckling and cracked in spots long past due for a refinish every inch of wood visible the dining room was empty all the missuss furniture shipped off to those sothebys people in new york mildred felt an uncomfortable tightening around her eyes she breathed in and straightened her back and said one does ones best in a firm voice firm and loud no one to hear her the missus was upstairs so many other rooms between them all empty and closed off the kitchen with its old cherrywood cabinets industrial refrigerators and three ovens was big enough for a hotel the pots and pans and cutlery remained as did the missuss favorite bone china set and a few sentimental silver pieces in the butlers pantry and the magnificent linen press the sothebys people said they couldnt hope to sell but the lovely things the treasures the missus and him had acquired in europe were all gone brought in fine prices they had even after the auctioneers premium and the taxes mildred had seen the check known everything was going to be all right for a while she and the missus had never discussed the financial situation the missus continued to pay her insisting upon full salary though lord knew mildred didnt deserve it what use was she in this state destructive thoughts banish banish she noticed a water spot on the cabinet below the sink found a rag wiped it clean back in the old days the kitchen had been a bustling place the missus and him entertaining constantly caterers milling about waiters rushing pots steaming stainless steel counters blanketed with platters of savories and sweets not the least of the latter were mildreds pies no matter who the missus hired for catering shed always craved mildreds pies most notably the plum the dorset apple and the mixedberry so had him so had everyone mildred had cooked and cleaned in the big house for fortyone years two years after the missus and him moved in the lodge at lake arrowhead as well but lakeside weekends had only been an occasional thing even when him was alive and often the missus called in a cleaning service to remove the tarpaulins and clear the taps the lodge hadnt been used for over a decade not since the terrible weekend mildred sighed and tamped her hair fortyone years shining the silver shampooing the walltowalls cleaning nearly a hundred windows even the leaded glass panels him had acquired from a church in italy oh the missus always provided another girl to help but none of them ever managed to keep up for the first decade her workmate had been anna joslyn that dim skinny girl from ireland not quite focused mentally speaking but a good worker and strong as a brood mare then the big loud one from denmark with the vulgar bosoms that one hadnt worked out at all what a mistake after the dane all the agency sent were mexicans good workers most of them and generally honest though mildred kept her eyes open some spoke english some didnt either way it was their problem mildred refused to learn spanish english and french were quite enough thank you miss hammocks class at the orphanage had emphasized only english and french and eight decades of its graduates had worked in the finest homes of britain and the continent the mexicans werent a horrid lot but they seldom lasted very long rushing to some family crisis in mexico children husbands paramours saints days who could keep score of all those catholic assignations mildred would have preferred young ladies properly churched and educated straightbacked girls who knew the difference between royal crown derby and chinese export but one accepted the problem she knew was that there were no more orphanages all those babies cut from the womb or allowed to remain with unfit welfare slatterns one had only to read the paper no need anymore for mexican girls or anyone else for that matter mildred was seventythree and she wondered if shed live long enough to witness the final collapse of everything rational and right not that she expected to keel over any day soon except for the arthritis she felt quite fine but one never knew look what had happened to the missus such a beautiful woman the most graceful woman mildred had ever seen on either side of the ocean nothing but kind words ever left her lips such patience and lord knew living with him had often required patience look at her now thinking about it mildreds eyes felt weak the coffeepot hissed right on time mildred poured the missuss coffee into a victorian pitcher clumsylooking piece probably a gift from some dinner guest the lovely pitcher the hester bateman was gone george iii a banner year proper hallmarks and all him had brought it back from one of his london trips a firstclass shop on mount street someone else might have relegated it to a display case the missus believed in using the fine things it had been her breakfast pitcher till four years ago cartons of silver paintings even formal gowns shipped off like vegetables when shed first been hired mildred had been afraid to touch any of the missuss treasures fearful of marring something even back then she could recognize quality the missus just a girl back then but so wise had put her at ease this is a home dear not a museum and a fine home shed made for him light wound its way through the branches of the ancient twisted sycamore on the breakfast patio filtering through the kitchen window and settling on mildreds recalcitrant hands gnarled as badly as the tree but the sycamore sprouted green every year if only people merited autumn renewal mildred shook her head and stared at the floor in need of mopping such an expanse such a big room not that the last girl had been any use what was her name rosa rosita three months on the job and fooling with one of the gardeners boys mildred had been forced to call the agency yet again hello mr sanchez hello miss board and what can i do for you today cheerful he was and why not another commission mildred set up three interviews with ladies then the missus told her do we really need someone else mildred just you and me all we really use is the kitchen and our rooms fighting to sound gay but biting back tears mildred understood shed packed the silver and the paintings and the evening gowns so this is what it had come to all those years the missus putting up with him and look how him had left her that temper of his no doubt it had hastened his death high blood pressure the stroke and him only a young man leaving the missus alone like that poor dove though he had provided for her in a financial way one couldnt fault him there or so mildred had thought then four years ago the change rooms purged and locked no more mexican girls the gardening crew cut from every day to twice a week then once then one skinny youth attempting to cover two acres with rapidly diminishing success gardens were like children requiring a hawk eye lest they go delinquent the missuss garden once a glory had become a sad shaggy thing lawns spotted and burnt and incompletely mowed untrimmed hedges swelling uncouthly trees burdened with dead branches flower beds whiskered with weeds the fishpond drained mildred tried her best but her hands defied her did the missus realize she rarely ventured out anymore perhaps that was why not wanting to see or perhaps she just didnt care not because of the financial issue because mildred was forced to admit that the missus had changed a long time ago the terrible weekend in lake arrowhead then him tragedy upon tragedy not that the missus had ever complained perhaps it wouldve been better if she had the german railway clock over the lefthand freezer chimed something else those nasalvoiced sothebys people had rejected not that mildred could blame them hideous it was and grossly inaccurate nine oclock on its face meant eight fiftythree in seven minutes mildred would be at the missuss bedroom door knocking gently hearing please come in dear from the other side of the molded mahogany entering shed set the tray on a bureau prop the missus while chattering encouragingly fluff the mountain of pillows fetch the wicker bed table set it carefully over the missuss comforter and arrange the service precisely silverplate toast rack filled with triangles of extrathin wheat bread browned lightly the coffee freshly ground african blend from that little shop on huntington boulevard one needed some luxury for heavens sake decaffeinated now but accompanied by real cream thick enough to clot for the scones what a job it was finding that the golden marmalade that mildred still made by hand using fine white cane sugar and the few sour oranges she managed to find out back in the orchard the sour orange tree was dying but it managed to produce a bit of lovely fruit one thing california was good for was fruit mildred still loved to stroll the orchard and pick pretending the ground wasnt hardpacked and lumpy pretending the herbs were green and fresh not the tangle of straw thatching the borders pretending she was a girl back in england out in the yorkshire country shutting out the fact that on certain days most days one could hear the pasadena freeway fruit and weather those were the only things to recommend california despite living most of her life in san marino mildred considered the place barbaric horrid things in the newspaper when she deemed them too horrid she didnt bring the paper up with the missuss breakfast the missus never asked about it the missus never read much anymore except for those romance paperbacks and art magazines the missus never did much at all nothing wrong with her the doctors claimed but what did they know the woman was sixtysix but had suffered centuries worth of tragedy the railway clock said and mildred had only three minutes to cross the kitchen to the creaky rear elevator that rose up to the missuss bedroom on the third floor she picked a fine yellow rose from the three without mildew on the thorny grandiflora bush out back shed snipped at dawn trimmed the stems and placed the flowers in sugar water now she laid the blossom next to the covered platter of shirred eggs the missus rarely ate the eggs but one tried lifting the tray she walked speedily steadily the kitchen didnt look too awful all things considered very good mildred said to no one in particular i sneak out of the park and go down los feliz staying as far from the light as i can no one walking up here just cars whizzing by los feliz ends and western starts and now the junkies and prosties take over i turn right on franklin because its darker all apartment buildings i dont want to be on the boulevard not too many people out tonight and the ones who are dont seem to notice me then i see a couple of mexicans hanging around a corner in the shadow of an old brick building probably doing a drug deal i cross the street and they look at me but they dont say anything a block later a skinny prostie with spiky white hair and bright blue tshirt and shorts comes out of an apartment carrying a tiny purse she spots me and her eyes get wild and she says hey boy in a drunk voice and wiggles her finger shes short just a kid doesnt look that much older than me fuck and suck thirty she says and when i keep walking she says fuck you faggot for the next few blocks i dont see anyone then another prostie older fatter who pays no attention to me just stands around smoking and watching cars then three tall black guys wearing baseball caps and baggy pants come out of the shadows see me look at each other i hear them say something and i cross the street again trying to seem relaxed i hear laughter and footsteps and i look back and see one of them chasing me almost reaching me i speed up and run and he does too his legs are long and hes got his hand up like to grab me i run across the street and a cars coming and it has to move to the side not to hit me the driver honks and yells fucking idiot and im still running but the black guy isnt i think i hear someone laughing probably a game for him if i had a gun i walk for a long time at cahuenga theres more light and the entrance to the hollywood bowl a long curvy road that climbs up im not going up there too much like the park i dont want anything to do with parks so guess what comes next another park wattles park what a weird name ive never seen it never been this far not a friendlylooking place high fences all around and gates with big chain locks and a sign saying the city owns it and its closed at night keep out through the fence all i can see is plants it looks messy probably full of perverts now franklin ends heres hollywood boulevard again i cant avoid it like its chasing me this big burst of noise and light gas stations cars buses fastfood places worst of all people and some of them look at me like im a meal i cross la brea it gets quiet again all apartments some of them pretty nicelooking ive never thought of the boulevard as anything but stores and theaters and weirdos but look at this people live here in pretty nice places maybe i should have traveled sooner the cut on my arm is dry and it doesnt hurt much the ones on my face itch im breathing okay though my chest still hurts im hungry but three dollars isnt going to buy me much and i look for dumpsters to dive nothing not even a garbage can i walk a little bit more and turn off on a real quiet street all houses a nice dark street but no cans here either or alleys cars are parked bumper to bumper and down a ways i see more light and noise another boulevard i stop and look around some of the houses look okay others are messy with cars parked on the lawn then i come to one with no car in the driveway or on the lawn totally dark oldlooking made of some kind of dark wood with a slanted roof that hangs over a really wide porch no fence not even across the driveway but the grass is cut so someone lives here and maybe they keep their cans in the backyard the driveway is just cement with a strip of grass growing in the middle and i cant see whats at the end of it i look around to make sure no ones watching and walk back there very slowly as i pass the front porch i see a big pile of mail in front of the door all the windows are totally black looks like the people have been gone for a while no beware of dog sign no barking from inside the house i keep going and finally make out whats at the end of the driveway a garage with wooden doors the yard is small for such a big house just a little grass and a couple of trees one of them gigantic but with no fruit the cans are out behind the garage three of them two metal one plastic empty maybe the people dont live here anymore i turn around and am heading back to the street when i notice a dot of orange over the back door a small bulb so weak it only lights up the top half of the door a screen door behind the screen is glass the screens held in place by two looptype things with hooks and when you twist them it comes right off the glass behind the screen is really a bunch of windows nine squares in a wooden frame i touch one lightly and it shakes a little but nothing happens i touch it harder knock a few times still nothing same when i knock on the door taking off my tshirt i wrap it around my hand and punch a lower square on the left side pretty hard it just sits there but the second time i hit it it comes loose and falls into the house and breaks lots of noise now nothing happens i reach in and feel around and find the doorknob in the middle is a button and when i turn the knob it pops out with a click and the door opens back on goes my tshirt and im inside it takes a few seconds for my eyes to see in the darkness the rooms some kind of laundry place with a washerdryer a box of tide on top of the washer some washrags next comes a kitchen that smells of bug spray with lots of plants in pots all over the counters i open the refrigerator and a light goes on inside and even though i see food i shut it fast because the light makes me feel naked as the door closes i notice a peacesign sticker and one that says sisterhood is all my heart is really beating fast but a different kind of fear not all bad i walk around from dark room to dark room nothing but a bunch of furniture then back to the kitchen a closed door on the way turns out to be a bathroom with more plants on the toilet tank i turn the light on then off clear my throat nothing happens this place is empty this is sort of fun i go back to the kitchen the window over the sink is covered by curtains with flowers on them with little fuzzy balls hanging down sisterhood women live here men wouldnt have all those plants okay lets try the refrigerator again on the top shelf are two cans of barqs root beer and a gallon plastic orange juice container with just a little juice left three gulps of juice it tastes bitter i put the root beer cans in my pocket next is a tub of mazola margarine and a stick of philadelphia cream cheese i open the cream cheese and its covered with bluegreen mold the margarine looks okay but i dont know what to do with it below that is a container of strawberry yogurt and three slices of american cheese stiff and curly around the edges no mold i eat all three these people have definitely been gone for a long time on the bottom shelf is a package of oscar mayer lowfat bologna thats never been opened i put it in my pocket along with the root beer and a whole pineapple with the green thing still attached on top and soft in a few places leaving the refrigerator door open for light i bring the pineapple to a counter and open drawers until i find forks and knives in there with them are bobby pins and hair bands i take out the biggest knife and slice the pineapple in half the soft spots turn out to be brown spots and theyre spreading all over the pineapple like a disease i cut around them this is really a good knife and manage to get some really nice ripe pieces of delicious supersweet pineapple that makes me hungrier and i taste the bologna and end up eating every slice standing at the counter then more pineapple the juice runs all over my chin and my shirt and i feel it burn my face where the cuts are then one of the root beers now my stomachs killing me because its full i go back to the bathroom right off the kitchen take a leak wash my hands and face then i notice the shower on a shelf are soap and shampoo and cream rinse and something called detangler plenty of hot water i add some cold make it perfect run it as hard as it goes locking the door i pull off my clothes and step in the waters like needles hurting me but in a good way i take the longest shower ive ever had no mom waiting to get in and spend half the day there getting ready for moron no moron wanting to sit on the toilet for an hour i just keep soaping and washing off soaping and washing off making sure every part of me gets attention my hair and under my nails inside my nostrils deep up my butt i want to get every bit of crud out of me then around front under my balls ive got a hardon that feels good im sitting there drying off loving being clean and safe thinking about far places imaginary places huge mountains purple majesty like the song a silver ocean surfer dudes jet skis girls in bikinis dancing the hula dolphins jacques cousteau blue tangs yellow tangs moray eels nautiluses then i hear sound and for a minute i think ive really spaced out created a whole tropical island movie with a soundtrack then the voices get louder womens voices then a bang someone putting something down light under the door from the kitchen a scream a real scream ramsey said i need a bite do you mind if we go in the kitchen nerves making him hungry petra said not at all mr ramsey good chance to see more of the house she followed him as he switched lights on illuminating terrible lithos big furniture veering into exactly what petra expected six hundred square feet of pseudoadobe walls and rusticbeamed ceilings white eurocabinets gray granite counters brushedsteel appliances copper rack full of lethal weapons hanging from the beams on the counters sat an array of food processors toasters microwaves a greenhouse window provided a view of stucco wall the eastern border of the house a side door in the center of the kitchen was a long narrow wooden table old heart pine scarred and buffed to a satin finish the scars shiny dents probably a genuine antique country french petra saw it as a monastery piece nice but the eight chairs around it were chrome breuer types with rawhide leather slings so discordant she wanted to scream whose idea of eclectic his or lisas ramsey opened the fridge on the left fully stocked a bachelor who made himself at home he took out another diet sprite and a carton of cottage cheese with chives gotta watch the tush he said locating a spoon sure i cant get you anything a drink at least no thanks he sat down at the head of the pine table and she took a side chair this must look weird he said lowering the spoon to the cheese eating but i havent eaten all day could feel my blood sugar drop hypoglycemic theres diabetes in my family so im careful he began eating cottage cheese wiping white flecks from his mustache not caring what he looked like in front of her maybe shed been wrong about the don juan thing or maybe he turned it on and off she watched him take a swallow of soda two more spoonfuls of cottage cheese got his attention by taking out her pad okay that night he said i told you i was in tahoe didnt i the first time you were here petra nodded scouting locations for next season he went on weve got a double script with some casino episodes trying to figure out where we want to do it well be shooting in a month or so who was with you on the scouting trip greg and our locations supervisor scott merkin we looked at some properties by the lake visited a few of the casinos had dinner at harrahs and flew home commercial flight he put the spoon down drank some more all these details so im a suspect no surprise in his voice the unspoken final word to the sentence finally its just routine mr ramsey he smiled sure it is ive said the exact same thing tons of times to suspects on the show just routine means dack price is gonna go after the guy petra smiled in real life routine means routine mr ramsey but if this isnt a good time to talk no this is fine the pale eyes locked in on petras ramsey ate more cottage cheese raised the soda can to his lips realized it was empty and fetched another i guess it makes sense my being a suspect because of the incident that was the slant the news put on it staring at her rope she could visualize it uncoiling like a cobra this whole thing said ramsey the way people are thinking about me after those news broadcasts no it wasnt a commercial flight we went by private charter we always do westward charter we use them all the time our usual pilot too ed marionfeldt i like him cause he was a navy fighter pilot real top gun we flew out of burbank everythings recorded in westwards log out around eight am back by eightthirty pm scott drove home and greg brought me back here he usually drives when it gets late because my night vision isnt all that great eye problems though his mustache was clean ramsey wiped it again early stages of cataracts my ophthalmologist wants to laser me but i keep putting it off telling her he couldnt have driven lisa to the park at night so you dont go out much at night i do its not that bad lights just bother me he smiled dont give me a ticket okay petra smiled back promise he dug the spoon into the cottage cheese again looked at it put it down petra noticed looseness around his mouth mottling behind the ears and several fine lines that had to be tuck remnants gray hair sprouted from an ear in the bright light of the kitchen every wrinkle and vein was advertised his body starting to fail him blood sugar the eyes the penis appealing to her sense of sympathy hoping for female tenderness sarcastic lisa hadnt offered so greg drove you home she said we got here around ninefifteen ninethirty did some paperwork then i just crashed next morning greg was up before me working out by the time i got to the gym ive got a home gym i did a little treadmill showered we had some breakfast here decided to practice some putting then head over to the agoura oaks country club for eighteen holes then you showed up sorry to spoil your day herbert okay said petra anything else thats it said ramsey who knew she closed the pad and they hiked back to the front door howre the cars she said passing the glass wall havent thought about them much petra stopped and peered through the black glass was the mercedes parked in its allotted space without light visibility was zero ramsey flicked a switch and there it was a big sedan gunmetal gray toys said ramsey turning off the light he walked her to the ford and when she got behind the wheel he said give my regards to greg petras turn to stare he gave her a small sad smile an old mans smile i know youll be verifying the alibi he said just routine feeling guilty and useless but making sure to look calm and sharp stu tightened his tie and put on his suit jacket five hours of phone calls no cases resembling lisa ramseys or ilse eggermanns he didnt know what to make of the german girls murder wasnt getting any help from the austrian police or interpol or the airlines tomorrow hed try us customs and passport control asking them what to keep an eye out for lauch good luck he stared at the viennese mug shot a conspicuouslooking guy but it was beyond needleinthehaystack maybe petra was having some luck with ramsey maybe not it was hard to care he cleared his desk and locked it walked across the squad room wilson fournier was on the phone but just as stu passed the black detective hung up scowling and reached for his own jacket fourniers partner cal baumlitz was out recuperating from knee surgery and fournier had been working alone for days and showing the strain new call said stu forcing himself to be social poor excuse for one fournier was averagesize and slim had a shaved head and a bushy mustache that reminded stu of one of the actors hed seen on sesame street back when hed worked nights had mornings to spend with his kids fournier hitched his holster and collected his gear and the two walked out together life sucks ken you and barbie get lisa ramsey celebrities up the ying and i get an endofshift maybeprowlerrapistburglar gig with stupid overtones you want ramsey fournier laughed yeah yeah i know fame has its price what kind of a maybeprowlerrapist fournier shook his head the rapist thing is crapscuse me deacon manure were supposed to be working homicide for gods sake and on this one no one got hurt let alone dead so whys it my business meanwhile ive got four open s and pressure from the boss goddamn braindead chief and his community policing manure a few steps later just to be polite stu said what exactly happened wil house on north gardner two lesbians come home from a week in big sur find someones been in their kitchen scarfed food used the shower they walk in on it the showers still going freak run screaming out the front door and the perp rabbits out the back what was burgled food part of a pineapple bologna some soda big bad burglary huh so wheres the rape exactly fournier gave a disgusted look lesbians a big pile of mail at the front door gone an entire week do they think of putting a stop on it or leaving some lights on or getting an alarm or a rottweiler or a poison snake or an ak man ken what kind of folks still think they can count on us to do a damn thing about crime routine am i a suspect was he playing with her she called stu at the station hed checked out an hour ago and when she tried his house she got no answer out with kathy and the kids must be nice to have a life back in la she bought some salads at a momandpop grocery on fairfax ate them at home while watching the news no ramsey info she tried stu again still no answer time to simulate a life for herself changing into acrylicspattered sweats she put on mozart and squeezed paint onto her palette hunched on a stool she worked till midnight first the landscape which was responding a bit she felt in the groove that hypnotic time contraction then another canvas larger blank and inviting she laid on two coats of white primer followed by a luxuriant layer of mars black and when that dried began a series of hastily brushedin gray ovals that became faces no composition just faces scores of them some overlapping like fruit dangling from an invisible tree some with mouths parted innocently all with pupilless black eyes that could have been empty sockets ghostly discs each one portraying a variant of confusion each face younger than the last a reverse aging until she was painting nothing but children perplexed children growing on an invisible child tree her hand cramped and she dropped the brush rather than get psychological about that she laughed out loud switched off the music snatched the canvas off the easel and placed it on the floor face to the wall stripping naked and tossing her clothes on the floor she took a long shower and got into bed the moment the lights were off she was playing back the interview with ramsey almost positive the guy was manipulating not knowing what to do about it she woke up wednesday morning still thinking about it the way hed flicked on the garage light showing her the mercedes as if daring her to probe further all those sympathy ploys blood sugar cataracts not much night driving poor old guy falling apart but there was one health problem hed never bring up one that could motivate some serious rage and still no lawyer at least not out in the open some kind of double bluff ask the wrong question and in come the mouthpieces or was he just feeling confident because he had the perfect alibi dont get sucked into it no frontal assault go for the flanks the underlings find estrella flores have a chat with the charter pilot though that wouldnt prove anything thered been plenty of time to get home leave pick up lisa kill her last but not least greg balch faithful lackey and likely perjurer petra was certain ramsey had phoned the business manager the minute she drove off but sometimes underlings harbored deep resentment petra remembered the way ramsey had turned on balch during the notification call balch standing there and taking it used to being a whipping boy put a little pressure on ignite some longburied anger and sometimes the little people turned she reached her desk at am found a note from stu saying hed be in late probably the afternoon no reason given she felt her face go hot crumpled the note and tossed it the flight manager at westward charter confirmed ramsey and balchs tahoe trip and the pm burbank arrival ed marionfeldt the pilot happened to be in and she spoke to him pleasant mellow hed done tons of trips with the adjustor no problems nothing different this time petra didnt want to ask too many questions for fear of making ramsey the prime suspect even though he was she could imagine some defense attorney using marionfeldts testimony to illustrate ramseys normal mood that day if it ever got to a trial dream on a phone call to social security verified that estrella flores was indeed legal her only registered address ramseys calabasas house so any checks would go there she asked a putupon ssa worker she hasnt filed for benefits so there are no checks going out if you get a change of address would you please let me know mr vicks if it comes to my attention ill try but we dont work with individual petitions unless theres a specific problem ive got a specific problem mr vicks im sure you do all right let me tag this but i have to tell you things get lost so youre best off checking in with us from time to time she called players management no one answered no machine maybe balch was on his way up the coast to montecito taking some downtime to obliterate evidence at the bosss request next came the merrill lynch broker morad ghadoomian had a pleasant unaccented voice sounded prepared for the call poor ms boehlinger i suppose you want to know if she had any financial entanglements unfortunately she didnt unfortunately no entanglements he said because there was nothing to tangle no money in the account nothing substantial could you be a little more specific sir i wish i could suffice it to say i was led to expect things that never materialized she told you shed be investing large sums of money but didnt well im really not sure what the rules are here in terms of disclosure neither is my boss weve never dealt with a murder before we do get deceased clients all the time estate lawyers irs reporting but this suffice it to say ms boehlinger only came by my office once and that was to fill out forms and seed the account how much seed did she sow said petra well i dont want to step out of line here suffice it to say it was minimal petra waited a thousand dollars said ghadoomian just to get things going in stock the broker chuckled ms boehlingers plans were to build up a sizable securities account her timing couldnt have been better im sure you know how well the markets been doing but she never followed through with instructions and the thousand remained in a money market fund earning four percent how much did she say she was going to invest she never said she just implied my impression was that it would be substantial six figures she talked about achieving financial independence who referred her to you hmm i believe she just called on her own yes im sure of it a reverse cold call he chuckled again but she never followed through never i did try to reach her suffice it to say i was disappointed financial independence lisa expecting a windfall or just deciding to get serious as she approached thirty by banking ramseys monthly support check and living off her editors salary a surplus of eighty grand a year could add up a reduction in the eighty would have upset lisas investment plans had ramsey balked after lisa got a job threatened to take her back to court and was that why she hadnt followed through or was it something simple shed chosen another broker not likely why would she have left the thousand sitting there with ghadoomian was money another issue between the ramseys money and thwarted passion no better setup for murder she spent an hour on the phone talking to civil servants at the hall of records finally located the original ramsey divorce papers the final decree had been granted a little over five months ago no obvious complications no petitions to alter support so if ramsey had balked he hadnt made it official then a message came through to call id division at parker center no name the civilian clerk there said ill put you through to officer portwine she knew the name but not the face portwine was one of the prints specialists shed seen his signature on reports he had a reedy voice and a humorless rapid delivery thanks for calling back this could be either a majorleague screwup or something interesting hope you can tell me which whats wrong said petra you sent us some material from the lisa boehlingerramsey crime scene food wrapper and a book we obtained numerous prints most likely female from the size but no match in any of our files i was just about to write you a report to that effect when i got another batch supposedly from another case burglary on north gardner latents from a kitchen knife and some food containers i had a spare minute so i looked at them and they matched yours so what i need to know is was there some kind of mixup in the batch numbers the forms getting screwed up because its bizarre two batches coming from hollywood one after the other and we get the exact same prints we caught hell about our cataloging last year even though were careful you know how much stuff we process weve been bending over backwards meaning if there is a problem on this one its on your end not ours how could a guy talk so fast enduring the speech petra had dug her nails into her palm when was the burglary she said last night a six car handled it and referred it to one of your ds w b fournier petra looked over at wils desk gone and checked out what kind of food containers were printed plastic orange juice jug the prints were on the paper label and a pineapple that was interesting never printed a pineapple before therere some other samples supposedly coming says here a krazy glue tape from stainless steel plumbing fixtures and a bottle of shampoo also tape from looks like a refrigerator yes a refrigerator sounds like a kitchen burglary so whats the story i dont know a thing about the burglary all we sent you from ramsey were the food wrapper and the book and the victims clothing youre telling me this other material isnt yours that is exactly what im telling you said petra portwine whistled two sets of prints from the same person two different crime scenes looks that way said petra her heart was racing do you still have the ramsey batch specifically the book nope sent it down to evidence yesterday at seventeen hundred hours but i did keep a copy of the prints some pretty distinctive ridges thats how i noticed the match okay thanks welcome said portwine grudgingly at least we dont have a problem she left wil fournier a note to get in touch still no message from stu and he didnt pick up his cell phone after driving downtown to parker center she smiled her way into the employee parking lot and went up to the thirdfloor evidence room where she filled out a requisition for the library book the evidence warden was a dyedblond black woman named sipes who was unimpressed by the fact that the victim was l boehlingerramsey and pointed out to petra that she hadnt written in the case number clearly petra erased and rewrote and sipes disappeared behind endless rows of beige metal shelving returning ten minutes later shaking her head that lot number hasnt been checked in im sure it has said petra last night officer portwine from id sent it over yesterday at five pm yesterday why didnt you say so that would be in a different place another fifteen minutes passed before petra had the evidence envelope in hand and sipess permission to take it back in the ford she removed the book our presidents the march of american history bag lady with an interest in government and burglary breaking into homes stealing food most likely schizo she flipped pages looking for notes in the margin some overlooked bit of scrap nothing remarkably the checkout card was still in the circulation packet the hillhurst branch she remembered that no activity for nine months no activity since bag lady had lifted it petra tried to imagine her living on the street thieving reading stealing food and knowledge there was a certain crazy romanticism to that squatting to pee on a rock schizo girlthoreau she drove back to hollywood found the hillhurst branch in a strip mall a few blocks south of los feliz strange setup not what petra thought of as a library windowless slab pure government graythink right next to a supermarket loose shopping carts nearly blocked the front door a sign said it was a temporary location she went in carrying the evidence packet and her business card the place was one big room a grayhaired female librarian at a desk in the corner talking on the phone a younger woman at the checkout desk one patron a very old guy in a cloth cap reading the morning paper a furled umbrella on the table near his elbow though the june sky was baby blue and rain hadnt fallen in months naturalbirch bookshelves on rollers reading tables of the same pale wood travel posters trying to take the place of windows what a pathetic bit of pretense the older librarian was engrossed in her phone chat and petra headed for checkout the young woman was hispanic tall well dressed in a budget gray rayon suit that looked better than it deserved to draped over her slinky form she had a pleasant face warm eyes decent skin but what caught petras attention was her hair black thick straight hanging below the hem of her miniskirt like that country singer crystal gayle may i help you petra introduced herself and showed the card magda solis said the woman clearly thrown by the homicide designation petra slipped the red book out and placed it on the counter magda soliss right hand flew to her left bosom oh no has something happened to him him the little boy who solis looked over at the grayhaired librarian the boy who stole it said petra small body impression small hands not a woman a kid why hadnt she thought of it suddenly she thought of the painting shed begun last night the tree full of lost children and fought the shudder that began at her shoulders and snaked its way down to her navel solis scratched her chin can we talk outside sure solis hurried over to the older woman in a slightly flatfooted gait that managed to be graceful arms bent tensely glorious hair flapping she said something that made the boss librarian frown and returned gnawing her lip okay im on break out in the strip mall near petras ford she said im a trainee didnt want my supervisor to hear did something happen to him why dont you tell me what you know ms solis i hes just a little boy maybe ten or eleven at first i wasnt even sure it was him taking the books i mean but he was the only one who ever read the ones that were missing this one especially he kept coming to over and over and then it was gone so he took other books too solis fidgeted but he always brought them back such a serious little boy pretending to be doing homework i guess he didnt want to attract attention i finally saw him do it sneak something back one that id marked missing something about oceanography i think pretending to do homework thats what it looked like to me always the same few pages of math problems he always did math algebra so maybe hes older or just gifted from the things he read ill bet he was gifted solis shook her head hed do a little math and then head back to the stacks find something read for a couple of hours it was obvious he just loved to read and thats so rare were always trying to attract kids and its a struggle even when they do come in they goof around and make noise he wasnt like that so well behaved a little gentleman except for stealing books solis worried her lip again yes well i know i should have said something but he returned them no harm done why didnt you suggest he get a library card for that hed need id and an adults signature and he was obviously a street kid i could tell from his clothes he tried to look nice damped down his hair and combed it but his clothes were old and wrinkled had holes in them so did his shoes and he wore the same couple of things over and over again his hair was long hanging over his forehead looked like it hadnt been cut in a long time reaching back she touched her own locks and smiled i guess we were kindred spirits please tell me detective has something happened to him he may have been a witness to something what else can you tell me about him small skinny anglo kind of a pointy chin pale complexion like hes anemic or something his hair is light brown straight im not sure about his eyes blue i think sometimes he walks with good posture but other times he hunches over like a little old man he has an old look to him im sure youve seen that on street kids did you ever speak to him one time in the beginning i came over to him and asked if there was anything i could help him with he shook his head and looked down at the table got a scared look in his eyes i left him alone a street kid last year in college i did some volunteer work at a shelter and he reminded me of the kids i saw there not that they were into books the things he read biographies natural history government the presidents this one was his favorite i mean here was a kid society had obviously failed and he still believed in the system dont you think thats remarkable he must be gifted i couldnt turn him in does my supervisor need to know petra smiled and shook her head magda solis said i figured the best way i could help him was let him use the library the way he wanted he returned everything except the presidents book where did you find it nearby said petra and solis didnt press her how long has he been coming to the library two three months every week two to three times a week always in the afternoon hed arrive around two pm stay till four or five i wondered if he chose afternoons because most kids are off from school then and hed be less conspicuous good thinking said petra the librarian blushed i could be all wrong about him maybe hes a rich kid from los feliz just likes to act weird whens the last time you saw him ms solis lets see a few days ago last week must have been last friday yes friday he read a big pile of national geographics and smithsonians didnt take anything last weekday before lisas murder he hadnt returned since a kid living in the park reading in the dark how by penlight part of a street kids survival stash from the griffith park lot to the north gardner burglary was a good four five miles traveling west why this was a kid whod settled down set up a routine not a wanderer scared because hed seen something i dont want to put him in danger said the librarian on the contrary ms solis if i find him i can make sure hes kept out of danger solis nodded wanting to believe the woman had bruised eyes kindred spirithad she meant something beyond untrimmed hair thanks for your help said petra youre sure hes not hurt he was okay last night breaking into a house and cutting pineapple hes fine but i do need to locate him maybe you can help me with that ive told you everything i know petra took out her pad and a number pencil i draw a little lets see if we can come up with something rapist police why are they screaming that i throw on my clothes the screams get far away i crack open the door look out see nothing and run out the back it sounds like theyre out in front still screaming rapist which is crazy id never rape anyone i know what it feels like to be hunted i run behind the garage climb over the wooden fence into the next yard lights on in that house colors a tv behind the curtains i hear someone laughing i run through the yard to the next street then back up to hollywood boulevard where i turn down another street then up again moving back and forth so no one will see me walking not running blend in blend in no sirens the cops havent come yet if those women keep lying about rape they might send up helicopters with those big white beams that could turn me into a bug on paper then i realize they never saw me why should anyone think im the one i slow down even more pretend everythings great im on another quiet street people locked inside thinking theyre safe or maybe worried theyre not ill keep going west away from the park and hollywood stupid women with plants all over the place who leave food to rot the next busy street is sunset weirdos lots more kids than hollywood even more cars lots of restaurants clubs across the street a place called body body body with a plastic sign of a naked lady then something called the snake club with a big line out in front and two big fat guys not letting anyone in is that guy in that red car looking at me weird i turn off to the next quiet street back and forth again now my feet are hurting ive been walking all day west maybe the beach the beach is clean isnt it i have no money no way to protect myself should have taken the pineapple knife stu studied the drawing of the boy hed blown in just before pm no explanation petra burned to have it out with him but this new development a potential witness meant they had to stay on task good work he said dont show harold harold beatty was a sixtyyearold rampart narc who sometimes doubled as a sketch artist all the faces he drew looked exactly the same the beatty family other ds called them behind his back stu played with his suspenders and the casual gesture angered petra further she wanted acknowledgment that this could be something because she wasnt confident it would lead anywhere at least the drawing was good guiding magda solis through every feature petra had produced a highly detailed carefully shaded rendering the librarian stared at the finished product and whispered amazing a nicelooking boy with big wideset eyes petra left them mediumshaded to accommodate either brown or blue a narrow nose with pinched nostrils thin mouth pointy chin with a dimple solis wasnt sure of the boys eye color but she was sure of the dimple straight hair light brown thick brushed to the right sheathing the forehead to the eyebrows hanging over the ears fringing wildly at the shoulders a skinny neck sprouted from a tshirt solis said he was small well under five feet eighty pounds tops wore tshirts jeans tennis shoes with holes in them sometimes an old ratty sweater oh yeah and a watch one of those cheap digital things that interested petra was the timepiece an old christmas present something hed boosted where was his home how long ago had he run away a kid when she applied for detective shed been offered the choice of juvey or auto theft had chosen hot cars no one asking why stu said he looks grim and that was true the boys expression was beyond hurt he looked burdened soliss phrase was crushed by life he takes food from the fridge showers said stu print match to ours unbelievable maybe its providence said petra maybe gods rewarding you for all that piety and church time sure said stu his voice rasped shed never heard him this angry what was the big deal she always kidded him about religion before she could say a thing he stood up and buttoned his jacket okay lets go tell schoelkopf turning his back on her yet again since hed waltzed into the squad room they hadnt shared a second of eye contact lets do it later said petra ive got paperwork he wheeled suddenly whats your problem with doing it by the book petra he made it clear he wanted to be informed and now theres something to inform him about hed made it to the door when petra caught up with him and stagewhispered what the hells going on nothings going on were going to inform schoelkopf not that whats with you he kept going didnt answer goddamn you bishop youre acting like a complete goddamn jerk he stopped worked his jaws his hands were fisted never had she cursed at him she prepared herself for an explosion this would be interesting instead his face slackened goddamn me you could be right in schoelkopfs office they both clung to frozen calm the captain glanced at the drawing and put it down you did this barbie hidden talent maybe we should retire harold he sat back and put his feet on his desk new shoes italian the soles still black it aint fish and loaves but maybe its half of something he ripped the drawing out of petras pad talk to juvey officers see if anyone knows this kid also shelters church groups welfare workers whoevers dealing with runaways nowadays ill make copies for pi public information youre going to the press with it said petra youve got a better way of publicizing it are we sure we want to publicize it right away why the hell not when we first found the book you thought it was weak pointed out the unlikelihood of anyone reading in the dark so whats the chance the boy actually saw anything but if we let the world know what he looks like and hes a hollywood street kid we could set off a hunting frenzy also if the killer knows hollywood he could get to him first i dont believe this said schoelkopf maternal instincts the feet returned to the floor he looked ready to spit you want to solve a crime or mother some runaway a sickle of rage cut through petra a serene voice that couldnt possibly be hers said i want to be cautious sir all the more so if he is a witness schoelkopf waved her silent you talk about the killer like its an abstraction were dealing with ramfuckingsey youre telling me hes gonna find a runaway before we do gimme a break tell you what barb if youre worried about child welfare keep an eye on ramsey that might even work out to our benefit he goes after the kid we nab him just like on tv schoelkopfs laugh was metallic yeah thats definitely part of your assignment surveil ramsey who knows you could be a hero petras lungs felt wooden she tried to breathe tried not to show the effort so were using the boy as bait said stu and now petra heard the father of six speaking you too said schoelkopf were tracking down a potential witness to a homicide jesus i cant believe im having this discussion what the fuck have we talked about since the beginning of this case being careful what the fuck do you think will happen if the kid is righteous and we make no effort to find him dont waste any more of my time you two produced the lead now develop it fine said stu but if petra spends her time on surveillance our manpower on the rest of the case doesnt sound like too much else is going on with the case actually there is something those similars you told us to look for stu told him about ilse eggermann the search for karlheinz lauch schoelkopf hid his surprise with a satisfied smile so there you go okay you need more manpowerscuse me person power tell fournier hes on it too the kids already his anyway big bad burglar the three of you do some real work at the very least well keep the streets safe from refrigerator bandits fournier said what do i do with my other s ask him said stu you were the one complaining about no glory heres your chance yeah im the pineapple protector okay how do we divide it petra said im supposed to keep an eye on ramsey ive already interviewed him so recontacts are reasonable but hell if im going to sit outside the gates at ranchhaven all day fournier said dont blame you he palmed his shaven head she knew him casually had nothing against him stu said he was bright hope so she needed to educate him quickly she began fournier took notes stu was looking distracted again the final arrangement was petra would follow up on estrella flores and greg balch maybe take another shot at ramsey stu would stay with the eggermann case and fournier would contact hollywood juvey local shelters and crash pads try to find the boy before the last word was out of petras mouth stu got up and walked away fournier said he all right just a little tired said petra too much fun back at her desk she called missing persons at every lapd substation found several floreses but no estrella she copied down the two who were similar in age imelda sixtythree from east la and doris fiftynine from mar vista phoned their families came up negative same for the sheriffs bureaus what now had flores bolted back to the old country where was that mexico el salvador then she remembered something ramsey had told her greg balch had hired the new maid so maybe hed found flores too another reason to chat with ol greg but first she owed a call to ron banks to let him know the ramsey dv had gone down out of la county he was at his desk said oh hi havent gotten back to you because i havent found any complaints yet you wont she said i just found out ramsey has a second home in montecito ron the beating happened there something else she hadnt done yet follow up on that oh okay said banks thats carpinteria sheriffs he cleared his throat listen about last time asking you out i didnt mean to put you on the spot the last thing you need is distraction its okay ron thats nice of you to say but its fine ron really it was unprofessional my excuse is ive only been divorced a year not really good at this kind of thing and lets get together she said scarcely believing it silence youre sure i mean great i appreciate it you name it how about tonight where do you live granada hills but ill be coming from downtown so it doesnt matter do you like deli food i like anything how about katzs on fairfax say eight fantastic he almost sang the word she could do that to someone a sky full of stars the ocean roars louder than the zoo animals im at the beach under the pier smelling tar and salt cold even wrapped in the black plastic sheet wet sand all around but i found a dry patch near these big thick poles that hold up the pier i cant sleep watching and listening to the waves come in and out but i dont feel tired the ocean is black as the sheet little dots of moonlight drawing a slanted line across the water its cold much colder than in the park if i stay here ill need to get a real blanket a while ago some bentover guy walked by on the sand near the edge of the water just one guy on the empty beach and the way he walked clapping his hands together jumping up and down every few seconds i knew he was crazy when the sun comes out ill have to leave two nights ago i saw plyr kill that woman and now im here weird and i didnt even try it just happened i was weaving between sunset and side streets passing so many restaurants my nose was stuffed with food smells guys in red jackets parking cars people laughing my stomach was still full but my mouth started watering i had no idea where i was going to end up just knew i couldnt stand still i came to a part of sunset that looked fancier shinier people huge billboards advertising movies and clothes and liquor then more clubs more big fat guys standing in front of the door arms folded over their chests the club where it happened was called avoid on a dark corner next to a liquor store painted black with all these black rocks glued to the front the fat guy there smoked and looked bored no one was trying to get in a plastic sign over the door advertised the bands who were playing meat members elvis orgasm the stick figures the liquor store was open and a guy in a turban was sitting behind the register i thought about buying some gum taking other stuff but he looked suspicious at me when i stepped through the door so i left just then this tall skinny guy with really long fuzzy black hair and pimples came out of avoid carrying some drums ran over to a black van parked around the corner opened the back door and put the drums in the van was full of dents and scrapes stickers all over the side he didnt lock it he made two more trips and then he went back inside and stayed there he never locked it the fat guy had gone inside too i slid around the corner looked in the vans passenger window it had only front seats the rest was storage i opened the door no alarm rang all i found on the seat was junk candy wrappers empty cans and bottles pieces of paper maybe the radio if i could sell it how do you take one out then i heard voices and saw the skinny guy standing on the corner his back to the van talking to a short girl with yellow hair with a pink streak through the middle of it she mightve seen the van if she looked at it but she was paying attention to him it looked like they were arguing he turned too late to jump out i jumped in closed the door threw myself in back and hid behind the drums they were half covered by this thick sheet of black plastic and i got under it knocking my bones against metal it really hurt i had to bite my lip not to cry out the plastic was cold and smelled like bleach the back door opened again and the van shook as something landed near me slam another slam i heard the girls voice from up front you guys were hot bullshit no really i mean it wim we sucked and everyone knows we sucked so dont bullshit me did you bring my jacket uh sorry ill go back and get it shit get in there fast another open and slam cough fucking witch the motor went on and the metal floor beneath me started to vibrate and i tried to hold on to something so i wouldnt roll but the drums were round and i didnt want to make noise so i pressed against the floor like a spider the radio went on he tried a bunch of different channels said fuck this shit turned it off a rubbing sound then a click and i smelled something familiar weed back in the trailer i went to sleep with my nose full of it wondering if it would give me brain damage slam here you go honey do you know what that is lambskin from fucking mongolia or tibet or some place and those nailheads are like hammered by hand and put in by blind peasants who say special prayers or something i gave my fucking blood for that and you leave it in there shit im sorry wim they both smoked no one talked the motor was running and i was just pressing my fingers to the floor trying not to move or breathe wondering where this was going to take me no way out because the drums blocked the back door at least it was warm she said gimme another taste ah thats good shit hey dont give it a blow job give it back where you wanna go wim where europe where the fuck do you think home i need to crash you dont wanna go over to the whiskey fuck no why would i wanna do that you said remember huh before we left we were talking you know

and tonight we did fucking nothingman i cant believe how bad we sucked skootch was like braindead and that guy in the second row im pretty sure was maybe from geffen and he left early fuck im gonna die without being famous you will be fam shut the fuck up the van started moving going awhile south then turning right which meant west again wim drove angry speeding making sharp turns fast stops it took a while for the girl to talk again hey wim grunt wim what you said before whuh about not giving head to the joint but there are other joints right giggle yeah right i had a triumphant night and now im ready to be romantic just shut up and let me get us home i cant believe how bad we sucked after that no one talked at all i tried to follow each turn drawing a map in my head but with all those turns i lost track finally he stopped and i thought im cooked hes going to get his drums find me take his anger out on me i felt around under the plastic wanting something to swing with touched cold metal but it wouldnt come free totally cooked open slam footsteps that got softer disappeared i got out from under the plastic the van smelled like one big joint it was parked on a quiet street full of apartments i climbed into the front seat unrolled the window this could be anywhere maybe hed even taken me back to hollywood the air outside was cold so i crawled in back again managed to pull the black plastic sheet loose folded it tucked it under my arm returned to the front and got out a new smell salt a fishy salt once when i was little mom took me to the beach a long bus ride from watson i dont know exactly what beach it was and we never went back there but the sand was smooth and warm and she bought snowcones for both of us it was hot and dry and crowded and we stayed there all day me digging holes in the sand mom just sitting there in her bikini listening to the radio she didnt bring any sunscreen and we both got burned im lighter than her and got it worse turning blistery feeling like my whole body was on fire all the way back on the bus i screamed mom telling me to be quiet but not like she meant it she was pink as bubble gum knew the pain was real back in the trailer she tried to give me wine but i wouldnt take it the smell bothered me and even though i must have been only four or five id seen her drunk was afraid of alcohol she tried to force me pushing the bottle up against my lips and holding one of my hands down but i just kept twisting my head pretending my mouth was glued shut till finally she left me alone and i just lay there every inch of my body roasting while she finished the wine herself smelling the salt i remembered all that and more mom sitting on a towel her bikini was black maybe she was hoping some guy would notice her but no one did probably cause of me so here i was the beach nowhere to go after that still no answer at greg balchs office petra de cided to eyeball the place at pm she drove out of the station lot picking up cahuenga at franklin and taking it over the hill studio city was the valley but to her it had always seemed unvalleylike north of ventura boulevard the neighborhood was the usual grid of anonymous apartment tracts but to the south were pretty hills up to mulholland winding trails stilt houses that had survived the quake the commercial mix along ventura was a little shabby in spots some stripmall development but also plenty of antique shops recording studios sushi bars jazz clubs a few gay bars definitely funkier than the rest of the valley nothing avantgarde about players managements home base though the company occupied a dreary twostory box the color of chocolate milk set back from the street and fronted by a parking lot weeds whiskered through the asphalt gutters sagged stucco corners were chipped h carter ramsey wasnt much of a landlord balchs black lexus was the only vehicle in the lot so he was in not answering the phone orders from the boss to discourage the media she peeked inside the car empty two tenants took up the ground floor of the chocolate cube a travel agency sporting the green tree flag of lebanon and advertising discount flights to the middle east and a wholesaletothepublic beautysupply store both closed rusting open steps on the right side climbed to a cement walkway and three mustardcolored doors were in need of refinishing suite a housed easy construction inc b was something called la darcy hair removal and tucked in back was players management no windows on the west wall oppressive she knocked got no answer knocked again and balch opened he was wearing a black zipup velvet sweat suit with white piping and looked genuinely surprised to see her odd ramsey had to have called him maybe he was an actor too hi he offered a soft hand cmon in detective conners was it connor he held the door for her the suite consisted of two lowceilinged rooms connected by a door now open the rear space looked bigger messy piles of paper all over the cheap green carpet takeout cartons the front room was furnished with a gold couch and a scruffy oak desk piled with yet more paper flagrantly grained fake rosewood walls were covered with photographs mostly blackandwhites the kind you saw at every dry cleaners in town big airbrushed smiles of stars and hasbeens dubious autographs but only one celeb in these ramsey as cowboy police officer soldier roman centurion an especially ludicrous shot of young h cart decked out like some kind of space alien plastic body suit armored by exaggerated pecs rubberylooking antennae protruding from his puffy sixties moptop no mustache wide white hireme smile a passing resemblance to sean connery the guy had been a looker a color photo at the top showed ramsey decades later dressed in a nifty sport jacket turtleneck looking flinty striking an action pose with a mm dack price the adjustor she should probably watch the damn show she was about to enter the back office when she noticed something that confirmed her guess about balch as performer at the bottom of the wall half hidden by the desk low man in the exhibit not a coincidence she was willing to bet balch in his twenties hed been decentlooking too a good fifty pounds lighter sunblond nicely defined muscles like a hero in one of those beach movies she used to watch for laughs tab hunter or troy donahue but even in his youth the business manager had worn a dull subservient smile that robbed him of star quality antiques said balch sounding selfconscious you know youre old when you dont recognize yourself anymore so you acted too not really i should take that stuff down the sweats were tight around his paunch baggy at the seat new white sneakers now that she had a good look she could see that his thin waxy hair was a mixture of blond and white pink scalp peeked through can i get you some coffee he indicated the rear office stood by the door waiting for her to enter no thanks she stepped in finally a couple of windows but they were covered by chenille drapes the color of old newspaper no natural lighting and the single desk lamp balch had on didnt do much to pierce the gloom the clutter was monumental papers on the floor chairs crowding another cheap desk bigger lshaped ledgers tax manuals corporate prospectuses government forms on the shorter arm of the desk was a white plastic coffeemaker spotted with brown kentucky fried chicken box in a corner grease stains on the underside of the open lid a glimpse of breaded fowl total slob maybe thats why ramsey maintained him in lowrent circumstances or maybe that was the essence of their relationship all those years playing lackey could she wedge the guy he did live in rolling hills estates very pricey so ramsey paid well for loyalty balch cleared an armchair for her tossing papers into a corner and sat behind the desk hands laced on his belly so hows it going the investigation its going petra smiled do you have any information that might help me mr balch me wish i did i still cant get over it his lower jaw shifted from side to side lisa was a nice girl little hottempered but basically a great person hottempered listen i know youve heard about cart hitting her all that stuff on tv but it only happened once not that im excusing it it was wrong but lisa had a temper she went off on him all the time trying to blame the victim to excuse the boss did he realize he was offering a motive for the bosss rage so she had a tendency to criticize mr ramsey balch touched his mouth his eyes had gotten small im not saying they didnt get along they loved each other all im saying is lisa could be that i can see her forget it what do i know im just talking you can see her getting someone pretty angry anyone can get anyone angry that has nothing to do with what happened this is obviously some kind of maniac why do you say that mr balch the way it it was done totally insane balchs hand rose to his forehead rubbing as if trying to erase a headache carts devastated how long have you and cart known each other we grew up together upstate new york went to high school and college together at syracuse played football he was the quarterback damn good one scouted by the pros but he tore his hamstring at the end of the senior season and you offensive lineman protecting the quarterback so you go back a long ways balch smiled centuries before your time did you come out to hollywood together yup after graduation one of those lastfling things before we settled down also to cheer cart up he was pretty upset about losing out on the nfl his dad owned a hardware store and wanted cart to take it over and he thought hed probably do that and you me surprised that she cared i had a business degree some offers from accounting firms figured eventually id get a cpa petra gazed around at the sty he called an office werent bean counters supposed to be organized so what led you to acting balch stroked the top of his pale head it was one of those weird things not exactly lana turner at schwabs are you old enough to know about that sure said petra knowing it from her father the honeymoon he and his bride had taken to california kenneth connor had loved la saw it as an anthropologists dream look at me now dad hobnobbing with the nevergreats working the industry you and cart were both discovered she said balch smiled again no cart was it was right out of a script we were a few days from going back to syracuse having a couple of beers at trader vics over at the beverly hilton this was before merv owned it anyway some guy comes over and says ive been watching you two finelooking young men would you like parts in a movie and gives us his card were thinking its got to be a scam or maybe hes a que some gay guy hustling but the next morning cart pulls out the card and says hey lets call for the hell of it cause we were gonna go home and get jobs why not be adventurous turns out it was for real a casting agency we went down and auditioned both got parts not that it was any big deal not even a b movie more like d a western straight to the dixie drivein circuit balch moved papers around atop his desk making no impact on the clutter anyway one thing led to another and we decided to stay in la got a few more jobs over the next year nonunion stuff barely enough to make the rent then i didnt get any more calls but cart started getting lots better ones then an agent and he was making some decent money mostly in westerns i decided to go home it was winter almost christmas i remember thinking my folks were already mad at me for taking the year off what would christmas dinner be like so you lost faith in hollywood balch smiled it wasnt a matter of faith i wasnt qualified didnt have the talent to make it never got speaking parts just crowd fillers walkthroughs that kind of thing couldnt find any accounting jobs and id blown all my job offers back east but i figured something would turn up then cart asked me to stay said it would be fun we could continue to hang out hed find me something and he did bookkeeping gig at warner brothers he spread his arms smiled again and thats the whole glamorous story when did you start managing carts business soon as he began making serious bucks hed seen what unscrupulous managers could do wanted someone he could trust by then i was working in business affairs at abc knew something about the industry do you manage anyone else balch shifted his weight smoothed out a black velvet fold of sweatshirt i do a few favors for people facilitate a deal now and then but carts investments keep me busy so hes done pretty well hes earned it spoken like a true lineman so you handle his contracts hes got an entertainment lawyer but yeah i vet things what else do you do for him prepare his taxes keep track of things were diversified real estate securities the usual theres some property management it keeps me busy anything else i can do for you just what youre doing said petra filling in personal details about cart cart lisa anything as if the matter required great contemplation balch closed his eyes opened them the hands were back on his middle blond buddha cart and lisa he said very softly is a very sad story he really flipped for her felt embarrassed about it the age difference i told him it didnt matter he was in better shape than guys half his age and lisa was crazy about him i thought they were the best thing ever happened to each other a pained expression crossed his puffy face i really dont know what happened marriage is tough the eyes opened been there twice whos to say what makes people tick petra produced her pad and balch moved back a bit as if repulsed by that bit of procedure if you could please give me the timetable for sunday the trip to tahoe and after you got back as precisely as possible timetable sure his story matched ramseys and that of the pilot marionfeldt detail for detail the tahoe trip nonstop business uneventful flight back both men asleep before pm waking up exercising showering eating breakfast putting golf balls pleasant dreams during the time lisa had been murdered petra said okay thanks by the way i was just curious why you call your company players management oh that balch let out a snortlaugh football days we were amateurs looking for something catchy and anonymous no mention of carts name i came up with it petra wondered if that was all of it in the industry players were those with power had he dreamed of that once so your job she said is protecting carts interest what did you do after lisa went public with the domestic violence incident what was there to do the damage was already done you didnt ask her not to go public again i wanted to but cart said no it was personal not business i disagreed whys that this town personal and business sometimes cant be separated but thats what cart wanted so i listened flipping pages petra said so you pay all of carts bills they go through me yes including lisas spousal support yup theres an example of the kind of guy cart is lisas lawyer made an outrageous request theyd only been married for a little over a year id been through it twice had a pretty good idea what shed settle for but cart said no negotiation give it to her frowning now resentful jealous so hes pretty generous said petra exactly he stood up now if you dont mind its a little late sure said petra smiling and rising too he waited by the door again and as she passed close she smelled him heavy fruity cologne and sweat out in the front room she said oh one more thing carts maid estrella flores any idea where she went cart told me she quit without notice hows that for loyalty i got him a new girl through the same agency yup remember the name of the agency some place in beverly hills the nancy downey agency he shot a cuff and looked at his watch i appreciate your time mr balch before she left the office she glanced at the wall of photos two young guys striking poses players next to the pictures balch did look old she drove to a gas station pay phone got the num ber of the nancy downey agency and called it though it was well past business hours no machine something to wake up for tomorrow taking laurel canyon back to the city she reviewed the interview with balch nothing dramatic but he had provided a possible lead to estrella flores and had offered evidence of friction between lisa and ramsey she went off on him all the time consistent with what kelly sposito had said about lisas sarcasm impotent exhubby sharptongued wife ramsey said she had a habit of shoving him had she finally pushed him too far how much did balch know had he heard ramsey leave the house during the earlymorning hours go into the car museum and pull out the mercedes or the jeep how far would the lineman go to protect the quarterback players actors what was real what was scripted time to talk to the night guard whod been on shift sunday then she thought of something ranchhaven a place that big smack in the fire zone thered have to be a second way out for safety if so was it guarded too or was there some way for residents to exit without tipping off the security staff too many question marks not quizzing the guard right away had been amateurish she felt like a blind painter was it worth a ride out to calabasas right now shed been going all day and if she didnt let go of it she wouldnt sleep and wouldnt that be pretty one groggy impaired d mucking things up further tomorrow morning her artwork would appear all over the news and leads about the boy in the park would start pouring in most of them useless the whole thing was a distraction and something about the boys eyes bothered her hed already seen plenty she didnt even want to think about an elevenyearold witnessing something like that she thought about him eating dinner alone in griffith park reading stealing books pathetic but charming enough go home et soak in tub eat sandwich oh jesus she couldnt go home the eight oclock appointment with ron banks what had possessed her to do that she zipped across sunset and checked her watch seven fortysix barely enough time to get to katzs let alone freshen up and change the guy would be forced to stare across the table at a hag big deal this was no real date what was it then she made it at three minutes to paid for parking in a nearby lot and walked into katzs cornedbeef air greeted with a wide false smile by a dyspeptic waitress who remembered her cop tips she took a booth toward the back ordered a coke headed for the ladies room to wash up in front of a soapspecked mirror she fluffed her hair and disapproved of her face definitely haggard every bone showing paler than usual too and something seemed to be tugging her mouth down some cruel god sketching in the wrinkles that would soon be engraved there at least the black pantsuit of the day was holding up okay lets hear it for viscose when she returned the drink was there and banks was walking through the front door she waved him over he smiled and sat down good to see you again his hands settled on the table fingers drumming unfolding the paper napkin he placed it on his lap his hands kept moving hit much traffic coming over she said not bad he looked different a stranger as opposed to she was sitting across from a stranger an uncomfortable stranger look at those hands straining for conversation when a hot bath would have proved celestial the waitress brought a bowl of sourpickle slices and petra took one defining the ground rules right from the start garlic on the breath dont think of getting close that seemed to relax banks and he reached for one too these are great he said never been here good place sometimes i go to langers on alvarado people are getting shot over at macarthur park and theyre still lining up for pastrami at langers been there said petra im kind of a deli freak no cholesterol worries good genetics she said cholesterolwise anyway he laughed why did he look so different younger even more boyish than at ramseys house despite being dressed more formally navy doublebreasted suit pale blue shirt maroon tie nice had he somehow found time to spruce up then she realized what the difference was the mustache was gone she remembered it as a smallish blondgray thing no big soupstrainer like his partners but its absence made a difference no gray in his head hair losing the stache took off years he had a pleasant face a little narrow the nose a little offcenter but the eyes were well placed hazel long lashes the now exposed mouth yielding but not in a weak way hairless hands young skin she saw him as someone whod gone through puberty late would preserve well the mouth turned up slightly at the corners a perpetual smile that might have gotten him into trouble as a schoolboy banks stop smirking she realized she was staring touched her upper lip and arched an eyebrow got rid of it last night he said almost apologetic it was an experiment my daughters didnt like it said it tickled i shaved it off right in front of them they thought it was hilarious how many daughters do you have two theyre five and six knowing hed carry pictures she asked if he had any as a matter of fact he said pulling several from his wallet two pretty little things both darkhaired but with fair skin somewhat latinalooking big brown eyes long hair styled into ringlets identical pink frothy dresses no obvious resemblance to banks though she thought she saw something in the younger ones smile totally adorable what are their names the older ones alicia and the babys beatrix we call her bee or honeybee a and b someone liked order she handed the photos back to him and he took a peek before slipping them behind his credit cards the waitress stomped over and asked if they were ready petra knew what she wanted but she picked up her menu to give him time the waitresss foot tapped i can come back no i think were okay ill take the pastramicoleslaw combo with fries and you banks said smoked turkey on a kaiser roll potato salad something to drink coffee alone again she said how often do you get to be with them they live with me oh their moms spanish from spain she trains horses teaches riding she went back to work at a resort in majorca and gave me custody she visits every few months is still trying to figure out where shes going to live must be tough said petra it is im trying to tell them mommy loves them cares about them but what they know is she isnt there its been really tough i just got them into therapy hopefully itll help most cops ran from anything psychiatric unless they were filing for disability bankss easy admission interested her she watched him eat another pickle narrow hands the free one continued to drum the fingers long but sturdy impeccable nails he chewed slowly everything about him seemed slow and deliberate except the hands all his tension filtered down to his fingertips she was always after me to grow a mustache my ex said it was muy macho he laughed so after shes gone i do it guess a therapist would have something to say about that anyway shes still trying to find herself hopefully she will soon how longs it been final decree was just over a year ago im able to feel sorry for her now see her as someone with serious problems but oh by the way i talked to the carpinteria sheriff and he said lisa ramsey never filed any dv complaint on ramsey there either theyve got no calls to the house period whiplash change of subject he knew it and blushed and petra groped for a way to rescue him the waitress solved that problem setting down his coffee hard enough to slosh the saucer and barking your foods coming up she hurried off and petra said thanks for checking ron least i could do the two of them worked on their drinks the restaurant was almost full the usual mixture of soupsipping old folk and genx depressives showing they didnt care about dietary fat behind the stocked case countermen sliced and wrapped and cracked jokes the briny aromas of herring and cured meat and stuffed derma yielding to sweetness as fresh rye loaves came out of the kitchen on steel trays suddenly petra felt hungry a little more relaxed how about you said banks been married divorced two and a half years ago no kids getting that out of the way before he could ask so youve got them fulltime must be challenging my mom helps out picks them up from school and babysits when i have to work late theyre great girls sweet smart into sports alicia does soccer gives the boys a run bees not sure if she likes soccer or tball but shes pretty coordinated sports dad her father had gone that route with all five kids football for the boys softball for petra every sunday into a hideous uniform she hated the entire experience faked enthusiasm to please him stuck with it for three summers years later he told her shed done him a big favor quitting hed yearned for some free time on weekends single father was that why shed gotten together with banks he seemed so unguarded what was he doing as a cop she asked him how he got into law enforcement my dad was a fireman it was either that or police work he said always wanted one of the two i dont want to sound chauvinistic but why the sheriffs and not lapd he grinned wanted to do real police work seriously back then lulu my ex was talking about opening up her own equestrian school one day we figured wed be living somewhere unincorporated so i applied to the sheriff how about you she gave him a very spare version of the artisttodetective transition he said you paint beatrix is kind of artistic or at least she seems that way to me her mom tried to do pottery ive still got the wheel at home just sitting there as a matter of fact want it no thanks ron youre sure it seems a waste i appreciate the offer but i just paint oh okay what kinds of things do you paint anything and you actually did it professionally i wasnt exactly rembrandt still you must be good she gave him a rundown of her ad agency days her mouth running while her brain thought how cute each of us shifting the focus to the other in her case defensiveness but banks seemed really interested in her polar opposite of nick all the other men shed dated since nick artists then cops even when they talked about you it was really just a ploy to get it back to me me me this one seemed different or was she just flattering herself she ended her recitation like i said no big deal still he said its tough making any kind of living creatively i had an uncle did some sculpture could never make a dime ah here comes the food whoa look at those portions he ate slowly and that prevented petra from wolfing good influence detective banks in between bites they chatted about work dry stuff benefits insurance the usual gripes comparing blue and tan bureaucracies goodnatured kidding about intramural sports competitions finding more common ground than differences she noticed he wasnt wearing his gun when their sandwiches were gone they each ordered apple pie à la mode petra finished hers first tried idly to pick up crumbs with the tines of her fork you like to eat said banks thank god the fork paused midair she put it down he blushed again i no offense what i mean is i think thats great seriously it sure doesnt show at least as far as i can he shook his head oh lord i am not good at this she found herself laughing its okay ron yes i do have a healthy appetite when i remember to sit down for a meal he continued to shake his head wiped his mouth with his napkin folded it neatly and placed it next to his plate whatever i just gargled out please take it as a compliment so taken said petra youre saying love of foods a healthy thing exactly too many girls these days get crazy about food i think about that because i have daughters my ex always bugged them obsessed with being skinny he stopped himself again not too cool bringing her up every minute hey she was a big part of your life its normal implying that shed done the same with nick but she hadnt shed never talked about him to anyone was he said past tense he raised one hand and sliced air vertically so hows the case coming not too brilliantly she talked about it without giving him details liking him but not forgetting that he was nonlapd he said situations like that publicity no way you can do your job properly ever have one like that once in a while touching his napkin he looked away wary too once in a while she echoed you know us country bumpkin lawmen runnin down rustlers protectin the pony express ah said petra anything id have heard about well he said hector and i did do some work on the county gen slasher megacase three years ago wacko killer cutting up nurses on the grounds of the county hospital four victims in three months the bad guy turned out to be an orderly whod served time for rape and assault hed faked his way through personnel screening worked the surgical floors of all things before he was caught the nurses had threatened to strike that was yours hectors and mine now im impressed believe me it was no big sherlock he said everything pointed to an insider it was just a matter of flipping paper checking time cards eliminating negatives till we found the positive petra remembered the feminist frustration media noise hadnt there been an initial task force were you on it from the beginning he blushed again no they called us in after a few months so you two are rescuers sometimes he said and sometimes we get rescued you know how it is what she knew was that the county gen slasher was a major case and that he was a rescuer top dog and thats who the sheriff had sent for the notification call to ramsey why was he being so cagey about it modest or sent by the tans to pump her for details any ideas on ramsey she said like i said at his house the guy rang my bell but im not a big one for bells he smiled give me time cards anytime she smiled back he drummed the table rubbed the spot where his mustache had been the waitress gave him the check and over petras protests he insisted on paying for it hey you put up with me you deserve a sandwich nothing to put up with she heard herself say they left the deli and he walked her to her car a warm night still a bit of foot traffic on fairfax and the newsstand across the street was crowded with browsers the food smells from katzs followed them he didnt walk close to her seemed to be consciously avoiding it so he said when they got to the ford this was great i is there some place youd like to go if youre not too tired i mean maybe some music are you into music im a little bushed ron the crushed look on his face said the evening was personal nothing to do with the case and she felt bad for suspecting him sure he said youd have to be he held out his hand and they shook briefly thanks a lot petra i really appreciate it had a man ever thanked her before just for spending time thank you ron he tilted forward as if ready to kiss her then rocked back gave a small salutelike wave and turned hands in pockets what kind of music do you like she said figuring country it had to be traditional country he stopped faced her again shrugged mostly rock old stuff blues steve miller doobie brothers used to play that kind of stuff in a band really she fought a giggle did you have long hair long enough he said walking back to her dont get me wrong we werent professionals i mean we did a few club dates played the whiskey way back when thats where i met my clamping a hand over his mouth sure said petra laughing and not just her right you met tons of babes thats why you joined a band in the first place dont tell me drums those active hands you got it drummers always get the girls right dont ask me said banks i was always too busy trying to keep the beat still play not for years my old kits rusting in the garage along with the potters wheel bikes probably piles of old toys kid stuff heaven knew what else petra pictured a small house full of levitz furniture far cry from the horse ranch that had never materialized so where do you go to listen to music she said used to go to the country club in reseda its not a country place its rock i know where it is oh sorry what about this side of the hill she said dont know he said dont go out much the admission embarrassed him and he looked at his watch need to get back she said no theyre asleep by now i called them before i left my moms staying over i just want to phone make sure everythings okay call from my place she said its not far from here thinking hed told his mother hed be late big plans or blind optimism for some reason she didnt care while he talked to his mother she fixed her makeup thankfully the apartment was in decent shape shed barely lived in it since the case broke she invited him to take off his jacket and hung it up standing in the kitchen they each had a glass of red wine he complimented her decor at his insistence she showed him her art not the works in progress her old portfolio color blowups of pictures shed sold through the coop gallery he was impressed didnt try to touch her they moved to the living room and went through her small cd collection trying to find something they both owned coming up only with eric claptons derek and the dominos sitting two feet apart on petras couch they listened to half the album then his hand shifted six inches closer to hers and remained there she covered her half of the distance and their fingers touched then entwined sweaty hands but neither of them dared wipe she found herself gripping his knuckles too hard and reduced the pressure he breathed faster but didnt move during bell bottom blues he tilted his head toward her and they kissed closedmouthed mutual garlic for what seemed like a long time then a wide open exploration full of clicking teeth and swirling tongues hands on back of neck soft lips he had very soft lips she was glad the mustache was gone when they broke they were both robbed of air he was ready for more but the hunger in his eyes shook petra and she pulled away they listened to the rest of the song sitting still holding hands again she was wet her nipples ached her body demanded loving but she didnt want it not with him not now one more song and she got up to use the bathroom when she returned he was standing jacket on she sat down again an invitation but he remained on his feet in front of her reaching down to touch her hair her cheek her chin she looked up saw his bottom teeth pinching his upper lip she was trembling now and had he tried again who knew what would have happened he just stood there she got up put her arm in his and walked him to the door he said id really like to see you again more confidence in his voice but still unsure id like that too a half hour later alone in her bed naked having touched herself and bathed someones latenight tv squeaking through the darkness she thought of everything she needed to do in the morning the sun comes up behind me orange brighter than in the park no trees to cover it the ocean is roaring gray the black plastics too thin im cold no ones out on the beach yet so i just lie there watching the sun and the few cars up on the coast highway going back and forth the thick poles that hold up the pier are black with tar and crusted with barnacles i see one thats open reach over and poke it and it closes the jacques cousteau book had a chapter about barnacles they stay where they are eat whatever floats by they make their own glue and its as good as krazy glue sometimes theyre impossible to move okay now its warming up a little i better move i get up and shake the sand out of my hair fold the plastic and tuck it behind one of the poles using a rock to weigh it down time to get some new stuff food money a hat i remember that sunburn maybe some sunscreen too where should i go should i leave la not up north cause thats closer to watson down south like to san diego but what if that doesnt work out the next stop would be mexico and theres no way im going to any foreign country if i stay in la where will i hide i think about it for a long time and get really scared same feeling like when i watched plyr i need to stop thinking about that its stupid to even be thinking of a plan i have no future even if i survive for a few months a year two years so what id still be a kid no schooling no money no control over anything still no one out on the beach it looks so tan and peaceful the ocean too gray as steel except where the tide comes rolling in throwing up spray like spitting at the sky spitting at god wouldnt it be nice to just walk into the water let yourself be carried away maybe youd drown or maybe thered be a miracle and youd wash up like one of those bottles with a message in it on some island with palm trees girls wearing just grass skirts long black hair down to their butts and youd come out of the ocean like some god and theyd be all thrilled to see you fight with each other to be your girlfriend take care of you feed you some barbecued pig with an apple in its mouth and fruit that they just pick from the trees no one has to work either way no worries i get up walk across the beach to the tide line roll my pants up and stand there let the waves trickle over my toes cold my feet get numb and they look like white wax how long would it take before you stopped feeling cold before your body stopped feeling anything i read in a nature book that gazelles and wildebeest chased by lions stop feeling pain so their death becomes easier that didnt happen to me with the pervs so maybe its just animals or maybe i just didnt get close enough if you didnt feel or worry you could just give yourself up like some sacrifice like jesus did i must have walked because now im in the water up to my knees and my pants are getting wet and kind of ballooning and swirling around not so cold anymore it feels clean i keep going the waters sloshing against my belt and i stand there and look across the ocean maybe ill see a boat or a whale spouting a few birds are out there flying around diving i take another step just one but it makes a big difference the ground drops out from under me and all of a sudden im up to my neck trying to step back but i cant get a hold on to anything and now i feel the water moving under me and im in over my head swallowing water choking up again i can see the top of the water the beach is getting smaller i start to swim but it doesnt help somethings pushing me forward i have no control start kicking waving my arms around knowing this is stupid you have to stay calm stay calm but im being pushed out forced i dont want this im tiny weaker than a barnacle because i have no glue why am i thinking about mom now how bad shell feel so cold my eyes burn my throat burns my eyes got to keep them open but ohnocantkeepmyheadabov up in the air again coughing spitting eyes burning throat hurts like a knife scraping it and im still being carried out by the no the beach is getting closer the ocean tosses me up the sand gets even closer releasing me like jonah no no here i go under again swallowing so much water i think ill explode then up coughing vomiting rocks in the water hitting me stinging the ocean playing with me which way will it throw me now stones scraping the bottom of my body the ground sand back on shore sand sticks to my soaked clothes salt in the scratches makes them burn i roll away from the water safe another chance god or did even the ocean think i was trash spit me back like bad food i hurry back toward the pier still coughing and spitting up salt water collapse stay there trying to get a little sun dry out a few people are out on the beach now i just mind my own business after an hour im drier but still wet my chest hurts and im scratched up by the sand but im here i need to concentrate money and a hat some food sunscreen mostly dry i take a walk up to the pier theres a ferris wheel some bumper cars and a merrygoround but theyre all shut and locked and theres nothing to take there a few restaurants but theyre closed too and the only food around is dry bits of popcorn stuck to the floor all the way at the end of the pier is a bait shack thats open some dirtylooking guy behind a counter and big white bathtubtype tanks full of anchovies some of them already dead and floating to the top a few people are fishing mostly old chinese guys and a few black guys no ones catching anything everyone looks bored the two garbage cans i find are full of fish guts and they stink so bad i almost puke i leave the pier up above the beach is a street full of fancylooking restaurants and hotels nothing there for me north is a small park with some old people and homeless guys and if you keep looking the street just seems to disappear all those trees too much like youknowwhere so i walk south and things start to look a little more familiar motels and apartment buildings weirdos who could be from the boulevard i find half a doughnut on the street and it looks okay so i eat it next block i see part of a twix bar left on the sidewalk but its too melted and grosslooking and i only eat a small bit of it a while later a sign says im in venice small houses people lots of mexicans i walk down a street at the end is the ocean again and soon im on this big wide path called ocean front walk like a giant sidewalk the ocean on one side stores on the other all sorts of people punks blacks beautiful bikinigirls on roller skates their butt cheeks hanging out guys looking at them young guys like college students old people sitting on benches bikers with tattoos lots of big meanlooking dogs some arnold schwarzeneggertype guys are exercising in these fencedoff areas their bodies all greased up so the muscles look like grapefruit trying to burst through the skin lifting weights rubbing chalk on their hands being huge and cool showing off the stores here are mostly small and cheaplooking fast food stands selling ice cream cold drinks sunglasses souvenirs postcards tshirts bathing suits hats that say california or malibu or venice id love some dry clothing but there are too many people around to take something still this might be a good place to hang out see what happens later i decide to walk from one end of ocean front to the other see what turns up halfway down i see a little gray building with a sixpointed star over the door a jewish star i know that from my history book the chapter the middle east birth of civilization a jewish church what do they call them synagons i go over jewish letters next to the door then english ones over the door it says congregation beth torah this might be good the jews always have money at least thats what moron used to say hed go off on how they were all fucking bankers sucking the blood out of the country killing jesus and now they wanted to take our money too like he ever had money then i think why would he be right he was wrong about everything else but still whats a church doing in the middle of all these businesses unless theyre out to make money it wasnt just moron mom used to agree with him say cowboy they really got a talent for making money must be in the blood you stupid bitch he laughed it aint talent its cause they cheat us fucking zog know what that is zionist occupation government they want to take us over not even human come from the devil fucking a snake didja know that the aryan race is the bona fide chosen people that night i was sitting at the kitchen table trying to study the civil war but then mom started telling a story and i listened about some rich jewish family who owned a big strawberry farm down near oxnard her parents and her used to pick there when she was a kid how the jews had a big white twostory house and a cadillac fucking bloodsuckers moron said actually they was okay kinda nice she started but he looked at her and she said except they sure loved their money the wife always dressed like she was going out to dinner and she was just a farm wife and here was this big house maybe it was even three stories buncha tv antennas all over the roof but we slept in these little migrant shacks kerosene heaters fucking a even if its mostly lies sometimes lies have some truth and i dont need thousands of jewish dollars just some spare change a sign next to the synagon door says prayers will be held on friday night and that the time for lighting candles is pm whatever that means no ones looking i try the door locked the next place over is called cafe eats and its closed too theres a space between the church and cafe eats i slip around to the back where theres an alley parked cars but none driving two spaces behind the synagon but no cars theyre praying friday night thats tomorrow i check out the back door plain wood with some little wooden thing nailed to the frame on the right side also with a jewish star probably some kind of goodluck charm maybe asking god for money the back doors locked too right next to it is a window a small one too small for a man to fit through but not for me a screen over it just like at the pineapple house also like that one it comes right off i dont have to break this window its loose when i push up on it it jiggles so i shove harder and feel it give some more then something pops and it slams open and i look up and down the alley still no one im in im getting good at this the room i land in is a bathroom small but clean a toilet a sink and a mirror no shower the mirror tells me i dont look as bad as i thought just the scratches on my face and some white crust around my ears and my lips i wash it off use the toilet considering i almost drowned i look pretty good i thank god in case it was him wash my hands now lets find some jewish money petra awoke confused at her head crowded with ron banks estrella flores ramsey the boy with the presidents book she wrapped herself in a robe and collected the morning paper there it was page the drawing smack in the center of the article no credit given to the artist the gist of the article was no progress the implication those bumbling police salmagundi the department spokesman careful not to make too big a deal about the witness angle the boy was just one of several leads were looking into the last paragraph made her inhale sharply twentyfivethousanddollar reward to anyone providing information about the boy or anything else that led to the arrest of a suspect money put up by dr and mrs john everett boehlinger all calls to be directed to hollywood detectives her extension blindsided they must have gone through schoelkopf goddamn him she couldnt work this way all day fielding crank calls had stu seen it yet normally shed call him nothing was normal anymore she got dressed in the first thing she pulled out of the closet took the paper with her and drove much too fast to the station there were already ten messages on her desk nine sightings of the boy and a psychic from fontana claiming to know whod murdered lisa what would the afternoon bring stu hadnt come in yet to hell with him fournier was checked out too she stormed into schoelkopfs office waving the article he was sitting at his desk jumped up and jabbed a finger at her dont get all pissy with me the parents blew into town yesterday went straight to deputy chief lazara he calls me at ten pm i have to come down here to deal with them the fathers an obvious asshole used to having his way who knows what hell try to do next i tried to warn you idiot and you brushed me off you couldve called me said petra i couldve bought microsoft at ten bucks whats the point barbie the nickname had never bothered her now it was a razor scraping raw nerve fiber the point is the point is ive been running interference on this for you from day one and youve produced squat i get yanked out of bed get dirty looks from lazara because hes working late he cuts out leaves me with mommy boohooing daddy delivering these fucking speeches after menendez and oj everyone knows lapd cant find a felon in the penitentiary so i give him what ive got which is this artwork of yours figuring maybe itll calm him down he says okay what are you doing about it and i say were looking for him mr boehlinger and he says doctor boehlinger then he tells me its not enough he wants some incentives here post a reward i try to explain that rewards bring in mostly nuts and even if we wanted to do that it would take time he picks up my phone calls some lawyer named hack and says talk to your buddy at the times and your other buddies at the tv stations showing me this hacks connected which he obviously is it was already eleven and he got the picture in so sue me i didnt wake you up at midnight you think youve got a grievance file a complaint meanwhile go do your job he waved her out a tv cop would have handed in the badge and gun a real cop kept her mouth shut she liked the job and the department was paramilitary would always be meaning lockstep rhythm death of the individual hierarchies you pissed down not up look at milo sturgis shed worked with the gay detective on one case had seen him as the ace he was but before that shed heard only curses affixed to his name the highest solve rate in west la to the department that didnt make up for sleeping with a man she returned to her desk put aside the ten message slips and phoned the nancy downey agency in beverly hills a woman with a latin accent said you should talk to mr sanchez hes at our other office in san marino san marino and bh covering the highpriced spreads east and west a man answered there similar accent mr sanchez yes she identified herself told him she was looking for estrella flores i am too pardon i just got a call from her son in el salvador hes worried hasnt heard from her since sunday is this about mrs ramseys murder wed just like to talk to her sir whys the son worried usually she calls him two three times a week he said he phoned the ramsey house but got only a machine i tried the same thing happened to me i left a message but no ones called me back mrs flores quit working for mr ramsey sir when the day after the murder oh so she didnt call you about another placement no sanchez sounded concerned any ideas where she might be sir no im sorry she worked for the ramseys for hold on let me look here it is two years never complained where did she work before that before that i couldnt tell you wariness had crept into his voice she wasnt legal when she came to us she was legal at least she presented papers we do our best to mr sanchez i have no interest in immigration issues even if you did detective we have nothing to hide our women are all legal we place them in the finest homes and there must never be a hint of of course said petra please give me mrs floress sons name and number javier he said reciting an address on santa cristina in san salvador and a number hes a lawyer you dont know of any other places she worked she told us she worked for a family in brentwood but only for three months no name she didnt want to use them as references because they were immoral immoral in what way sir i think it was something to do with drinking mrs flores is a very moral woman petra hung up thought about the maids disappearance if flores had left of her own accord why hadnt she contacted her son it didnt take much morality to be repulsed by murder had she seen something or been seen where to go with it more calls to substations to see if flores had turned up somewhere as a victim unlikely if shed been eliminated by ramsey because she could blow his alibi hed have made sure to conceal the body better to scope out ranchhaven talk to the guard service ask longoverdue questions while she was there she could drop in on ramsey again slip in some hints about flores see how he reacted wil fournier appeared in the squad room door beckoning her with a wiggling finger he looked angry something to do with the boy she hurried over whats up got some people cant wait to meet you he angled his head down the hall petra looked out and saw a couple in their fifties standing at the far end well dressed backs to each other the parents none other said fournier schoelkopf snagged me as i came in said they wanted a firsthand report from all three of us wheres ken dont know her tone made him stare what exactly do they want info got any nope how about you talked to a few shelters churches some of our juvey people no one knows the kid a couple of social workers thought they mightve seen him around but he hasnt checked in anywhere outdoor kid said petra thinking what guts it took for an elevenyearold to go it alone in the park lets go do some handholding said fournier female d and a coalcolored one these people look like the type who still think lawn jockeys are funny mrs boehlinger was everything petra expected petite perfectly groomed handsome longsuffering pat nixon handsomeness a puff of coldwaved hair the color of dry champagne crowned a roundish face contoured eyebrows trim figure in a conservatively cut black st johns knits suit black suede pumps and purse red eyes her husband defeated expectation petra had pictured a big man hearty someone like ramsey dr john everett boehlinger was fivefive pounds tops with narrow shoulders and a homely face full of homely features fat nose small dark eyes rubbermask looseness around the jowls bald on top thin fringe of gray at the sides a clipped stainless steel goatee he could have played freud in the country club halloween bash he wore a black vested suit white shirt gray tie printed with tiny black dots white silk hankie in the breast pocket onyx cuff links captip shoes were polished shiny as motor oil two small people in funeral garb mrs boehlinger remained focused on the wall in front of her clenching and unclenching one hand the other gripped her purse her french nails were glossy but chipped she still had her back to her husband didnt look up as petra and fournier approached dr boehlinger had focused on them immediately body canted forward as if ready to spar when they were ten feet away he said to petra youre the one i spoke to on the phone yes sir detective connor she extended her hand and he submitted to a half second of skin contact before withdrawing wiping his hand on his suit oh for gods sake the she reminded herself the poor mans lost his child nothing worse than that nothing he said vivian and his wife turned slowly ravaged eyes the corneas a scramble of ruptured capillaries the irises bright blue like lisas there was more than a suggestion of lisa in the fine facial structure would lisa have ended up like this a fashionable matron buttoned to the neck all propriety detective connor vivian the doctor singsonged scoldingly vivian boehlingers expression said so what the hell am i supposed to do about it she said pleased to meet you and profferred an icy hand petra smiled and this is detective fournier weve already met detective fournier said dr boehlinger wheres the third one bishop out in the field said petra out in the field sounds like hes planting vegetables actually sir said fournier its kind of like that we cultivate leads wonderful said boehlinger you know what a metaphor is now eliminate the chatter and tell us what youve cultivated about ramsey mrs boehlinger stared turned showed him her back once more he didnt notice well a detective named bernstein stepped into the hall coffee cup in hand started forward returned to the squad room lets talk somewhere private said petra all three interrogation rooms were horrible smaller than jail cells no windows the obvious wall of oneway mirror that most of the idiots brought in for questioning took early note of then promptly forgot bad smell in all three sweat pomade cheap perfume tobacco hormones she chose interrogation one because it had three chairs instead of two fournier fetched a fourth and they crowded around a tiny metal table forced intimacy mrs boehlinger kept looking at her nails her knees her shoes anywhere but at another human being the surgeon looked ready to slice flesh petra shut the door and let in some claustrophobia mrs b was picking at her knit skirt boehlinger was trying to stare down fournier trying to dominate to what end force of habit she remembered what ramsey had told her about both parents trying to run lisas life let me start by saying how sorry we are for your loss were doing everything in our power to find lisas killer mention of her daughter made mrs b weep the doctor made no effort to comfort her we know who the killer is if theres anything you can tell us to substantiate that sir he beat her up she left him what more do you need unfortunately this boy the potential witness said boehlinger im sure thereve been responses to our reward a few calls have come in said petra and we havent gotten to them yet sir been following up other leads for christs sake boehlingers hand slammed the table his wife jumped but she didnt look at him i dip into my own damn pocket do your job for you and you dont have the decency to follow up we will sir said petra soon as were free to do so why arent you free were here sir said fournier boehlingers hand rose again and for a second petra thought hed try to strike wil but the fist froze in midair slight tremor surgeon past his prime or the stress were delaying you were the problem no sir said fournier we appreciate all your the hand slammed again you he said very softly are a very rude man youre both rude john typical said boehlinger glaring at petra and fournier in turn civil servants so you know nothing about this boy priceless just priceless affirmative action at its finest i believe were going to have to take this one step further vivian hire our own stop it john please boehlinger laughed derisively we will most definitely hire our own investigator because these two obviously arent shut up john the shriek filled the room boehlinger turned white and clawed the tabletop his fingers failed to find purchase and his hands flattened without facing his wife he said vivian id appreciate it if you just shut up john shutup shutup shut up now it was her turn to raise a hand it sailed through the air like a flesh airplane landed on her bosom over her heart she ran out of the room swinging the door open not bothering to close it fourniers eyes begged for petra to follow even dr bile was preferable to a grieving mother petra caught up with her at the end of the hall in the stairwell sitting on the top step forehead to the wall the champagne puff bobbing with each sob maam im sorry no need to apologize maam im very sorry very very very sorry petra sat down next to the woman and chanced putting her arm around the heaving shoulders beneath the knit fabric were small bones petra smelled makeup breath mints chanel no lets find somewhere to go vivian boehlinger straightened and pointed at the interrogation rooms not with him no said petra by ourselves no one was in the vending machine room so she guided the woman in and closed the door no lock she placed a chair against it sat down motioning for vivian boehlinger to choose one near the folding table that served as the ds snack center coffee no thank you subdued voice now that posttantrum shamefatigue small hands folded in a blackknit lap under the fluorescence petra could see hints of deep facial lines muted expertly by makeup the eyes were tormented devoid of hope so disturbing in contrast everything else about the woman was so well put together im sorry she repeated its really okay maam situations like this when all this is over im going to leave him petra didnt speak vivian boehlinger said i was going to do it this year now ill have to wait thirtysix years of marriage what a joke she shook her head made a terrible sound more parrot squawk than laugh he has affairs with sluts she went on thinks im stupid and dont know another bird sound it made petras flesh crawl cheap slutty affairs and now lisas gone odd juxtaposition but maybe not tabulating her miseries petra waited for her to take it further but all she said was my lisa my pretty lisa several more minutes of silence then maam do you think cart ramsey did it i dont know quick answer shed thought about it she gave a pitiful shrug and sniffed petra fetched a paper napkin dab dab thank you youre very sweet i dont know what to think she sat up straighter higher john thinks he can buy everything he offered lisa money not to marry carter and when that didnt work even more money to divorce him so idiotic lisa was going to divorce carter anyway she told me if john had ever communicated with her he could have saved himself the offer which is all it was lisa divorced carter but did john keep his end of the bargain a scary smile spread across the thin lips lipstick and liner had been used to extend the coral borders and radically change the mouths contours without her morning routine this woman would be unrecognizable he didnt pay up said petra of course not he didnt give lisa one dime said he hadnt been serious it was for lisas own good anyway she had nothing to complain about lisa didnt care she knew who she was dealing with but still dont you think thats terrible how much did he offer lisa fifty thousand dollars so now he comes up with half she shook her head dont expect him to pay any reward detective i feel sorry for anyone who thinks theyre going to get paid by john do i think carter did it i dont know to me he always seemed civil then lisa told me he hit her so i dont know how many times did she say he hit her maam just the once they had a tiff carter lost control and hit her more than a slap her eye was blackened and her lip was split just once said petra once was too much for lisa that sounded boastful daughter asserting herself in a way mother never could she told me she wouldnt tolerate it and i agreed with her for all the things her father did over thirtysix years he never laid a hand on me if he had who knows what id have done she lifted her purse hefted it like a weapon of course i didnt know lisa was going to go on television if shed told me about that i probably would have advised against it too public tasteless but id have been wrong why keep it all inside whats the point of being quiet and pretty and tasteful she cried some more dabbed do i think carter did it why not hes a man theyre responsible for all the violence in the world arent they am i as sure as john no because no ones ever as sure as john she got up i know youre trying your best detective john wants blood but i only want something ill never get my little girl back now if youd be so kind as to call me a cab certainly maam petra stayed with her holding the door heres my card if you think of something anything please let me know the two of them returned to the hallway the door to interrogation one was still closed your poor black friend said vivian boehlinger johns prejudiced i really despise him ill call that cab said petra where to the beverly wilshire hes staying at the biltmore barely after am and she was exhausted the time spent with the boehlingers had sapped her energies poor wil was still in there what a pair even allowing for tragedy no marital role model for lisa how much free will did any of us have the message stack had grown four more tips on the boy she dreaded dr bs followup calls in some cases you bonded with the victims family here she was wanting to punch dr bs lights out creeped out by mrs bs avian laugh not good at all and stu still hadnt arrived obviously he didnt give a damn anymore which didnt fit a career opportunity thing so maybe it was marital she did some fruitless followup with missing persons on flores was putting down the phone when stu said good morning freshly shaved every hair in place he wore a beautiful slategray gabardine suit pearlgray shirt smokeandred paisley tie so perfectly composed it pissed her off is it she said he turned around and left the squad room sam ganzer didnt park the lincoln carefully the twentyyearold land yacht was too wide for each of the spaces behind the shul so he used both of them who was there to complain the synagogue once a social center for venices jews had been reduced to a weekend facility sams maintenance calls the only thing that opened its doors before friday night even on the weekend it was sometimes hard to get ten men together for a minyan beth torah wasnt orthodox enough for the yarmulkeclad yuppies whod gentrified venice so they started their own congregation a few blocks away brought a bearded fanatic rabbi from new york installed a partition between the men and the women the old mostly leftwing crowd who patronized the shul wouldnt hear of it that had been five years ago now most of the regulars had died off eventually sam knew beth torah would close down the property sold maybe the yuppies would reclaim it which would be better than yet another cheap business added to the dozens that lined ocean front walk sam didnt mind the yuppies as much as some of the old socialists did he had a deeprooted distrust of authority but was at heart a businessman meanwhile hed park any damn way he pleased he felt hed live forever for seventyone his body was working okay his brother emil living down in irvine not religious at all was seventysix good stock generations of thickset robust metalsmiths and carpenters honed by bonenumbing ukrainian winters it had taken pure evil to cut down most of the ganzer tree mother father three younger brothers two sisters shipped off to sobibor never seen again avram mottel baruch malkah sheindel had they made it to america what would their names have been sams best guess was abe mort bernie marilyn shirley last week hed raised the question with emil who didnt want to talk about it all in all fortyfive ganzers and leibovics had been rounded up by the ukrainian police and handed over to the occupying nazi scum sam and emil muscular young men emil a lightweight boxing champ at the kovol gymnasium were spared and enslaved as forced laborers eighteenhour workdays on thin soup and sawdust bread midnight escape through the snow living in the forest on leaves and nuts nearly starving till theyd been taken in by a saintly catholic woman when her son came back from the war he wanted to turn them over the ganzer brothers ran again walking till the brink of death finally making it to shanghai the chinese had been decent sam sometimes wondered what it would have been like to stay marry one of those gorgeous porcelain girls instead liberation canada detroit la for years he hadnt thought about any of that crap lately the memories had been returning uninvited probably some kind of brain damage his body was strong but names places were fading hed walk into a room forget why the ancient stuff though was as clear as day all that anger he could feel it pounding in his ears bad for the blood pressure he turned off the lincolns engine got out on friday night and saturday he assumed sextons duties had since mr ginzburg died with the unpaid position came maintenance obligations why not what else did he have to do besides play the mandolin and sit outside his house getting too much sun hed already had four precancerous lesions cut off his face and one on his bald spot had to wear a stupid cap like an old guy he took the hat off tossed it into the lincoln locked up enjoyed another look at how hed parked better than leaving room for some drug addict to slump in a stolen car and inject himself that had happened more than once this neighborhood always a little nuts had become a crazy mix of gawking tourists on weekends lowlifes crawling out of the woodwork at night most of ocean front was one big gypjoint now flybynights selling cheap junk weekends so jammed you couldnt take two steps without bumping into some yutz for forty years sam and emil sold hardware and plumbing fixtures from their store on lincoln boulevard things you could use both of them knowing how to install as well as sell pipe a house from scratch you got to be handy living on your own never depending on anyone else leaving shanghai hed vowed never to depend on anyone else maybe thats why hed never married though the ladies loved him hed had his good times even now he once in a while got between the covers with softskinned grandmothers ashamed of what age had done to their bodies sam knew how to make them feel young and gorgeous he felt for the shul key in his pocket found it opened the back door not noticing the screen from the bathroom window lying on the ground because it was partially blocked by his right front tire moments after he got inside he knew someone had broken in the silverplated pushke was sitting atop the platform where the torah was read shiny against the blue velvet coverlet right out in the open the charity box hadnt been used since friday night when it was passed around before services sam had put it away personally in a cabinet beneath the bookcases just a cheap combination lock no reason to make a big deal all it contained was a few dollars in coins but someone had tried anyway and look food had been taken out of the same cabinet snack stuff for the handful of saturdaymorning regulars tam tam crackers and a pink box from a bakery on fairfax sugarcoated kichlen shaped like bow ties sam had bought them last week no preservatives had to be stale hed forgotten to get rid of them crumbs on blue velvet a quarter and a dime had fallen out of the pushke hungry thief what else had he taken the only things of value to a junkie were the silver finials and breastplates that graced the three torahs in the ark sam started toward the carved walnut case ready to draw back the blue velvet curtain afraid of what hed find then he stopped himself raised his heavy arms instinctively maybe the crook was still here all he needed was some junkie jumping out at him no one did silence no movement at all he stood there and looked around the shul was four rooms small entry hall in front gents and ladies lavs at the back in between the main sanctuary rows of walnut pews seating for a doublesided dead bolt protected the front door you couldnt get in or out without a key same for the back so how he waited a few more minutes convinced himself he was alone but made sure by inspecting then out to the front room still locked no damage to the door in back was where he found it the window in the ladies lav closed but the screen was off there it was down near his tire some white chips on the sill where dry paint had flaked off closing the window after hed left considerate thief he returned to the sanctuary opened the ark examined the torahs all the silver in place the bottleshaped pushke hadnt been emptied either and the lock didnt show a scratch only sam and mr kravitz knew the combination and they took turns emptying the weekly take and delivering it to the hadassah thrift shop on broadway once upon a time congregation beth torah had proudly contributed fifty dollars a week to the poor now it was down to ten twelve embarrassing so sam augmented it with twenty of his own what kravitz did he had no idea the guy was a bit of a cheapskate he inspected the pushke rattled it still full except for the quarter and the dime strange several kichlen were gone and from what sam could see quite a few crackers hungry gonif probably some bum too doped up to know what he was doing one of those nuts who lurched up and down the walkway sometimes sam gave them money other times he wanted nothing to do with them a skinny nut because the lav window was small junkies got skinny and werent they always hungry for sweets okay no big loss he dropped the coins back in the pushke brushed crumbs from the velvet closed the cracker box and the bakery box and carried them over to the bookcase opening the lower cabinet where the food went he saw something else the gonif hadnt touched booze schnapps for the regulars a nearly full bottle of crown royal and a halfempty smirnoffs vodka a junkie with one vice only no taste for booze next to the bottles were some folded prayer shawls a bunch of small silk ones striped blue but also the big blackstriped woolen tallis worn by the prayer leader that one belonged in the compartment under the platform how had it gotten there had he put it there had kravitz he strained to remember damn his memory last shabbos yeah yeah mrs rosen hadnt felt good and sam had left early to take her home hed left kravitz in charge the guy had no eye for details removing the woolen shawl he saw that kravitz hadnt folded it properly either a klutz hed clerked for the water department all his life what could you expect from a desk jockey refolding the shawl caressing the thick wool sam carried it to the platform bent down and opened the compartment door inside was a boy a small skinny kid curled up into a corner looking scared as hell breathing hard sam could see his chest moving and now he could hear it fast raspy like he had asthma or something such a look on the face sam knew that look his siblings faces through train windows laborers in the camp who didnt make it even tough emils face the time he got pneumonia thought this was it sams own face when in the dead of winter he found a piece of broken glass in the snow used it for a mirror saw what hed become this boy looked exactly like that its okay he said the boy shivered hugging himself like he was cold and even though this was june venice california a beautiful sunny day sam felt a ukrainian freeze pass over his own body its okay he repeated come on out i dont bite the boy didnt budge come on you cant stay in there all day still hungry crackers arent enough lets get you some real food it took a long time to coax the boy out standing far back so the kid could crawl free when he was finally out he looked like he wanted to run sam held him by the arm skin and bones more memories the boy struggled tried to kick sam knowing what it felt like to be restrained let go and the boy dashed toward the front of the shul rattling the door but locked in returning to the sanctuary he gave sam a wide berth wildeyed looking from side to side trying to figure out how to escape sam was sitting in a front pew holding a box of doughnuts the boy had missed real chazerei entenmanns chocolatecovered cake doughnuts still unopened hidden behind some old prayer books kravitzs secret lode who did he think he was kidding next to the doughnuts was also a sealed jar of gefiltefish balls in jelly sam couldnt imagine the boy going for it here he said holding up the doughnuts take it with you the boy stood there and stared despite being dirty and ragged and skinny with a scratchedup face he was a nicelooking kid maybe eleven twelve what was he doing out here so young there were plenty of runaways in venice but they were mostly teenagers bigshot rebels with needles and rings stuck into their bodies all over crazy haircuts tattoos a bad attitude this one just looked like a kid undernourished and scared definitely goyischelook at that upturned nose that dirtyblond hair sometimes the goyim beat their kids abused them god knows what else maybe this one had run away jews too he supposed though hed never encountered that personally what did he know about kids anyway emil had one son a lawyer lived in encino drove a german car never talked to his parents or sam here he said shaking the doughnut box take it no response the kid distrustful thinking sam was up to something dirt stains all over his jeans and that tshirt was full of holes he was making fists a tough little pisher sam put the doughnuts on the floor got up said fine ill open the door for you you dont have to crawl out the window but if you ask me you should get some clean clothes eat some real food with vitamins dipping into his trouser pocket he took some bills out of his wallet two twenties way too generous for someone he didnt know but what the hell he placed the money on the floor next to the doughnuts walked to the back of the shul and unlocked the rear door then he went into the gents lav to give the kid a chance to make a graceful exit and because his bladder was killing him petra stared at the doorway through which stu had just passed then she went after him he reappeared in the doorway before she got there cocking his head cmere oh yeah faithful little junior partner will jump up on cue they locked eyes his face was stone no apologies deciding to maintain her dignity she followed him down the stairs and out of the building to the rear lot where his suburban was parked the truck usually spotless had dirty windows crusted bird droppings freckled the white hood she said what the hells going on stu he unlocked the passenger door motioned for her to get in came around and sat behind the wheel were not going anywhere she said remaining outside some of us have work to do he stared through the windshield sun from the east traced the contours of his profile in orange a paperbackbook model couldnt have posed for greater effect everyone a goddamn actor petra got in and slammed the door so hard the truck shook stu said i owe you an explanation okay kathy has cancer petras throat seized and closed and for a moment she couldnt breathe oh stu he held up a finger shes going in for surgery tomorrow shes been having tests done we werent sure now we are im so sorry stu why didnt you tell me obviously not close enough eight months of chasing bad guys doth not a deep relationship make one breast he said her doctor found it on routine checkup they think its just a single tumor what can i do to help nothing thanks were covered mothers taking the kids and fathers dealing with the hospital his right arm rested on the center console petra put her hand on his sleeve go home stu wil and i will handle everything no thats the thing i was going to take a leave of absence but kathy insisted i shouldnt she wants me home tonight to take her to the hospital told me i can stay until she falls asleep and tomorrow when she comes out of surgery ill be there but in between she insists i keep working even when she gets radiation maybe they can do just a lumpectomy theyre not sure youre planning to stay on the job said petra kathy wants it you know kathy petra knew very little about kathy gracious pretty efficient supermom never without makeup high school prom queen with a teaching credential shed never used during the family outings petra had observed a superorganizer a bit reserved lets be honest more than reserved despite superficial friendliness the woman had always maintained distance and petra had thought of her as an ice queen thirtysix years old six kids petra thought of her own father raising five children by himself and all the while stud been fighting to maintain shes so strong stu said ive never slept with anyone else saying it with wonderment petra patted his arm most guys get tired of being with the same woman all i ever wanted was kathy i really love her petra i know you do you try to do the right thing live a certain way i know there are no deals with god hes got his own plan but still shell be fine said petra itll work out youll see look at ramsey he went on has a healthy wife does that to her the eggermann woman all the things we see he put his head down on the steering wheel broke into startling phlegmy sobs vivian boehlinger now this this was different this was part of her petra reached over and held him as she aapproached the elevator mildred board heard footsteps from above then a toilet flush the bathwater running the big house was built beautifully but if you stood in certain places sound traveled freely through the rafters missus drawing the bath herself there was something new perhaps it would be a good day she returned to the kitchen ate the shirred eggs and drank the coffee at the old yewwood table dumped the coffee made a fresh pot and waited allowing the missus a nice long time to soak by she was riding up with the second batch of breakfast no newspaper on the tray but not because shed screened it for nastiness the delivery service had skipped the house this morning again such a slipshod world shed take care of it after serving get right on the phone with the newspaper subscription office give them what for sometimes she wished the missus would allow the subscription to lapse there was no need to read the kinds of things they printed the lift let her out on the carpeted top landing she walked past the space where the upstairs steinway grand had stood past the ghosts of the regency chest with its intricate tortoiseshell front the pair of monumental kang xi vases blue as the sky white as milk sitting high on carraramarble pedestals a patch of dust in an alcove made her stop and wipe with the hem of her apron the walk to the missuss suite took her past the echoes of chinese porcelain the gilded cases one filled with animalier bronzes the other teeming with japanese inro jade ivory mixedmetal vases all irreplaceable like the boulle chest it was illegal to kill tortoises now unborn babies yes but not reptiles she knocked on the missuss door received the expected faint reply and went in the missus was in bed wearing the cream satin bed jacket with the covered buttons what a quest it had been finding a proper dry cleaner for that hair wrapped in a white french towel no makeup but still beautiful rosewater scent sweetened the enormous room the only items on the nightstand were a limoges tissuebox holder and a black satin eye mask the bed covers were barely mused even in sleep the woman was genteel but the missus was acting strange staring straight ahead not smiling at mildred bad dreams again the room was still dark both sets of drapes drawn mildred stood there not wanting to intrude and a second later the missus turned to her good morning dear morning maam her face so thin so white tired very tired so it probably wouldnt be a good day midred resolved to try to get her out of the house a bit a drive to huntington gardens last month the two of them had spent a glorious hour strolling at the missuss snails pace a week later mildred had suggested they repeat it perhaps the art gallery but the missus demurred maybe another time dear once upon a time a driver had wheeled the cadillac and the lincoln the cadillac was gone mildred wrestled with the lincoln how much petrol was in the tank if not a drive at least a stroll out in back some fresh air maybe after lunch heres some breakfast for you maam thank you mildred saying it automatically so politely that mildred knew the missus wasnt hungry probably wouldnt touch a thing the body needed sustenance that was simple logic yet despite all her education the college degree from wellesley the finest womens school in america the missus sometimes seemed unaware of the basics during those moments mildred felt she was the older sister caring for a child you do need to eat maam thank you mildred ill do my best mildred put the food down drew the drapes fetched the bed tray and set it up she noticed a kink in the drapery pleats straightened it and looked out the window the bluetiled pool that him had modeled after mr hearsts at san simeon was empty and streaked with brown the boxwood knot garden too painful to see mildred looked away but not before being assaulted by a distant view of downtown los angeles all that steel and glass hideous from up close but this far perhaps it did have a certain stature when she turned fully the missus was wiping her eyes crying mildred hadnt heard a sniffle the missus pulled a tissue out of the porcelain box and blew her nose inaudibly another cold or had she been crying here you go maam toast just the way you like it forgive me mildred its a beautiful breakfast but maybe in a bit please leave it some coffee to stimulate the appetite maam the missus started to refuse then said yes please mildred took hold of the cozywrapped pitcher and directed an ebony stream into the royal worcester cup the missus lifted the coffee her hands were shaking so she needed both to keep it steady whats the matter maam nothing everythings fine mildred what a beautiful rose giant blossoms this year maam its going to be a good year for roses yes im sure it will thank you for going to the trouble no trouble at all maam the same dialogue they exchanged every morning hundreds of mornings a ritual but not a formality because the missuss gratitude was genuine she was gracious as royalty more gracious look what royalty had become it was hard to think of her as an american more of an international the missus reached for another tissue and patted her eyes mildred picked up the first tissue dropping it in the venetian wastebasket beneath the end table noticed something in there a newspaper todays i got up very early and brought it up mildred dont be cross early maam mildred had been up at six taking her own bath ten minutes of secret bubbles ten minutes later she hadnt heard a thing the missuss escape concealed by running water i went outside to check the trees all those winds the santa anas we had last night i see maam oh mildred its fine the soft eyes blinked mildred crossed her arms over her apron how early is early maam i dont really know dear six sixthirty i suppose i went to sleep too early and my rhythm was off very well said mildred would you be wanting anything else maam no thank you dear now the missuss hands were shaking again holding tight to the covers smiling but it looked forced mildred prayed it wasnt another downturn she looked down at the newspaper you can take it said the missus if you want to read it mildred folded the horrid thing under her arm read it indeed shed throw it out with the kitchen trash when the lock clicked on the back door to the jewish church my brain froze and i couldnt move what would the jews do to me now i was finished as the back door opened i jumped under the big table crawled into the cabinet and closed the door quietly i could hear footsteps from inside just one person walking yes just one the cabinet was empty and smelled of wood and old clothes my mouth tasted of crackers and fear i pushed myself into a corner and didnt move praying whoever was in here wouldnt open the doors the sign said no prayers till tomorrow did the jews have secret prayers whoever it was out there walked around stopped walked some more now he was close to me if he did open the cabinet id jump out id scream like a maniac surprise him and escape escape how not through the back door unless hed left it unlocked the front could you open it from inside the bathroom window again that would take time my stomach started to hurt really bad i felt like i was being suffocated i didnt even do anything really wrong just ate some of their food and it wasnt that good crackers with an onion taste some butterflyshaped cookies that were stale i didnt even mess with the silver bottle with the jewish star on it just shook it to see what would fall out even though the lock looked dinky i thought about breaking it but the bottle looked nice and i didnt want to damage it this was a jewish place but it was still a church so maybe god was here too id tell him all that if he caught me no i wouldnt id yell and scream and run to the bathroom lock myself in get that window up i remembered what moron said about jews being out to kill christians thats got to be crazy but what if now hes farther away back and forth back and forth whats he doing uhoh hes coming closer again i hear rattling hes shaking the silver bottle now it sounds like hes scraping the top of the table probably cleaning up the cracker crumbs now he walks away maybe hell see no one stole anything and just leave now hes walking back the door opens i dont jump out and yell i just push myself harder into the corner a face stares at me an old face kind of fat glasses with thick black frames a big nose red kind of big ears a funnylooking old guy he steps back hes wearing old guys clothes a white shirt and baggy light blue pants and one of those zippered tan jackets his fingers are really thick and his hands look too big for the rest of him he doesnt look mad more surprised i keep pushing myself into the corner the wood is hard against my back and my butt but i cant stop pushing he steps back some more says its okay in a deep grumbly voice i just sit there its okay come on out i dont bite then he peeks in closer smiling showing me his teeth like trying to prove theyre not for biting kids the pervert grandpa smiled that way too hes giving me room to get out but i cant move i just cant move he starts saying its okay if im hungry i should eat right not junk i figure if he gives me troubles i can just push him down even with those big thick hands hes an old guy finally my body relaxes and i crawl out he grabs my arm and hes pretty strong and i try to kick him and he lets go and i run to the front of the synagon but the doors locked with one of those locks you need a key for so now im stuck i go back hes sitting down on a church bench he laughs holds out a box of chocolate doughnuts tries to give it to me but no way will i get close enough to him to take it not just because hes jewish because hes a person and you cant trust anyone he starts talking again telling me hell unlock the back door for me i dont have to crawl through the window then he pulls out money two twentydollar bills forty dollars whats he trying to buy i dont take it and he puts it down on the floor along with the doughnuts and gets up and unlocks the door and goes to the bathroom i grab up everything and race out of there outside i breathe again inside my pocket the money weighs a ton and the first doughnut i eat walking through the alley tastes fantastic i eat another one then my stomach starts to hurt and i decide to save the rest for later stores are opening and more people are walking and skating and the first thing i do is buy a hat a dodgers hat with an adjustable band in back i fit it to my head and bend the brim over my face so itll keep the sun off and also to hide it because buying it is a strange experience the place i find it is this little shack a ways up from the synagon the guy who sells it to me is ugly with bad skin mirrored sunglasses and long greasy blondandgray hair he looks at me funny like he knows me i guess he could be from hollywood but i never saw him before hes got a weird accent like a bad guy from a spy movie russian he sounds like a russian spy so whys he looking at me like that i mean i cant be sure he really is because of the mirrored sunglasses but it seems like he is the way he turns his head toward me and just keeps it there taking a long time to give me my change as i turn away he says hey you kid but i leave pushing the hat down over my face when i turn around a few moments later hes in front of the shack still looking in my direction so i duck between some buildings and walk through the alley a little then back to ocean front too far for him to see me the ocean has turned pure blue and my bones finally feel warm i smell corn dogs and popcorn know i have money to buy them but im still full from the crackers and the doughnuts all these people and im walking along with them like its a moving sidewalk and were all together doing some dance no ones bothering anyone the corndog smell makes me feel im at a carnival i was at a school carnival once had no money to buy corn dogs or anything this feels like a warm bright dream i reach the end of the walkway and theres no place to go but sand the whole beach is like the end of the world i figure ill try the other end turn around walk for a while until i spot the ugly russian guy coming my way hes in the crowd but hes not part of it everyone else seems to be having a good time he looks angry and his eyes are all over the place looking for something me another perv i dont want to find out slipping back over to the alley i walk back in the direction i came from checking over my shoulder a few times i see a couple of people but not him then the alleys empty again and heres the synagon theres a huge old white lincoln continental with a brown top parked there must be the old guys jew canoes moron called them cadillacs and lincoln continentals soft cars he used to say for soft people but the old guy had a strong grip the way he just gave me all that money forty dollars like it was nothing so the jews are rich but he didnt want anything from me maybe i can get some more money from him im still out in the alley thinking about it when he comes out sees me and gives a surprised smile hes really short this time i notice that his teeth are too white they have to be false mom had some false teeth made up for the back of her mouth where the rotten ones fell out but she never put them in and her face started to get saggy he holds out his hands like hes confused what he says you already spent it all stu let her comfort him then abrupt as a power failure he broke the embrace it was the first time theyd ever touched back to work he said back at their desks he told her i heard from one of my studio sources scott wembley had called last night he gave her the basics leaving out the whining in the ads voice its no big deal detective but you said call for anything what do you have scott a few of us were sitting around schmoozing and ramsey came up and someone said they thought his show sometimes shot in griffith park mountain areas the horse trails its just across the freeway from burbank recent shoot i dont know thats all i know who brought it up another ad and dont ask me where she heard it from cause i didnt pump her you said be subtle right did she know this for a fact or was she guessing she said she thought so thought shed heard it somewhere it was like casual talk people giving their opinions what kinds of opinions one really ramseys the white mans answer to oj okay scott thanks thank me by leaving me alone petra said so maybe ramsey knows griffith but then why wouldnt he pick a more secluded area of the park because then hed have to drag lisa along on foot using the parking lot meant he could drive in get out of the car ostensibly to talk then stab her by surprise you think he planned it i think at some time during their time together he planned it also the car may have had some significance psychologically ramsey collects cars lisa liked to have sex in them where better to end their relationship than in a parking lot the perfect la couple good point i like that he put his hands on the steering wheel hed shaved carelessly missing a tiny waffle of blond hair below his right ear be interesting to know if any adjustor episodes match the murder life imitating bad tv said petra these people have no imagination getting the actual scripts would take time but i can scan a few years worth of tv guides see what comes up in the plot summaries fine said petra more busywork he looked grateful to do it fournier entered the squad room picked up a stack of message slips and came over hey he said hey said stu nothing on his face to indicate this wasnt just another day fournier waved the stack took the liberty of burglarizing your desktop barbie ill pay you later she said anything new still nothing on the kid from shelters dogooders or juvey but he didnt just blow into town ive got one nice lead korean guy runs the okirama on western says the kid bought food from him once in a while over a three fourmonth period always

korean guy called him said the kid also came by and swiped ketchup mustard mayo thought he never noticed and guess what last time the kid came in was sunday night around nine bought a chiliburger there you go said petra thinking about the boy on his own for three months managing his finances whered he get the money where did he come from lets check the national runaway lines already faxed the picture said fournier theyve got tons of files itll take time meanwhile the korean wants the reward he laughed along with everyone else along with the greedy types are a few just plain wackos i got an alleged clairvoyant from chula vista claiming some satanic cult murdered lisa for her thymus gland seems theres a new rage for thymus glands among the horned crowd lisas thymus was intact at the time of autopsy said petra i told the lady she hadnt won the jackpot didnt know clairvoyants could cuss like that one last thing schoelkopf blew in theyre leaning on him from the top and we are instructed to inform him immediately about anything remotely resembling a lead do we have one stu told him the rumor about ramseys show filming in griffith fournier thought nah he cant take that to the press he actually made it to the squad room said petra among the great unwashed for a whole five minutes barb turn up the heat and the grease spatters a witness how was it possible hed awoken this morning feeling pretty good about things stretched yawned made coffee poured some juice opened the paper and there it was his bowels started churning a kid the article said maybe hed been there the police were developing other leads meaning the police didnt know a damn thing or they were double bluffing trying to draw him out he didnt do well with uncertainty a kid in the park at that hour maybe it was a bogus clue a plant to flush someone out no not with a reward if a false clue got some innocent kid picked up by some moneyhungry idiot and the parents sued thered be bigtime legal problems so probably a real lead but how would anyone know about the kid if he hadnt come forward unless some sort of physical evidence had he left something behind funny thing was after doing lisa hed thought he heard something up behind those rocks a rustle a scraping above the sound of his pumping arm he allowed himself a moment of bliss the look on lisas face even in the darkness hed seen it or maybe hed just imagined it hed convinced himself that hed imagined the scraping had stopped stood still heard nothing returned his attention to lisa so nice and inert he had blood on his shirt but was careful to keep his shoes clean because shoe prints could cause problems asphalt was good for that too stay off the dirt before returning to the car he took the shoes off so careful and yet a kid up there that late it made no sense he stared at the picture again white looked to be eleven or twelve could be any of a thousand kids if he existed even if they found him what could he have seen in the darkness no way his face had been visible in the darkness right what about the car a flash of license plate there were some lights on the edge of the lot had he passed under them he hadnt worried about it had assumed no one was there if the kid did exist why hadnt he come forward so maybe it was bogus on the other hand this could be a problem not a huge one certainly nothing compared to estrella the evileyed bitch throwaway people la was full of them a kid consciously he didnt feel worried but christ his heart was hammering away like a bastard he ripped the page out of the paper squeezed it into a tight sweaty ball thought better of it and unfolded the picture tried to drink coffee but it wouldnt go down tried to cheer himself up by thinking of lisa on the ground true love never dies but she had so easily the best part had been her surprise bygones be bygones lets hug then wham something quite different from a hug quite different he said aloud in a cultured british accent david niven voice one of a thousand parts hed never gotten to play no one appreciated his talent lisa had though during the last second of her life the look on her face finally seeing him in a new light youre capable of this hed made sure to look in her eyes as he jammed the knife in and yanked up one of those beautiful moments when everything came together best role hed ever played just the two of them dancing in the dark the two of them and a kid what could he have done to avoid it gone traipsing up in those hills scattering blood and who knew what other kinds of forensic evidence all over the place even the lapd nitwits might have found something theyd found out about the kid how and now the reward the old man throwing his weight around maybe the kid had been there earlier but left before he and lisa showed up maybe maybe maybean old song one of the doowop ones he loved some girl group the chantelles or the shirelles all that money would probably bring in nutcases bottom line was lapd didnt have a clue not a bloody clue he said in his david niven voice not the sheriffs clowns whod showed up the first day or that pair from the police department bishop strong and silent yielding center stage to connor ms detective those long legs no chest but still that was some piece of poon what was she twentysix seven that dark hair and pale skin the kind of long lean body that might look too bony naked but was okay with clothes on he imagined her white and smooth not a scrap of fat on her stretched out on a poolside lounge as she yielded to his hands his mouth his another time another place he laughed stretched big arms not a clue any of them except for this alleged kid who wasnt coming forward because he didnt exist out there that late he had to be a street punk a runaway maybe his mind was blown from drugs or aids probably nothing to worry about he sat there for a long time trying to convince himself finally reaching the ugly conclusion it needed to be taken seriously hed research it unlike the cops he wasnt bound by rules life had taught him to make his own rules after all these years it all boiled down to one take what you want like that night in redondo the german stewardess sitting in that restaurant arguing with that plugugly boyfriend he studied them from the bar across the room nursing a heineken wiping suds from his false beard wondering what a girl like that saw in someone that repulsive noticing the girl because of her resemblance to lisa that boyfriend a face like pigshit he watched them conjuring up beautyandthebeast sexual fantasies that failed to arouse him because it was clear that they werent getting along glaring at each other not eating much finally the girl got up and stomped out of the restaurant looking so much like lisa a bit taller bigger tits the lush body in that short blue dress those tight muscular legs as she marched offscreen pigshit tossed bills down and followed big guy but soft a sack of fertilizer he watched them leave paid for the heineken made sure no one was watching and climbed down to the parking lot behind the restaurant finding a vantage point behind his car pigshit was trying to get blondie into his car lots of hand gestures on both sides every time she moved those tits bounced from the way they responded not an ounce of plastic chest like that on a skinny girl you didnt see it very often they kept arguing then pigshit grabbed her she pulled away he grabbed again she slapped him he slapped her she fell got up this was fun now pigshit looked like he was apologizing the big idiot actually got down on his knees and what did blondie do spit on him watching from behind his car he almost laughed out loud uhoh here comes payback pigshit sprang up swung at her a giant roundhouse but clumsy too many drinks he missed blondie ran across the lot those wonderful tits heavingho pigshit shaking his fist but not following blondie stopped at the edge of the lot folded her hands across the wonder chest pigshit shook his head got in a compact car drove away alone she let her hands drop helplessly realizing it was dark no ones around the pier has emptied out try finding a cab in redondo beach at this hour the smart thing would have been to return to the restaurant instead she just stood there crying well fräulein stupidity has its rewards his turn wonderful his second time first had been little sally tosk back in syracuse tenth grade well developed since eighth hed watched her chest grow almost alarmingly not a true blonde a strawberry blonde still wearing braces on her top teeth shed come on to him all through football season finally hed graced her with a date secret date she had a boyfriend but wanted to slut around with him too hed driven to her house in his fathers new buick her parents out till late some kind of rotary dinner the tosks lived on a big piece of land beyond the city limits used to be a farm sally was ready at the door little nightie nothing else gave him tongue in the living room tit in the kitchen they moved up to her bedroom then she got all hysterical when he refused to say he loved her and tried to push him away and he had to put a hand over her mouth to stop her from screaming covering her mouth and her nose and all of a sudden she was blue he panicked then he started to see her in a different light and fooled with her body just exploring careful not to leave anything behind he drove home throbbing with terror and pleasure the tosks came home two hours later big scare in town rumors of a stalking sex maniac he lost sleep for weeks because what if sally had told someone she was meeting him lost weight and told his mother he had the flu but she hadnt told anyone worried about the boyfriend the cops talked to the boyfriend no leads he attended sallys funeral cried along with everyone else nothing like young lust sally the german girl lisa not that he was a serial killer he had no compulsion but when the opportunity came up at sallys funeral he really lost it when the dirt hit the coffin one of sallys girlfriends another cheerleader took his hand and dried his eyes told him later how sensitive he was dearly beloved he intoned in a melodious voice not niven john houseman someone like that and the oscar goes to i tell the old guy no ive still got it but i wouldnt mind some more have any work i can do he pushes his glasses up his nose so you can talk want to work eh how old are you old enough he comes closer listen if youre in trouble running away from something maybe i can help you because a fellow your age shouldnt be out here all alone i back away i dont need help just work got a work permit i dont answer he says a work permit its the law to protect kids they used to force kids to work not anymore not in the united states so hes not going to help me i start to leave hold on you want work fine i stop what do you have how much do you pay he smiles again a businessman okay listen the shul here the synagogue he points over his shoulderis not used much during the week but it would be good to have someone to clean the place up before friday services keep an eye out on things know what i mean a watchman not a night watchman a day watchman because theres nowhere to sleep you have someplace to sleep sure its dangerous around here at night he says coming even closer you been on the streets awhile havent you i dont answer im not trying to be nosy sonny but maybe i can help cause i been there believe me the way he says that the change that comes over his face like something i learned in science metamorphosis i know hes telling the truth that must have been a long time ago i say he stares at me cracks up yeah a real long time back in the stone age his laugh is funny deep like it comes from way down in his belly i cant help myself my mouth turns up ah he can smile too so maybe lifes not so bad after all eh that wipes the smile from my face it is he said someone hurt you that bad inside the shul he shows me a little closet in the mens bathroom where the cleaning stuff is kept a broom a dustpan a mop and pail windex for the glass lemon pledge for the wood some silver polish too but he leaves that there sees me looking at it cmere sonny do you have a name by the way im sam ganzer sonny is fine he shrugs holds out his hand and we shake his hand feels like a hunk of dried meat nice to meet you he says same here he brings me into the main room of the shul at the front is this big carvedwood cabinet that i never had a chance to open reaching to the ceiling and covered by a blue velvet curtain he pulls a cord and the curtain opens behind it are these doors with twelve little carved scenes bible scenes i recognize noahs ark moses in the cradle some other stuff doesnt mean anything to me nothing about jesus of course i think this is weird what am i doing here behind the carved doors are three things also covered in blue velvet with jewish writing with wooden poles sticking out on top and bottom and silver handles just on top the closest one says dedicated by saul and isidore levine in memory of their father hyman hanging over the front are silver plates know what these are sam asks no torahs the jewish bible you believe in the bible dont you i dont know what i believe in but i nod so you understand these are holy right dont worry i wont steal the silver i say he turns red as a tomato thats not what i was implying sonny i just want you to know that this is important stuff were dealing with so when i ask you to polish the silver youll be extra careful got it got it even though i know what he was really saying we arrange it this way ill sweep and mop the entire shul including the bathrooms windex the windows and lemon pledge the wood the last job will be polishing the silver because he needs to bring me more rags also he says the silver polish is pretty strong so dont breathe it in too close got it got it im serious he says you dont sniff stuff do you glue paint you dont do that right no drugs never i said not once i believe you he said you seem like a nice kid id like to know what youre doing out on the streets living on crackers but its your business i say nothing he says i just dont want to come in here find you knocked out by silver polish fumes believe me i know about these things owned a hardware store for forty years at the end junkies and lowlifes were coming in buying all the glue and fixative it was pretty obvious none of them ever installed a commode boy he can really talk ill be careful i say another thing today is thursday tomorrow night we have services saturday too so i cant use you at all on saturday fine after today i dont think therell be anything to do he puts his hands in his pockets so now the important part how much do you want whatever you think is fair whatever i think meaning if i say two pennies an hour youll be happy i think youll be fair flattered sonny but if youre gonna be a businessman learn to set a price i think for a while how much do they pay kids to flip burgers at mcdonalds i dont know i really dont know two dollars an hour two dollars an hour minimum wage is over five you dont think youre minimum wage okay six fivefifty fine i shout and it surprises me im not deaf he says fivefifty an hour and i figure youve got what eight nine hours lets say fifty bucks total heres an advance out comes his wallet and suddenly therere two tendollar bills in my hand and not believing my good luck i stick them in my pocket the rest youll get when you finish ill come by in a few hours to check he moves closer again stops one more thing this is a cash deal no withholding for taxes social security so dont report me to the government okay the way motor moran figured it if hed had a good scoot hed nevera noticed it he was thirty years old and except for those four months guarding that junkyard in salinas had never worked a real job artsandcrafts prison shit didnt count hed never been in a real pen anyway just local shitholes dui drunk and disorderly a month here a month there life owed him something before he died this could be it the kind of scoot his dick

while before he muttered buell using the name motor hated hey spank motor raised his hand for a high five spanky didnt move then he slipped a ring through his beard turned it into a gray horsetail

motors heels hurt with each step all that weight pounding down the worndown boots not helping his thighs chafed through filthy denim when he got there he was sweating from exertion he ordered spankys food scowling at the beaner kid who said yes sir and stopped smiling when he saw motors face he was about to leave when he saw it on one of the tables la newspaper he didnt read newspapers who gave a shit but this one the picture made him notice fuck if it didnt look like sharlas rug rat he picked it up it took him a long time to finish the article and he had to go over it twice to be sure hed always had trouble reading words not making sense some letters upside down his old man called him a retard look whos talkin fucking unemployed janitor dead at fortyfive from a fuckedup liver mom not much better in the boozeslave department but at least she didnt bug him she couldnt read good either finally he got through it was this for real witness to a murder hollywood he studied the picture some more looked exactly like the little rat had to be the rat hed split what four months ago and kids always split to hollywood motor had ended up there himself old brain fry kicking his ass after he flunked tenth grade for the third time finally telling himself fuck it im gone he took the greyhound that time too stealing bucks out of brain frys jeans scared when he got there the place was huge

closed seconds later he was cruising along the access road to the trailer park when he got to the highway he remembered to switch on his headlights thursday at pm after spending more fruitless time on the eggermann murder stu got ready to leave petra was in the ladies room he supposed he should wait to say goodbye to her tomorrow hed go through tv guides any decentsize library would have them hed find one near the hospital he locked his desk tried to free his mind of the worry bad margins on the tumor lymph nodes full of cancer when he was with her he was mr positive shed let him know right

year then a sorority sweetheart at occidental a history major just one tumor drizak assured him relatively small the family history wasnt terrible kathys mom was healthy but an aunt had died of breast cancer all in all a decent prognosis drizak claimed but stu was a doctors son knew how imprecise medicine could be bad surprises father had told him more than once are part of a surgeons life thats why we all have to trust in the lord stu ached to trust and for the past few days hed been praying with the conspicuous fervor of a missionary inside he was hollow as an atheist all those please gods dear jesuses what right did he have to petition for the sake of the children always the children a hand on his shoulder made him jump sorry said petra thought id shove off her hand remained there look if theres anything i can do thanks but were fine petra im sure itll all go smoothly what times the surgery six am dont rush back she said wil and i will handle everything okay he said wondering if shed try to hug him again he hoped not not here in front of all the others what are your plans he asked thought id mosey over to ramseys place talk to security see if theres any other way out of ranchhaven good idea he said petra had pointed out that theyd neglected to question the night guard immediately and hed been appalled what would he do without kathy he told petra she was doing a great job and left walk steady one foot in front of the other but his knees were weak and it felt as if someone were shoving him el salvador time was an hour later than la and petra doubted estrella floress son would still be in his law office she tried anyway got no answer connected with an international operator found three more listings for javier floreses and lucked out on number two im worried about my mother said the attorney in heavily accented but sound english your city is dangerous my mother doesnt drive where would she go i phoned ramsey but he didnt call back my mother told me he lives out in the country how could she just walk out of there she didnt drive where would she go this isnt right flores talked like an interrogator articulate educated so what was his mother doing cleaning houses as if he was used to the question he said ive been after her to come back and live with us but shes very independent but still she didnt drive where would she go it cant be related to mrs ramsey is it your mother told you about mrs ramsey no the last time i spoke to her was sunday the day before it happened i read about it in the papers i read american papers what are you doing to find her detective ive contacted every missing persons bureau sir i called you to make sure there was no place your mother could have gone a relative a no no one said flores she knows no one so you dont think it had anything to do with mrs ramsey we have no evidence of that sir please flores exploded im not stupid could she have learned something that put her in danger i honestly dont know mr flores so far theres no evidence of that did your mother ever say anything about the ramseys that could be relevant especially last sunday no they didnt come up she asked how her bank account was doing thats all she wires me her money i deposit it shes saving up for her own house all her money goes to el salvador except whats taken out for american taxes what about past conversations said petra what was her opinion of the ramseys she said the wife was young nice not too picky was mr ramsey picky a little he had these cars he wanted polished all the time but it was a good job better than the one she worked before very picky people they always criticized do you remember their names people in another part of town belair hooper mr and mrs hooper the man always ran his finger along the furniture looking for dust the woman drank too much and they didnt pay her well first names i dont wait the address is here in my book unless i threw it out when she no here it is hooper heres the number petra copied it down ill call them mr flores ill call them too he said but i dont think my mother would have returned to them anything more you can tell me about the ramseys the one she didnt like was the business manager he was in charge of paying her was always late with the check finally she complained to mrs ramsey and that helped mr balch she never mentioned his name said he was a snob out to show he was important him she didnt like what about mr ramsey she didnt talk about him much do you think he killed the wife mr flores at this point i okay okay all i care about is my mother ill do everything i can to find her sir so as far as you know there were no conflicts with mr ramsey no reason for your mother to suddenly quit he wasnt home that often it was a big house she didnt like being alone so much his voice broke i know theres something wrong the moment petra hung up the phone it rang the civilian clerk on duty said a dr boehlinger called did he leave a message just to call him back telling not asking just what she needed clenching her jaw she dialed boehlingers hotel he was out thank god for small victories she phoned the hoopers in belair busy maybe javier flores was already on the line she tried again connected to a huskyvoiced woman oh jesus i just spoke to her son no i havent seen her snorting laugh so now the police are trying to bring illegals back thank you mrs hooper youre the one who hired her when she was illegal mrs hooper click wil fournier came over and showed her a piece of paper forty or so names all but three checked off tipsters our little burglars been spotted all up and down the state but its mostly garbage who unlocked the asylum he loosened his tie the tan pad of his hand was inkstained one sweetheart from frisco claims hes the son she gave up at birth she was just about to call unsolved mysteries the money would sure come in handy because she wants to become a psychologist one guy claims the kids not a kid hes some kind of mystic guru an apparition appears in times of crisis and renders deliverance the world may be coming to an end he might have something there said petra long as i get my pension said fournier he tapped each of the three unchecked names these are possibles two come from the same place some farm town called watson between bakersfield and fresno neither of the callers know the kid by name but they both think theyve seen him around they didnt sound wacko or greedy and two tips from a small place like that is interesting i put in a call to the local law must be a real hick place because its a twoman sheriff outfit and both guys were out i talked to some woman at the desk who sounded about a hundred years old this last one probably is greed russian accent but at least the guy sounded sane insisted hed seen the kid in venice this morning described his clothes tshirt jeans said the kid looked like hed been sleeping on the street had crusted salt on his face like hed washed with ocean water scratched up too good eye for detail thats why im not dismissing him he runs a souvenir stand down on ocean front in venice claims he sold the kid a hat this morning then the kid took off north the guy thought it was weird a kid being out by himself middle of the day and buying a hat he never sells hats to kids trying to hide his face said petra fournier shrugged could be if the kid read todays paper and we know hes a reader on the other hand youre homeless broke a runaway someones offering twentyfive gs for your presence wouldnt you turn yourself in try to collect hes a child wil probably an abused child why should he trust anyone feel enough in control to scheme and if he saw the murder he could be too scared to think about profit guess so or maybe the kid was there but not during the murder figures why bother anyway this russian is definitely after the money petra read the mans name out loud vladimir zhukanov thats another thing said fournier his being russian i dont want to be prejudiced but you know the scams those guys have been pulling off he folded and pocketed the list ill stop by to see him have a date in santa monica tonight dinner at loews ever been there petra shook her head zhukanov said hed stay late to talk to me one last thing schoelkopf called me into the office again pumping for details i may have to give him something barb and then boom right in to the media and we run around like little windup toys if you have to you have to said petra its already out of our hands she was ready to leave at seven when the phone blared again a young woman said hold please for lawrence schick ten seconds of bad music then a sleepy male voice said to which detective do i have the pleasure of speaking detective connor evening detective connor this is larry schick meaningful pause she was supposed to know who he was and she did sixhundredbucksanhour lawyer criminal defense mostly celebrity drunk drivers actors kids playing with guns other delicate felonies shed seen him doing sound bites but had never met him her typical perp couldnt even afford a western avenue hack evening mr schick howre things on the ramsey case finally the wall goes up are you asking as a concerned citizen sir schick laughed im always concerned but no detective connor ive been retained by mr ramsey to represent him in this matter so please channel all future communications through my offices offices plural look ma im important communications said petra anything pertaining to the case said schick are you saying we cant talk to mr ramsey without clearing it with you first mr schick at this point in time said the lawyer that would be advisable detective good night same to you petra said to a dead phone yesterday shed chatted with ramsey in the kitchen now this from ramseys point of view two things had transpired the reinterview and the talk with balch had she raised something with either of them that worried him grabbing her notepad she reviewed her notes the talk with ramsey had covered nothing earthshattering he had mentioned being a suspect scratch that one new topic estrella flores she flipped to the balch interview his and ramseys hollywood discovery lisas temperament the dv episode estrella flores was the maid the hot button what had flores seen that night or did it have something to do with the boy in the paper ramsey thinking hed pulled off the perfect crime only to encounter every bad guys worst nightmare a mystery witness she would have loved to stare into those baby blues right now probing for fear so of course she couldnt but no one not even an overpaid bh lawyer could stop her from just happening to be in ramseys neighborhood and dropping in stopping for a roast beef sandwich at an arbys on sunset she ate in the car chewing on meat and suspicion watching night creatures emerge from the dark knowing years ago shed have been scared to get this close at she set out for calabasas postrush hour she sailed arriving at the ranchhaven guardhouse by the guard on duty was a young man weakchinned with discouraged posture thin everywhere except around his middle where the uniform shirt strained when she drove up he folded his arms across his chest grim watchfulness ludicrous in the absence of threat faded when he saw her up close a crooked smile split his bland pie of a face flirtatious great the guys eyebrows were very faint nearly invisible his badge said d simkins he came out looked at her opened the gate she drove up to him hows it going no maam easy tone coming into play because she was driving a honda not a porsche not one of the locals petra showed him her badge oh he said stepping back and hitching his trousers its about time detective for what i was on shift the night lisa ramsey was killed kept wondering when you were gonna come by wagging a finger in mock disapproval petras turn to smile well here i am officer simkins she parked got out entered the guardhouse without asking permission he followed the booth was a glass closet barely enough room for both of them simkins leaned against a counter looking her up and down no shame not much inside small cabinet for supplies a single wheeled chair that simkins offered her she stayed on her feet she extricated her pad while checking out the security hardware multiline telephone twoway radio setup handheld walkietalkie two closedcircuit tv screens suspended above the counter one highlighting the mouth of the main road the other so dark she could barely tell it was switched on next to the phone a greasy paper bag and a copy of rolling stone some rock star instantemperor on the cover pierced eyebrows a silver stud through the tongue simkins said so what can i do for a fellow officer petra dredged up another smile so you were on all that night officer simkins doug yes i was it was real quiet but i dont know i had a feeling like it was too quiet like something could happen did anything happen simkins shook his head but you know i just felt it was a weird night then the next morning when i heard what happened i said oh man like one of them psychic things lord deliver me from dunderheads this place seems like it must be pretty quiet in general youd be surprised he said suddenly defensive you get stuff like fires with fires we call a firststage alert which is letting people know we might have to evacuate scary said petra thats why were here touching his own badge stainless replica of lapds could the department sue so doug what time were you on duty that night seven to threes my regular shift then the morning guy called in sick so i did double duty till when eleven when day watch starts day watch being officer dilbeck retrieving the old guards name from her memory banks yeah oliver said simkins frowning probably miffed that dilbeck had already been interviewed petra said did anyone from the ramsey house come in or out during that time he did mr ramsey he and his friend a blond guy i always see him with they came in that night what time nine or so or so they didnt log entries and exits do you have a written record of that no we dont hassle with that defensive again who drove doug the friend did either mr ramsey or his friend go out again that night nope said simkins decisively smugly delivering the punch line no one from the entire development left after that though a few more people came home like i said it was a quiet night what about mr ramseys maid nope never left its real quiet around here too quiet i like action petra suppressed laughter know what you mean doug anything else you can tell me about the ramseys well simkins said pondering ive only been working here three weeks just see him going in and out same for that friend of his you think he did it dont think much of anything yet doug three weeks on duty hed never known lisa even with a brain the guy wouldve been useless to her is mr ramsey home right now hasnt come in or out on my shift are there any other ways in and out of ranchhaven nope what about that second screen there simkinss eyes flashed to the console oh that thats just a fire road way back at the rear of the property but no one uses it even when we were on evac alert the plan was to get everyone out through the front the screen looks pretty dark its dark back there petra bent close to the monitor no officer there nope just one of them cardkey doohickeys the residents get issued cards but no one uses it no reason to id like to go over there myself doug just to take a look i dunno you can come with me if you want she stepped closer to simkins their chests nearly touched the guard was perspiring heavily well just a quick look doug i promise not to steal any dirt she winked it made simkins flinch yeah okay just dont disturb any of the residents okay because that would be my butt they like their peace and quiet thats what they pay me for how do i get there up the main road to the top he gestured managed to move closer their shoulders touching on the way to ramseys house matter of fact but instead of turning right you bear left and after a while youll see this big empty lot that was supposed to be a ninehole golf course but it never got built probably cause the residents all play at clubs anyway keep bearing left all the way around it and the roadll curve up suddenly switch directions just keep going till you cant go any more she thanked him patted his shoulder he flinched again she drove very slowly pausing when ramseys house came into view the outdoor lighting was on full blast weaker illumination leaked from inside no cars in front damn that museum impossible to know if the guy was home she stared at the house static so were the nearby structures the more expensive neighborhoods got the deader they looked simkinss directions led her on a tenminute loop past the wouldbe golf course now just a flat gray table planted with young junipers and surrounded by wroughtiron fencing the road compressed to barely one lane and the brush along both sides thickened to high dark walls above them she could see the kinked and coiled branches of oak trees dwarfed by a black dome of sky a few stars struggled through haze the moon was oversized graywhite streaked with fog the smell of horse manure and dry dirt her headlights created an amber tunnel through the gloom she switched her high beams on continued at ten miles per suddenly the fire exit was there a single gate twelve feet high electric same iron motif as the main portals stout brick posts warning signs the card slot topped a steel post she stopped ten yards in pulled her flashlight from the glove compartment let the car idle and got out the horse aroma was stronger up here quiet not even a bird but she could hear the freeway baritone insistent remote she swept her flashlight across the road poorly maintained dusted with soil simkins claimed no one used the back exit but she could see the faint corrugation of tire tracks a few horse prints smaller ones that could be dog or coyote she was no gungho tracker dad could have helped her with prints keeping to the side of the road she walked to the gate then back repeated it the dirt was so compacted it didnt granulate under her feet some rust around the card slot another slot on the other side of the fence easy entry and exit and ramseys house was at the upper edge of the development meaning he wouldnt have to pass many neighbors to sneak out she thought about how hed do it wait till balch was asleep or put something in balchs drink to help sleep along then roll the mercedes out of the megagarage or the jeep if it had been brought back from montecito headlights off cruising slowly with houses so far from the road all those fences gates high foliage thered be no reason for anyone to notice people with pools and jacuzzis and home theaters and putting greens didnt sit by their front windows people who craved that level of privacy often pretended nothing existed beyond their four walls she took a closer look at the tire tracks degraded no tread marks she doubted theyd be of much use but still shed have loved to get a cast no way to do it without a warrant and no grounds for a warrant and now larry schick esq was on the scene forget approaching ramsey about anything even if they pulled a match to one of ramseys cars it had been four days since the murder ramsey could admit being up there claim hed taken a cruise in the hills trying to mellow out deal with his grief the hills great place to get rid of a body was estrella flores buried somewhere out there did the fire road lead anywhere other than out to the santa susannas she backed down till the nearest shoulder turned around and returned to the guardhouse simkins saw her coming put down his rolling stone and opened the exit gate his window was closed no desire to talk petra stopped alongside the booth he screwed up his mouth and came over his big moment over feeling down he wanted her gone find anything nope just like you said doug tell me where does the fire road go out into the mountains and then it connects to a bunch of little side roads doesnt it merge with the it kinda hooks back toward it but doesnt actually merge he managed to make the last word sound dirty but if i wanted to reach the freeway through the back roads i could yeah sure everything reaches the freeway i grew up in west hills we used to come out here hunt rabbits before they built this place sometimes theyd run onto the freeway get turned to freeway butter the good old days said petra simkinss weak face firmed with recollection and a resentful frown captured his features rich folk moving in on his childhood memories it can get beautiful out there he said real emotion longing at that moment she liked him a little better but not much sam says hey not bad ive been working all day going over and over the windows until there are no streaks mopping the wood floors using the pledge to shine them up ive done only half the seats but what i finished looks pretty good and the room has a nice lemon smell sam tries to give me the rest of the money im not finished yet i trust you sonny by the way now that you work for me are you ready to give me your name that catches me by surprise and bill pops out nice to meet you bill its been so long since anyones called me by my name since ive talked to

want to work tomorrow sure go ahead take the money i do he looks at his watch time to quit bill we dont want to be accused of exploiting the working man we walk outside and he locks the shul the alley is empty but i can hear the ocean through the space on the side of the building people talking on the walkway that big lincoln of his is parked crazy the front bumper almost touching the building he opens the drivers door so bye i say see you tomorrow bill he gets in the car and i start to walk away south away from that russian perv im liking the feel of all that money in my pocket but wondering where to go back to the pier but it was so cold and now i have money i hear a loud squeak turn and see sam backing the lincoln out of the alley he has plenty of room but he keeps backing up and stopping jerking the car the brakes are squeaking uhoh hes gonna hit the fence no he misses it i figure i should direct him before he hurts himself but he makes it turning the steering wheel with both hands his head kind of pushed forward like hes struggling to see through the windshield instead of driving forward he backs up stops next to me hey bill you really got somewhere to go for the night sure where the street ill be fine i start walking he stays next to me driving really slowly id give you money for a hotel but no ones gonna rent to a kid and if you show all that cash someones gonna take it from you im fine i repeat sure sure i cant let you sleep in the shul because what if you slip and fall we got a liability problem you might sue us i wouldnt do that he laughs no you probably wouldnt but i still cant listen i got a house not far from here plenty of room i live alone you wanna stay for a day or two fine till you figure out what to do no thanks that comes out kind of cold and i dont turn to see his face because i know hes going to look insulted suit yourself bill dont blame you someone probably hurt you you dont trust no one for all you know i could be some crazy

that to me im talking the second world war goddamn nazis ever hear about any of that sure i said learned about it in history history he laughs but not a funny laugh so who am i to tell you to trust

shul tonight only dont fall and break your neck and if you do dont sue us then he jams his car into reverse and backs up all the way to the shul its scary the way he weaves and swerves all over the place its a miracle he doesnt smash into anything petra opened her front door exhausted not feeling like a night owl anymore thought of kathy bishops ordeal tomorrow real problems no selfpity allowed for you kid she popped a can of coke checked the phone machine a longdistance phone service promised to be her slave if she signed up ron banks had called at seven leaving an number probably home please get back to him adele one of the civilian clerks at the station requesting the same thing at eightfifteen she would have loved to talk to ron first to be with him the two of them talking making out on the couch wherever that led business first she called adele hi detective connor got a message for you from pacific division a detective grauberg heres his number pacific was ilse eggermann territory had something new come up grauberg was out but a d named salant came on already spoke to you guys to who hold on says here captain schoelkopf guess grauberg couldnt reach to notify got kicked upward notify what got an auto carcass you were interested in black porsche registered to lisa boehlinger ramsey a carcass gutted gutted and left for the vultures probably a tijuana taxi by now got a witness says it was parked there for at least four days where behind the bus lot near pacific avenue the witness is one of the drivers gutted right from the beginning progressively gutted someone set fire to it last night thats how we got called in four days and not a single report you cant see it from the street salant added blocked by storage buildings we get hot cars stashed there all the time where is it now said petra downtown have fun she talked to several criminalists before locating a female named wilkerson who was working on the porsche the car was a charred shell no wheels seats engine front windshield like locusts swept in said wilkerson what about prints nothing so far ill let you know she drank coke and tried to put together lisas journey from doheny drive to griffith park where did venice fit in just a dumping ground for the porsche or had lisa driven it behind the bus yard meeting up with her date on a deserted street in a highcrime neighborhood was the lastdate scenario totally wrong had lisa indeed been carjacked and abducted forced to drive to venice by a stranger or by someone she knew setting out from doheny for a date with someone else the murderer watching stalking following pulling off the snatch ramsey would fit that picture venice kelly sposito darrell breshears current flame lived on fourth street walking distance from the bus yard where was breshears home base she looked him up in her pad the dmv data had him on ashland ocean park the border between santa monica and venice very close everything gravitating toward the beach including the boy if wils russian tipster could be believed breshear another former actor everyone performing news of the recovered car would be in the paper tomorrow she had to get to breshear before he had time to construct a story it was nearly pm was he with his wife or with kelly betting on the former she got dressed again and drove west ashland was a pretty sloping street in the best part of ocean park houses of all sizes every conceivable architectural style breshears place was at the top a small wellmaintained craftsman cottage with lots of cactus in the front thatches of sword plant instead of lawn white bmw ragtop in the driveway behind an iron gate bright lights over the gate hinted at a fantastic backyard view she rang the bell and breshear answered wearing a black tshirt and baggy green shorts holding a bottle of heineken when he saw her his eyes bulged this is a bad time he said my wife it could get worse she said i think you lied to me we found lisas car today right here in venice did you have a date with her sunday night if you did well find out he looked over his shoulder closed the door and came out and said can we move out to the sidewalk wont your wife get curious shes in the bath petra accompanied him to the sidewalk it wasnt really a date he said she just said she wanted to talk about what i dont know oh hell yeah she wanted to get it on so youd continued your relationship past those glorious seven days not really he said just once in a while maybe once a month your idea definitely not lisas one hundred percent my my said petra lisa kelly your wife whats her name by the way marcia breshear looked back at the house look busy guy said petra its no crime obstructing justice is i didnt obstruct anything it i had nothing to say that would help you because by the time i got there she was gone what would it look like saying i went to meet up with her that night staring at petra a black man we know what thats all about cut the racial crap said petra the only civil rights that were violated were lisas what time were you supposed to meet her tenthirty when did you set it up she set it up that day she called me at work around seven you were working sunday doing a final cut check with the lot guard i signed in i will said petra so lisa called you to get together she said she was lonely down had been sleeping all day took some coke now she was wired couldnt sit still how about a cruise the car always in the car a cruise said petra she wanted to get together at nine but i told her id be working till then had a date at kellys place right afterward but id see if i could slip out around tenthirty meet her behind the bus yard why there wed met there before its clandestine i didnt like it too much crime around there but lisa did the risk turned her on he shrugged petra said go on i had trouble getting out kelly kept me busy till after eleven finally i told her i needed to get some air was going to take a little drive i made it by eleventen or so and lisas car was there but she wasnt i waited around till eleventwenty figured shed showed up and left the car was there but she wasnt said petra that didnt worry you like i said lisa liked to take risks doing it at traffic lights a cop car right next to us coldwater canyon that kind of thing i figured maybe shed met up with someone else was having a good time which was okay with me i really didnt want to see her that night didnt want to see her at all but but what you know how it is i have trouble telling women no when did you get back to kellys had to be eleven twentyfive eleventhirty and you spent the night there thats the absolute truth the perfect alibi kelly gave you wasnt come on he said i was only out for half an hour max no way could i have made it to griffith you and kelly are both liable for perjury and obstruction said petra come on please youre making a big deal out of nothing petra walked up close to him pointed at his chest but didnt touch it at the very least you cost me a lot of hours mr breshear if theres anything else you know spill it now i dont thats it she stared him down he repeated i dont listen to me she said pointing again im not arresting you yet but dont even come close to thinking about going anywhere therell be police officers watching your house and the studio surveillance on kelly too you guys make the wrong move it all hits the fan including a nice long chat with marcia breshear blinked convulsively this feels good petra admitted to herself finally someone she could intimidate on this damn case as she walked away the front door opened and a womans voice said darrell honey who was that she drove back to her apartment head suddenly clear the basic structure of lisas last night alive taking form if breshear was finally being straight a meet at abducted between then and taken to griffith park at least a halfhour ride probably longer murdered between midnight and the car which one plyr plyr some other set of wheels ramsey with his multiple vehicles multiple houses fences gates larry schick was a nightmare suspect crime paid if you started out rich it was nearly eleven when she walked through the door too late to call him she did anyway four rings then a little girls munchkin voice said when you hear the beep leave a message beep and beep and beep and ron broke in banks hi its petra petra saying her name with pleasure she could use some adulation hows it going she told him about the porsche breshears revised story the new time frame think hes dirty unless his girlfriends lying bigtime about his alibi he didnt have the time but who knows whats up i phoned carpinteria sheriffs again asked if they could keep an eye on ramseys house they said theyd upped patrols already and today at six fortyfive i got a callback tried to reach you at your office but they said youd already left turns out ramsey hasnt been spotted there for a while but greg balch showed up this morning left his lexus and drove back in a jeep that belongs to ramsey license plate plyr zero said petra so you know already i knew ramsey owned the jeep didnt know balch picked it up didnt want to step on your toes calling carpinteria but id already made contact with them figured it would be efficient a deputy stopped balch driving off the property around noon balch showed him id a business card snapshot of him and ramsey keys to the house said he was there to pick up the car bring it down for service which seems odd there are plenty of mechanics in santa barbara an extracareful cleaning said petra or ramsey wanted a fourwheeler because he was planning to do some heavyterrain driving those hills maybe ramseys spooked now that youve got a potential witness maybe she told him about larry schicks call there you go he said anyway thanks again ron your daughter has a cute voice wha oh thats bee she loves to perform theyre both asleep now finally have your hands full it takes a while to get them tucked in my mom says they run rings around me tomorrow though i get to sleep in day off moms driving them to school good for you said petra i may just drive up to montecito tomorrow care to join me sure he said quickly its a pretty drive lying in bed in darkness so total she felt suspended she thought about lisa being abducted and butchered balchs picking up the jeep ramsey edgy because of a little boy who stole books wherever he was the fact that no one on the street knew him intrigued her he hadnt taken up with other runaways hadnt sought help from any agency a loner made sense a kid who loved to read wouldnt fit in hed probably been an outcast back home too so why hadnt he been reported missing where were the parents had to be abuse an elevenyearold intellectual running from god knew what a kid like that witnessing a murder no reason for him to trust anyone a survivor and now the police had turned him into quarry she had shed just fallen asleep when the phone rang it was well after midnight and her heart pounded as for one horrible irrational moment she panicked about her fathers condition then realized he was beyond worry one of her brothers in trouble kathy a nervoussounding woman said detective connor this is adele again from the station im really sorry to bother you this late but a call came in for detective bishop longdistance international and no one answers at his house youre his partner and seeing as its international i international from where vienna a police inspector named tauber i guess he didnt figure out the time difference thanks put him on a scratchy voice said detective bishop this is his partner detective connor ah yes yes this is inspector ottemar tauber from vienna clear connection the scratchiness was the austrians vocal quality he coughed cleared his throat a couple of times hello inspector is this about karlheinz lauch two days ago detective bishop submitted an inquiry concerning herr lauch said tauber we have located herr lauch for you unfortunately he is unavailable to you for questioning as he is deceased when did he die it appears to have occurred fifteen months ago what was the cause of death inspector it appears to have been cirrhosis of the liver a young man like that said petra tauber clucked his tongue these things happen lauch eliminated as a suspect for lisa meaning the similarities between lisa and ilse eggermann werent worth a damn or were they ramsey a multiple killer no too weird taubers call had burned away any drowsiness she was wired going into the kitchen she drank ice water paced sat down at the table got up and put on the stereo derek and the dominos thered been no music in the apartment since rons visit think think lauch eliminated for lisa meant concentrate on ramsey stalking lisa following her dv offenders were often obsessive it made sense did his dispatching balch to get the jeep mean the fourwheeler was the murder vehicle the mercedes a distraction just as shed wondered she recalled the way ramsey had flicked on the lights in the car museum showing her the gray sedan probably hoping shed ask for a look because he knew shed learn nothing balch doing the dirty work all at once maybe it was the dark room her fried nerves her mind took a hairpin turn what if balch was an active part of it or working for himself she sat there tight as a fiddle string viewing the case through a whole new prism just a slight shift of angle and everything changed balch as bad guy flashing back to all her hypotheses she inserted balchs name in ramseys slot everything fit lisa and balch yet another older man something romanticand financial because balch wrote the checks managed ramseys finances probably understood them better than the boss you heard about that all the time business managers soaking celebrities balch colluding with lisa to soak ramsey exwife and longsuffering lackey finding common ground in their resentment of the man with the dough lisa had talked to ghadoomian the broker about setting up investments being financially independent soon but shed never followed through daddy reneging on the fifty thou or other plans laid to waste had lisa gotten greedy leaned on balch caused their partnership to disintegrate petra thought about it for a long time balch was no prize but lisa was no conventional girl balchs motivation was no big puzzle bedding the quarterbacks ex the woman ramsey had failed to satisfy would be the ultimate thrill for an underachiever like him all those years protecting ramsey on the football field and in real life watching his own screen dreams fade as ramsey earned millions for all of balchs adoration of his buddy the payback had been limited ramsey hadnt helped balch progress past those first few graded flicks balch said he had no talent but the same was true for plenty of smalltime players surely ramsey could have gotten him something in the industry instead hed stuck balch in that dingy office shuffling papers while he himself lived a stars life why not a better office at least ramsey telling balch you dont deserve better what if balch finally decided he did with lisas help she liked taking risks had she stepped too far over the edge then something else hit her balch lived in rolling hills estates near palos verdes ilse eggermanns body had been dumped near marina del rey but her date with lauch had taken place in redondo beach just a few freeway stops away from the peninsula she pictured balch stopping off at the redondo pier for dinner or drinks watching ilse and lauch quarrel ilse walking out on lauch allowing balch to move in noticing ilse because she reminded him of lisa picking her up wouldnt have been that tough kindly older guy chivalrous ilse would have been vulnerable alone at night a foreigner after a pig like lauch balch might have even seemed suave the resemblance between lisa and ilse not a coincidence because balch had been lusting for lisa for years the underling always the underling balch rescues ilse tries for sexual payback gets shut down in a rage he butchers her gets away with it years later blackmailed up against the wall why not do it again she ran it through again balch managing to get out of the house while ramsey sleeps using the fire road driving one of ramseys cars but estrella flores spots him shed never liked balch in the first place might have viewed anything he did with suspicion he eliminates her one more time it still fit maybe in the morning it would seem ludicrous right now she liked it wil fournier had changed into his best suit for the date with leanna the macys model from ethiopia he didnt want to get close to the russian the guy oozed sleaze selling tshirts tourist crap the outward trappings of a legit business but those eyes that demeanor wil had worked wilshire bunco and fraud for two years collaborated with west hollywood sheriffs on lots of russian scams the weirdest case was five years ago an immigration racket strongarming new arrivals wil and a sheriffs d making a call to the apartment of one of the suspects the guy opening the door covered with blood holding a carving knife hed just dismembered another russian what had he been thinking answering the door like that sharing the bust wil found out he liked homicide transferred he was sure the souvenir vendor had run angles the way zhukanov had leaned over his counter giving him the eye all that junk hanging from every inch of the stall trying to stay cool like the whole thing didnt matter to him he was just a citizen trying to do his civic duty but wils mention of the twentyfive grand raised sweat on the russians pitted nose absolutely certain hed seen the kid it sounded to wil like hed practiced all day convincing himself because how could he be that sure petras drawing was good but to wil the kid didnt look that distinctive he smiled to himself all white kids looked the same right he was noncommittal with the russian took notes as zhukanov pointed north up ocean front where the kid had supposedly disappeared but when wil traipsed there showing the picture to café owners none of them knew a thing most of the other businesses were closed for the evening so he supposed a revisit was called for but he doubted it would produce anything this whole case had a futile smell to it he retraced his steps and the russian was still there way past closing time waving as wil passed him and headed toward his car leanna was due at loews in twenty minutes fivecourse dinner wine hed met her at a club those huge brown eyes sir zhukanov called out yes mr zhukanov i will keep my eyes open for you i call you when i see him again just what wil needed some moscow mafioso playing junior detective now here it was the next morning and all he could think about was the sun on leannas shoulders beautiful morning hed arrived at seven on the dot energized a bunch more crank tipster messages on his desk but the russian hadnt called so maybe the kid was gone from venice or more likely hed never been there those two tips from watson interested him a lot more two righteoussounding old women both thought they might have seen the boy in town he was still waiting for a callback from the watson sheriff his phone rang a new day dawns hey dubbayew its vee vee long time val vronek was a dii wil had worked narcotics with at wilshire now

kid was theyd turn him in themselves take the whole twentyfive didnt say the guy was smart wil just there and none of the assembled patrons jumped on the offer it was like all those who give a shit

smiled some swede or dane had invented the original one this one was made in korea pirated zhukanov had bought ten gross from an old moscow friend of his who worked the docks down in long beach a hundred bucks no questions asked a georgian named makoshvilli theyd busted heads together while in the army breaking up protests near the kremlin braining yids assorted cosmopolitan dirt he brought the trolls in a few at a time pocketed the cash fuck the boss vladimir zhukanov sergeant in the moscow police reduced to trafficking in toys america land of dreams hed claimed to be a yid to get over here paid a fortune to some immigration lawyer to lie for him bunked down in some west hollywood hovel full of yids while he tried to find a niche for himself in la a few months later yeltsin opened the gates to anyone the bastard the city was all niggers and brownies he had yet to find his niche hed driven a cab tried unsuccessfully to sell his headbusting services to a van nuys forgery ring managed to get into a west hollywood cartheft ring but couldnt hotwire fast enough so they fired him he worked nights for a while bouncing at a russian club on third street till some punks broke his nose five against one stupid club owners insisting no weapons how could they claim it was his fault now this five bucks an hour from the yid who owned the souvenir stand zhukanov skimmed at least percent regularly the yid knew it didnt care he was raking it in from twenty other stands all around the city living in hancock park buying that hooknosed wife of his diamonds one day zhukanov figured hed break into the house get those diamonds meanwhile he sold toys till now salvation in the form of the kid had to be him zhukanov had done his share of hunting knew what prey smelled like handing it to the nigger cop but the black bastard wasnt taking him seriously no wonder this multicultural shithole had so much crime nigger cops like having foxes guard chickens no way would he let that screw up his plans twentyfive grand meant out of here maybe a quick grab for the bosss diamonds fly to new york brighton beach coney island no shortage of outfits there whod welcome his talents but with that kind of money hed start his own business he was already selfemployed personal hunter of the kid how far could the little bastard have gone he was sure to turn up again and sergeant zhukanov would grab him a flash of optimism lightened his mood a little vodka maybe stop off somewhere for a nice meal starting tomorrow hed be on full alert friday morning petra woke thinking about balch as suspect it still made sense but so did ramsey which one of them both of them neither of them a horrible thought the report of lisas burnedout car was on page along with a smaller reprint of her drawing but nothing about the venice tip or those from watson so wil hadnt been forced to report yet as she showered and soaped her body she realized kathy bishops body was under the knife right now shed call stu later when things had settled meanwhile there were some details to take care of before she set out for montecito dr boehlingers hotel room didnt answer out already doing who knew what a recheck of missing persons brought no clue to estrella floress whereabouts and by am she was on her way to granada hills to pick up ron when she drove up he was standing at the curb holding a cell phone his house was a tiny tudor on a sunsplashed side street one story the sharply pitched shake roof and half timbers and pseudogables silly but somehow touching someone had cared enough to lay in details the grass was mown and edged but pale two rosebushes flanking the stone walkway were knobby with deadheads and half the oranges on a fifteenfoot valencia had browned he was at the car door before she shifted into park his hair was showermoist cowlicks sprouting like new wheat a blue vneck sweater yellow buttondown shirt and offwhite dockers made him look younger grad student business administration oxblood penny loafers somewhere along the trajectory from rock drummer to cop hed touched upon preppy dressed casually he looked much younger maybe younger than she did hi she said he got in hi limescented aftershave he hadnt worn that the first time that seemed like years ago he made no move toward her now locked the door and put the phone in his lap explaining just in case my mom needs to call i should move into the twentieth century finally get one of those get one of those handsoff deals he said talk in the car make everyone think youre psychotic and theyll leave you alone laughing she pulled away from the curb wondering if she should mention the theory jolt about balch no too speculative at this point he had years on her he was a rescuer she wanted to look smart in front of him as she drove they chatted small talk but intelligent he gave off an air of stability too boring for the spanish equestrienne or would he reveal some grubundertherock dark side if she waited long enough you are one untrusting broad thank you nick beautiful day she heard him say his hands were quiet now no gripping of the door handle or other signs of anxiety about her driving the loafers looked freshly polished sharp crease in the dockers wasnt that sort of an antidockers thing petra smiled at the thought of him wanting to impress her by the time they reached the onramp they were really talking she sped through the west valley past ranchhaven into thousand oaks newbury park camarillo the produce fields and fertilizer stink of oxnard at ventura ron pointed out a golf n stuff on the east side of the freeway telling her he sometimes took his girls there they also had ubump cars and miniboats the latter a lot of fun if you dont mind getting wet getting all enthusiastic but the bounce went out of his voice when petra thinking about balch again said sounds cute if youre into that kind of thing he added embarrassed i am she said hastening to salvage the conversation grew up in arizona didnt see too many boats mini or otherwise after we solve the case lets stop off on the way back and get wet he didnt answer she turned her head far enough to catch the blush on his neck oh jeez how could a size shoe fit completely in a mouth or she said we could golf but only after we solve lisa were gonna wrap the whole thing up today right sure he said grinning arizona didnt they move london bridge there she exited at santa ynez asking him do you know montecito only by reputation which is rich pulling to the side of the grovebordered road she consulted her thomas guide located ramseys street two miles in a pair of right turns and a left and resumed driving montecito was ten degrees cooler than la a perfect sixtyeight private groves bordered santa ynez road rich indeed petra had been up to santa barbara a few times with nick sunday outings eating seafood on the pier scorning the sidewalk art theyd passed montecito on the freeway nick rhapsodizing about the estates great spanish architecture old money real class it made beverly hills look like crap getting into one of his blindambition grooves going on about how one day theyd have enough money to get a place there but hed never pulled off to show her she picked up speed no town in sight yet just the clean stretch of asphalt cutting through the umber fudge and chlorophyll of old trees coral bursts of bougainvillea oranges and lemons sparkling like gems the sky was blue the clouds were white a clean yellow sun rose from behind the mountains diecut sharp black dabbed with lavender what a place ramsey had all this and the place in calabasas the cars the real estate money wasnt everything but it sure made things nice what led rich people to screw things up so badly she looked over at ron and from his expression she guessed he was asking himself the same thing montecitos business district was four corners of earthtone lowrise upscale shops then more road ramseys street was skinny darkened by shaggy eucalyptus his property at a dead end announced by bluegray stone posts and a high black scrollwork gate wide open a carpinteria sheriffs car blocked the entrance one deputy standing near the drivers door hand on holster another facing the vehicle hands on hips welcoming party petra said to ron did you tell them we were coming no as they got closer the deputy at the front of the squad car walked into the center of the road and halted them with his palm petra stopped by the time the deputy reached them she had her badge out he studied it a kid tall husky red crew cut two weeks of rusty mustache swollen biceps he looked over at ron banks la sheriffs i spoke to captain sepulveda yeah he told us since the murder weve been upping our patrols anyway good thing just caught a trespasser he hooked a thumb right now said petra he made it easy left the gates open looks like a nutcase verbally abusive claims hes ramseys fatherinlaw petra squinted at the cruiser through the rear window dr boehlingers goateed face seethed she watched boehlinger butt the glass with his shoulder then retract clearly in pain a surgeon brilliant the deputy watching him must have said something because boehlinger started screaming too far away to hear but his mouth was wide open the window glass gave him a preserved look rage in a jar she said he is ramseys fatherinlaw come on said the redhaired cop his name was forbes dr john everett boehlinger didnt he have id yeah thats what his id said but that didnt mean anything to us forbes grimaced he sure doesnt act like a doctor got a toilet mouth whatd you catch him doing coming out of a toolshed out back the door was smashed he obviously kicked it in was carrying a shovel looked to us like he was planning to break a window in the house do an unlawful entry so hes really her father come on petra nodded shit forbes cracked massive knuckles his demeanor we figured a loony for sure and he was talking crazy bodies buried out here he was gonna dig them up we had to restrain him hands and feet kind of tough hogtying an old guy like that but he tried to bite us forbes looked at his hand smooth and tan at the end of the buffed arm the thought of bodily injury was a narcissistic insult working in a rich quiet town hed actually managed to keep himself smooth small guy he added but incredibly feisty finally we got him quiet enough to untie his feet didnt want a heart attack or anything he shook his head her fathershit where does he say bodies are buried said petra we didnt ask we figured him for a loonytunes starfucker we get them from time to time all the hollywood types with second homes up here tabloid reporters too weve been preparing ourselves for problems with ramsey had any not till now maybe no one knows hes got a weekend place here yet does ramsey come up here much ive never seen him but maybe he comes up at night lots of the hollywood types do flying up at night to santa b in copters or private planes or they just limo straight up from la the whole thing with them is not to be spotted its like a game you know im famous but you cant see me they never come into town to shop have people doing things for them and with the size of these properties its not like theyve got real neighbors petra took in the surroundings long stretches of tenfoot wall on both sides through ramseys gate was a winding stone motor path flanked by palms the guy loved palms who takes care of ramseys house when hes not here she said forbes shrugged probably a cleaning crew there is a regular gardening crew comes here tuesday and i think saturday forbes touched an eyelash scratched the side of his nose ramseys also got a gofer comes up to check out the house i ran into him on patrol a couple of days ago greg balch said petra yeah thats the one the other deputy had turned his back to the cruiser shorter darker than forbes thick arms crossing a barrel chest another buffboy department must have a good gym switching cars said petra yeah a lexus still parked behind the house at first it looked funny but he had the keys a letter from ramsey authorizing him to drive all his cars thumping noises sounded from the patrol car dr boehlinger kicking the window why dont you let him out said petra you wanna take custody of him i want to talk to him it took a long time to calm boehlinger down he was wearing a gray washington u sweatshirt baggy gray tweed wool trousers probably from an old suit and white sneakers flecks of spit whitened the corners of his mouth wisps of hair flew at random angles and his goatee looked grizzled finally thirty seconds of silence earned him unlocked cuffs the moment his hands were free he brandished fists at the deputies you stupid fucking imbeciles forbes and the shorter man beckel ignored him before uncuffing him theyd held the little man at arms length as he shouted and kicked a cartoon situation now they headed back to their cruiser conferring with ron as petra ushered boehlinger to her car idiots boehlinger shouted he coughed spit phlegm into the dirt started to rant again petra tightened her grip on his shoulder he was shaking like a lapdog still frothing at the mouth braindamaged idio please doctor dont please me young la propelling him faster petra talked into his ear dr boehlinger i know youve been through hell but if you dont settle down well be forced to let them arrest you boehlinger said youre an idiot too that butcher walks free bodies pile up and you threaten me goddamn all of you ill have you all collecting welfare bodies where said petra in there boehlinger jabbed toward the gate behind the pond there must be a god i came to get into the house go through the butchers papers some evidence of what he did to lisa but i saw a helluva lot more than i bargained for what kind of evidence were you looking for doctor anything boehlinger said quickly what made you think ramseyd left any evidence behind i didnt think i hoped lord knows you people havent done a damn thing i dip into my own pocket and you dont have the brains and the decency to follow dr boehlinger petra said firmly what evidence were you hoping to find here silence boehlingers watery blue eyes lowered i didnt have a clear concept but what could it hurt this is the place he beat my lisa whats to say he didnt write notes to himself or something lisa wrote stop interrupting my train of thought young lady the point is i went to find something to break the window the shovel no no no i chose the shovel after i saw it i was looking for a chisel to pry the lock im good with tools the last sentence a pathetic boast look mom im useful sulfurous breath blew out from between boehlingers lips his eyes were frightened maybe he hadnt been the best father in the world but lisas death had ripped him up such a small man petra said you switched from the chisel to the shovel after after i saw the grave behind that pond of his a grave how can you be put your money on it said boehlinger fresh excavation about six feet long far side of the pond plants trampled plants missing ive been here before after the wedding the bastard was trying to impress me i have an eye for detail saw the difference right away is the pond plumbed said petra maybe thered been a repair and maybe charles mansons the popedesignate dont be stupid young lady ive assisted at autopsies seen my share of crimescene photos i know what a grave looks like ron came back saying looks like youre off the hook for now doctor boehlinger huffed forbes waved from the cruiser and petra went over okay hes yours hope youre taking him straight back to la we will eventually said petra eventually were in a bit of a bind deputy he claims he saw a fresh grave on the ramsey property but we have no jurisdiction cant step onto the property to check a grave youre taking his bull seriously given the details of our case we cant afford to ignore it oh come on burying someone right here petra shrugged oh man forbes turned and said gary to beckel who was sitting in the car writing an incident report the shorter deputy had a broad stoic face and a meaty chin forbes filled him in beckel said what some kind of serial killer or something itll probably turn out to be nothing said petra on the other hand if something did occur its your jurisdiction we cant just go in there said forbes no warrant youve already been in there because of dr boehlingers trespassing obvious criminal behavior gave you clear grounds for entry once on the premises you apprehended a suspect then noticed something amiss fresh excavation oh come on said forbes youre putting our nu putting us in a position okay said petra but ill have to write this up for my boss and you can bet the first thing boehlingers going to do when he gets back is contact the media hes already played that game forbes cursed under his breath beckel said lets call it in chick yeah said forbes im calling my boss when petra returned to the car dr boehlinger was sitting in the backseat with ron talking animatedly dryeyed still tense but conversing at normal volume ron listened intensely nodding boehlinger smiled ron smiled back said interesting extremely interesting said boehlinger petra got in the drivers seat so said boehlinger i told them i thought they should take you seriously doctor theyre notifying their superiors in their case said boehlinger that encompasses most of the world petra couldnt help herself she laughed ron said doctor in a prompting tone boehlinger cleared his throat i apologize for everything i said before detective connor not necessary doctor yes it is ive been a rude lout but you have no idea what its like to lose everything true said petra suddenly she pictured kathy bishop under the knife it was almost noon kathy was probably out of surgery chest stitched how much had been taken from her petra resolved to call the hospital soon so tell me doctor said ron those autopsies you mentioned were they part of your duties as er chief or special consultations that was years ago ron said boehlinger wistfully ron back when i was chief resident i actually deliberated going into pathology spent some time with the st louis coroners back in those days the place was a regular new man dr banks master psychologist shuffling sounds drew petras eyes to the side window forbess big feet scraping asphalt okay he said looking at petra avoiding boehlinger the boss is coming then well have a look at this socalled grave captain sepulveda was a blocky silverhaired man around fortyfive with brownsuede skin and an impeccable uniform he arrived in an unmarked with a third deputy went onto ramseys property alone and emerged moments later ordering all three officers inside petra and ron and boehlinger waited in the car as boehlinger rambled on about medical school graduating top of his class multiple triumphs as an er doctor twenty minutes later sepulveda appeared dirt streaks on his shirt rubbing his palms together a few athletic steps brought him to petras side his eyes were slits so compressed petra wondered how he could see looks like we have a body female buried four feet down maggots some deterioration but plenty of tissue still on it so its been days not weeks maybe two days said petra thinking had the car exchange been just a cover for balchs trip older hispanic female approximately fivetwo oneforty the razorcut eyes dipped at the outer corners you know her i believe i do you might also want to have a look at that black lexus look for what blood sleeping indoors is great at first i woke up every hour but then i was okay the brown blankets sam brought me are rough but warm the sheets and pillows smell of old guy before i turned out the lights i lay there looking up at the shuls ceiling the red bulb in the silver holder hanging in front of that ark sam never said not to sleep in the shul but i figured it wouldnt be respectful so i set myself on the floor near the back door next to the bathroom every so often i could hear a car drive through the alley and once i heard someones feet shuffling outside probably someone dumpsterdiving and it made me lose breath for a few seconds but i was okay i think i fell asleep watching the red bulb sam told me it wouldnt go off was something called an eternal light to remind the jews of god then he laughed and said wishful thinking eh bill the bulb dies every couple months i get up on a ladder take my life in my hands he tossed me a bagel left and locked the door its and ive been up ten minutes i can see the colored glass windows in front of the shul get brighter i want to go outside and have a look at the ocean but i dont have the key to the front door shaking out and folding the blankets and sheets i wash off in what sam calls the gents and finish the rest of last nights bagel then opening the back door an inch i look through the airs cool cold even with tons of salt in it the alley is empty i step outside make my way around the side of the shul to the front of the walkway no ones out just gulls and pigeons the oceans dark gray with spots of light in a few places like orangepink freckles the tides coming in very softly then rolling back out like someone tilted the earth back and forth this whooshwhoosh rhythm i think of something i once saw on tv panning for gold gods tilting the whole planet looking for something valuable i stand there watching and listening then i think of that woman in the park and how shell never see the ocean again i shut my eyes tight and blow out those thoughts thinking of the ocean the air how salty it smells how i like that smell how this is the end of the earth this is as far as you can run theres some litter on the walkway papers and beer bottles and soda cans but everything still looks beautiful quiet and empty and beautiful not a single other person i will always love being alone now the sky behind me starts to brighten up more and the skin of my arm turns gold and i spot the sun rising humongous and eggyolk yellow i cant feel any heat yet but with a sun that big i know it will be coming now im not alone anymore from the south maybe a block away i see a guy coming toward me on roller skates wearing nothing but a bathing suit holding his hands out like hes trying to take off and fly the picture is ruined i go back to the shul sams lincoln is there parked crazy as usual and i find him in the shul looking at a book good morning i say he turns around fast closing the book he doesnt look happy where were you outside outside to see the ocean the ocean why is he repeating everything i say he puts the book down walks toward me and for a second i think hes going to hit me and im ready to defend myself but he goes past me and checks the back door to make sure its locked stands with his back to the door definitely unhappy do you want me to leave i say did i do something wrong he blows out air and rubs his neck we got a problem bill he takes something out of his pocket a piece of newspaper this is yesterdays edition he says dealing with you kept me busy i didnt get to it until this morning he unfolds it and shows it to me i see the word murder then a drawing of a kid me i try to read the article but the words are jumping up and down so is my stomach my heart starts pushing against my chest i feel cold and my mouth is dry i keep struggling to read but nothing makes sense its like a foreign language blinking i clear my eyes but the words are still weird and jumping i grab the paper from him and hold it close finally start to understand the woman who got killed in the park has a name lisa i have to think of her as lisa now lisa boehlingerramsey her exhusbands an actor cart ramsey a show called the adjustor ive heard of it i think moron used to watch it someones offering twentyfive thousand dollars to find me i run for the back door sam doesnt try to stop me as i reach for the knob my feet freeze where can i go its going to be a hot bright day full of people out for that money the sunlight will uncover me someone maybe a bunch of them will grab me and tie me up and turn me in sams still standing there you can stay here all day but remember tonights friday services thirty forty alter kocker worshipers showing up a half hour before dark nothing i can do about it im not breathing great and my chest feels tight i open my mouth wide to capture some air but not much comes in my stomach hurts worse than it ever did and my hearts still bumping against my chest chuck chuck just like what happened to lisa one thing you might consider bill twentyfive thousands a lot of money if you do know something about this why not be a good citizen and help yourself in the bargain i dont know anything he shrugs fine i accept that its not you just some kid who looks like you but with the resemblance how are you gonna traipse around i slept so well last night but now im tired just want to lie down i sit down on a shul bench and close my eyes to see something like that bill of course youre scared i know i saw terrible things too i keep my eyes glued shut you see things like that you wish you didnt because you know itll change you thats the big difference in this world bill people whore forced to see terrible things and everyone else getting away with the easy life i wont tell you its good to see it stinks no one would choose it the only good thing is you can get strong from it i dont have to tell you that you already got strong being out there taking care of yourself you did a good job considering what you been through you did great its true bill youre handling things great hes saying nice things trying to make me feel better why does it feel like a punch in the stomach one part of my brain he goes on is saying call the cops protect him no no dont worry im not gonna do it im just telling you whats going on in my brain the other part must be the strong part is reminding me of what happened to me when i wasnt much older than you remember those nazis i told you about some of them were cops devils in uniform so its not always simple is it a guy wants to do the right thing not break the law but its just not that simple is it he reaches out and touches my shoulders dont worry youre safe with me he means it it makes me feel good why does it also make me bend over so low my foreheads almost touching the floor and now my eyes hurt too and i cant stop myself from rocking back and forth and my bodys shaking and im crying like a damn baby i just cant stop it with everything thats happened why cry now wil fournier returned from schoelkopfs office thinking could have been worse the captain had been irritable but distracted a meeting this afternoon with deputy chief lazara including your case which i assume is stagnating schoelkopfs face started to redden wil headed him off by volunteering the russians tip when did this come in late last night the guys a lowlife i figured id do some checking on him first check later its a solid tip and i want you back in venice searching for the kid wheres barbie wil wondered about that himself dont know schoelkopf glared at him tight team you guys are running hows kens wife i imagine shes being operated on right now sir shell probably be okay young woman like that okay back to the beach fournier if the kids there i want him found schoelkopf picked up his phone straight to the media no one could see him but hed put on a media smile before leaving for venice fournier followed up on the two tips from watson nothing new from one old woman but the second a mrs kraft said she was pretty sure the boy lived in a trailer park on the south end of town lowclass place she said they started it years ago for retired people but trash moved in the boys family is trash said wil if he lives there they probably are but you dont know a name no sir im just saying i think he lived there because i think i seen him around there when i was out with my dog my dogs a sweetie pie but the boy didnt come near jet like he was afraid of animals this happened twice im not sure its him but i think so okay thanks mrs kraft said fournier whats the name of the trailer park sleepy hollow she said like that book the ghost story he called the watson sheriff and got a busy signal could you believe that just as he tried again brian olson the d at the next desk waved at him someone for you on my line fournier went over to olsons desk and olson used the break to get coffee fournier detective this is sheriff albert mccauley from watson california woulda got back to you sooner but i was attending a firearms conference up in sacramento ever been to one of those very educational low drawling voice plenty of free time not yet said wil educational mccauley repeated so what can i do for you fournier had left detailed messages what was this mayberry rfd he told mccauley about the boy and the trailer park runaway huh said the sheriff yeah the hollows a scruffy place not much crime though anywhere in watson for that matter quiet here only real problems we get is when the migrants blow in and hit the tequila the kid had run from something thought fournier if you could check sheriff sure no problem got some things to catch up on first then ill go over and talk to the hollow manager see if he can id this boy you say it was in the la paper two days ago dont usually read the la papers not too friendly to law enforcement are they depends said wil noncommittal i can fax you the drawing sure do that wil thanked him again and hung up resolving to call the sleepy hollow manager himself if he didnt hear back from mccauley by late afternoon he spent another two hours following up with shelters and social workers and headed west having lunch at an italian place on the third street mall in santa monica then drove to venice a beautiful afternoon at the beach was wasted talking to shopkeepers restaurant managers old folks bodybuilders rollerbladers tourists who looked at him like he was crazy some people were scared of him despite the suit and a flip of the badge black skin maybe one day hed get used to the reaction but probably not sleazeball zhukanov was back behind his souvenir counter and the first time wil passed the stand he ignored the russians hostile stare on the way back he stopped asked zhukanov if hed seen anything the russian shook his head and pushed stringy hair out of his face greasy face full of pits pus pimple in the fold of his left nostril zhukanovs beard was a poor excuse for facial hair unevenly trimmed a blemish not an adornment the guy didnt believe in deodorant either whod buy toys from him zhukanovs eyelids drooped not yet but i keep eyes open do that wil started to walk away zhukanov said how can i call you without number wil fished out a business card and placed it on the counter ignoring zhukanovs outstretched palm hatred filled the russians eyes he picked a troll doll off the rack and put the tiny figures neck between two fingers wil left wondering if hed decapitate the thing it was already and he was due at the cave by for val vroneks signal about the fat bikers arrival the value of that seemed less than iffy probably just another fool out for the twentyfive thou but digging dry wells was part of the job he called into the station nothing from sheriff mccauley so either the watson lawman had checked out sleepy hollow and located the kid in question or hadnt bothered yet either way wil was annoyed the only message was from petra area code he returned it the mobile customer you are trying to reach is either away from the vehicle or obtaining a number for the sleepy hollow rv park and recreational facility he phoned got another taped message another drawling voice quiet place mccauley had said more like zombie town he called leanna asked her phone machine whether she was free for a late dinner tonight lets say ninethirty ten another try at petras cell phone same outcome it was nearly seven and he was ready to kill the first machine he met he walked along the beach found a quiet bench and sat down to enjoy the ocean for a while watching the seagulls and the pelicans he loved those pelicans the way they just cut through the air no effort very cool birds god it was gorgeous here if you concentrated on the water forgot about the people then he found himself turning around scanning the walkway just in case the kid happened by wouldnt that be something a precious accident unable to relax now he found another bench one that put his back to the water and his eyes on business at he was on hollywood boulevard drinking an orange whip at a snack stand a few storefronts down from the cave the nightcrawlers were already out punks dopers heshes shehes all kinds of its more dumb tourists small groups of marines on leave those kids always got into trouble with their shaved heads they looked just like skinners maybe some of them were as he sucked down the sweet freezing drink he saw something that really cracked him up pudgy girl around nineteen shaved head except for one of those roostercomb deals leading a guy of the same age around on a leash saying get going get going the guy was skinny pale mute had a romantic smile on his face fournier sipped a little more whip tossed the cup and ambled by the cave harleys were lined up in front of the bar even from here you could hear the music some kind of country rock way too much bass a halfopen door offered a glimpse of dark room wil kept walking made it to the corner pretended to examine the cheesy clothes in a store window turned around when he reached the bar the second time val vronek was coming out all leathered and chained looking almost as greasy as the russian the undercover man paused just left of the doorway lit up a cigarette caught wils eye for a half second his left cheek twitched and he gave his head a very small shake no fat boy wil took a stroll fifteen minutes later vee communicated the same thing made sure no one was watching flashed ten fingers three times see you in thirty half hour later still no sign of the guy val lit up a cigarette walked to one of the harleys checked the chain lock loped down the street to the corner a few minutes later wil followed he found the undercover d in the darkened doorway of an apartment building just off the boulevard black windows city condemnation notice on the door sorry guy was probably full of shit said vee or maybe he watches tv what was on tv your kid didnt you see it havent been sitting in a bar all day vee smiled six oclock news dubba some tipster put him in venice maybe fat boy decided i wasnt worth dealing with and went there straight just came from venice said wil and the tipster had any of the bikers on the walkway matched fat boys description no he would have noticed that he hoped vee said if he shows up ill call you gotta get back to scroteville his face was glassy with sweat hot gig said wil hell would be a vacation dubba and the smells something else not that youll ever get a chance to know being dusky wil chuckled hey membership has its privileges leaving vronek his beeper number in case fat boy showed up he drove home wondering if leanna had called back maybe shed tried his apartment thinking him back already logical it was nearly ninethirty hed sure given the citizens full service today the beep came just as he pulled into his driveway he read the number sheriff mccauley gee thanks pard finally moseyed on down to the ol holler didja collecting his mail he entered his ground floor flat checked the phone no leanna uncapping a bottle of heineken he called mccauley complications said the sheriff no more drawl none of that countrybumpkin friendliness got a tentative id on your kid the manager idd him names billy straight william bradley straight twelve years old approximately five feet seventyfive eighty pounds no ones seen him for months the mother was unemployed living on welfare always months behind on the rent no father that anyones ever seen not a good situation but the boy never gave any trouble gone for months but no one in peaceful quiet zombieville had bothered to report it thought wil even country lanes could be mean streets what did the mother say about his disappearance sheriff thats the complication when i went over to talk to her i found her dead in the trailer looks like a couple days or so contusions to the occipital portion of the skull some lividity beginnings of rigor some blowfly maggots the trailer was hot probably hastened the process but neighbors saw her two mornings ago so that helps fix the tod byebye andy griffith hello quincy there was blood on the edge of a dresser so it looks like she fell backwards and hit her head on the counter or was pushed shes got some old bruises on her too there was a boyfriend living with her for a while and all of a sudden hes gone biker type loser with a petty record we got an id on him too from fellows at the local bar buell erville moran white male thirty years old sixone twoninety brown hair blue eyes reddish muttonchop sideburns said wil youve got him no but we want him there was enough skin on estrella floress face for petra to make the id the maids throat had been slashed ear to ear but no other wounds were evident none of the overkill butchery visited upon lisa made sense she supposed lisa was passion this was snipping loose ends balch or ramsey or both neither was no longer a viable choice dr boehlinger wanted to stay but sepulveda had deputy forbes drive him back to la a match made in hell that caused petra to grin inwardly despite the horror of the situation poor estrella talk about wrong place wrong time still wearing her pink uniform shed probably been taken care of on tuesday or wednesday driven up here on wednesday had to be late wednesday or thursday morning the day balch had been spotted leaving because shed interviewed him wednesday evening and the lexus had been parked in front of the players management building empty clean in contrast with the mess in the office had the deed already been done had estrella been lying in that trunk during the interview she and ron stood back as the local techs worked hustling to finish up before darkness changed the game ramseys montecito spread was huge the house old and stately cream stucco and red tile real spanish no bell tower none of the crazy angles of the calabasas castle giant oaks shaded the acre closest to the building the landscaping took the shade into account ferns clivia camellia azalea lovely pathways of degraded granite had been laid out expertly the property dipped leading the eye down to the pond a hundredfoot disc of green water set out in full light white and pink lilies claimed half the surface flamecolored dragonflies zoomed past like tiny aircraft a bronze heron stooped to drink cattails and more lilies in the background yellow white with amethyst centers petra could see the missing foliage that had tipped dr b to the grave precise eyes indeed the techs were concentrating on the black lexus the interior was onyx leather black carpeting covered the trunk not the easiest surfaces for spotting bloodstains but one of the criminalists thought he saw a patch the size of a dime on the inside of the trunk door and luminol confirmed it nothing on the car seats but the test brought up rorschachlike blots of blood all over the carpet id say about a pint said captain sepulveda if that meaning he killed her somewhere else wrapped her in something and it leaked out then he shampooed the trunk i could smell it figured if it looked clean it was talking softly unhappy about being drawn in petra wondered if hed ever been a homicide d he said we better get some warrants for the house and the grounds who knows what else is out here he turned to face petra and his slit eyes must have focused on her though she couldnt see enough iris to tell im going to talk to a judge right now whats next for you balch drove the car up here so hes obviously a suspect she said im calling this in to my captain asking to put out a warrant whether or not balch was working for ramsey remains to be seen but i dont doubt this murders related to ours i need balch and ramsey located asap telling not asking fine said sepulveda i should be back within the hour any questions talk to sergeant grafton he indicated a slim attractive darkhaired woman in plainclothes taking notes by the side of the pond he left and ron handed petra the cell phone she phoned wil fournier first away from his desk she left the number schoelkopf was out too meetings all afternoon but she convinced a clerk to track him down he called five minutes later i was with lazara this better be good seems pretty good to me sir she told him shit okay we pick up both of them pronto ramseys hiding behind lawrence schick i know that so we yank the bastard the hell out from behind schicks skirts just to talk not an arrest you stay there be an eagle eye dont lose control of the situation and keep the goddamn phone line open balch lives in rolling hills estates said petra his office is in studio city ive got both addresses go she read off the numbers schoelkopf clicked off ron said i should call in too hector and my mom were not getting out of here for a while she returned the phone nifty little ericsson is this private gear or department private ill reimburse you he smiled and punched numbers the lexus was being winched to a tow truck techs were setting up tape and post perimeters near the burial site sergeant grafton paced off the area pointing and instructing a santa barbara county coroners station wagon drove up and two men in white got out with a folding stretcher estrella floress corpse was small those bowed legs the gaping throat wound exposing a corrugated flash of trachea ron couldnt find de la torre but he connected with his mother and petra walked away to give him privacy thinking about the call shed have to make to javier flores schoelkopf had ordered her to keep the line open to hell with him it was rons phone let the department buy her one the tow truck backed out manipulating the lexus around oaks moments later the coroners guys carried the body to the wagon and followed the garden looked trampled fronds and leaves bent over broken petra smelled a hint of ocean pacific currents managing to make it this far inland lilies swayed the yellow tape danced ron came back and gave her the phone well she said it started out as a nice day still is he moved closer to her and his fingers touched hers for a second taking hold of her index finger he squeezed gently and let go he was staring straight ahead drummers hands tapped a beat on the side of his thighs but his eyes seemed serene he loves this she thought hell do homicide as long as they let him the phone beeped connor schoelkopf said talked to attorney schick he and ramsey are on their way up there what about balch ramsey said he was supposed to be in his office we called there got no answer same thing happened to me the time i interviewed him said petra he was in but didnt pick up the phone whatever ive got officers headed there right now and rolling hills has agreed to pay a house call whys ramsey coming here she asked its his house barbie hes very upset motor slept lousy and now the headache was a killer no blanket no pillow just his leather jacket on the warped floor of an abandoned apartment on edgemont plywood over the windows and some sign about earthquakes on the door told him it was his place for the night he used his buck knife to pry the board up from the back door rolled his scoot inside and pushed it around from room to room they were all the same tiny no furniture light fixtures or plumbing graffiti all over the walls linoleum pebbled with mouse shit cockroach carcasses oil stains empty bottles the room he finally chose was in the back the whole building smelled of mold and wet dog insect casts burnt matches and the worst thing a chemicallike stink that made his eyes water but it was dark and he was wiped out from riding all day walking around hollywood the place seemed mostly the same then over to griffith park to scope out the rug rats territory but the park ended up being too big to get a handle on why the hell would a little fuck need such a goddamn big place he bought three hot dogs with kraut washed it down with a chocolate malt and cruised over to the cave parking his scoot with all the others in front hoping no one would look close inside he hoped for brotherhood had to spend his last dough on beer when no one offered to buy him one eating three pickled eggs and stuffing some slim jims in his pocket before the bartender evileyed him no one gave a shit about the picture of the rat everyone was watching fuck films on bigscreen tv when some chick did something especially nasty up on the screen a low growl of support rose up from the bar forty fifty crankglazed eyes fixed on cum shots no interest in making twentyfive big ones except for one dude who didnt really seem that interested either but said he might know something motor arranged to meet with him at eight tomorrow maybe hed bother maybe he wouldnt so might as well bunk down not exactly the holiday inn but nothing he hadnt seen before even though the chemicals gave him a headache the aloneness turned him on like the time he was celling with a greaser in perdido a dui rap three days of inhaling the motherfuckers stale farts ready to strangle him and then the fourth day they took the guy away because it turned out he had federal warrants aloneness was like someone massaging your body only there was no one there just the feeling now it was friday morning ten oclock his eyes were swollen and all he wanted to do was cut off this fucking head so he could replace it with one that didnt feel like it was about to explode pissing on the floor of an adjoining room he spit out morning taste rubbed his eyes till they focused and wheeled his scoot outside into the sun strong mf sun that didnt help either he was hungry had no money time to go to work it took him two hours to find a mexican chick walking all alone on a side street no little gangbangers to protect her honor he drove past her stopped got off walked toward her and she was scared right away but he passed her by and she relaxed and thats when he turned around and grabbed her purse and shoved her to the ground telling her dont fucking move she didnt understand the words but she got the tone of voice he kicked her in the ribs just to make sure walked as fast as his bulk would allow to his scoot and drove a mile away twentythree bucks in the purse along with a tin cross and pictures of little mex kids in some kind of costumes he took the money threw the rest of it down a storm drain drove back to the boulevard found the same stand where hed bought the hot dogs and got two more along with a fried egg on a muffin with hot sauce on the side extralarge coffee that he drained and refilled an apple turnover and one of those little containers of milk like he used to get in school and jail now he was ready for a days labor he walked the picture up and down the boulevard again got nothing but dirty looks was hungry again by three forced himself to continue for another couple of hours till he finally couldnt stand it anymore figuring hed earned a real meal he went over to gojis and used up most of the mex chicks money on a corned beef sandwich fries onion rings double banana split more coffee telling the nigger waitress to keep filling his cup till she just left him a pitcher someone had left parta the paper in his booth but it was nothin but words the tv over the counter was going news sports weather dead stuff then he saw the rats picture again stopped eating bananas smothered with whipped cream and paid attention his heart was zooming away the coffee and he was totally awake and ready to do something anything asshole on tv saying something about the beach reported to have been spotted near ocean front walk in venice so fuck the dude at the cave time to putt west after dark if the rat saw him it wouldnt be good larry schick wore a cheaplooking brown suit that probably cost three thousand dollars all puckered around the lapels and sagging on his meager frame instead of a handkerchief in the breast pocket he carried an ornately carved meerschaum pipe the bowl hung out like a talisman womans head creepy the attorney was younger than petra expected early to midforties with a very tan pencilpoint face jetblack prince valiant do and pinkplasticframed eyeglasses snakeskin cowboy boots like one of those english rock stars trying to stretch the hip thing into middle age he and ramsey arrived at the montecito house just after six schick behind the wheel of a black rollsroyce silver spur malibu colony sticker on the windshield a bunch of club emblems fastened to the grille another car boy ramsey got out first he wore a faded denim shirt black jeans running shoes looked even older than the last time shed seen him taking in the scene he shook his head schick came around from the drivers side and touched his elbow petra and ron were with them before they could take another step ramsey kept staring at the crime tape the estate was quiet now only a few techs still working no word from sepulveda on the warrants yet sergeant grafton remained stationed near the pond shed introduced herself a while back first name anna bright art history degree from ucsb which gave them something to talk about during the dead time she was flying to switzerland next week major burglary old masters we recovered almost all of them itll never hit the papers no interest in homicide no attempt to take over the case now she watched the arrival of the rolls met petras eye studied ramsey for a while and turned the other way petra said evening mr ramsey larry schick said the lawyer interposing his arm between them ramsey stepped back he looked at ron then zeroed in on petra what the hell is going on estrella flo i know i know but what was she doing up here we were going to ask you that sir ramsey shook his head again and clicked his teeth together unreal the worlds gone nuts schicks facial muscles hadnt budged he said what exactly happened to her detective too early to give out details mr schick but i can tell you she was murdered very brutally and buried over there she pointed at the pond the gravesite was marked by a stake my god said ramsey turning away petra said mr ramsey did mrs flores ever work at this house sure recently no back when lisa and i were together by the end of the sentence ramseys voice had thickened he glanced at the stake again and winced schick said detective why dont we do this a little later its okay larry said ramsey lisa and i used to spend weekends here sometimes lisa brought estrella with us to clean i dont think estrella had a key though and i cant see why shed come up here who cleans the house now a cleaning company not regularly maybe once a month i never use the house anymore whats the name of the company i dont know greg handles it does mr balch come up personally to let them in sure ramsey studied her where is mr balch now ramsey looked at his watch probably on his way home he worked today i assume ramseys voice had cleared you havent spoken to him recently said petra the last time i spoke to him was lets see two days ago he called to ask if there was anything i needed i said no he tried to cheer me up ive been mostly hanging around the house trying to avoid the media now this insanity petra said we tried to call mr balch at the office and he didnt answer maybe he stepped out whats the big deal were talking to everyone with access to this property access said ramsey i suppose anyone could climb the gate never installed electric gates no need never got around to it when lisa and i came up we used a padlock the thing that bugs me is how did estrella get up here she didnt drive excellent question said petra schick said hopefully you people will come up with some answers he removed the pipe inspected the bowl turned it upside down nothing fell out petra said so you havent asked mrs flores to clean this house recently never listen you have my permission to go over the whole place house grounds anything dont bother with warrants cart said schick even in the spirit of helpfulness ramsey said larry i want to get to the bottom of this no point slowing things down to petra just do whatever the hell it is you do tear down the whole goddamn place for all i care he swiped at his eyes turned his back and walked several steps schick followed him and placed a hand on his shoulder balch had offered similar comfort that first day and ramseys response had been to turn on him but he accepted the attorneys gesture nodding as schick told him something petra saw him pinch the top of his nose he and schick returned sorry detective connor anything else was there any reason for mr balch to be up here recently like i said he comes up to fix things let in workmen if there was something to fix hed have a reason but youre not aware of anything specific i wouldnt know said ramsey greg takes care of things both houses absolutely does that include exchanging cars pardon bringing the jeep to la for maintenance said petra leaving his own car here what are you talking about mr balch did that yesterday sir a local deputy saw him exit the property and mr balch told him youd asked him to bring the jeep down for maintenance he left his lexus here makes sense said ramsey the jeep was for weekends here lisa liked it i rarely use it so maybe it seized up but you dont know that no im guessing where do you take the jeep for service some jeep dealer in santa barbara i think any reason to bring it to la ramsey shrugged and stroked his mustache maybe greg switched dealers maybe he had a problem with the one in santa barbara why all these i just need to get this straight said petra feigning confusion you never asked him specifically to pick up the jeep not specifically what are you getting at she pulled out her pad scrawled maybe nothing sir after writing she snuck in a quick cartoon of schick the stupid haircut made it easy ramsey was staring at her you think greg petra didnt answer next to her ron was as still as a machine oh cmon said ramsey no way no thats absolutely crazy how did mr balch and estrella flores get along they got along fine ramsey laughed this is totally nuts if greg says the jeep needed maintenance it did whats going on here is probably some kind of psycho stalker someone with a grudge against me so he goes after people close to me mrs flores was close to you no i dont know all im saying is these nuts are all over look at john lennon all the crap people in the industry put up with have you checked out anything like that were looking at all kinds of things said petra schick said i know someone who can look into it cart ron hadnt said a word petra glanced at him letting him know it was okay he said in terms of stalkers do you have anyone in mind mr ramsey if i did dont you think id tell you harder tone with ron jesus petra closed her pad thanks for giving the okay to search sir it will save us time and paperwork if you dont mind putting it in writing schick barked on cue before we go that far lets pin down the details let them do their job larry said ramsey to petra whatever turns up i guarantee you it will have nothing to do with greg schick made his mouth very small and ran a finger under thick black bangs why would a grown man opt for a hairstyle like that something to catch jurors attention maybe the meerschaum was a prop too reality fantasy petra said ill get some paper for you to write on sir schick said hold on please detective cart youre upset and youre going to get taken advantage of ive seen the things that occur during searches breakage pilferage i strongly advise you let them break stuff larry i dont give a shit like i said tear the whole place down he faced petra youre just theorizing right you cant be seriously thinking greg had anything to do with this schick said at the very least i insist upon being present during any search fine said petra to ramsey one more thing greg balchs behavior the night of lisas murder when the two of you returned from reno detective said schick there has to be a better time for this ramsey said what about his behavior did he act differently in any way no the same old greg the day we visited your house your mercedes was gone where was it what does that have to do with gregs behavior said ramsey sir if youd just bear with me the mercedes was being serviced said ramsey hed told her that but if the redundant questioning bothered him he didnt show it too many toys theres always something in need of fixing did greg bring the mercedes in said petra ron had turned around was studying the house or the dealer picked it up said ramsey what needed to be done to the car i have no idea so it was driving okay yes it was fine maybe it needed a routine oil change i dont know what mercedes dealer do you use ramsey put a finger over his mouth some place nearby in agoura i think he laughed harshly as you can see im very in touch with my life petra smiled at him the second time i came to your house the mercedes was back in the garage who brought it over same answer either someone from the dealer or greg i think it was greg but whats the diff how did greg and lisa get along petra said talking faster a little louder if schick hadnt been there shed have stepped closer to ramsey invading his personal space forcing eye contact even with the attorney hovering it was a silver bullet of a question and ramseys head moved back greg and lisa fine everyone got along fine no problem between them no i cant believe youre wasting time on hes my closest friend detective connor we were kids together he and lisa got along fine hell he introduced me to lisa at the pageant said petra at the pageant but he knew her before they ramsey stopped they what sir they dated nothing serious just a few times so dont go construing it was over by the time lisa and i started dating greg had no problem with it if he had would he have introduced us why indeed suppositions dragraced through petras head beauty queen with sights set on the industry believing at first that balch was a hollywood heavyweight maybe balch had used that as a pickup line they start dating he pours on the bs but she sees through it learns where the real clout is throwing the small fish back she goes for the whopper everyone got along said ramsey but his voice had weakened and he was picking at his mustache schicks stick face was all adrenaline but he still wasnt moving same for ron it made petra feel as if the two of them were fading out of view bit players spotlighting her and ramsey she said okay sir thanks for your help do you have a key to the house here said schick taking out a ring and fingering a brass schlage someone else to answer for ramsey take care of him being a star even a minor one was a return to childhood drawing ron fifty feet away under the largest of the oaks petra kicked acorns and said anything i missed not that i see be interesting to know if the mercedes was taken in for service youre thinking it might have been lisas murder car petra nodded different cars for different kills said ron keep us guessing balch is looking nice and dirty isnt he filthy want to try to call some mercedes dealers said petra maybe some stay open past six will do he removed the cell phone from his pocket she gazed over at ramsey and schick theyd drifted back to the rolls schick was leaning against the front fender caressing the meerschaum offering some kind of lawyerly counsel ramsey seemed uninterested cars said petra were also lisas preferred venue for sex the case is pure la the jeep for lisa would entail driving back and forth from here said ron balch and ramsey got back from reno just a couple of hours before lisa was abducted not enough time so i bet on the mercedes or the lexus or another of ramseys wheels which would be good for balch if he was trying to shift suspicion we should also try burbank airport that charter company ramsey uses balch has got to have access to the account rabbiting by charter said petra just a possibility images flashed two young bucks head for hollywood but only one ends up rich with the girl too balch had mentioned two failed marriages another reason for him to be bitter she remembered his remarks about lisas temper her going off on cart at the time it had puzzled petra why was goodbuddy greg giving the boss a motive now it made perfect sense something else balch a total slob had been wearing brandnew white tennis shoes because the old ones were soaked with blood she said i want to chat more with mr adjustor thanks for making the calls remember the name of the charter company westward charter the pilot they use is ed marionfeldt rattling off facts without consulting her pad everything coming together a new rhythm she walked back to ramsey and schick still by the rolls but neither man was talking schick studying ramsey ramsey staring at the ground as petra got closer he looked up mr ramsey when you returned from tahoe you were extremely tired went to sleep earlier than usual correct i was bushed we were going since early morning greg balch drove the two of you from burbank airport to your house yes mention of balchs name seemed to weary ramsey then you and mr balch had dinner at your home and he had you sign some business papers do you recall the nature of those papers by the way some kind of lease agreement i own office buildings petra copied that down all right please bear with me who cooked dinner ramsey smiled were talking sandwiches and beer who made the sandwiches greg not estrella flores she went off duty at seven was already in her room doing what sir whatever it is she did in there i think i heard the tv wheres the maids room in the service wing off the kitchen okay said petra adding some details to schicks caricature concentration lines on the forehead pout creases so greg prepared the sandwiches and poured the beer yup the beer was grolsch if it matters imported lager with a barbiturate chaser thought petra balch slipping ramsey a mickey if so had the underling stopped to deliberate wondered about adding a little more powder paying ramsey back for all those years of friendship some friendship not one single acting job putting balch down in public sticking him in that crappy office a middleaged errand boy the unkindest cut of all lisa because hed met lisa first gave her up to cart always cart petra could almost feel the rage herself what had led balch to stalk lisa that night had she reignited their old relationship then cut it off or had balch just succumbed to his own fantasies petra pictured the blond man waiting by lisas apartment watching the porsche drive out of the subterranean lot following in one of carts cars he had access to all the cars all the toys tonight hed play taking what was his the same way hed taken ilse eggermann ilse lisa the names were virtual anagrams patterns a crazy notion but when it hit you in the face you said ouch how many other dead blond girls were there girls who reminded balch of lisa where the hell was balch or maybe she was all wrong and the lackey would show up alibied a perfect explanation the case in tatters and some psycho was stalking ramsey or was ramsey the stalker the boy in the park might know had wil made any progress shed call him again as soon as she finished up with ramsey the beers she said did you drink them from bottles or cans from a glass said ramsey as if shed asked a rude question cans you opened yourself bottles you could open for someone else and right after you drank did you feel even more tired no he said i told you i was tired all day i mean the alcohol mightve been the topper but the blue eyes widened oh cmon youve got to be kidding about what sir something in the beer no no no way in hell id know if no it didnt feel that way i was just bushed from overwork and travel i conked out we both did how long did you sleep that night ramsey stroked his mustache licked his lips schick said lets finish up here detective almost done said petra smiling the lawyer didnt smile back i got up around eight eightthirty said ramsey so eleven hours is that your typical sleep pattern no usually sevens enough but oh come on i wouldve felt something woozy whatever this is james bond stuff detective connor i make movies i know the difference between fantasy and reality his eyes told her a new troubling logic had begun to worm its way into his brain true confusion or acting the difference between fantasy and reality the phrase seemed to mock petra im sure youre right mr ramsey she watched ron pocket the phone as he returned schick was watching her she excused herself and met ron well out of ramsey and schicks earshot only one open mercedes dealer he said sherman oaks never serviced ramseys cars but bingo at westward charter balch tried to fly out last night called around eleven wanting to book a solo trip to vegas said it was a business trip westward doesnt take off past ten and told him to check commercial flights wed better start calling airlines oh my she said stupid move said ron trying to use the charter billing it to the boss said petra payback she noticed ramsey staring at her had she given away something with her body language she ignored him nice to be able to do that i just got out of the bathroom thats where i ran after i stopped crying when i came out i almost hoped sam wasnt there but he was shining the silver charity bottle with a corner of his jacket my eyes were dry i felt i was walking through a bad dream you got a few hours till they show up to pray tonight he said still polishing i sat down again and thought no ideas came the walkway all those people now it seemed like a haunted place i couldnt see any other way out so i agreed to go to sams house but not during the day i dont want anyone to see me thats a little difficult bill people start showing up before dark and i have to be here to run things the way we finally work it out is at six oclock hell come back with some dinner and sneak me into his car ill hide there while the jews are praying in the backseat covered by the blankets how long do you pray an hour give or take i stay late to clean up when the coast is clear ill let you know thanks dont mention it he says just take care of yourself then he laughs who am i to tell you that you been taking care of yourself fine no answer to her second knock and now mildred board was worried shed heard the bath filling a half hour ago had the missus fallen suffered some kind of an attack maybe the doctors were wrong and she really was ill she turned the doorknob called out maam as she entered the bedroom empty and the bed was made not mildreds tightcornered creation but a decent tuck first the bath now the bed why on earth all this independence yesterday shed been up extra early and ready hearing footsteps at am she went down to find the missus in the kitchen folded newspaper in front of her next to a cup of something that turned out to be instant tea are you all right maam shed said fine mildred and you the missus was smiling but the look in her eyes was distant ready to greet the day maam thats the spirit fighting a frown mildred fixed a proper cup of english breakfast while glancing at the paper the missus smiled i must be developing a belated interest in current events yes maam up early too i seem to be doing that lately dont i must be a change in my biorhythm later that day shed found the missus out on the patio with her hand on a stone column as if she needed support looking out at what the ruins of the garden more like nothing her eyes had that blank look again and when mildred greeted her they stayed that way for several seconds strange things were happening mildred walked through the bedroom into the first dressing room no one the bathroom was empty too the tub drained towels folded a long corridor led to the walkin closet standing in the doorway mildred repeated maam in here mildred you may come in mildred hurried through the narrow passage the rear closet was larger than most rooms lined with mahogany shelves and racks builtin drawers handprinted hatboxes scores of shoes arranged by color all that was left of the missuss couture collection was a pair of wool coats a rain slicker five suits black brown beige two grays and a few casual dresses and cashmere sweaters all encased in plastic wardrobe bags the missus was standing in front of the mirror applying makeup fully dressed in one of the gray suits a thirtyyearold chanel she wore pearl earrings the small ones lovely mildred remembered the diamonds him had showered on the missus an annoying little man from san gabriel had examined them with a loupe and a predatory smile the chanel draped the missuss figure perfectly but her feet white laceup tennis shoes over bulky white socks i thought id go out for a walk mildred the missuss thick wavy hair was brushed and sprayed chestnut embroidered with gray her makeup had been applied expertly except for one stray granule of lipstick near the corner of her beautiful mouth mildred restrained the impulse to flick it away but she did give a pointed look and the missus caught the hint and dabbed a walk lovely idea maam mildreds eyes lowered again those socks the missus laughed uneasily not exactly the height of style i know but these are easy on the arches my hamstrings are stiff mildred i tried to stretch them out but theyre still bound up its been too long since i walked mildred drawing back her shoulders and straightening her spine she started down the corridor do be careful maam i watered the orchard just twenty minutes ago and drainage seems to be poor especially in the rear area the peach trees boggy and slippery youd think that gardeners boy would have the sense to the missus stopped and placed a delicate hand on mildreds shoulder im not walking on the property dear she said im going around the block oh said mildred i see she didnt ill be happy to come with you no thank you dear i need to think with all due ill be fine mildred the missuss chin began to shake she drew back her shoulders she took another step stopped im always fine mildred am i not by pm captain sepulveda still hadnt returned and the techs had stopped working the sun was low and the oaks blocked out straggling daylight sergeant grafton had returned to her car petra was finished with ramsey lawrence schick escorted his client back to the rolls remaining blankfaced as petra tagged along ramsey got into the passenger seat and stared out the open window he looked ancient petra said if i need to reach you were going for dinner said the attorney the biltmore santa barbara and after dinner said petra schick smoothed his bangs its not exactly a night for brandy and cigars is it detective so i guess well return to la nice to meet you please continue to communicate through me tapping the meerschaum twice he got into the drivers seat turned a fraillooking wrist the car woke up and sailed away but for the merest spatter of gravel silently a few minutes later sepulveda drove up with a handful of warrants explaining every judge was playing golf hed changed into sweats carpinteria sheriffs insignia on the shirt despite ramseys waiver no search had begun because sergeant grafton had insisted on waiting for sepulveda petra called schoelkopf to tell him about balchs attempted flight to vegas no answer and the clerk said hed signed out for dinner she didnt know where no luck with wil fournier either she was just about to call stu when sepulveda arrived ron was using the phone talking to his kids well concentrate on the house for now said sepulveda waving the warrants do the grounds tomorrow morning ive got techs from our station and a fingerprint spec from ventura used to work for us that i still think is the best you planning to stick around for a while said petra you know i cant let you participate in the search got to color within the lines can we observe sepulveda considered that why dont you and your partner make yourself comfortable over there he pointed to a wooden bench that curved around the trunk of the biggest oak drooping branches afforded semiprivacy no way i can look captain anything comes up ill give a holler flashing him a smile petra walked to the bench rockhard and cool ron came over still talking im proud of you bee thanks for listening so well to grandma bye he hung up said we cant go in banished to the sidelines said petra another boss too many jurisdictions he said he sat down next to her grazed her fingertips with his thumb but thats not always bad is it never know who youll meet she smiled not minding his touch but unable to think about anything but work all the things she had to do she borrowed the phone tried wil again still no answer but schoelkopf picked up ramsey was just here with schick she said and she summed up the interview told him about balchs call to westward charter well that pretty much clinches it doesnt it balch shit and you guys were certain it was ramsey can you imagine the field day the press wouldve had with that near prosecution of an innocent man okay no release of

dream about mom again ill try to figure out what it is i want to convince her of land of the free home of the stupid in the cramped storage room behind the souvenir shack vladimir zhukanov finished the vodka and wondered if hed been an asshole to leave russia at least there he had a uniform a purpose there was always someone who needed controlling even more now since capitalism was sinking its claws in the gangs were taking over and half the gangsters were expolice he couldve found something in america he had no respect only stupid dolls stupid nigger cop ignoring him then taking his information to the tv the black bastard anonymous tip meaning they didnt want to pay him one thing it proved hed been right about the kid like thered been any doubt that dimple in the chin just like the drawing scratches on his face what youd expect in someone hiding in a forest zhukanovs father had told him stories about forests the war militiamen chasing yids through clumps of wintering birch bare trees iron sky the marriage of bayonet and flesh crimson stains on snow anonymous tip the tv news meant competition for the twentyfive thousand only one competitor so far but he was trouble enough fat guy in filthy leather walking up and down the walkway with the kids picture from his station behind the counter zhukanov watched the big pig up and back up and back walking laboriously breathing hard in the heat growing visibly pissed off as the day wore on and he got nothing but head shakes and blank stares the first time the guy waddled toward the souvenir shack zhukanov made sure to be in the back room examining the days receipts trying to figure out how much he could skim and get away with the second time though he was up front counting trolls making sure no one had ripped him off the big pig said hey man and shoved the picture in zhukanovs face zhukanov shook his head dismissively it wasnt even worth talking about but the guy just stood there you didnt even look at it man breath like a toilet zhukanov refused to dignify the question picked up a malibu troll want to buy something his tone making it clear that the guy couldnt afford a lousy toy the fat guy tried to give him the evil eye zhukanov almost laughed out loud big but flabby back in moscow hed trampled runnyshit like this halfdrunk finally the guy jiggled off what an imbecile still it was competition hed have to be sharper than ever now it was dark and all the retail shops were closed the only things open were the cafés on the north end of ocean front and the yid church a few stores south bunch of old yids in there wailing plotting whatever the hell they did when they got together he had skim money in his pocket the vodka had awakened his senses and he was hungry and horny and getting angrier by the minute at the nigger cop and everyone else who was conspiring to deprive him of what was rightfully his tomorrow hed call the newspapers and tell them the truth about the anonymous tip how stupid cops didnt respect dutiful citizens no no not yet that would focus more attention on the walkway bring in more problems hed give the nigger one more chance what was his name he had the card somewhere not in his pockets maybe hed left it in the back room slipping behind the curtain he searched among the clutter but didnt find it no matter hed ask around a bald nigger detective someone would know him then a mantoman talk maybe offer him a piece of the twentyfive if that was the only way if the nigger still didnt cooperate hed go to the papers no the tv stations get in touch with one of those blondies who read the news tell her the truth maybe some bigshot movie producer would be watching and say hey this is a good idea for a movie arnold schwarzenegger a russian cop comes to america to show the stupid americans how to did they do that one already it sounded familiar no matter with movies you had something good you did it again publicity that was what he needed on top of the money hed be the hero trying to find the kid solve a crime but no one listened and hey man said a voice from up front fatso how had he gotten in then zhukanov realized hed forgotten to pull down the shutters and lock up he took another swallow of vodka hey you back there man stupid asshole get rid of him and find some place to eat and drink zhukanov put on his planet hollywood jacket and tapped his front pockets cash in the right front pocket knife in the left cheap taiwan blade he carried it with him for the walk from the shack to his car sometimes with an unlicensed mm part of the backroom arsenal nunchucks a sawedoff baseball bat ageblackened brass knuckles hed inherited from his father so far the only thing hed had to use was the bat as a warning to kids with itchy fingers but you never knew the gun was back home cheap junk it had jammed and he had it on the kitchen table trying to figure out what was wrong with it hey zhukanov bolted the rear door before parting the curtains the fat bastard had his elbows on the counter scratching a blubbery chin sweating eyes rawlooking and swollen hulking silhouette against the black beach sky maybe toughlooking to some tourist but all zhukanov saw was a vat of grease hey bro din you hear me zhukanov said nothing listen man cant help you how can you say that man you dont know what im asking zhukanov started to slide down the front shutter the fat man reached up and stopped it zhukanov pulled the fat man resisted flabby but his weight gave him strength zhukanov said move fatso fuck you shithead that brought the blood to zhukanovs face he could feel it hot as winter soup his neck veins throbbed his hands ached from gripping the shutter go away he said fuck you man i got a question you could at least try a fucking answer zhukanov went silent again no big deal bro said the fat man maybe youve seen this kid since i was here you say no fine so why you giving me shit the shutter wouldnt budge the fat guys resistance enraged zhukanov go away he said very softly the fat guy pushed at the shutter and it shot up daring zhukanov to try closing it a bully used to having his way zhukanov remained in place smelling him the stench wasnt just his breath it was all of him a walking garbage heap seen him go away asshole now it was the fat mans turn to go red pig eyes bulged spittle bubbled at the sides of his mouth that soothed zhukanovs anger turning it warm and smooth this was starting to get funny he laughed said stupid fatass piece of shit the fat guy made a deep fartlike rumbling sound and zhukanov waited for the next insult ready to throw something back laugh in the bastards face again but the fat guy didnt say a word just went for him faster than he thought possible one huge hand shooting out and snagging him by the throat pulling him up so hard against the counter he thought his ribs had broken the pain nearly blinded him and he thrashed helplessly the fat guys other hand was fisted zooming at him for a facepulverizing punch zhukanov managed to jerk his face away from the blow but the hand around his neck kept squeezing and he could feel all the breath go out of him hear the fat guy snarling and cursing ocean front was dark abandoned just the waves no one around to watch this monster strangle him to death no one but the yids yards away doing their christkilling chants they wouldnt help him anyway he tried to tear at the strangling hand but his hands were sweatslick so weak and the fat mans arm was moist too and he couldnt get a purchase slipping and flailing as his field of vision funneled to a pinpoint of light he saw the fat mans enraged face another fist coming at him a spasm of panic saved his face but brought the blow along the side of his head hard enough to rattle his brain pan his arms continued to wave around uselessly he didnt remember the knife until hed nearly lost consciousness then he remembered pocket front pocket left side for the quick draw just like theyd taught him in handtohand the fat man began shaking him harder feeding off the pain and terror on zhukanovs face not noticing as zhukanov reached down zhukanov floundered found it grabbed too low cold metal a sting gropegrope finally he touched the warmth of wood he yanked upward pushed the blade no strength not even a thrust just a weak womanish poke and must have missed because the fat man was still choking him cursing gargling and now the shaking had stopped now the bastard wasnt making any sounds a look of surprise on his face the blubbery lips formed into a tiny o like saying oh where was the knife suddenly the hand around zhukanovs throat opened and air rushed into his windpipe and he retched and choked finally realized he could breathe but his throat felt as if someone had used it for a lye funnel the fat man was no longer facing him he was flopped down on the counter arms hanging over where was the knife nowhere in sight losing everything must be the vodka then he saw the slow red leak from under the fat mans shoulder no gush no big arterial spurt just seepage like one of those summer tides when the waves got gentle he took hold of the fat mans hair and lifted the massive head the knife was still embedded in the guys neck just offcenter from the adams apple tilting downward diagonal slice through jugular trachea esophagus but gravity was pulling the blood back down into the body cavity zhukanov panicked what if someone had seen like the kid in griffith park watching thinking he was protected by darkness but there was no one just this fat dead piece of shit and zhukanov holding his head up a hunter with a trophy for the first time in a long time zhukanov felt strong territorial a siberian wolf the only bad thing was the size of the bastard and now he had to be moved letting the head flop down again he turned off the lights in the shack checked the cut on his hand just a nick vaulted over the counter and scanned the walkway in all directions just to make sure the stainedglass window in the yid place was a multicolored patch in the darkness but no old yids out in front yet removing the knife he wiped it with his handkerchief then eased the corpse down to the ground wiping blood off the counter he stuffed the kerchief into the neck wound having to roll it up into a tight ball because the slash was only a couple of inches wide small cut but effective small blade it was the angle that had done it the fat guy leaning forward to strangle him zhukanov giving that little girly poke upward and then suddenly the guys weight had reversed the trajectory forcing the knife down into his throat severing everything along the way making sure the handkerchief plug was secure he inhaled deeply and prepared himself for the tough part mother of christ his neck hurt he could feel it starting to swell around the neckline of his tshirt and he yanked down ripping some elastic looser but he still felt like the fat guy was choking him another look around dark quiet all he needed was old yids flooding out okay here goes taking hold of the fat guys feet he started to pull the corpse the damn thing only budged an inch and zhukanov felt horrid pain in his lower back like dragging an elephant bending his knees he tried again another vertebral warning but he kept going what was the choice it took forever to get the bastard out of view and by then zhukanov was sweating out of breath every muscle in his body aflame and now he could hear voices the yids coming out he yanked dragged breathed yanked dragged breathed frantic to get the corpse well back from the walkway had he gotten all the blood off the counter he rushed back found a few stains used his shirt turned off the lights and slammed down the shutter now he could hear them louder old voices jabbering he got the corpse halfway to the back of the shack stopped when his chest clogged up bent his knees again resumed yank drag breathe by the time he reached the alley all he could hear was the ocean no voices all the yids gone home he dragged the corpse next to the shacks garbage bins not a commercial dumpster because the boss was too cheap two wooden shipping crates that some mexican illegals emptied every week for ten bucks okay now what leave him there concealed by darkness fetch the car load the bastard in it and take him somewhere to dump where did the west hollywood guys go for that angeles crest forest zhukanov had a vague notion where that was hed find it another forest if the old man could see him now david had finished off goliath and soon goliath would be rotting in some gulley no wait before that he had to triplecheck for bloodstains inside the shack and out along the side of the shack where the pig had been dragged hed get the car load the guy keep him there while he gave the shack a thorough going over ditch the knife the clothes he was wearing the nunchucks and the baseball bat too no no reason to panic why would anyone connect him to the fat bastard even if they found the corpse just the blood the knife his clothes get it done before sunrise the guy would leak all over his trunk but hed clean it running it through again he decided it was a good plan he stretched fingered the tender hot flesh of his neck slow down slow everything down its over why had the bastard invited trouble like that zhukanov thanked him for starting up he hadnt felt this good since leaving moscow okay time to get the car hed taken three steps when light caught his eye the back door of the synagogue opening someone still there he pressed himself against one of the wooden bins tripping over the corpses legs nearly falling on his ass forcing himself not to curse aloud he breathed through his nose and watched as an old yid came out of the synagogue zhukanov could see him clearly illuminated by the light inside short thickset one of those beanies on his head the yid reached in and the blessing of darkness returned but just for one second because now the guy was opening a car door not the drivers door the left rear door someone in back of the car sat up got out stretched just like zhukanov had just done the yid talked to him shorter than the yid a kid hiding in back had to be the kid why else would he be hiding the right size and hed been lying low who else could it be the kid got back in the rear seat lay down disappeared so hed been here all along hidden by the yids made sense twentyfive grand would make them come in their pants well see about that the yids car started up and the headlights went on staying in the shadows zhukanov ran toward it the yid started backing out just as zhukanov got close enough to read the license plate bunch of letters and numbers zhukanov mouthed the magic formula soundlessly at first his brain refused to cooperate but the old yid helped him taking a long time to back the car out and straighten up and by the time he finished zhukanov had it all memorized no time to get his old car to follow hed write the number down call the department of motor vehicles giving out addresses was illegal but he knew a clerk at the hollywood branch wiseass louse from odessa whod do it for fifty bucks given the payoff an excellent investment by pm the search of the montecito house had turned up nothing the place is just about empty sepulveda told petra a little furniture in the living room and one bedroom the rest of the rooms have nothing check for secret passages she said only half in jest sepulveda stared at her ill let you know if the phantom of the opera shows up she and ron headed back to la shed been running up his cellphone bill talking to airline supervisors some of them impressed by her title others skeptical so far no no flights under balchs name had turned up and a call from wil let her know he was meeting with the same results thoroughness would demand paperwork the proper forms tomorrow she was exhausted angry at schoelkopf for keeping the news about balch under wraps the kid he publicizes but this scares him she and ron talked about it till they got to oxnard bosses were always easy targets when they reached camarillo the car turned silent and she saw he had his eyes closed he awoke when she stopped the car in front of his house rise and shine she said he smiled groggily apologized then leaned over to kiss her she shifted her hips in the seat and met him halfway one of his hands passed behind her head pressing gently the other found its way to her breast he was smoother when fatigued he squeezed her softly then began to remove his hand she held it in place the next kiss lasted a long time he was the first to pull away and now he looked wide awake she said some first date second the first was the deli true she realized shed thought of that as getting acquainted he said well youve got plenty to do i wont keep you she initiated a third kiss he didnt try to feel her kept both hands above the neck then he cupped her chin with nick she hadnt liked that too confining he did it differently she traveled his mouth with her tongue and he made a small baritone noise of contentment oh man he said i really want to see you again i know its not a good time to be thinking about going out call she said if i say im too busy itll be the truth he kissed the tip of her chin you are so pretty the first time i saw you i shaking his head he got out groped in his pocket for his keys and waved wait she called out as he turned and started toward his front door he stopped your phone he laughed returned to the drivers side took it make sure you send me the bill she said its going to be huge sure he said then he kissed her again back on the she could barely keep her eyes open exhaustion even in the face of all that adrenaline meant she was severely sleepdeprived shed go home take some caffeine squeeze in another hour or so of phone work then enough by the time she reached her apartment it was one message on her machine she let it sit there changed into a flannel nightie and got extrastrong coffee going realized she still hadnt called stu too late now she felt lousy one day this case would be over but kathys experience would last forever would stu remember her as being neglectful during his crisis the message turned out to be him phoning at and asking her to call back up to midnight the st joes operator was reluctant to put her through this late but finally she heard stu say petra so sorry for not calling sooner hows kathy fine he said resting someone who didnt know him would have thought he sounded okay everything went smoothly very smoothly they did a mastectomy one breast the surgeon says shell have total recovery thats great i got through four years of tv guide dont worry about that stu how can i help thanks but were okay he said youre sure do the kids need anything just their mom he said and his voice changed theyll get through it petra well all get through it i know you will one breast anyway said stu how was your day apart from that mrs lincoln how was the play keeping her at arms length hed cried once in her arms probably vowed never to lose it again actually a huge amount of stuff hit the fan stu she told him about estrella flores the bloodstained lexus balchs attempt to rabbit by charter then william bradley straight idd but still unaccounted for left without a mother poor kid he said i leave you alone for one day and look at all the trouble you get yourself into everything coming together and he had nothing to do with it she wanted to tell him it was okay but it wasnt balch he said he fits that well as well as ramsey does stu didnt pick up on that he was the veteran maybe she should focus so we track balch she said any idea where he is my bet is some other state or out of the country but s says we cant publicize it yet near arrest of an innocent man and all that scared the hell out of him but its nuts right with the straight kid we go mediawild but on balch were gagged giving him a head start oh yeah something else karlheinz lauch died a year ago but the similarities between lisa and ilse eggermann got me thinking eggermann was picked up in redondo and dumped in the marina balch lives in rolling hills estates right down the coast a serial wouldnt it be weird if he was some bigtime creep and this is just the tip of the iceberg silence the numbertwo man strikes out to achieve dominance another inadequate psychopath exactly hold on he said and petra heard him talking to someone that was the night nurse okay what can i do to help right now just stay with kath shes sleeping he said sharply i want to work tonight petra what airlines have you checked wil and i split them up we havent gotten through to some of them they want paper i figured what about international carriers he said does balch have a passport dont know ive already made contact with the passport office on eggermann ill do international and the domestic carriers you havent reached you sound bushed get some sleep ill talk to you in the am let them think hed rabbited to vegas let them think they were dealing with someone stupid it would help him tie everything up he liked being neat not as bad as lisa she was compulsive wanting everything just so irregularities set her off that vicious mouth she hated surprises so he gave her one the german girl too little stupid sally one more surprise left and the stupid cops were making it a little easier leaking anonymous tips venice beach ocean front walk could the kid still be there maybe sometimes those runaways bunked down how far could a street kid go if hed tunneled deep could he be found should he forget about the kid was he overreacting obsessing sometimes he did that like the way hed worry a hidden pimple till it got infected and festered and hed have to lance it himself coat it with neosporin live with the pain no one knew that about him maybe the kid hadnt even been in the park if hed seen something wouldnt he have turned himself in tried to collect the reward but that assumed he read the papers watched tv knew what was going on in the world some of those kids were so stonedout or braindamaged they didnt have a clue not much of a witness should he just let it ride live with the uncertainty he considered it for a long time the idea bothered him big loose end he could at least check it out he thought a long time about how to do it without putting himself in danger finally came up with the plan perfect and ironic the hardest thing to pull off irony according to the bullshitartist acting coaches whats my motivation selfpreservation sams house has a living room a kitchen two bed rooms with a bathroom in between i got a real bed the sheets felt new sam slept in the other room and i could hear him snoring through the wall its only a few blocks from the shul on what sam calls a walk street instead of a road to drive through theres a sidewalk maybe twice as wide as a regular one i should walk said sam driving there but at night there are too many nuts out he parks in an alley around the back hes got an alarm with panels on the front door and the door to the kitchen i looked the other way while he punched the code so he wouldnt think i was up to something he said im ready to hit the hay and showed me my room on the bed were a new toothbrush and toothpaste and a glass no pajamas bill didnt know your size he looked embarrassed standing in the doorway not coming in i said thanks this is great i mean it he clicked his teeth together like his false teeth didnt fit listen i want you to know i dont usually have guests never did before i didnt know what to say what im getting at bill is you dont have to worry about something funny going on i like women stick around long enough and youll see that i believe you i said okay better get some sleep the bedroom is painted light green and has old dark furniture a gray carpet and two pictures on the wall hanging crooked ones a blackandwhite photograph of a woman with her hair tied up and a guy with a long black beard the other ones a painting of some trees that looks like it was cut out of a magazine the room has that oldguy smell and its a little hot i brush my teeth and look in the mirror the scratches on my face arent too bad but my chest hurts my eyes are pink and my hair looks nasty i strip down to my underpants get under the covers and close my eyes at first its quiet then i hear music from sams room like a guitar but higher a mandolin a bluegrass band at the sunnyside had one of those he plays the same song over and over it sounds sad and old then he stops and the snoring begins i think of mom thats all i remember till morning now its saturday and i wake up before he does and go into the living room the curtains are closed and the house is dark i pull a living room curtain aside and see a couple of metal chairs on sams front porch then a low wall houses across the walk street the sky is getting blue and some gulls are flying its weird but i swear i can smell the salt through the windows the living room has more books than any place ive seen except a library three walls are covered with bookshelves and you can barely walk cause of all the magazines on the floor in one corners a couch with a knitted blanket thrown over it a tv and a music stand holding a song by some guy named smetana i sit down on the couch and dust shoots up no morning stomachache its the best sleep ive had in my life and i decide to say thank you by making breakfast in a box on the kitchen counter i find whole wheat bread and i toast four slices theres a coffee machine but i dont know how to use it so i just pour milk and orange juice into glasses and set them out on the table along with paper napkins forks spoons knives in the refrigerator are fruits and vegetables butter some sour cream eggs and a big jar of something silverylooking like out of a science lab pickled herring i take out the eggs hoping sam likes them scrambled theyre frying up when i hear him coughing he comes in wearing this light blue bathrobe rubs his eyes and pushes at his teeth thought i heard something what youre a gourmet is scrambled okay he turns his back on me puts his hand to his mouth and coughs some more excuse me yeah scrambled is great usually i dont cook saturday its my sabbath im not that religious but i usually dont cook maybe cause my mother never did sorry no no this is good why should it apply to you he comes closer looks into the pan smells good i could use something hot you know how to make coffee no he explains how to use the machine and leaves when he comes back the coffees poured and hes dressed in a tan suit and a white shirt with the collar open his hairs brushed and hes shaved by now the eggs are pretty cold okay lets chow down he says unfolding his napkin and putting it on his lap bon appétit that means eat up in french he tastes the eggs very good very gentlemanly of you

you want a breath of fresh air one one twentyfive think of january first my birthday im a new years baby im not going out just in case he punches the numbers the light goes green and he opens the door relax take it easy try the herring not a chance i say and he leaves smiling the chessboard is still out on the kitchen counter i think ill experiment with different moves see things from both sides saturday morning at the phone woke petra schoelkopfs voice played havoc with her brain waves got comprehensive warrants on balchs office and home you and fournier go over both with a finetooth before we put a bulletin out on him ive messengered the paper and keys to you should be there any minute get it all done today so we can cast the net on the bastard why do we have to wait to cast because thats the way upstairs wants it barbie the fact that we came so close to tunnelvisioning on ramsey scares them shitless no more questions get moving does fournier know about the assignment you tell him the doorbell rang just as she was stepping out of the shower drying off frantically she wrapped herself in a bath sheet ran to the door saw a patrolman through the peephole and stuck her hand out through a crack in the door for the manila envelope containing the warrants and the keys the uniform a tall guy grinned checked her out and said shed have to sign a form slide it under the door after i slam it in your face she roused wil at he sounded half dead and she thought she heard a woman in the background all right he said where first up to you balchs office is closer how about nine make that ninethirty want me to pick you up he didnt answer immediately there was definitely a woman there talking low and rhythmically almost singing no he said ill meet you with no traffic the drive to studio city was fifteen minutes of morning breeze and she had time to stop at dupars near laurel for takeout coffee and an apple cruller in the lot fronting the brown building was a gray acura but no signs of the driver the license plate said sherri she pulled up next to it and was eating in the car when wil arrived in his civvy wheels black toyota supra he wore an offwhite linen suit black polo shirt perforated black shoes looked ready for a palm springs weekend shed put on the usual pantsuit he looked at the building what a dump ramsey lives like a king but treated him like a serf maybe the guy finally exploded didnt know you were a shrink he said actually that makes sense want more this occurred to me last night the way lisas body was left out in the open no attempt at all to conceal same with ilse eggermann its as if hes boasting look what i can get away with all his life balch is subservient to ramsey eating dirt taking verbal abuse what better way to undo that psychologically than by taking ramseys woman then discarding her and announcing it to the world taking her said wil you think balch and lisa were making it i think balch wanted to hes no adonis but she dated him once and we know she likes older men whether or not she agreed to start up again only balch knows unless we find something in there they had their guns in their hands as they approached the door basic procedure detectives did little shooting but a good deal of it took place while serving warrants petra unlocked the door and went in first someone was sitting at the desk in the front room and she brandished her mm a young woman in a budget power suit working the morning crossword the sight of the gun painted her face with terror pretty brunette very short hair dark eyes maybe hispanic who are you said petra wil was behind her she could hear him breathing the womans voice dribbled out nearly inaudible sherri amerian im an attorney the acura in the lot mr balchs attorney no said amerian i work for lawrence schick stronger voice now a little brassy with resentment and the eyes had turned chilly am i allowed to show you my id its in the purse over there i mean i dont want to get shot in the process go ahead said petra amerian produced a drivers license and her business card from schick and associates the license made her twentyseven years old fresh out of law school doing schicks scut work on a saturday okay she said imperiously junior associate but to look at her body language she was arguing before the supreme court didnt take long to get that lawyer tude going will you please put those guns away not waiting for a reply she came around from behind the desk great figure wil holstered his piece what are you doing here representing mr h cart ramseys interests officer detective fournier this is detective connor amerians shrug said their names didnt matter our firm was informed that you intended to conduct a search of these premises related to possible evidence pertaining to mr gregory balch may i see the warrant why said wil because the premises are owned by mr ramsey and we represent his here petra slipped her gun back into her purse and gave her the studio city paper the young lawyer studied it exactly right material pertaining to mr balch not mr ramsey this office contains numerous documents of a confidential nature pertaining to mr ramseys finances and we insist that they not be tampered with as such ill be remaining here while you conduct your search in order to accomplish that our suggestion is that we set up a procedure in which you indicate a given drawer andor shelf and i review the contents beforehand if i have to blow my nose said wil are you going to review the tissue amerian frowned i really dont see the point of fine said wil cut to the chase the top drawer of this desk first and no chitchat or coffee breaks fold your puzzle and put it away they took three hours to search every inch of the suite after the first hour amerian got bored with her role as gatekeeper and started to say sure sure whenever wil or petra pointed out a book on a shelf or a box on the floor short attention span the sesame street generation the only remnants of balchs presence were fastfood cartons takeout menus from local restaurants and a top drawer full of officesupply flotsam no family photos petra supposed that made sense balch was a twotime marital loser man with no attachments something about him that got in the way of relationships so what the same could be said for millions of people who didnt kill she kept going all the papers were ramseys now amerian was paying attention again rent books tax returns folders listing deductions business contracts documents petra would have loved to see a few days ago balch had worked here for years but left nothing of himself behind did that say something about the way he viewed his job she removed a california tax code from the shelf flipped pages turned it upside down nothing same for the next ten books the place was even messier than when shed interviewed balch for a guy with such a disorganized mind hed proved a canny killer so many steps carefully laid out then why had he been sloppy enough to call westward charter and alert them to the rabbit the usual psychopaths selfdestructive behavior or a ruse where was he they left at pm stopped for lunch at a seafood place on ventura not much conversation wil had started off grumpy and four hours of futility hadnt improved his disposition he ate his sand dabs slowly drank a lot of iced tea looked out the window petras crab cakes went down like deepfried hockey pucks and by pm they were in separate cars on the headed for the interchange and the onehour ride to rolling hills estates and balchs home on saddlewax road he got ahead of her at imperial highway and shed lost sight of him when she thought of something speeding up she managed to spot the supra just past hermosa beach and waved him off at the redondo beach exit they both pulled onto the shoulder petra jogged to his car humor me she said but i want to take a look at the place on the pier where ilse eggermann was last seen then go to balchs fine he said good idea ill stick with you a fifteenminute westerly cruise down redondo beach boulevard took them to the former site of antoines now a dudley jones steak house franchise with a harbor view deepred room full of weekend brunchers and noise blond surferwaiters sailing past with platters of rare flesh and melonsize baked potatoes petra allowed herself a second to visualize ilse eggermann feuding with lauch leaving the restaurant descending wooden steps off the pier just as she and wil were doing now continuing down to the parking lot late at night deserted the place would be spooky the drive to rolling hills estates chilled her sixmile straightaway on hawthorne boulevard it began as a swath through the usual mash of car dealers malls and officesupply barns then narrowed just before palos verdes drive where a median strip appeared planted with eucalyptus and pine and blacktrunked shaggy trees that resembled willows a white wooden sign welcomed her to rolling hills estates and low white corral fencing appeared along both sides of the road ten minutes from redondo driving leisurely this was balchs turf she pictured him coming home from a long day as ramseys slave stopping off for a drink noticing ilse and lauch fighting he follows them out sees lauch drive off picks up ilse promising to drive her to her hotel near the marina but they never get there open dump in a parking lot look what i can get away with then back home so simple a day at the beach beautiful ocean but too many people he wore a topquality realhair false beard similar to the one hed used for the german girl a widebrimmed straw hat a long brown ratty raincoat over a frayed white shirt and cheap gray cotton pants running shoes relatively new but dirtiedup to stay in character the gait he adopted was a clumsy stifflegged shuffle when he walked he pretended to stare at the ground but was able to sight upward without being obvious because the hat did a good job of concealing his eyes if someone made eye contact he could half lower the lids and focus on nothing mr mentally disordered homeless ocean front walk was full of them sitting on benches lurching along with the crowd staring at the sand or the palm trees or the ocean as if something important were happening out there what imaginary whales mermaids with big tits flapping around on the beach his mother had gone crazy when he was fourteen hed never wondered what she thought about just stayed away as if she were contagious he walked up and down ocean front very slowly every so often hed sit make like he was dozing off while examining passersby no one paid attention to him the bicycle cops were on the lookout for violence so if you kept to yourself they were happy to ignore you same with the tourists anything to avoid being panhandled the problem was the quantity of people nice warm saturday everyone flocking to the beach the slowcruising walkathon along ocean front so dense you could barely make out individuals plenty of kids but not the kid after an hour he was able to classify them into two groups the wellscrubbed spawn of the tourists and clots of darkskinned bigmouthed local brats weaving in and out of the pedestrian stream probably looking for pockets to pick why would the kid be out in broad daylight why would he be here period after the anonymous tip waste of time but considering all hed accomplished he didnt feel that bad beautiful day go with it long time since hed been here and the walkway had gotten more commercial lined with shops snack stands restaurants even a synagogue that was odd some of the buildings ran through to the alley and beyond it the speedway others occupied the ground floors of multistory prewar apartment buildings the boy could be in one of those buildings and how could you find him the boy could be anywhere hed give it a few more hours the beard and hat and coat were heating him up a cold drink would be nice and he had ten bucks in his pocket more back in the car parked six blocks away but a crazy bum fishing out money might attract attention so he decided to settle for water from a fountain there was one down at the other end near the synagogue hed shuffle clear to the northernmost end of ocean front turn around come back drink repeat it a few times take a pseudonap on a bench call it a day forget about the kid he told himself it was okay but it stuck in his throat big hot pimple full of pus just itching to be squeezed he preferred to give in to his compulsions avoiding them built up tension his mother had been unbelievably compulsive before going completely bonkers smoking five packs a day picking at her face rocking when she sewed going on food binges then starving herself for days when they put her in the hospital she began to bang her head against the wall like one of those autistic kids and they forced her to wear a football helmet flowered dress and a helmet what position do you play ma she looked ridiculous and he did everything he could to avoid visiting her shed died ten years ago and he was sole surviving kin through a local attorney hed instructed the hospital to cremate her bury her on the grounds thinking about her evoked no emotion he was hot discouraged not happy about abandoning the loose end mostly the heat right now that was the biggest part of what he felt he took an hour to cover the walkway two more times getting more and more uptight about not succeeding no kid who looked anything like the picture he reached the water fountain filled his belly with water wiped the beard a tourist about to drink changed his mind talk about a convincing performance the nearest bench was occupied by a young couple in spandex he stumbled over muttering perched his butt on a corner and the couple got up and left this was good the synagogue must have just let out because he saw old people milling around outside the front door then dispersing he had nothing against any group even jews just wished those who couldnt take care of themselves would die and make room for everyone else someone else didnt like the jews though guy working the souvenir stand a couple of stores down look at how he stared at them real hostility ugly guy midforties long greasylooking blond hair probably tinted bad skin skinny arms sticking out of the sleeves of a really hideous purple california here i come tshirt the stand stocked similar shirts hats sunglasses toys and banners and postcards a tiny little place crammed with junk no one was buying probably because the proprietor was about as welcoming as a piranha hostile and jumpy looking up and down ocean front too interesting a pair of cops walked their bicycles past the stand and the ugly guys eyes widened and his body shot forward he almost threw himself over the counter wanting to tell them something but he stopped himself picked up some kind of doll pretended to be checking the price strange the cops must have thought so too because they stopped and talked to the ugly guy he produced a sicklooking smile and shook his head the cops didnt leave right away something about the guy was making them wonder the guy kept smiling fingering the doll and finally they did leave the guy stood there for a long time watching them before returning to his old routine looking north then south north then south not a glance at the beach looking for something in particular someone anonymous tip could it be was god that good he studied the souvenir vendor for another twenty minutes and the pattern never altered pace check out the walkway take a doll down squeeze it put it back pace suddenly the guy altered his routine going behind the cheap chintz curtains that backed the souvenir stand probably a rear stockroom maybe a bathroom break for five minutes the stand was left unattended and some local kids cruised by and pulled postcards from the rack when the longhaired guy came out he was wiping his lips a drink break here he goes again up and down up and down definitely on the prowl could it really be maybe he was waiting for a dope deal then again the tip had come from somewhere to a loser like this selling crap no one bought twentyfive thou would be a helluva lot of saturdays good reason to be jumpy he observed the guy some more same routine one more booze break the guy was robotic on autopilot just like the nuts he used to see when he visited his mother definitely worth looking into what did he have to lose he got up walked a hundred yards south reversed direction and shifted closer to the storefronts passing close to the stand and looking for posted hours there it was summer hours to mf weekends to hed leave come back close to hopefully the crowds would be gone hopefully the guy wouldnt close up early or go off shift if he did there was always another day given no other leads it was all he had and he decided to be hopeful optimism that was the key long as you didnt lose the irony saddlewax road was a quarter mile in from the palos verdes turnoff along the way petra saw two little girls in full equestrian dress riding gorgeous brown horses a woman on a black steed trailed them scrutinizing their posture or the horses or both balchs house was threequarters up the shady street a onestory apricot stucco ranch atop a high bed of devil ivy that same white corral fencing cordoned the property and all its neighbors boys shot baskets a man in a bright green polo shirt hosed down a vintage corvette the neighborhood had that aura of families with bright futures strange place for a man living alone maybe the remnant of one of the marriages there was a basketball hoop atop balchs garage too no cars parked outside the few roses planted next to the house were leggy and browning and the roof shakes were warped bound stacks of mail four days worth sat in front of the screen door a very small notice stapled to the screen said the local sheriffs had assumed jurisdiction over the property no one was to trespass the locals hadnt taken in the mail wil phoned them and they said it was okay to enter if he and petra removed anything make a list and send a copy he got evidence bags and recording forms from the trunk of his car petra picked up the mail and they went in the living room was dark rancid littered with unfolded newspapers dirty clothes empty cans of beer and pepsi bottles of orange juice and vodka a screwdriver man a sty just like the office unlike the lexus as petra read the mail wil got to work on the sofas removing cushions unzipping them yanking out the foam four days of post yielded utility bills junk ads coupons three days ago hed been spotted at montecito switching cars after burying estrella flores where had he cut the maids throat probably somewhere in the hills above ranchhaven petras best guess was hed overpowered flores in the house driven her out through the fire road found some nice quiet kill spot then wrapping the body in plastic stashing her in the trunk he made the fortyfiveminute drive to montecito entombed the body left the lexus behind because he thought it was clean and why would the cops check out ramseys weekend house picking up the jeep because that had been lisas murder vehicle and he wanted to make sure it was clean she recalled his demeanor during the interview a little downbeat selfeffacing no edginess but if he was that psychopathic why would there be slipping in lisas bad temper how she took it out on cart brandnew running shoes a clever bastard mr gregory balch so why had he stayed a lackey all his life embezzling cash from the boss waiting for the right moment to bolt original plans to do it with lisa but something had gone wrong was balch somewhere in brazil with suitcases of cash the satisfaction of having destroyed ramseys life in more ways than one she went into the kitchen the food in the fridge was sad bachelor fare beer wine more orange juice and smirnoff more takeout cartons beef lo mein and ribs from a chinese place on hawthorne boulevard kfc crispy chicken bucket no address but shed seen an outlet along the way on hawthorne half a gigantic pizza from a place called demonas in studio city ventura boulevard just a few blocks from the office all the food was long past edibility the pizza looked petrified in the living room wil worked grimly and silently upending couches slitting burlap bottoms pulling a clock off the wall and shaking it hard enough to do serious damage peering up the fireplace she decided to get an overview of the house found three bedrooms two boneempty one a disgusting mess a pair of bathrooms a dining area off the kitchen and next to the living room a paneled den that looked out to the backyard nothing in it but a brown leather recliner and a sixtyinch tv an illegal black box sat atop the television petra switched on the set and was assaulted by five feet of penis entering vagina a lazy synthesizer score moans and grunts oh those men said wil laughing she turned off the tv opened the curtains the yard was nicesized with several mature trees and an oval swimming pool but the grass was ten inches of hay the pool a sump of algaestreaked soup high block walls and shrubbery blocked the neighbors views lucky for the neighbors lightyears from ramseys princely lifestyle all those years of being nothing like ramsey she decided to tackle the disgusting bedroom first it smelled like the bottom of a laundry basket kingsize bed cheap headboard black sheets and pillowcases flecked with oily gray stains gloving up she bagged the linens the mattress was a mildewed ruin even protected by surgical rubber she found handling balchs linens repulsive facing the bed was another tv same size and a second black box same porn station wadded tissues and stroke books in a nightstand added to the picture of balchs solitary sexual life she flipped through the magazines hoping for some really nasty s m to build up the badguy psyche but most of it was straight hetero male fantasy the worst some lightweight bondage the porn went into a bag duly noted piles of dirty underwear and socks created a lumpy rug between the wall and the left side of the bed balch probably slept on the right side tossed his junk across the closet was crammed with sweat suits in varying colors drawstring lounging pants jeans shirts all with macys labels a plastic bag with a ticket from a dry cleaner on hawthorne boulevard contained two pairs of pants and three shirts including the bright blue silk hed been wearing the day of the notification call she removed the plasticwrapped garments he leaves dirty laundry on the floor for days but chooses to clean these probably the stuff hed worn while murdering lisa two pants three shirts if they were bloodstained why hadnt the cleaner noticed she tagged and bagged moved on to the shelf above the closet thirteen file boxes up there balchs tax records she took her time with them his salary from ramsey was his sole income ramseyd started him off twentyfive years ago at regular raises had brought him to nice but nothing compared to the bosss millions the forms listed little by way of investment hed deducted depreciation on the saddlewax house which had been purchased fourteen years ago and his car leases buicks then caddies now the lexus but no other real estate for thirteen years alimony had been paid monthly to helen balch of duluth minnesota for the last nine hed also divvied up to amber leigh balch helens name conjured up a middleaged woman the dutiful first wife the house bought fourteen years ago right after the marriage if so dissolution had taken place one year later amber leigh sounded like an industry pseudonym petra saw a homewrecker with big hair long legs probably blond because lisa and ilse said he liked blondes bigchested bimbo a face not quite pretty enough that hadnt lasted long either two thousand a month to helen fifteen hundred to amber his takehome was a little over eight thou a month lease payments on the lexus were six hundred take away that and spousal support and he cleared thirtynine hundred a month for the last few years hed received tax refunds of twenty grand or so not poverty but chicken feed by industry standards by ramsey standards no obvious signs of bigticket hobbies or conspicuous expenditures did he play the track sniff coke had he accumulated a money stash augmented it with skim she searched every corner of the room found no bankbooks or investment material unlike lisa no plans had she been his launderer then shed demanded more or tried to blackmail balch money and passion had to be a door slammed she looked out the window and saw wil heading for the garage he pushed a remote and the door slid open no car that she could see she returned to the tax files labeling each carton onward the first of the empty bedrooms was just that in the second though she found more booty on the closet shelf three shoe boxes of loose photos first came thirtyyearold professional shots of football teams high school and college the faces too small to make out then homecamera jobs showing ramsey and balch in full athletic gear giant padded shoulders tight waists tall dark and handsome and his flaxenhaired buddy both grinning cocky ready to take on the world after that came wedding snaps balch still lean and tan wearing a powderblue tux a ruffled shirt and an unsure expression helen turned out to be slender attractive with short dark hair and a prim mouth later photos showed her aging well staying slim sometimes wearing glasses holding a baby wrapped in pink a daughter balch had never mentioned a child during the interview but why would he theyd been focusing on other peoples lives petra remembered how he punted away personal questions at the time it had seemed awshucks now she understood twenty or so pictures of the child no name on the back of any of the pictures a pretty darkhaired girl who favored her mother snapshots up till age eight or so then nothing the divorce or had it been worse a death yet another loss in balchs miserable life box number two contained smaller versions of the celeb shots petra had seen on balchs office wall mostly ramsey a few of balch various photographers hollywood and the valley the last box was nearly empty just a wedding portrait photographers stamp from las vegas a vegas connection balch in a dark suit and white bandedcollar shirt pinkfaced puffy slightly offkilter towering over amber leigh who was tiny and asian with incredible cheekbones and breasts that screamed augmentation not what petra had pictured but definitely bimboistic he married darkhaired women but killed blondes beneath the photo was an envelope dated three years ago loopy childish handwriting addressed to mr g balch at the saddlewax address on the return side caitlin balch no address duluth minnesota postmark the same handwriting on a single sheet of lined notepaper dear dad well im graduating from junior high and i won an award for band but i dont think you care about that you never call or come here anymore and you never send the alemoney on time and with mom being sick that makes it really hard for us im only writing this because mom said i should you should know when your daughter graduates you dont care right your daughter i guess caitlin lauren balch pathetic had he ever answered no further correspondence said probably not no shots of lisa or ilse eggermann that would have been too much to hope for if hed been obsessed with either of the dead women hed probably destroyed the evidence or taken it with him to play with petra bound all the shoe boxes with rubber bands and was carrying them out when she heard wil shout hed laid it all out on the floor of the garage six handguns two revolvers and four automatics three rifles two shotguns one an expensive mossler boxes of ammo for everything the garage smelled of gun oil tool rack on a wall above an empty workbench two large toolboxes full of assorted gizmos a pair of fishingtackle boxes six fishing rods seven reels deepsea and lake said wil appreciatively good lures too handtied and look at this knives petra counted thirtytwo bucks fighting daggers longbladed boning knives wil said hed taken from the tackle boxes the man likes to shoot and cut petra theres blood on the boning blade might be trout then again maybe not fishing and hunting said petra maybe hes got himself a little cabin up in the woods thats all we need one of those nature boysurvivalist deals better take our time with all this im gonna put on fresh gloves get my video cam it was when they finished the house had grown almost unbearably hot and petras nose had gotten accustomed to the smell wil said we earned our keep and clicked the tv on again switching channels from an oralsex pretzel to local news just in case something broke it seems to be the way we find out anything the news was all crime a nineyearold girl abducted in willow glen a driveby in florence and another db out in angeles crest but nothing on lisa or william bradley straight work work work said wil yawning and pulling down his sleeves hed folded his linen jacket and placed it on the mantel over a protective layer of lapd plastic he looked as tired as petra felt he yawned again and she said i know were supposed to start casting the net on balch but i for one need some food he held up a silencing finger something on the tv had turned him wideawake white male the reporter was saying no name has been released yet but sheriffs deputies have described the victim as unusually large over six feet and three hundred pounds or more the body parts were separated but hadnt yet been scattered in this remote area of the forest the boy scouts who may have disturbed the killer report seeing a car drive off quickly with its lights off thats it for now chuck well keep you posted fournier gunned the remote speeding through channels three other news shows but either the dismemberment had already been covered or only one station had the story so far what said petra six feet three hundred pounds he said maybe its a coincidence but thats real damn close to the size of buell moran the fool who was looking for the straight kid the one who probably killed the kids mother i mean i know this countrys got an obesity problem but we were figuring hed heard about the beach tip and headed west if he did maybe he met someone he thought could help him but didnt im not saying it is him lots of bikers get dumped in angeles crest plenty of them are big but its too cute to ignore much too cute said petra enter it in a baby contest and heres another thing petra dismemberment and angeles crest reminds me of something i dealt with years ago working on those russian cases russians loved to cut up the bodies we walked in on one of them doing it they concentrate on the head and the fingertips think it screws up ids and they were using angeles crest had just discovered it the guy who gave me the tip on the kid is russian first time i met him i had a feeling about him con eyes why would he kill moran how about competition for the twentyfive lets say both of them got a serious case of the greeds both are lowlifes no impulse control the russian zhukanovs his name sees moran showing the kids picture around gets worried or maybe moran approaches him tells zhukanov hes the kids father has some rights here zhukanov says enough of this noise those russians are mean petra the guy we caught playing human jigsaw had been paid two hundred bucks imagine what twentyfive thou would motivate if zhukanov was threatened enough to kill moran said petra it might mean he learned something new about the straight boys whereabouts more than he told you let me phone in to see if any new messages came in on that the clerk said youve got messages but its crazy cant go up to check no one answered in the squad room she hung up and wil took his jacket off the mantel his forehead was as dark and slick as licorice and he wiped it and dialed the phone a number she recognized downtown sheriffs rons hq good old tans again he said their solve rates about twice ours but they dont have to deal with the gangbangernowitness bullshi hello this is detective fournier hollywood lapd could you please petra took the shoe boxes out to her car in the dark balchs street was silent and peaceful happy families cozy in front of the big screen if they only knew she filled her nose with warm piney air what was the weather like in duluth minnesota what would helen balch think when the exs face was all over the tube when she got back wil was smiling no id on the body but theyve got the head thank you boy scouts and the description fits moran to a t i know weve been cranking up the overtime and i was looking forward to some shuteye petra but i think we need at least to check this russian out maybe we cant solve lisa right away but wouldnt it be nice to solve something it would be loverly said petra do you mind if we stop on the way for some grub theres a chinese place on hawthorne that mr balch patronized i doubt hes got good taste but who knows kathy bishop awoke at nine sweating chilled in terrible pain stu punched the call button and held her hand she looked at him but from her face he couldnt tell what she saw where the hell were the nurses he wanted to run over to the station but didnt want to leave kathy finally they came and he had to control himself from screaming at them now kathy was sedated back asleep and he realized it hadnt taken that long after all get a grip the room felt like a cell hed left only for an hour when mother had vanned all the kids over at fivethirty and theyd gone for burgers and fries at a local mcdonalds all six were quieter than usual even the baby he assured them they could see mommy soon played around told jokes thought they were buying the daddyasusual bit but wasnt sure he felt out of it some imposter inhabiting daddys body the kids started acting up and mother said lets go troops on the way out stu noticed other diners staring and he filled with anger whats wrong turkeys never seen a big family before he stayed hot all the way to st joes weird hed never had a short fuse before meanwhile petra and wil were chasing what looked to be a multiple killer and he was calling airlines catching guff and bureaucratese turning up empty no record of balch booking any flights but with all the turndowns hed received who knew he used to be able to worm stuff out of bureaucrats mormon charm kathy called it kissing his forehead and favoring him with her comehither wink he loved that wink not an ounce of charm in him tonight he held kathys hand limp lifeless but for the warmth of her skin he might have panicked breathing evenly the machines said she was fine no more airlines to call not a damn thing to do but wait for what more pain too woundup to sleep he got up and paced the room he needed to sleep needed to be together for kathy the stack of tv guides sat on an end table maybe stupid derivative dack price plotlines would get him drowsy he was into the second volume when he felt his posture slacken and his eyelids droop the third made the room grow dim then something filtered through the fatigue words sentences something a little different now he was sitting up wideawake rereading wondering should he call petra strange maybe nothing but he didnt even know where petra was so out of touch could his judgment be trusted hed try to find her worse came to worst hed have wasted some time wasting time was his new hobby anyway the white cop was taking him seriously finally which is what zhukanov told him when the guy appeared at the counter just before closing time showing his badge and the picture of the kid finally pardon sir i talk to one of you but he dont call back a black guy the white cop stared yes sir i know what do you want demanded zhukanov doublechecking on the identification sir the cop leaned his elbows on the counter and put the newspaper clipping down big guy blond ruddy dark suit dark tie he reminded zhukanov of a colonel hed worked with on crowd control back home a real sadist loved to twist limbs knew how to do maximal damage with just a flick of a wrist borokovsky this guy looked a lot like borokovsky was he of russian descent his card said detective d a price but everyone changed their names doublechecking i already tell you he been here no one calls me its on the tv its a homicide investigation sir we have to be careful said the blond cop looking over zhukanovs shoulder at the shelves of toys calling me sir but probably thinking im some kind of joke a clown the fat guy thought so too and look where he was having had several hours to think about it zhukanov felt good about killing the fat guy great even the siberian wolf dispatches its prey paints its muzzle with blood howls at the moon while cutting the guy up zhukanov had felt like howling moving him into the car then dragging him out had been torture zhukanovs back and shoulders and arms still throbbed getting the bastard into pieces turned out to be not so easy either he shouldve sharpened the kitchen knives better that cleaver shouldve gone right through the joints not stuck like that the head though had been less of a problem than he expected rolling away like a soccer ball eyes open that was funny he felt like kicking it but you had to get rid of the head and the fingers let the cops have the rest of the carcass his plan had been to take the head somewhere it would never be found but the boy scouts had ruined it hiking through the forest yelling like drunks so now the cops had the head maybe theyd learn who the fat guy was big deal no connection to him hed cleaned all the blood and here was a cop leaning over the very same counter no clue zhukanov fought not to smile hed tossed the knives into five separate storm drains from valencia to van nuys the fat mans clothing and billfold ended up in dumpsters near fairfax and melrose let the yids get blamed no bills in the billfold just a drivers license and a nice picture of a naked girl with her legs spread that zhukanov pocketed the license he slipped down another drain the fat mans name was moran so what when he got home he washed his bloody clothes took a shower had something to eat worked with the broken gun for a while still couldnt figure out what was wrong with it then a few glasses of vodka and he was out like a light by three five hours later he was back at the shack waiting for the yids to return with the kid if they didnt hed go over to the motor vehicle department on monday but the car showed up all right pulling behind the yid church at nine prayer time for the yids zhukanov knew usually till eleven or so he kept going back to the alley every fifteen minutes finally spotted the old guy whod hidden the kid coming out with an old woman they drove off and he followed them in his car they never noticed too busy yapping and now he had an address without paying for it twentythree sunrise court he didnt write it down the way he had with the license number because now he was smart no one would get it unless they paid for it and now look how calm he was facing the white cop though if the guy had just showed the badge no picture of the kid he mightve figured it had something to do with moran what the hell would he have done then i tell the black guy he said he never call me back im sorry sir weve been quite busy you busy looking for the kid said zhukanov but i see him you saw him several days ago sir maybe said zhukanov smiling maybe maybe i see him again the blond cop pulled out a little notepad when sir i tell your black buddy the first time he never call me back the blond cop frowned leaned a little closer sir if you have information i dont know said zhukanov shrugging maybe i forget the way the black guy forget to call me the pad shut the cop was annoyed but he smiled sir i understand your frustration sometimes things get busy and we dont dot every i if that happened to you im dot every i is important said zhukanov not sure what that meant but also money money said the cop twentyfive thousand that said the cop sure if we find the boy and he helps us its yours at least thats what i was told no one tell me ive seen the forms sir my captain signed them if youd like to call him no no said zhukanov i just wanna get it square you know maybe i know something more than i told the black guy but what if kid runs you dont find him what happens if your informations solid youll get partial payment said the cop part of the twentyfive thousand thats the way we always do it im not saying you could get all of it but how much part of it i dont know sir but generally in these situations its around a third to a half id guess ten twelve thousand and if the boy is there youd get all twentyfive why dont you speak to my captain no no said zhukanov thinking if the old yid did take the kid home with him the kid could still run better not dawdle anymore i want you should write it down write what what you say twelve fifteen to zhukanov just for telling all twentyfive if kid show up sir said the blond cop sighing im not in a position oh all right here you go ripping a sheet out of his pad he said how do you spell your name zhukanov told him the blond cop printed neatly this stipulates that to the best of my knowledge mr v zhukanov is due because of information he has offered about a missing boy unknown identity related to l ramsey pc should mr v zhukanovs information lead directly to this boy and this boys information lead to apprehension of a suspect he would be due det d a price badge here said the cop but to be honest i cant promise you this means much zhukanov snatched the paper read it and stuffed it down his pants pocket now he had a contract if the bastards gave him trouble hed hire johnnie cochran sue the hell out of them i know where he is he said enough for the twentyfive the blond cop waited pen poised the yids the jews from over there got him zhukanov pointed south they got a church the old jew hid him in there took him home you saw this said the cop he straightened and his shoulders widened you bet i looked for the car followed it to the old guys house this morning good detective work mr zhukanov in russia i was policeman really well it paid off sir thank you and believe me ill do everything i can to make sure you get every penny of that twentyfive thousand you bet said zhukanov the wolf triumphs the blond cop said whats the address twentythree sunrise court twentyfivethousanddollar address thats here in venice yeah yeah right here idiot didnt know his own city zhukanov hooked a thumb from alley you go to speedway then to pacific then five blocks over great said the cop closing the pad youve been a tremendous help sir when you say the alley you mean the one back there yeah yeah i show you vaulting over the counter adrenalinecharged despite his aching limbs zhukanov led the blond cop around the side of the shack past the shippingcarton trash boxes if the guy only knew what had been in there yesterday over there he pointed is jew church where i see car okay what kind of car sir lincoln white brown roof year dont matter i got something better for you grinning zhukanov recited the license number the cop scrawled in the darkness other way is where he went north said the cop yeah yeah right up to speedway and then pacific five blocks the cop repeated the instructions a real dummy thats it said zhukanov go find him you stupid bastard im giving him to you on a platter the cop put his pad away and shot out a hand thank you sir they shook firm manly shake if the cop only knew the hand he was grasping had been bloody up to the elbow a few hours ago zhukanov tried to break the clasp get the guy moving but he couldnt pull away the cop was holding on to him yanking him close what the hell was this the cop was grinning like he was going to kiss him this wasnt right this was wrong zhukanov struggled struck out a hand grabbed his wrist twisted it something broke and pain devoured him from fingertip to the bottom of his ear one quick move just like colonel borokovsky he cried out involuntarily and something big and meaty exploded in the middle of his face and he went down then more pain even worse burning searing like a fire igniting his bowels starting right under his navel then spreading upward like a burning rope then he felt cold a strange cold cold air blowing inside him deep inside and knew hed been split open filleted the way hed split the fat bastard and now it had happened to him and he couldnt do a damn thing just lie there and take it the last thing he felt was a hand going through his pocket fishing out the contract liar cheater the money was hi being alone here is different from the park dif ferent from watson ive got all these rooms these books someone who trusts me once in a while i hear footsteps out on the sidewalk or someone talking or laughing a car driving by but they dont bother me im here locked in i can sleep without waking up to see whats around i can read without a flashlight ive thought about it a lot and sams right tomorrow ill find a phone and call the police tell them about plyr maybe i can call mom too tell her im okay not to worry im doing just fine one day ill come back be able to support her what would she do cry get mad beg me to come back or worse not beg me she must miss me a little i stop thinking about it stretch my feet out on the couch pull the knit blanket up over my knees start in on the next life magazine the main articles all about john kennedy and his family happy and handsome on the beach california beach same sand thats just a little way up i could walk over look at it pretend to be john kennedy come back but i told sam id stay here and he gave me the alarm code i get up and try it green light red light green light red light green light i open the door smell the salt that beach smell no ones out most of the houses are dark i go out to the porch feel cold scared back in the house why does just going outside scare me ill try again later back to the kennedys the owner of the chinese restaurant had no mem ory of balch petra and wil ordered some spring rolls to go ate them in her car agreed to drive separately to venice meet on pacific and rose walk to zhukanovs stand together she called the desk at hollywood station detective bishop for you half an hour ago said the clerk had stu gotten hold of flight information on balch this operator refused to put petra through no calls to surgical patients past nine maam im a police detective returning another detectives call stuart bishop is mr bishop the patient no his wife is then im sorry maam i cant put you through let me speak to your supervisor please i am the supervisor the rules are for our patients welfare and comfort if youd like i can have a message slip sent up to the room telling him you called fine ill wait cant do that maam itll take time were understaffed and i need to keep all the lines open if its important im sure hell call back sure said petra have a nice night she got back in the car drove on hoping it wasnt that important even if they found a flight reservation she had doubts balch had actually shown up the call to westward charter had to be a fakeout balch had been too careful about everything else to slip up like that meaning what he was anywhere but las vegas site of his second wedding tomorrow shed try to get hold of amber leigh and helen find out why theyd divorced the guy his kinks bad habits what might lead him to murder blondes anywhere but the cabin in the woods homicidal thoreau if no leads showed up soon schoelkopf would probably go straight to americas most wanted maybe that was the best way to handle it take the heat off her and wil off william bradley straight now motherless poor poor kid and now the guy whod probably turned him into an orphan had been butchered like the squalid ton of pork he was one less felon heard from petra felt grim satisfaction about that not that it would stop her from going after the butcher dinky little house light on in the front room but dim the lincoln parked in back so the old man was home with the kid was he married zhukanov hadnt mentioned anything about seeing a wife but that didnt mean anything the old guy couldve gone to temple left her behind maybe she was sick an invalid easy on balance the walk street was probably an advantage no cars to hide behind but no drivers interrupting no pedestrians either during the half hour hed watched the house from three different spots he tried the back alley again rubber soles swallowing his footsteps the newish running shoes hed walked around in them made sure there was no squeak out of the cheapsuit cop getup and into black sweats and a black windbreaker with pockets the van rented from a flybynight place down near the airport a perfect dressing room hed paid cash used no id leaving the guy who ran the rental lot five hundred in cash as collateral five hundred hed never see again worth it the van was parked four blocks away east of main on a residential street pleasant stroll to sunrise court the beach air was tangy invigorating hed never lived on the beach maybe one day from the back he could see that the kitchen light was still on ten thirtyeight someone up or just a security measure probably the latter hed seen no trace of any movement why had the old guy taken the kid in a relative the drawing didnt show a jewishlooking kid but you could never tell no if it was a family thing wouldnt they be pushing the kid to collect the money a good samaritan religious convictions giving the kid sanctuary in the temple did jews believe in that he had no idea returning to the front he hid behind a clump of shrubbery continued to watch the house how to do it the only way was a blitz home invasion gangbangers were getting into that especially the asians a small place like this how many rooms could there be a knife would be best because of the sound factor but running from room to room stabbing was risky even with weak prey there was the risk of escape the alternative was the glock but that meant noise venice was highcrime hed heard about gangs on ocean front had seen gang types during todays surveillance so the neighbors were probably used to hearing gunshots at night but a street like this the houses close together bursting in doing it ditching the gun taking the escape route hed plotted back to the van risky but fun admit it the risk was part of the fun that and simply being able to do it a zapperoo commando blitz then one hand on the knife the other on the gun if it was just the kid and the old man and they were close together the knife would probably work so hed start with the knife have the gun ready for complications one thing hed decided for sure rear entry was best ha ha another advantage of the walk street everyone parked in back so walking through the alley wouldnt be viewed as deviant if he was spotted hed affect a relaxed stroll pretend to belong jangle his keys and head for one of the cars the way he looked white male sweats wouldnt be threatening he hoped his knees hurt too much squatting the percs were no longer doing the trick lisa had claimed coke was a good anesthetic dentists used to smear it on gums always wanting him to try it screw that he bought it for her spooned it up her cute little nose tried to get some satisfaction from her body while she was high but no way would he do it percs were as far as he went maintain the upper edge he waited nothing okay back again ready to blitz he was just about to leave when the front door opened and someone came out on the patio looking around the kid perfect hed sprint across the sidewalk grab him cut his throat be off god was good but just as he got ready to spring the kid ran back inside scared youve got good reason sonny thats the place said wil waiting the phone to his ear ocean front walk was dark and deserted and petra could barely make out the souvenir stand as they got closer she saw it was a tiny ramshackle thing rolldown shutter over the front okay wil said to the phone to petra got a home address for him west hollywood of course they were twenty feet away from the shack no one on the walkway for at least a hundred yards theyd passed one homeless guy at the corner of paloma and speedway and petra saw another sitting on a bench to the north but he got up and shuffled away the tide whispered secrets and the beach looked like ice they were about to turn around when she noticed something two inches of space beneath the shutter closed but not locked gun out she hurried over wil following loops for a lock were welded to the lowerrighthand corner of the steel roll and a ring was bolted to the counter but no lock in sight she peered through the two inches dark but she could make out stuff wrapped in plastic hanging from racks postcards hats just like the kind william straight wore she backed clear across ocean front watched the stand while talking to wil in a low voice clear sign of illegal entry our duty to investigate absolutely he said but what if the guys some nut and hes lurking inside there lets check the back first whipping out penlights they snaked along the north side of the stand too damn dark too damn quiet petra liked using her brains psyching out bad guys she could do without this tv cop stuff behind the building were two huge wooden packing crates slats over plank sides her penlight said they came from the docks at long beach the stands back door was bolted a nice big padlock in place off definitely off unless it hadnt been a thoughtout burglary just something impulsive the packing crates stank of garbage the neighboring buildings all utilized commercial dumpsters city regulations the russian saving money one good thing about the crates though the slats offered an easy foothold she got a toe in hoisted herself up the first one looked inside nothing she found zhukanov in the second crate lying on his back atop a heap of trash mouth open in the dead mans stupid gape one arm spread the other pinioned under his head at an angle that would have been excruciatingly painful had he been alive bisected disemboweled the penlight turned his intestines into overfed eels same killing wound as lisa balch had never left town at all the charter call a fakeout just as shed suspected so what had stu phoned about no time to think about that she ran the light over the trash saw the blood now a huge crimson oblong spattered on paper refuse wil had found blood too specks and drips on the front of the crate another large stain on the ground shed been standing right in it damnit how could she have missed it they phoned it in to pacific division were told to safeguard the scene it might be a while before anyone showed up because a shooting had just gone down in oakwood and some of those victims were still breathing inside the stand they found no evidence of breakin just crappy toys a rear stockroom with a chair and a card table full of receipts and sales slips no apparent system a planet hollywood jacket hung from a nail in the wall on adjoining nails were nunchucks half a baseball bat with a leather thong tarnished brass knuckles the russian equipped for battle someone had taken him by surprise several bottles in the corner might explain it cheaplooking russian labels cloudy vodka one of the bottles was nearly empty zhukanov drunk his defenses down bolstered by booze when he killed moran if he had killed moran maybe hed been morans crime buddy a drug connection whatever and the two had colluded to collect the twentyfive thousand somehow balch had figured it out and finished them both off but then why bother taking moran to angeles crest while leaving zhukanov right here where he was sure to be found look what i can do zhukanovs gut wound matched lisas and ilses but moran didnt fit so the russian probably had dispatched moran and balch had finished off zhukanov there could only be one reason the russian knew something vital about william bradley straight all zhukanov had told wil was that the boy had bought a hat from him not enough to kill for had the russian held back did he know more she shot her theories at wil who was up in front examining the inside wall beneath the counter looking for more bloodstains she was talking at manic speed couldnt believe the edge in her voice wil listened said you think zhukanov saw the boy again got a fix on his location but how would balch find out i dont know but if it was him he took zhukanov by surprise maybe force or zhukanov was plastered or he pulled some kind of scam on zhukanov the guy was crazy for the reward it could have clouded his judgment a scam said wil someone whod be legit asking about the boy yes said petra a social worker a cop maybe balch impersonated a cop wil thought about that a suit and a fake badge is all itd take yeah zhukanovs greed would do the rest but for balch to risk killing him now when he knows were going to be looking for him we havent caught him he may not even know were on to him said petra and if it leads to the boy it could seem worth it that tells me zhukanov may very well have learned something more about the boy she returned to the stockroom searching nervously frantically toys stupid toys imagine a hairbasket like zhukanov peddling playthings to little kids nothing in the pocket of the planet hollywood jacket the card table the receipts she grabbed them all up started scanning ten slips in she found an invoice form no sale marked no date just a single line of shaky printing rtrm license number had the russian seen william straight in a car and copied down the plate everyone knew you could bribe info out of dmv the papers had covered a big bribery scandal a few months ago a guy like zhukanov would know his way around that sort of thing pay up get the address she looked for a phone in the shack none in either room what a hovel fournier was still looking for blood she borrowed his phone what was the night number for dmv traces yeah yeah she remembered it when the clerk came on she had to fight from barking orders at the woman this one was a stickler for regulations lord save me from rule books but a little assertiveness finally made her cooperate and a few computer clicks later petra had it samuel morris ganzer sunrise court venice birthdate in an old man had william found himself a protector the lincoln was parked inches from the back of the house and its front bumper gave him a great boost to the window drapes on this one too but not drawn tightly he had a perfect view of the kitchen helped along by a small light over the stove the living room too separated only by a waisthigh counter a floor lamp there cast charcoal shadows on gray carpet enough light to see the front door red glow off to the right side alarm too bad but better to know up front three doors to the left probably bedrooms and bathroom not much space between them small rooms better for stabbing and that was the entire layout excellent no sign of the boy since hed first ventured out onto the porch the old guy either both bedroom doors closed the boy and the old man with or without wife fast asleep or maybe the old guy was a queer and the boy was sleeping with him that would sure explain taking him home sleep made it a helluva lot easier burst in throw the bedroom doors open boom boom boom gone even before the time delay kicked in on the alarm knock stuff over on the way out maybe steal something to make it look like a gang thing he got down from the car checked the alley for intruders examined the houses rear door two dead bolts bad but putting a little weight on the wood he felt some give one or two good shoves would take it off the hinges probably ruin his shoulder but he was used to pushing his way through obstacles the door was nothing compared to a defensive line okay then here come da blitz the knife if it worked the gun ready for backup either way he could do it in seconds run out the back fade into the night one last look through the kitchen window he was scared had to admit it this was different not like lisa the german girl sally the stupid russian all those times hed set up the scenes but there were times you had to improvise he climbed up on the lincolns bumper again nothing different but still he hesitated up again down again compulsive when his anxiety rose he handled it with repetition like his mothers head banging the stupid bitch she deserved to die in that stupid helmet okay one last look this time he saw the boy see it pays to be thorough coming out of the middle door to the left a bathroom just as hed guessed skinny little thing light enough to dropkick he watched him emerge go into the kitchen open the refrigerator take something out a carrot would he wash it the sink was right below the window duck crouched next to the outer wall he heard plumbing kick in hygienic little sucker the water stopped he waited finally raised his head peeked in again the kid was standing in the living room back to the kitchen window eating the carrot finishing half of it he walked to the front door punched the alarm panel damn too far to make out the code opening the door the kid stepped out again but only for a few seconds and here he was again back inside closing the door turning about to face the window could he see anything out here in the darkness probably not unless it was right up against the glass but be extra careful duck again another thirty seconds passed before he dared another look the kid was still standing in the living room munching on the carrot visible in profile just another face the kid finished the carrot bent and picked something up a magazine he eats healthy washes reads such a good little citizen but not careful because the light on the front alarm panel was green hed forgotten to trigger the goddamn alarm god was wonderful the blitz was on sunrise court said petra thumbing through her thomas guide wil took his penlight out of his mouth i know it one of the walk streets he was outside the stand recording the details of the zhukanov crime scene which direction she said north five six blocks the license number and samuel ganzers name hadnt impressed him could be zhukanovs boss a customer zhukanov couldve recorded the license for a check authorization could be said petra having only instinct to back her up she closed the map book so youll stay here keep zhukanov company sure maybe hell teach me russian its almost eleven sam should be back soon i thought id stay up till he got here but now im tired guess ill go to sleep hes probably having a good time with mrs kleinman i could eat another carrot but im not really hungry maybe ill take another shower no i already had one dont want to use up too much of sams water i go to turn off the living room lamp maybe ill take some magazines to bed uhoh i forgot to switch the alarm back on i head for the panel reach out for the buttons and from behind me comes an explosion then a crash from the back of the house oh no did i leave the stove on or something but i dont smell gas or anything burning and when i turn i see a big black space where the kitchen door was and the doors down on the floor and a guys coming through the space hes in the house now seeing me throwing open the door to sams room looking in coming out coming at me dressed all in black weird orangepink skin and yellow hair big he looks right at me i dont know him but he knows me plyr how oh god no oh no hes coming right at me and hes got a knife a big pink man with a knife i want to scream but my mouth is frozen i reach for the doorknob touch only air and hes coming faster closer such a big knife i run to the left but that just puts me in a corner nowhere to go bookshelves behind me i have to do something throw something that worked before books i start pulling them off the shelves and heaving them at him as hard as i can a few hit him but he keeps coming walking slower smiling taking his time holding the knife out in front of him waving it back and forth i keep pulling out books and throwing them they hit him in the face the chest the stomach he laughs pushes them away keeps coming the rooms dark but he can see me he keeps coming straight at me i try to shove the dusty couch at him but its too heavy he laughs i pick up the music stand and throw it that surprises him he loses his balance and i run around him into the kitchen toward the back door suddenly im down on the floor something around my leg hes pulling me by the ankle i see his knees bend see the bottom of his chin his arm the knifes coming down i twist around like a snake just keep moving moving maybe if i move hell miss and i can get out through the back door hes squeezing my ankle hurting it i punch at him keep twisting get close enough to the arm thats holding my ankle and bite it bite it hard billy snake billy viper he shouts and lets go and i want to run out the back but hes blocking the way where where where the only choice is fake him out move to the left then the right into the bathroom next best thing get in there lock myself in i jump up run faster than ive ever run before across the kitchen hes running too breathing hard i make it into the bathroom slam the door lock it squeeze in between the toilet and the bathtub cold floor breathing fast my chest hurts so bad no sound then he laughs again i hear footsteps slow footsteps hes relaxed im trying to breathe slower but every breath makes a squeaky sound through the door i hear stupid little shit you cornered yourself hes right the bathroom has no window now hes kicking the door it shakes the wood swells like a balloon that cracks right in the middle i jump up open the medicine cabinet feel in the darkness for something sharp a razor blade scissors anything no razor blade no scissors heres something pointy a nail file i think its not sharp but i grab it he kicks part of his leg comes through black sweats black tennis shoes i stab down at the pants the nail file hits bone but it slides off doesnt go in he yells calls me a little bastard another explosion much louder something comes through the door flying by me the mirror on the medicine cabinet door shatters i feel pain in the back of my head put my hand there warm and sticky needles glass needles a gun hes got a gun too i throw myself into the tub he shoots again now the door is full of holes splintering and now i can see part of him on the other side his legs and shoes and his pants hes still shooting im lying facedown in the tub as low as i can go but a bullet hits the tub and the porcelain shatters and part of the wall falls off this is it im trapped finished i did my best it wasnt good enough i hate you everyone another explosion the bullet goes into something above my head stuff falls down on me dust tiles im getting buried now theres no door just him big huge the knife in one hand the gun in another he turns on the light ive still got the nail file he sees it and laughs puts the gun in his pocket oh no the knife i curl up dont want to see it just dont let me feel it he takes hold of my hair pulls me up so im on my knees pulls my head back i piss my pants and shit slides out of me running down my leg thank you god for nothing you dont exist you liar another explosion more and moreandmoreandmore i cant stand the noise i dont get it whats he doing he drops me and i fall into the tub hard a womans voice says my god then its okay honey a hand touches the back of my neck i scream red puffs sparked from balchs back neck posterior skull later petra learned shed shot him nine times within a twofoot diameter each bullet lethal a tight little circle of death he fell on his face next to the bathtub stayed there the gun at his side she kicked the weapon across the floor kicked him to make sure he was dead though maybe that wasnt the only reason the knife had fallen to one side big ugly commando thing with a black hardrubber handle she kicked it away too stepped over the blacksweatsuited corpse bits of bloodpinkened bone gritted the tile floor the bathroom door was a splinter of frame barely hanging from one hinge the boy was huddled fetally in the tub what was left of the tub ragged chunks of porcelain had been torn loose glass shards and dust and broken tiles were everywhere blood had flowed over balchs back and wormed onto the floor the place looked as if it had been through a war how could the idiot think hed get away with this hed come close shed had trouble finding a space within eyeshot of the house and even though she saw no sign of intrusion something pinged in her gut and she doubleparked around the corner she got out of the car smelling sea air expecting another dead end then gunshots raped the silence and she pulled out her gun and ran around to the back found the door kicked in a dimly lit kitchen beyond the threshold off to the left another ravaged door blacksweatsuited bulk nearly filling the opening an upraised knife a childs limp legs stop she screamed but it was no warning she was already shooting when she got to the boy he refused to uncurl whimpered when she talked to him screamed when she touched him such a skinny little thing his long hair was bloodstained porcupined with glass fragments twelve but the size of a tenyearold a yellow pool had spread underneath him she smelled feces saw the stain covering the seat of his jeans the urge to pick him up hold him rock him in her arms was so strong it made her palate ache she got down on the floor talked to him finally managed to stroke his hair without repulsing him he stopped shaking went rigid then limp she cradled his head and now he let her she knew how to comfort at that moment she thought crazily of nick you were wrong you prick when the boy was breathing regularly she lay him down gently in the tub and called for an ambulance and uniformed backup code returning she stayed with him picking glass out of his scalp getting splinters in her finger it didnt matter it felt okay calling him william using a soothing tone not really knowing what she was saying wanting to calm him down but how could you comfort a kid whod been through this she heard sirens pacific division cops burst in then came the paramedics only when the boy was up on a stretcher did she allow herself to leave him fetal again so small under the shock blanket an old man rushed in looking stunned the paramedics seemed pained as they carried the boy out she watched them carry him away ignored the old mans questions the uniforms too walking straight to balchs body she turned it over not balch a stranger the shock punched her in the heart and she broke out into a sweat a second jolt hit her even stronger recognition ramsey his mustache was gone and his skin was different some kind of salmonpink theatrical makeup was smeared all over his face and down his neck flaking around his nostrils dark shadows around his eyes gray makeup the bushy blond wig had been jarred loose revealing a crescent of black curls blond tint in the eyebrows hed even done the eyebrows blue eyes dull as sewer water mouth open the same old death gape she looked down his mouth saw the tongue curled back blood collecting at the bottom of his throat thinking about what hed put the boy through lisa ilse the flores woman she would have welcomed the chance to kill him again they found gregory balchs body the next day buried under dirt hay and horse manure in the barn behind the calabasas house his throat cut just like estrella floress entombed in dung you didnt need to be a shrink to interpret after tearing the pink palace apart the closest they got to a motive was a single piece of notepaper in ramseys bedroom rolltop one of those from the desk of things in the center hed written l and g lisa and greg a sweat stain beneath the inscription indicated stress according to a department shrink very profound the psychologist was light on facts heavy on pomposity suggested he be the one to see billy straight for debriefing petra had other ideas and she stood her ground stus find added another layer tenyearold adjustor plot out of tv guide a football player attempts to frame his best friend for murder and dack price investigates maybe eventually it would help stu feel hed played a part right now he had kathys recuperation to deal with shed finally gotten realistic agreed to his thirtyday compassionate leave l and g had lisa and balch tumbled or was it all in ramseys paranoid mind or maybe it was money lisa and balch conspiring to skim no way to know till all the financial records were pried loose from larry schick maybe never petra really didnt care same for the specifics of lisas murder just paperwork now her best guess was the original scenario ramsey had doped up balch on sunday night snuck out followed lisa abducted her using the mercedes not the jeep because billy had seen the plates plyr turned out thats all hed seen not enough to point a finger at anyone the boy had been turned into quarry for nothing or maybe ramsey had switched plates used the jeep after all or some other set of wheels he had so many let the techs logic it out killing estrella flores up in the hills because shed seen him sneak out or might have borrowing balchs lexus for the flores kill or maybe balch had been in on it after all friend to the end whatever ramseyd used him tossed him away a football player attempts to frame an old friend pilfering from a script that hadnt been very good in the first place no imagination the industry industry big shots called themselves players ramsey styling himself a player knowing he really wasnt one because his ratings were low his acting was a joke and his penis wouldnt harden to hell with him billy was her concern the boy was beginning his sixth day at western pediatric hospital where hed proved a difficult patient at first petra neglected her paperwork ignored schoelkopfs calls spent most of her time bedside when she left a hospital play therapist filled in at first billy ignored both of them by the third day he was accepting the books and magazines petra brought him on the fourth day ron came and took her to dinner at the biltmore downtown nice dinner great dinner she found her hand seeking his the way he listened to her turned her on till then shed wondered if what had happened between them was due to the tension of the case to her great pleasure now that things were calming down she wanted to be with him more maybe soon shed get to meet his girls sweet fantasies she harbored no illusions of healing the boys emotional wounds had phoned alex delaware a psychologist shed worked with and trusted friend of milo sturgiss a man whod been willing to go undercover for something he believed in but he was out of town with his girlfriend would be returning today meanwhile billy stayed in the hospital for antibiotic treatment and nutrition a police guard sitting ten feet down the hall no reason petra could see for that but schoelkopf had ordered it maybe he was feeling guilty so why not the uniform at the door to billys room had been called into action only once dealing with sam ganzer who insisted on visiting feisty old guy standing on his tiptoes facing up to the uniform fingers pointing things getting loud until petra interceded said ganzer could see billy took him for coffee in the family lounge first to calm him down he wanted to know what would happen after billy left the hospital telling petra she was brave a real hero but no way would he allow her or anyone else to send the boy to some stupid juvenile hall i can tell you about institutions hell ill adopt him myself before i let you get away with that petra promised shed take care of billy adoption fantasies had filled her head too billy needed to be hospitalized for at least three weeks hed emerged from the nightmare encounter with only superficial scratches but medical tests revealed a lowgrade bacterial infection in his lungs foot fungus slightly elevated blood pressure and a preulcerous stomach the doctors pronounced the last two symptoms as probable stress reactions no kidding the infection was their main concern and they had him on iv antibiotics no one had told him about his mother yet delaware said hed handle it and petra was grateful it wouldnt be her ilse eggermann would never be solved officially but petra was sure ramsey had done her too how close shed come to being fooled okay humility was good for the soul good for the career too in the future shed be careful about assuming anything she thought about how ramsey and ilse could have gone down ramsey visiting balch in rolling hills estates couple of beers between friends then on the way home nice easy drive up hawthorne he decides on a stopover at the pier had he used a disguise that night too had he been planning something all along or had ilses foreigner status protected him from recognition the adjustor had never made it over to europe that kind of mo indicated he mightve killed other women shed beg off that part of it let the feds have their fun anyone else who wanted the glory schoelkopf was already holding press conferences talking about his investigation no news on the reward yet dr and mrs boehlinger had returned to ohio to finalize lisas funeral arrangements and they hadnt returned petras calls whether or not billy deserved the reward legally he certainly deserved it morally boehlinger would probably try to avoid paying after what hed put billy through petra wanted to lean on him but what could she do maybe an anonymous leak to the papers or perhaps mrs b would come through all secondary for now billy slept helped along by a big dinner and sedation angel face white and smooth so peaceful she bent down kissed his forehead left the room went to get the play therapist on her way out of the hospital one of the administrators a middleaged suit named bancroft snagged her hows our little hero detective connor fine bancroft caught her arm let go quickly when she stared at his hand if you have a moment detective i have someone whod like to speak with you who in my office please his office was big done up in blue tweed and fake colonial two women in their sixties sat in overstuffed chairs one was chunky broadshouldered with wiry gray hair uncoiling under a small charcoal pillbox hat an ancient nononsense tweed suit a melttheglacier stare the other was very thin with coiffed hair the color of brandy tasteful jewelry light makeup navy suit that looked like chanel matching shoes her face was longish painfully angular shed probably been beautiful once she looked frightened petra was baffled detective said bancroft this is mrs adamson she and the late mr adamson were among our most generous benefactors slight inflection on the past tense bancroft winced the thin woman smiled her hands were white blueveined slightly liverspotted petra noticed one index finger making tiny circles atop her purse gorgeous shoes gorgeous suit but like the stocky womans getup the outfit looked old gave off a clear sense of history no introduction of the other woman she was examining petra like a fishwife rating mullet well ill leave you to talk said bancroft he left the chunky woman got up too looking none too happy thank you mildred mrs adamson told her mildred nodded grimly before closing the door mrs adamson turned to petra her mouth worked finally she said please call me cora im so sorry to take your time but instead of continuing she removed something from her purse and held it out color snapshot of billy a little younger maybe eleven he stood on a boat dock waving how did you get this maam its mine i snapped the picture you know billy straight the bottom half of the womans mouth trembled and her eyes pooled with tears this isnt billy straight detective connor its billy adamson william bradley adamson jr my son my late son petra examined the back of the photo a handwritten inscription said billy arrowhead the colors were a little faded she should have noticed some detective the boy was smiling but something was off the smile required effort a handkerchief had flown to cora adamsons face she said perhaps there are things i couldve done differently but i wasnt how could i know for sure know what mrs adamson forgive me im not making sense let me organize my thoughts billy my billy was an only child brilliant he taught himself to read at four he graduated from cal law school thirteen years ago immediately began doing legal work for the farm workers union my late husband was convinced it was a stage rebellion getting back at the corporate world but i knew better billy had always been caring kind even as a small boy he refused to hurt anything he wouldnt fish bill senior loved to fish but billy refused the day i shot that picture he and bill had had a tiff about that bill insisted he was going to show billy how to fish once and for all billy cried and insisted he wouldnt get in the boat refused to kill anything finally bill told him if he couldnt be a man just to stay behind with his mother which he did but he was upset he loved his father i took the picture to cheer him up petra stared at the photo same eyes same hair same cleft chin jesus even the expression was a clone at twelve he became a vegetarian said cora adamson again bill thought it was a phase but billy never touched meat or fish again im wandering forgive me where was i the farm workers billy could have gotten a job with any firm in the country but he chose to travel around the state with the farm workers looking for violations living the way they lived he seemed happy then suddenly he showed up at home and announced hed quit gotten a job with the public defenders office but he wasnt happy there either and left soon after after that he started to drift driving around the state in an old car growing his hair long a long beard doing legal work for various free clinics never settling down i knew something was bothering him but he wouldnt tell me what it was he wasnt around long enough to tell me his father was so angry at him he just kept wandering leaving me no phone number no address i knew he was lost but he refused to be found sitting up straighter she twisted the handkerchief then one weekend he showed up at our place in arrowhead we had guests business associates of his father and bill was embarrassed about the way billy looked billy didnt care it was me he wanted to talk to he came to my room late at night brought a candle and lit it he said it was confession time then he told me hed had an affair with a girl in delano one of the migrant girls a young girl underage and she became pregnant or claimed to billy never saw a child because he panicked when she told him being a lawyer her age statutory rape he was also worried some grower would find out and use it against the union instead of shouldering his responsibility he gave the girl every dollar he had with him and left town thats when he joined the public defenders office but it never stopped bothering him and he began driving around california trying to find her he said her name was sharla and that she wasnt sophisticated but she had a good heart he never found her but lets face it mom he told me if id wanted to badly enough i wouldve right im not sure i want to know fathers right i am a coward spineless no use to anyone i told him the fact that he was telling me now showed he was extremely courageous he still had a chance to buck up i promised to do everything i could to help him find the girl make financial arrangements for the child if there was one because i was skeptical thought the girl was out for money that infuriated him he began pounding the bed shouting that i was just like all the others everything was money money money then he blew out the candle and stomped out id never seen him like that and it shocked me i thought i would let him cool down the next morning he was found floating in lake arrowhead they said it was an accident i never looked for the girl i was never sure it was true i did wonder from time to time and then i saw the picture in the paper and i knew and now youve found him detective connor petra took another look at the photo and handed it back too close to be anything but righteous and the time line was right william bradley adamson william bradley straight what is it you want me to do for you mrs adamson detective i know i have no right to maybe legal rights but morally but this child he must be my grandson theres no other rational explanation im sure we can prove it with genetic tests but not now not with all hes been through i want to help him suddenly she looked down at her lap i dont have the resources i used to have my husband ran into some misfortune before he passed away petra found herself giving a sympathetic nod the truth is said cora adamson still averting her eyes ive been living off savings for several years but i know how to budget and im by no means penniless learning about billy this billy has crystallized my plans i live in a grotesquely oversized house that ive been thinking of selling for some time until now i lacked the incentive and the will to make the change now its clear theres no mortgage on the house once i sell it even after taxes i should have enough to support myself and my grandson in a reasonable manner a pleading note had entered the womans voice here she was chanel suit and all applying for parental rights what do you say to that cora adamsons head rose perhaps its all for the best too much privilege can create its own difficulties petra wanted to say i wouldnt know instead she nodded i love children detective connor before i was married i taught school i always wanted lots of children but billys birth was difficult and the doctors forbade it other than the loss of billy and bill and my parents learning i couldnt have more children was the saddest moment of my life a thin white hand clutched her sleeve what im saying is i sincerely believe i have something to offer i make no excuses for the lack of detective connor can you see it within yourself to help me the womans eyes locked onto petra hungry desperate delaware was flying into town tonight why couldnt he be here now please said cora adamson petra said lets talk about it yesterday dr delaware told me about mom my stomach caught fire and i wanted to rip the iv line out and punch him in the face he sat there looking sad what right did he have to be sad i rolled over and ignored him no way would i let him see me cry but the minute he left i started crying and i went on crying all day and all night except when someone came into the room and then i pretended to sleep sometimes when they thought i was sleeping theyd discuss me nurses interns poor kid hes been through so much tough little bugger i am not tough im here because whats my choice thinking about mom made me want to be dead too but then i thought what good would that do there probably is no god so i wouldnt get to see her anyway that first night i dug my nails into my hands made them bleed a little extra pain felt right its the next day and i still cant believe it i keep thinking shes going to walk through the door ill say im sorry for running away shell apologize too well hug then it hits me shes gone thats it never again never this hurts so much i cry a lot fall asleep wake up cry some more havent cried for an hour maybe im all dried up no more tears hey doc put some tears in the iv i spit on the floor if i could empty my mind the way the orderlies empty my trash can out with all the garbage when im alone i think of her even though it hurts i want to hurt being alone is what im used to i dont get enough of it with all the doctors and interns and the nurses sometimes i cant stand all the noise and the sympathy want to punch all of them not sam he comes every morning brings me candy and magazines pats my hand and talks about how were two peas in a pod tough survivors how he wont let anyone mess with me dont worry hes got connections he repeats things and sometimes his voice puts me to sleep i fight to stay awake dont want to make him feel bad he was my friend when no one else was one time he came with mrs kleinman but she annoyed me touching my cheek bringing food i didnt want to eat trying to feed it to me i was polite to her but maybe sam could tell because he never brought her again petra brings me books shes very pretty not married not a mom and i think maybe she likes me because it gives her mom practice or its a vacation from being a detective she killed him shes a serious person doesnt tell jokes doesnt try to cheer me up when i dont want it even when she smiles shes serious even if im totally exhausted i cant be anything but nice to her shes about moms age whyd mom have to take that idiot moron in let him run her life let him put a split in our family why couldnt mom learn to be alone dr delaware said it was probably an accident he pushed her and she fell but that doesnt make her any more alive i keep thinking if id been there i couldve saved her dr delaware talked to me about guilt how it was normal but it would pass how it was the parents job to take care of children not the other way around he said mom did love me she meant well but shed hit some bad luck he also said that what happened to her was terrible no way would he try to tell me everything was okay because it wasnt he was certain though that mom would be proud of how well id done on my own maybe he considers me very impressive at first i thought he was full of it the way hed just sit not saying much at first i thought he didnt care now i think he probably does he shows up every day at pm stays with me for two hours sometimes more doesnt mind if we dont do anything before he left he noticed the chessboard that sam left and asked if i wanted to play hes about as good as sam and i beat him two out of three he said okay next time and i said prepare to lose he laughed and i asked him whos paying him to play games and he said the police dont worry hed collect he always does sometimes he tells jokes some of them are funny the nurses seem to like him i heard one nurse ask another if he was married and the other one said she wasnt sure she didnt think so he and petra would make a good couple i can imagine the two of them in a nice house a good car some kids a dog or even one kid so he could get all their attention nice happy family taking trips going to restaurants maybe it happens i dont know ill never stop thinking about mom the doors opening and for a moment i think its her its petra and shes wearing a red suit thats different she always wears black shes carrying a bag and she gives it to me inside is a book the presidents book not the one from the library a brandnew one clean cover crisp white pages it has that newbook smell the colors in
