edition there is a glossary at the back of this book which explains many of the concepts of quantum mechanics employed in the text the reader may find this helpful and it may be consulted at any point when elucidation seems needed the story herein is set in a variety of parallel universes in which most of the politicians are thieves and most of the theologians are maniacs these universes have nothing in common with our own world of course of course book one the universe next door not until the male become female and the female becomes male shall ye enter the kingdom of heaven jesus in the gospel of thomas part one purity of essence for the cherub cat is a term in the angel tiger christopher smart jubilate agno dont look back history is a nightmare from which none of us can awaken stephen prometheus in carl jungs odysseus the majority of terrans were sixlegged they had territorial squabbles and politics and wars and a caste system they also had sufficient intelligence to survive on that barren boondocks planet for several billions of years we are not concerned here with the majority of terrans we are concerned with a tiny minoritythe domesticated primates who built cities and wrote symphonies and invented things like tictactoe and integral calculus at the time of our story these primates regarded themselves as the terrans the sixlegged majority and other lifeforms on that planet hardly entered into their thinking at all most of the time the domesticated primates of terra referred to the sixlegged majority by an insulting name they called them bugs there was one species on terra that lived in very close symbiosis with the domesticated primates this was a variety of domesticated canines called dogs the dogs had learned to achieve a rough simulation of guilt and remorse and worry and other domesticated primate characteristics the domesticated primates had learned how to achieve simulations of loyalty and dignity and cheerfulness and other canine characteristics the primates claimed that they loved the dogs as much as the dogs loved them still the primates kept the best food for themselves the dogs noticed this you can be sure but they loved the primates so much that they forgave them one dog became famous actually he and she was a group of dogs but they became renowned collectively as pavlovs dog the thing about pavlovs dog is that he or she or they responded mechanically to mechanically administered stimuli pavlovs dog caused some of the domesticated primates especially the scientists to think that all dog behavior was equally mechanical this made them wonder about other mammals including themselves most primates ignored this philosophical challenge they went about their business assuming that they were not mechanical the fact that plutonium was missing originally leaked to the press in the mids at first there was a minor wave of panic among those given to worrying about such matters and there was even some churlish grumbling about a government so incompetent that it couldnt keep track of its own weapons of megadeath but then a year passed and another and soon five years had passed and then nearly a decade and the missing plutonium was still missing but nothing really drastic had happened terran primates being a simpleminded sleepful race simply stopped worrying about the subject the triggering mechanism of the most destructive weapon ever devised on that backward planet was in unknown hands true but that was really not much more unsettling to contemplate than the fact that many of the known hands which had enjoyed access to plutonium belonged to persons who were not in all respects reasonable men see terran archives reagan ronald wilson career of the primate philosophy of that epoch was summed up by one of their popular heroes mr satchel paige in the aphorism dont look backsomething might be gaining on you it was a comfortable philosophy for sleeploving people the use of atomic weapons was widely blamed on a primate named albert einstein even einstein himself had agreed with this opinion he was a pacifist and had suffered abominable pangs of conscience over what had been done with his scientific discoveries i should have been a plumber einstein said just before he died actually the discovery of atomic energy was the result of the work of every scientist craftsman engineer technician philosopher and gadgeteer who had ever lived on terra the use of atomic energy as a weapon was the result of all the political decisions ever made from the time the vertebrates first started competing for territory most terran primates did not understand the multiplex nature of causality they tended to think everything had a single cause this simple philosophic error was so widespread on that planet that the primates were all in the habit of giving themselves and other primates more credit than was deserved when things went well this made them all inordinately conceited they also gave themselves and one another more blame than was deserved when things went badly this gave them all jumbosized guilt complexes it is usually that way on primitive planets before quantum causality is understood quantum causality was not understood on terra until physicists solved the schrodingers cat riddle schrodingers cat never became as famous among the primate masses as pavlovs dog but that was because the cat was harder to understand than the dog pavlovs dog could be understood in simple mechanical metaphors to understand schrodingers cat you needed to first understand the equations of quantum probability waves only a few primates were smart enough to read the equations and even they couldnt understand them that was because the equations seemed to say that the cat was dead and alive at the same time every character in this book looks like pavlovs dog from a certain angle if you look at him or her a different way however youll see schrodingers cat as early as a group of chicago paranoids known as the nihilist anarchist horde nah printed up a singlepage broadside on how to manufacture an atomic weapon they sent this in envelopes with no return address to all the most hostile and embittered individuals and groups in the united states nah regarded this mailing as both a joke and a warning and refused to face the fact that it was also an incitement nah had already put out bumper stickers saying things like register capitalists not guns and honk if youre armed and eat the rich and they even had a rubber stamp which they used to decorate subway advertisements with the nihilistic message arm the unemployed riot in the loop on new years eve but they really outdid themselves with the buildyourown atomic weapon sheet which was titled hobbysheet and looked like this hobbysheet in a series of collect em all a simple atomic bomb for the home craftsman there is nothing complex about an atomic or fission bomb if enough fission material uranium or plutonium is brought together to form a critical mass it will explode the trick is to put the pieces together fast enough to get a decent blast before the bomb blows itself apart this can be done quite simply by means of ordinary explosive as shown below it was later estimated that the nihilist anarchist horde most of whom were living on welfare were able to mail out only of these over the fouryear period before they grew bored with the project nonetheless many of the equally paranoid and hostile persons who received this mailing had access to xerox machines and were as desperate as the members of nah itself it was later determined that by there were over copies of hobbysheet in circulation eventually one of them reached the poe group who were ready for an idea like that the planet as a whole continued to drowse alternative texts that is precisely what common sense is for to be jarred into uncommon sense eric temple bell mathematics queen of the sciences galactic archives the original title of the greater part of what we have collected in this book under the title schrodingers cat was the universe next door the book of that name was begun as a sequel to llluminatus but after several editors in a row suffered psychotic breakdowns while reading it publishers defensively ordered that any ms with that title from robert anton wilson should be returned unopened people generally do not want a new form of prose fiction to replace the hackneyed novel wilson wrote in a letter to his friend malaclypse the younger there never has been a serious attempt since odysseus schrodingers cat fair copy according to wilson scholars incorporates later and still more bizarre material the text of which was allegedly dictated to wilson by a canine intelligencevast cool and unsympathetic from the system of the dog star sirius schrodingers cat fair copy appeared much later in under mysterious circumstances some claimed at the time that it had been received by a trance medium to whom wilson had broadcast it after his melodramatic departure from this world in skeptics have always insisted that the alleged medium actually found it in an old tampon box in her attic a legend about the manuscript being recovered from the masonic auditorium in san francisco after the earthquake of and passed around among adepts of certain occult groups is probably mythical various alternative texts generally considered forgeries have circulated at intervals and many wilson scholars debate heatedly whether this final ms is in fact totally or even in major part wilsons work that two authors at least are here represented often at crosspurposes with each other is the emerging academic consensus at this time the present edition incorporates all material that is undoubtedly wilsons together with matter of such a wilsonian and weird character that the present editor regards it as probablywilsonswithinreasonabledoubt it only remains to affirm that schrodingers cat contrary to appearances is not a mere routine or shaggy shoggoth story despite his sinister reputation and his wellknown eccentricities wilson was one of the last of the scientific shamans of the primitive terrestrial phase of the cruel magnificent unistat empire this may be hard to understand when many establishment scholars still deny that anything like scientific shamanism existed in the twentieth century but it is nevertheless well documented that wilson leary lilly crowley castaneda and many others pursued rigorous studies in scientific shamanic research even under the persecution of the neurological police so characteristic of that barbaric epoch some have even proposed that schrodingers cat is actually a manual of shamanism in the form of a novel but that opinion is almost certainly exaggerated see the editors clandestine neurotransmitter research under the holy inquisition and the dea archives of general archaeology vol no one month to go immature humorists borrow mature humorists steal mark twain on december benny eggs benedict a popular columnist for the new york newstimespost sat down to compose his daily essay according to his usual procedure he breathed deeply relaxed every muscle and gradually forced all verbalization in his brain to stop when he had reached the void he waited to see what would float up to fill the vacuum what surfaced was one month to go to benny looked at the calendar what happened next would be portrayed by a cartoonist as a light bulb flashing on over his head he began pounding the typewriter comparing the actual situation of the world with orwells fantasy galactic archives new york was an independent citystate in the northwest of unistat it was noted for its malodorous stockyards its vast motionpicture industry and a huge phallic monument dedicated to washington a fertility god who allegedly slept in nearly every part of the unistat usually with human women bringing forth such semidivine progeny as the gigantic paul bunyan the patriotic general motors the trickstergod nixon and the benign mickey mouse who began as a totem of the city of disneyland and eventually became the principal divinity of all unistat his column headed one month to go was read by nearly people the newstimespost being the only surviving daily paper available to the citizens of the six boroughs of new york city nine million of the readers were a little bit paranoid this being the natural ecological result of crowding that many primates into such a congested space and most of them agreed with the most pessimistic portions of benedicts estimation of orwells accuracy as a prophet one month to go to became a catchphrase to conclude or answer anybodys complaint about anything one month to go to soon you heard it everywhere it reached chicago by december san francisco by december was even quoted in bad ass texas on december by december the london economist printed a very scholarly article on world history from when orwells book was published to the present enumerating dozens of parallels between orwells fiction and the planets nightmare in paris a prominent existentialist in an interview with paris soir argued that living inside a book even a book by an english masochist like orwell was better than living in reality art has meaning but reality has none he said cheerfully the sixlegged majority on terra were never consulted when the domesticated primates set about building weapons that could destroy all lifeforms on that planet this was not unusual the fish the birds the reptiles the flowers the trees and even the other mammals werent allowed to vote on this issue even the wild primates werent involved in the decision to produce such weapons in fact the majority of domesticated primates themselves never had a say in the matter a handful of alpha males among the leading predator bands among the domesticated primates had made the decision on their own everybody else on the planetincluding the sixlegged majority who had never been involved in primate politicsjust had to face the consequences most of the domesticated primates of terra did not know they were primates they thought they were something apart from and superior to the rest of the planet even benny benedicts one month to go column was based on that illusion benny had actually read darwin once in college a long time ago and had heard of sciences like ethology and ecology but the facts of evolution had never really registered on him he never thought of himself as a primate he never realized his friends and associates were primates above all he never understood that the alpha males of unistat were typical leaders of primate bands as a result of this inability to see the obvious benny was constantly alarmed and terrified by the behavior of himself his friends and associates and especially the alpha males of the pack since he didnt know it was ordinary primate behavior it seemed just awful to him since a great deal of primate behavior was considered just awful most of the domesticated primates spent most of their time trying to conceal what they were doing some of the primates got caught by other primates all of the primates lived in dread of getting caught those who got caught were called nogood shits the term nogood shit was a deep expression of primate psychology for instance one wild primate a chimpanzee taught sign language by two domesticated primates scientists spontaneously put together the signs for shit and scientist to describe a scientist she didnt like she was calling him shitscientist she also put together the signs for shit and chimpanzee for another chimpanzee she didnt like she was calling him shitchimpanzee you nogood shit domesticate primates often said to each other this metaphor was deep in primate psychology because primates mark their territories with excretions and sometimes they threw excretions at each other when disputing over territories one primate wrote a long book describing in vivid detail how his political enemies should be punished he imagined them in an enormous hole in the ground with flames and smoke and rivers of shit this primate was named dante alighieri another primate wrote that every primate infant goes through a stage of being chiefly concerned with biosurvival ie food ie mommies titty he called this the oral stage he said the infant next went on to a stage of learning mammalian politics ie recognizing the father alpha male and his authority and territorial demands he called this with an insight that few primates shared the anal stage this primate was named freud he had taken his own nervous system apart and examined his component circuits by periodically altering its structure with neurochemicals among the anal insults exchanged by domesticated primates when fighting for their space were up your ass go shit in your hat youre full of shit take it and stick it where the moon doesnt shine and many others one of the most admired alpha males in the kingdom of the franks was general canbronne general canbronne won this adulation for the answer he once gave when asked to surrender at waterloo merde was the answer general canbronne gave when primates went to war or got violent in other ways they always said they were about to knock the shit out of the enemy they also spoke of dumping on each other the primates who had mined unistat with nuclear bombs intended to dump on the other primates real hard benny benedicts entire philosophy of life had been shaped by an obscene novel a murder and a boston cream pie the novel was called odysseus and the most shocking thing about it aside from the searing indecency of its language was that it had been written by a famous theologian rev carl gustav jung of zurich switzerland nobody had known what to make of the book when it was first published except to fulminate against it the story in fourteen chapters recounted fourteen hours in a very ordinary day as some staggeringly ordinary characters wandered about zurich on extraordinarily ordinary business when jung revealed that the fourteen chapters corresponded to the fourteen stations of the cross conservative critics added blasphemy to their charges against him latermuch lateracademic exegetes adopted odysseus as the very model of a modern novel and wrote endless studies proving that it was an allegory on everything from the evolution of consciousness to the rise and fall of civilizations benny couldnt understand much of what these academic critics wrote but he knew that odysseus was to him the only book that really succeeded in making the daily seem profound that was enough of an achievement to convince him that jung was a genius it also encouraged him to look at everything that happened as being marvelous in one way or another if jungs characters or some of them happened to defecate urinate masturbate and fornicate during the fourteen hours that was not because the theologian was trying to write pornography but because the miracle of daily life could not be shown without all of its daily details benny didnt give a flying philadelphia fuck about the novels parallels with the odyssey and the stations of the cross which jung admitted or the other correspondences with body organs colors tarot cards iching hexagrams and the romantic triangle in krazy kat which his admirers claimed to have found the important thing about odysseus was that it demonstrated almost scientifically that no day was a dull day jung who regarded himself as a better psychologist than the psychologiststhis was a conceit typical of theologiansclaimed to have found three more circuits in the nervous system beyond freuds oral biosurvival circuit and anal emotionalterritorial circuit jung said that odysseus demonstrated also a semantichominid circuit which created a veil of words between domesticated primates and their experience thereby differentiating them from the wild primates he also claimed a specific sociosexual circuit created by the process of domestication and he added a fifth neurosomatic circuit typical of mysticism and music which causes primates to feel high and spacedout but benny didnt care about all that odysseus in his mind was simply the book that described life the way it really is without sentiment and emotions the murder changed all that it showed benny that every day is also a terrible day for somebody on july bennys mother a whitehaired old lady of eightyfour left the brooklyn senior citizens home where she lived to walk one block to the supermarket on the way she had her purse snatched and according to witnesses struggled with the thief she was stabbed seventeen times with a boy scout knife when benny arrived at the hospital emergency room she was already dead but he got a looka long lookat her crimson mutilated body before the doctor on duty hustled him out into the hall and shot him full of tranquilizers benny was crippled psychologically in a way that he could not perfectly understand after all having reached the fifth decade of his life he was well acquainted with grief in the past ten years he had experienced the deaths of his father his older brother and three close friends but murder is not just another form of grief it is a metaphysical message like fate knocking on the door at the beginning of beethovens fifth benny found that the whole world had turned to very fragile glass every police siren every newscast every angry voice on the street reminded him that he belonged to a dangerously violent species benny benedict realized that each minute somewhere in the world somebody was being bashed beaten stabbed shot slashed gassed poisoned robbed of life he could not bear to be alone at night anymore the grinning sadist began to haunt him this horrifying image had been imprinted upon his neurons by various movies and tv melodramas of the sixties and seventies the grinning sadist invaded your home sometimes alone and sometimes with a horde of equally moronic and vicious cohorts you were particularly susceptible if you were blind or a woman or all alone at night but sometimesas in the dangerous hourshe would come with his brutal crew in the bright daytime his business was never simply burglary although that was part of it his real interest was in humiliation terror degradation torture of the body and spirit and he always grinned bennys doctor prescribed valium mg before bedtime it helped benny sleep but when he was awake every noise still sounded like the grinning sadist furtively trying the door benny bought a police lock every noise now sounded like the grinning sadist trying to force a window then one day looking through the old files in the newspaper morgue benny found an interview with senator charles percy given in two years after the murder of his daughter for the first year after the murder senator percy said my whole family lived in terror benny felt a sudden sense of relief this must be normal he thought it happens to everybody whos had a murder close to them and it lasts only a year but as july approached benny was not emerging from the terror it was growing worse well he had been reading up on grief and bereavement and he knew the first anniversary is always a terrible time he found the knowledge helpful it gave him a small purchase on detachment also without his doctors consultation he had raised his valium dosage at bedtime from mg to mg and sometimes then on july itselfthe anniversary of the murder the grinning sadist appeared benny had been invited to give a talk at the press club on lousewart and lowered expectations the luncheon was excellent but benny ate little knowing that a belch in the middle of the speech could destroy all communication for several minutes after when fred figs newton began to introduce him new yorks most beloved daily columnist an institution for over thirty years benny felt the usual twinges of stage fright began rehearsing again his first three jokes gave up on that and concentrated instead on his mantra om mani padme hum om mani padme hum and was finally in the ideal state of mixed apprehension and urgency out of which the most relaxedsounding public speeches always come as the applause died down he rose to speak and he saw the grinning sadist coming right at him he saw the deranged eyes the cruel mouth the deliberately ugly clothing like a very poor cowboy or a s college student and the knife in the maniacs hand om mani padme hum and then he got the boston cream pie right in the face it hadnt been a knife at all he had imagined a knife when the pie plate was turned and raised as it was thrown benny stood there very conscious that he was overweight and past fifty boston cream pie dripping from his face trying to remind himself that heart palpitations were not a symptom of heart attack aware suddenly that the daily life of humankind was not only marvelous as jung had taught him and terrible as the murder had taught him but totally absurd as well as the existentialists might have taught him galactic archives pie throwing was common in unistat at the time of this romance it derived of course from the territorial feceshurling rituals of other primates see expressions of violence in wild and domesticated primates encyclopedia of primate psychology sirius press domesticated primates defend ideological territories mental constructs as well as the physical turf pie throwers were expressing mammalian territorial rage in a traditional primate manner by throwing guck in the faces of those who threatened their ideological space aufgehoben new planets discovered news headline the only one in new york who didnt react emotionally to benny benedicts one month to go column was justin case an embittered fortyish man who wrote beautifully meaningless film criticism case had not liked the film of and never read books which he regarded as too oldfashioned to be worthy of serious attention books were invented by gutenberg in the fifteenth century and are like all other inventions five centuries old hopelessly archaic case often said he also liked to categorize books as linear aristotelian and when he was especially rhetorical paleolithic he justified this last adjective on the grounds that books consisted of words an old stone age invention case had a phd from yale and a dd dishonorable discharge from the us army he had earned the former for a thesis on metaphor and myth in the films of the three stooges and the latter for trying to organize a mutiny during the vietnam war his film criticism appeared in a journal called confrontation his essays usually began with the same three words as his phd thesiseg metaphor and myth in hitchcocks steps metaphor and myth in beach blanket bingothat sort of thing there was not much of an audience for such writing and justin barely made a living his dream was to become an editor at pussycat magazine where the big money was the fbi had been tapping his phone ever since vietnam and had reels and reels of his conversation which concerned almost nothing but films nevertheless they kept listening hoping something incriminating would slip eventually a man with both a phd and a dd was obviously worth attention even if most of what he said was totally incomprehensible to them special agent tobias knight playing cases tapes one evening actually heard a long rap about curly being the id or first circuit larry the ego or second circuit and moe the superego or jungs fourth circuit things got even more confusing when case went on to talk about the cinematic continuity in the sm dimension between moe and polanski it got even weirder when case said polanski himself went to chinatown three timeswhen his parents were murdered by the nazis when his wife was murdered by the manson family and when he got convicted of statutory rape we all go to chinatown one way or another sooner or later still the bureau did not give up case was sure to say something incriminating or at least intelligible to them sooner or later tobias knight had listened to hours of private conversations since joining the fbi among other things this had clearly shown him that all the standard primate sexual behaviors were prevalent throughout unistat since knight like benny benedict and most other twolegged terrans did not know he belonged to a mammal species this primate behavior was profoundly shocking to him he felt much like a methodist who runs a drugstore in little rockanguished that the sins of his fellows were exceeded only by their hypocrisy this made him cynical the same cynicism was widespread in the bureau older hands who had listened to or even hours of private conversations were beyond cynicism they had become paranoid about their fellow primates tobias knight himself would be classified as a nogood shit by most of the primates if they knew what he was up to he was the first pentuple agent in the history of espionagethat is he had connections with four other intelligence agencies besides the fbi and was doublecrossing all of them he also had a walrus mustache and a jovial eye he could have been an excellent character actor in movies or tv everybody liked him and trusted him on sight that was why he was so successful in the cloakanddagger business justin case suspected that the fbi was tapping his phone however out of primates in new york also suspected the fbi of tapping their phones case just happened to be one of the who were correct in this suspicion case was certainly not a mutineer by temperament his visual cortexthe most energized part of himwas neurogenetically imprinted with a dry detached analytical almost passive temperament his world was made up of forms in space edited into amusing montages by the passing of time if he ever read books he might have found that einsteins relativity was the mathematical analog of his own mind even paintings barely won his tolerance only film and tv basically montage turned him on he was inclined to feel that anything which did not flicker shimmer and change rapidly was probably dead and should be decently and quickly buried in short he was an electronic taoist the vietnam war had been punishing in various ways to all unistaters but case embroiled in the center of it experienced it as very bad tv it was like the film had stuck and moe kept jabbing his finger in curlys eye over and over in an infinite regress until the myth and metaphor had both turned meaningless through redundance if the war wasnt that it was sloppy editing or just plain bad taste the mutiny was the only equivalent he could find to the simple act of turning the dial to another channel he had tried to explain this to the lieutenant appointed to defend him at the courtmartial a sly catfaced young man named lionel eacher lieutenant eacher before entering the service had been an expert at contract law the rules by which the primates determined and marked their territories remember other mammals do this by leaving excretions which geometrically define the size and shape of the claimed turf but domesticated primates do it by excreting ink on paper eacher was a lawyer an expert at proving either that the ink excretions meant what they said if he were being paid to prove that or that the ink excretions didnt exactly mean what they said if he were being paid to prove that lionel eacher listened to cases story with growing incredulity at the end of the narrative he frowned very thoughtfully and said would you just run that by me again so case had explained this time in more detail the aesthetics of proper utilization of sadomasochist material in the total structure of significant form i see eacher said thoughtfully i think weve got a winner he relaxed and lit a cigarette the usual defense is that you were reading the bible and saw a white light and jesus told you to give up war but this well this is beautiful you sound like a real fruitcake i might even get you a medical discharge case realized that he was talking to a barbarian but that was normal in the military he had an intuitive sense that twenty years in the joint which was what the judge adjutant generals office was asking would be even more redundant in the sm dimension than the war itself very well if a man of esthetic sensibility seemed like a fruitcake to these primitives so be it he wanted to go home case explained his position to the courtmartial with great eloquence part of what he said he even used later in a critique of the rocky horror show and they did indeed decide he was a fruitcake they gave him a dd but two members of the board he learned later had argued vigorously for a medical the vietnam war like most primate squabbles was about territory chinese primates unistat primates the primates of the bear totem from the steppes and various local southeast asian primates were trying to expand their collectivetotem egos territories by taking over the turf in southeast asia if they had been wild primates they would have all excreted in the disputed area and maybe thrown excretions at each other being domesticated primates they made ink excretions on paper and threw metal and chemicals at each other it was one of a series of rumbles over southeast asia which had at one time or another involved dutch primates french primates primates of the rising sun totem and various other predator bands since the unistat primates like other domesticated hominids did not know they were primates all this was explained by a ferocious amount of ink excretions invoking morality and ideology the twin gods of domesticated primatedom basically the primates who wanted to claim southeast asia said it was good to go in shooting and grab whatever was grabable the primates who didnt give a fuck about southeast asia said it was evil justin case was not verbally oriented he thought in pictures as a good film critic should he never asked whether the war was good or evil it was unaesthetic the people who had mined unistat with nuclear bombs had not regarded the vietnam war as unaesthetic they thought it was downright evil they thought just about everything the unistat alpha malesin corporations and governmentsdid was evil they thought most of their fellow primates were nogood shits justin case had been born blissfully by a joyous mother schooled in the grantly dickread method of natural childbirth by the time justin was thirtysix years old in the dickread method was as obsolete as the horse and buggy things were moving fast on terra in that age nonetheless the dickread natural childbirth yoga was good for its time and case had a permanent security imprint on the oral biosurvival circuitry of his brain that was one reason he never worried about ethical issues when justin began to crawl about the house and then rose up to walk up and down in it his father a former alpha male with a large corporation now on the skids due to booze found him a pest and a nuisance father disappeared rapidly pursued by lawsuits and child maintenance liens which harassed him so much that he drank even more earned less and was first chronically and then permanently incapable of paying a blessed penny to justin and justins mommy justin was not genetically programmed to be an alpha male but under the circumstances he learned to do a good imitation of one mommys great big man mommy called him the analterritorial old primate section of justins brain took an imprint of pretendauthority then justin discovered the semantic environment he learned to read and watch tv the books seemed clumsy and sententious compared to the immediacy of the tube he took a visualelectronic imprint on the semantic circuit like most of his generation cases sociosexual circuit was imprinted by playboy sexual revolution weed rock yippies protest the generation gap womens lib and general confusion he was a bachelor who had heterosexual couplings as often as he felt the need with the minimum possible human involvement if youre interested in superficialities he looked like a gay intellectual or a college professor or a little bit of both he already had a bald spot he dressed in conservative good taste and every four years he went to a polling booth and carefully printed with a heavy felttip pen none of the above this was his one flicker of social consciousness case had one weird experience in his whole life it happened in when he went to see the famous mentalist psychic escape artist and comedian cagliostro the great at a nightclub called von neumanns catastrophe cagliostro began his act with a few traditional tricks being locked in one box and then reappearing out of another at the opposite side of the room that kind of routine this was followed by one of his bitingly sarcastic monologues about the tricksters in other professions such as the clergy and the government this was all as case had expected from the most controversial magician in show biz history then came the psychic stunts which were sometimes frighteningly impressive bw cagliostro called out will you please stand up case saw the unbearable bore blake williams standing at a ringside table bw cagliostro repeated you will never finish your twelvevolume study of quantum psychology not ever in this universe the twitches in your leg from the polio can be cured by valerian root tea the incident at the vandivoort street incinerator is still haunting you your investments are all wrongtheres no future in space industry and as for project pan doctorproject pan naughty naughty naughty case could see that williams had turned pale jc cagliostro called out suddenly dont stand this is private justin case squirmed halfafraid halfskeptical totally vulnerable jc cagliostro repeated you have created this movie that you call reality stay out of chinatown sm the magician went on sm about the beast now thats in your future poe quoth the raven nevermore poe in july immediately after the democratic convention held behind barbed wire to prevent the people from interfering in their own affairs a letter appeared in the seed a chicago radical newspaper the letter said brothers and sisters the final struggle is upon us the big racistimperialist forces that control amerika have taken off their fake liberal mask and shown their true fascist nature look at the record the assassinations of john and bobby and martin luther king the unending war against the people of vietnam the brutalities of the local police right on television with the whole world watching during the recent demokratic convention is it not obvious that the multinational corporations no longer even care to pretend that democracy still exists and are ready to kill us to the last man and woman if we continue to resist weather underground has chosen the wrong path romantically allowing themselves to be known and defying the authorities to catch them we of poe have organized quietly our numbers are not for publication nor our identities we will not take credit for our actions unlike the weather romantics we will not recruit new members we will send no further communiques to the press we will work and study to strike the most crippling blows possible against the fascist monster if you agree with us do not seek to find us and join us do as we have done peace on earth john brown some readers of the seed thought this was a puton others claimed it was the work of an fbi agent provocateur a few wondered if poe actually existed and what it would do everybody of course assumed that the initials poe stood for the slogan in the last line of the letterpeace on earth they were wrong poe stood for purity of essence the group had deliberately taken as their model general jack d ripper in the film dr strangelove who launches a nuclear war to protect the purity of essence of our precious bodily fluids against fluorides poe honestly felt that sanity had failed to save the world and that only insanity remained as a viable alternative nor were they alone in this attitude the same year poe was formed the american people elected richard milhous nixon to the white house guided by a similar gutlevel feeling that somebody like jack d ripper was needed to confront the growing chaos of the planet with some strong counterchaos the real name of the founder of poe was not john brown of course that was a pseudonym the original john brown had been a fervent idealist which was why poe admired him they were all fervent idealists too john brown motivated by idealism had set out to abolish slavery in unistat in the nineteenth century on one of his first raids he murdered a whole family of slave owners an associate who was less idealistic had suggested sparing the children but john brown refused nits grow up to be lice he said idealists were like that you were much safer falling into the hands of the cynics the cynics regarded everybody as equally corrupt that was the attitude for instance of tobias knight and the other old hands at the fbi the idealists regarded everybody as equally corrupt except themselves galactic archives at the time of this story the unistat government had atomic bombs for every man woman and child on the planet since a person can die only once historians have been at a loss to explain what the unistaters expected to do with the surplus bombs for each human being galactical primatologists inform us that similar irrational behavior has been observed among domesticated apes on several thousand planets the sixlegged majority on terra had never developed idealism or cynicism nor had they ever thought of sin or corruption they had a simple pragmatic outlook people could be recognized because they all had six legs good people smelled right and were part of the same hive or colony bad people smelled wrong and were not part of the hive they should be eaten at once or driven off twolegged and fourlegged critters werent people at all and to hell with them the fourlegged residents of terra were for the most part equally simpleminded people had four legs sixlegged critters were food or else they were not worth noticing twolegged critters were dangerous and should be avoided only the dogs among all the fourlegged terrans recognized the twolegged primates as being people some of the primates also recognized the dogs as being people onetenth of one percent of the domesticated primates recognized all the lifeforms on their planet as people the onetenth of one percent of the primates who recognized nonprimates as people were in violent disagreement with each other about everything else about onethird of them were mystics and suffered from permanent brain damage brought on by fasting yoga or other masochistic practices they had attained understanding of the intelligence of all living beings through an ecstaticagonizing experience of ego loss brought on by their masochistic excesses they went around talking about this genetic intelligence and calling it god and telling everybody it was too smart to make mistakes and incidentally talking a lot of nonsense also brought on by their excesses another third of the primates who recognized consciousness wherever it existed were specially trained scientists in fields like ethology ecology biophysics and neurologic they all talked in specialized jargons and hardly anybody could understand them most of them couldnt even understand one another the last third of the primates who had a sense of the genetic program behind evolution were folk who had eaten some strange chemicals or vegetables they were like the blind denebian shell cats who suddenly encounter water for the first time by falling into an ocean they knew something was happening to them but they werent sure what it was poe theoretically had no leader it was an anarchomarxist collective the real leader was of course an alpha male his name was franklin delano roosevelt stuart and he was one of the smartest men in unistat at that time unfortunately his reptile biosurvival circuit was imprinted with chronic anxiety his mammalian emotionalterritorial circuit was imprinted with defensive aggression his hominid semantic circuit was imprinted with an explosive blend of black street cynicism and new left ideology and his domesticated sociosexual circuit was from kinksville fdr stuart claimed that the purpose of poe was to accelerate the dialectical process of evolution toward the classless society where all would live in peace prosperity and socialist solidarity and there would be no cops the real purpose of stuarts activities was to get even the other primates in unistat had raped his mother and jailed his father and driven his brothers and sisters into street crime and junk and generally maltreated him all his life in addition they called him by an insulting name which was nigger second in command in poe was sylvia goldfarb a refugee from god s lightning now the radical lesbians and weather underground she was even smarter than f dr stuart but she deferred to him despite her feminist orientation because he was a true alpha male who was a mean motherfucker when crossed and had even more rage in him than she did to sylvia the purpose of poe she said was to create a world where all men and women all races and all classes all humanity lived in loving harmony and ate uncooked fruits and vegetables her real motive was also to get even the other primates discriminated against her for being female for being jewish for being highly verbal and a teachers pet for wearing glasses for being an atheist and for several dozen other reasons at least they also called her by an insulting name which was dyke the third founding member was mountbatten babbit who was a cyclical schizophrenic he wigged out once a year on the average and had learned how to medicate himself with phenothyazines to keep those periods of bizarresville down to a few weeks each but during those dilations of ego he was likely to be anybody from napoleon to a vietnamese buddhist the rest of the year he was a brilliant research chemist and computer expert but it was hard for him to get a good job because of his several incarcerations in mental hospitals babbit said he was in poe to create a rational world guided by sound scientific and libertariansocialist principles yeah he wanted to get even too the other primates called him a nut or a fruitcake the other members of poe were equally brilliant and equally desperate the hidden variable markoff chancy was a prime candidate for poe but due to quantum wave probabilities his orbit never intersected theirs chancy detested the majority of primates because they called him shorty or even more insulting names mr chancy you see was a midget but he was no relative of the famous chaneys of hollywood people did keep making jokes about that it was bad enough to be by the standards of the gigantic and stupid majority a freak how much worse to be so named as to remind those big oversized clods of cinemas two most famous portrayers of monstrofreaks by the time the midget was fifteen he had built up a detestation for ordinary mankind that dwarfed he hated that word the relative misanthropies of paul of tarsus clement of alexandria swift of dublin or anybody in poe revenge for sure he would have he would have revenge it was in college ucberkeley that markoff chaney discovered another hidden joke in his name it was in a math class and since this was berkeley the two students directly behind the midget were ignoring the professor and discussing their own intellectual interests which were of course five years ahead of intellectual fads elsewhere so we keep the same instincts as our primate and preprimate ancestors one student was saying he was from chicago his name was mounty babbit and he was crazy even for berkeley but we superimpose culture and law on top of this so we get split in two dig you might saybabbits voice betrayed pride in the aphorism he was about to unleashmankind is the statutory ape and the professor percy prime time said at just that moment when such a related series appeared in a random process we have what is known as a markoff chain i hope mr chaney wont be tormented by jokes about this for the rest of the semester even if the related series of his appearances in class does seem part of a notably random process the class roared another tone of bile was entered on the midgets shit ledger the list of people who were going to eat turd before he died in fact his cuts were numerous both in math and in other classes there were times when he could not bear to be with the giants but hid in his room pussycat centerfold open masturbating and dreaming of millions and millions of nubile young women all built like pussyettes all throwing themselves passionately upon him today however pussycat would avail him not he needed something raunchier ignoring his next class he hurried across bancroft way and slammed into his room chainbolting the door behind him damn prime time and damn the science of mathematics itself the line the square the average the measurable world that pronounced him subnormal once and for all beyond fantasy in the depth of his soul he declared war on the statutory ape on law and order on predictability he would be the random factor in every equation from this day forward unto death it would be civil war the midget versus the digits he took out his pornographic tarot deck which he used when he wanted a really farout fantasy for his orgasm and shuffled it thoroughly lets have a markoff chain orgasm just to start with he thought savagely his first overt acthis fort sumter as it werebegan in san francisco the following saturday he was in nortons emporium a glorified fiveanddime store when he saw the sign no salesperson may leave the floor without the authorization of a superior the mgt what he thought are the poor girls supposed to pee in their panties if they cant find the superior years of school came back to him please sir may i leave the room sir hah not for nothing had he spent a semester in professor sheets kellys intensive course on textual analysis of modern poetry the following wednesday the midget was back at nortons and hiding in a coffee urn when the staff left and locked up a few moments later the sign was down and an improved version hung in its place no salesperson may leave the floor or look out the door without the authorization of a superior the mgt markoff chaney launched what he considered a reign of terror against the oversized idiots of the statistical majority an electronics whiz since his first junior edison set he found it easy to reverse relays in street intersections so that the walk sign flashed on red and the dont walk signs on green this proved to be bereft of amusement except in small towns denizens of new york chicago and similar elephantine burgs accustomed to nothing working properly ignored the signs anyway the midget branched out and soon incomprehensible memos signed the mgt were raining upon employees everywhere his father crusty old indole chaney had been a stockholder in blue sky inc a very dubious corporation manufacturing devices for use in low gravity when john f kennedy announced that the us would place a man on the moon before blue sky suddenly began to haul in the long green markoff inherited a fund that delivered per month for his purposes it was enough living in spartan fashion constantly crisscrossing the country by greyhound he soon knew every graffito in every white tower mens room by heart dining often on a tin of sardines and a container of milk markoff left a train of anarchy in his wake employees may not exchange vacation days the mgt employees may not punch other employees time cards any deviation will result in termination the mgt fill out in triplicate keep one copy mail one copy to the office and send the third to the transylvania consulate the mgt this was used at a blood bank of course on january the midget was in chicago hiding in a coffee urn in the tenthfloor editorial offices of pussycat magazine he had a vacation schedule form with him to be run off on xerox and distributed to each editors desk this form was his masterpiece it was sure to provoke a nervous breakdown in anyone who tried to decipher and comply with all its directions yet it was not much different on the surface from the hundreds of similar forms handed out in offices daily chaney was quite happy and quite impatient for the staff to leave so he could set about his cheerful task for the night two editors passed the coffee urn talking whos the pussycat interview for next month one asked dr dashwood you know from orgasm research oh the midget had heard of orgasm research and it was of course on his shit list more statistics and averages more of the modern search for the norm that he could never be and now the bastard who headed it dr dashwood would be interviewed by pussycatand probably would get to fuck all the gorgeous pussyettes at the local pussycat club chaney fumed orgasm research moved from the middle of his shit list to the top replacing his archenemy bell telephone the thought of dr dashwood remained with him all night as he ground out his surrealist vacation memo on the office xerox he was still fuming when he returned to his pantrysized room at the ymca and slipped the bolt to keep out the wandering and prehensile deviates who infest ymcas everywhere dr francis dashwood supervisor of orgasms and now ready to dive headfirst into a barrel of pussyettes the midget suffered at the thought but it was nearly am and he was tired tomorrow morning would be time to do something about orgasm research chaney dreamed of dashwood measuring orgasms with an ndimensional ruler in frankensteins laboratory while men in trench coats went slinking about in the shadows asking unintelligible questions about missing gorillas in the morning he shuffled through his bogus letterhead file looking for something appropriate for correspondence with orgasm research thuggee society division of hash import and afrogenealogy said the handsomest letterhead this was illustrated with a threeheaded kali but that one he reserved for correspondence with prominent white racists informing them that the afrogenealogy division alex haley researcherinchief had discovered that their greatgreatgrandmother was black chaney always invited the recipients to come to the next thuggee meeting and bring their wives and sisters friends of the vanishing malaria mosquito committee to ban ddt was a good one but not good enough for dr dashwood chaney reserved it for correspondence with president lousewart finally the midget selected christians and atheists united against creeping agnosticism a nonprophet organization reverend billy graham president madalyn murray ohair chairperson of the board in a few moments chaney produced a letter calculated to short a few circuits in dr dashwoods computeroid cortex dear dr dashwood when you are up to your ass in alligators its hard to remember that you started out to drain the swamp cordially ezra pound council of armed rabbis ps entropy requires no maintenance that should make the bastard wonder a bit he thought with satisfaction stuffing the enigmatic epistle in an envelope and addressing it markoff chaney loathed math because it contained the concept of the average chaney not only loathed but hated despised abominated detested and couldnt stand the thought of dr dashwood not just because dashwoods work involved statistics and averages but because is was concerned with orgasms that was a tender subject to chaney he was a virgin he was never attracted to women of his own stature that was almost incestuous and besides they simply did not turn him on he adored the giantesses of the hateful oversized majority he adored them lusted after them and was also terrified of them he knew from sad experience oftrepeated that they regarded him as cute and even cuddly and one of them had gone so far as to say adorable but absolutely ridiculous as a sex partner damn and blast them all to hell he had tried building his courage with booze they thought he was disgusting and chauvinistic and not even cute anymore he tried weed they thought he was cute again and even hilarious but even more absurd as a possible lover he tried est the trainers spent the first day tearing him downtelling him he was a nogood shit and everybody knew he was a nogood shit and things like that which he had always suspected the second day they built him up and convinced him he could control his space as well as any other mammal he was flying when he came out he went at once to a singles bar and sidled up to the most attractive blonde in the place hi he said boldly swaggering a bit what would you say to a friendly little fuck she gazed down at him from what suddenly seemed an enormous height hello friendly little fuck she drawled with magnificent boredom when chaney slunk back to his ymca room and his pornographic tarot he vowed more vehemently than ever that he would be the meanest fuck on the planet nobody would ever call him a friendly little fuck again he still adored the giantesses and feared them but now he hated them too in short he was really stuck on them their cuntsthose hairy moist hot adorable inaccessible rejecting terrible divine frightening schwartzchild radiuses of the dimension of manhoodwere the holy grail to him he knew their cunts were hairy and hot and moist etc despite his virginity because he had read a lot of pornographic novels galactic archives pornographic novels were novels about the things primates enjoy most namely sexual acrobatics they were taught to feel ashamed of these natural primate impulses so that they would be guiltyfurtivesubmissive types and easy for the alpha males to manipulate those caught reading such novels were called nogood shits of course pep muss es sein es muss sein ludwig van beethoven pepthe peoples ecology partyhad been founded by furbish lousewart v following the success of his monumental bestseller unsafe wherever you go lousewart v was a man born into the right time his book perfectly reflected all the foreboding of the late s its thesis was simply that everything science does is wrong that scientists are very nasty people and that we need to go back to a simpler more natural way of life the message was perfect for the time it was simply hitlers national socialism redone with only a few minor changes where hitler wrote jew for instance lousewart wrote scientist nobody but the most backward denizens of bad ass texas or chicago illinois was capable of really getting riled up by the antisemitic ploy anymore and lousewart had with intuitive brilliance picked the one scapegoat capable of mobilizing real fear rage and hatred among the general population and hitlers wagnerian primitivism was altogether too teutonic for young america in the s so lousewart replaced it with a chic blend of taoist and amerindian primitivism it didnt matter that scholars pointed out that all of lousewarts arguments were illogical and incoherent his followers despised logic and coherence on principle and it didnt even matter that he had brazenly lifted most of his notions right out of roszaks where the wasteland ends and von danikens gold of the gods it was a package that had a builtin market with the collapse of the republican party after nixon and ford there was a void in national politics somebody had to organize a force to challenge the democrats and the peoples ecology party moved quickly to capture the turf furbish lousewart was an expert in morality and ideology he understood that seeking out and denouncing nogood shits was the path by which one could become leader of a movement of the anxious and angry in short he had the instincts of a politician the lousewart philosophy of asceticism medievalism and despair was officially called the revolution of lowered expectations the revolution of lowered expectations had not been invented by furbish lousewart the whole neurosociology of the twentieth century could be understood as a function of two variablesthe upwardrising curve of the revolution of rising expectations and the downwardplunging trajectory of the revolution of lowered expectations the revolution of rising expectations which had drawn more and more people into its upthrust during the first half of the century had led many to believe that poverty and starvation and disease were all gradually being phased out by advances in pure and applied science growing stockpiles of surplus food in the advanced nations accelerated medical progress the spread of literacy and electronics and the mounting sense that people had a right to demand a decent life for themselves and their children the revolution of lowered expectations was based on the idea that there wasnt enough energy to provide for the rising expectations of the masses year after year the message was broadcast there isnt enough the masses were taught that terra was a closed system that entropy was increasing that life was a losing proposition all around and that the majority were doomed to poverty starvation disease misery and stupidity most of the people who still had rising expectations were scientists when furbish lousewart realized the political capital to be made from the revolution of lowered expectations he also realizedthus demonstrating his political savvythat having an opposition meant having a scapegoat group the scientists were an ideal scapegoat group because they all spoke in specialized languages and hardly anybody could understand them the jews had served this function in earlier ages because they spoke yiddish the scientists spoke mathematics louses in the skidrow dimehaunts it is impossible now to suppose that organic life exists only on this planet furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go justin case heard about the louses in the skidrow dimehaunts at one of epicene wildebloods wild wild parties on december simon moon a creature with almost as much

in on as they say in texas but that lardassed bore blake williams was droning the whole problem of course is that we havent been born yet in fact only now at this point in history is humanity about to be born williams was full of rubbish like that about to be born asked carol christmas the most delicious piece of blond femininity in the galaxy case thought at once that it would be a splendidly wonderful idea to deposit at least some of his sperm within herany orifice would do he thought this was a brilliant decision on his part and wondered how to begin implementing it he had no idea that

leaned forward in doubtful inquiry thats a very funny metaphor professor the only difference between my publishers and the james gang the drunk went on monotonous as a bass drum is that the james boys had horses which explains the various rebirth experiences reported by astronauts like aldrin and mitchell and the others williams trumpeted gassy old windbag earth is our womb leaving earth is

to the john one martini too many and he never did get all the conversations sorted out in his memory but the louses in the skidrow dimehaunts were firmly lodged in the ambiguous imagery files of his mythandmetaphor detector right next to the three stooges and chinatown and cagliostro the great to have locks on these doors one of the causes of cancer is the harmfulness of cooked foods furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go blake williams had the great good fortune to suffer a bout of polio in infancy of course he did not realize it was good fortune at the timenor did his parents or his doctors nonetheless he was among the lucky few who were treated by the sister kenny method at a time the early s when the american medical association was denouncing that method as quackery and forbidding experiment thereon by its members he was walking again with only a slight limp when he entered grade school in the real luck occurred twelve years later in when he was eighteen the limp and the dead muscles in his lower calves disqualified him for military service the next man drafted in his place had both testicles bloodily blown off in korea williams of course never knew about this patriotic gelding but he was well aware that various boys his age were having various portions of their anatomy blown off in korea being somewhat philosophical he often reflected on the paradox that the polio which had been when it occurred a physical agony to him and a psychological agony to his parents had preserved him from such mutilations considering that the only continuing effect of the polio was the slight limp he had to admit that nature or god or somethingorother had sneakily done him great good while appearing to do him great evil this was a decided encouragement toward an optimistic attitude toward the seemingly evil and made him wonder if the universe were not benevolent after all the guy who lost his balls in williamss place on the other hand became a pronounced pessimist and cynic between korea and vietnam while blake was acquiring first an ms and then a phd in paleoanthropology another great good fortune in the form of another seeming evil came before his eyes he was walking in lower manhattan he had started from washington square where he and his current girl friendthey were both nyu studentshad just had a particularly nasty quarrel right after a biology class he had wandered far to the west in a mood of suicidal gloom such as young male primates often think they should experience after losing a sexual partner somehow he wandered onto vandivoort street and found himself at the vandivoort street incinerator there he saw a most peculiar sight a rather stout man looking like he was about to cry was watching while two younger thinner men were pouring books out of a truck into the incinerator what the hell blake williams asked nobody in particular it was like an old movie of nazi germany nobody had told him that bookburning was now an american institution he approached the stout man who was the only one of the three who seemed unhappy and repeated his question what the hell he asked i mean are you people burning books they are the stout man said he went on to explain that he was an executive of something called the orgone institute press and that a court had ordered all their books destroyed williams was curious and looked at some of the titles character analysis and the mass psychology of fascism and the cancer biopathy and contact with space i didnt know that book burning was legal in this country he said neither did i the stout man said bitterly blake williams walked on dazed he couldnt have been more astonished if hed seen storm troopers rounding up jews he wondered if hed fallen into a time warp later of course he learned that the orgone institute headed by dr wilhelm reich had been investigating human sexuality and had come to some highly unorthodox conclusions dr reich himself died in prison dr silvert reichs coinvestigator committed suicide the books were burned and the heresy was buried but williams had an entirely new attitude toward the country in which he lived the scientific community which had looked on and made not a single gesture to support dr reich and dr silvert and the omnipresent rhetoric which insisted that the dark ages had ended many centuries ago he remembered that sister kenny at the time he and thousands of others were cured by her polio therapy had been denounced as a quack by the same entrenched medical bureaucrats who imprisoned the orgone researchers how convenient he thought aghast to assume that all the injustices happen in other countries and other ages that dreyfus may have been innocent but the rosenbergs never that pasteur may have been right but not the researcher ostracized from the american association for the advancement of sciencenot the professor denied tenure at our university not the man in our prison blake williams came to the great doubt without bitterness but with increased awareness that society is everywhere in conspiracy against intelligence on his own and at some expense he repeated all of dr reichs experiments and drew his own conclusions there were only eighteen he used to say deliberately cryptic sucking his pipe deadpan whenever anybody enthused about scientific freedom in his presence if the victim inquired only eighteen what blake would reply with the same deadpan only eighteen physicians who signed the petition against the burning of reichs books in he was not disappointed in his expectation that nine out of every ten researchers would angrily reply but reich really was a quack the tenth was the only one who would ever hear williamss real thoughts on any subject the turning point however didnt come until it was then that williams read a book entitled cosmic trigger the author a rather too clever fellow named robert anton wilson who wrote in a style as opulent as a moslem palace claimed to be in communication with a higher intelligence from the system of the dog star sirius he also provided evidence of a sort that aleister crowley g i gurdjieff dr john lilly dr timothy leary a flying saucer contactee named george hunt williamson and the priesthood of ancient egypt among others had also been contacted by esp transmitters from sirius williams found that he actually believed this preposterous yarn the discovery thrilled him since it didnt really matter whether the pretentious wilsons pompous claims were true or not what mattered was that he blake williams was free at last remembering free at last free at last thank god almighty im free at last the tombstone which had so moved him in despite bs and ms and phd blake williams was free he did not have to think what other academics thought he had somehow liberated himself from conditioned consciousness project pan in a sense began at that moment blake williams knew that he was going to do something great and terrible with his newfound freedom and he was resolved that unlike reich and leary and semmelweiss and galileo and the long sad list of martyrs to scientific freedom he would not be punished for it screw the earthlings he said bitterly and with mucho cojones im wise to their game the trick is to be independent but not to let them know about it that night he wrote in his diary challenge a remaining taboo it was that simple he had always wanted to understand genius and now he had the formula freud living in an age that prized its own seeming rationality had found one of the remaining taboos and dared to think beyond it he discovered infant sexuality and the unconscious among other things galileo had gone beyond the taboo thou shalt not question aristotle every great discovery had been the breaking of a taboo blake williams began looking around for a remaining taboo to violate this was by no means easy in unistat at that time living in a novel let there be a form distinct from the form g spencer brown laws of form jo malik once thought she was a transsexual she had even gone to dr john money the pioneer of transsexual therapy and surgery at johns hopkins back in the midsixties i think im a man living in a womans body she said dr money nodded that was normal in his business he began asking her questionsthe standard onesand in only a half hour she was convinced that she was not a transsexual she was just a confused woman dr money kindly gave her the name of a good psychiatrist in new york where she lived for a more conventional form of therapy after three months the psychiatrist announced that jos problem was not penis envy that was hardly exciting she had never thought her problem was quite that simple the therapy ground along she learned a great deal about her father complex her mother complex her sibling rivalries and her habit of hiding resentments it was enlightening in a painful way but she was still confused then the womens liberation movement began and jo dropped out of therapy to enter politics she no longer defined herself as a man trapped in a womans body but as a human being trapped in male definitions of femininity it was a very satisfactory resolution of her problems she no longer had to take responsibility for anything everything was the fault of the men there was no need to stifle resentmentsthe correct political stance was to express them in a strident voice and with a maximum of emotionalterritorial rage she had finally learned the abcs of primate politics she even learned to swell her muscles and howl it was all so much relief after years of selfdoubt that jo remained in while the rest of the world moved into and and and that was why she was wearing a bring back the sixties button at epicene wildebloods party jo still had one problem left over from prewomens lib days sometimes just before sleep she heard a voice saying no wife no horse no mustache of course she knew that everybody occasionally heard such voices in the hypnagogic reverie before true sleep you were wigging out only if you heard them all day long still she wondered where it came from and why it had such a cryptic message jo malik hadnt had a sexual relationship with a man since and looked it she was also sixtyfour years old and looked it nevertheless there was an unidentified man at the wildeblood party and jo suspected him of having designs on her bod that was because he kept trying to get into every conversation group that she intercepted he was following her she was convinced mother very easily made a jam sandwich using no peanuts mayonnaise or glue blake williams said of course skull island was coopers chinatown justin case said at the same moment wham that arbral with his showers sooty the fugs come in on tinnycut foets moon droned along jo decided that she had taken perhaps a little too much of the afghan hash that was going around it seemed that everybody in the roomthe creme de la creme of manhattan intelligentsiawere all talking gibberish she eased out onto the balcony for some fresh air and restful silence eight stories below a marquee blinked up at her deep throat it said male chauvinism she breathed deeply mingling oxygen with the cannabis molecules in her blood and the unidentified man appeared hello he said casually i thought id find you out here who the hell are you buster jo barkedthe first warning my name doesnt matter he said he was tall and handsome and very gentle in his eyes the worst kind of male chauvinist pig the seducer you dont matter either jo said snappily id like to be alone to enjoy the view if you dont mind she showed more teeth emphasizing the second primate warning im hugh crane the handsome stranger said quickly i have been sent by the author of our being with an important message for you please listen its vital to your future we are all living in a novel take it and stick it jo said leaving the balcony another male chauvinist squashed or at least squelched unfortunately back in the wildeblood soiree the first voice she heard was benny benedict complaining womens lib christ what we need now is mens lib do you know how much alimony im paying starhawks life study in capitalism man exploits man in socialism its exactly the opposite ben tucker famous vaudeville comedian while eggs benedict was complaining about his alimony in new york a telephone was ringing in marlene murphys apartment in san francisco starhawk a bronze young man with an arrogant face had picked marlene up in a singles bar on powell street just three hours before and still didnt know her last name he came out of the bathroom stark naked to answer the phone very carefully he said yes who is this the voice on the other end asked sharply starhawk breathed deeply who you trying to call he asked in return calmly starting to smile isnt this starhawk began to feel that he knew this voice from somewhere no he said this is try again mac he hung up quickly marlene murphy came out of the bathroom also naked toweling her hair starhawk looked at her thoughtfully you got a husband you sort of forgot to mention he asked me a husband marlene lit a cigarette thanks for the laugh id rather be in jail a husband jesus no thanks well somebody didnt like a man to be answering your phone starhawk said somebody with a voice like a cop or a bill collector my father she said oh crap here i am twentyfour years old and working for a masters in social psych and he thinks i shouldnt have a man in my apartment when he calls thats the irish for you the phone rang again marlene answered it this time starhawk started to cross the room but she grabbed his leg and as he turned she took his penis in her hand daddy marlene sounded genuinely surprised a man no im alone studying for the exams she was running her fingers around the crown of the penis and starhawk was reacting with a notable swelling what look i just told you it was a wrong number what am i a suspect you got in the back room you must have made a mistake even if it was the first time in your whole life marlene leaned forward and kissed starhawks cock quickly and shifted back to the phone at once no i said no daddy no and i meant it the church says im supposed to go to confession to a priest once a year it doesnt say im supposed to go to confession to my own father every time he calls me on the phone her hand was moving rapidly now trying to make starhawk ejaculate he smiled recognizing her game and pulled away to kneel before her and began licking her inner thighs no i havent seen aunt irene in two years shes involved in what greenpeace thats just to protect the whales theres nothing communistic about it and half the people in mendocino are in it what sure but they just like whales up there what do you mean my voice is getting funny it must be a cold coming on yes yes oh god its the door yes i love you too daddy the door she hung up quickly her pelvis heaving god god god oh sweet fucking jesus god starhawk stood up and said you like that kind of game why dont you call the archbishop and ill do it to you again while you talk to him you are a prize marlene said you really are a prize have you spent your whole life learning how to please women its my life study starhawk said everything else is just a hobby starhawk like most of the characters in this romance was a liar most primates lied constantly because they were afraid of getting caught and being pronounced nogood shits starhawk was always afraid of getting caught because his life study was really burglary starhawk thought he had a right to steal anything and everything he could get away with from the white people the white people had stolen all the land in unistat from his ancestors starhawk like the grim moralists in poe was determined to get even getting even was the basis of many primate semantic confusions such as expropriating the expropriators an absolute crime demands an absolute penalty they did it to me so i can do it to them and in general the emotional mathematics of one plus one equals zero the primates were so dumb they didnt realize that one plus one equals two and one murder plus one murder equals two murders one crime plus one crime equals two crimes etc they did not understand causality at all the few primates who did understand causality slightly called it karma they said all sorts of foolish things about it they didnt even know enough mathematics to describe quantum probability waves they said in crude hominid metaphor that bad karma led to bad vibes landslide bryce s dewitt states the copenhagen view promotes the impression that the collapse of the state vector and even the state vector itself is all in the mind one fact which seems to emerge from the present discussions of the nature of consciousness is that it is nonlocal ie not confined to a certain region of spacetime lawrence beynam future science furbish lousewart v was elected president of the united states in with the greatest landslide since roosevelt ii buried poor alf landon alive in the peoples ecology party also gained control of both the house and the senate and twentythree governorships out of the fiftyone the pep platform a weird mixture of tangled religiosity and new left antirationalism became official policy the new order began mildlyat least by comparison with what was to followand the major changes of the first administration consisted only of cutting the nasa budget to zilch banning mcdonalds hamburger shops which resulted in underground steakeasies where you gave the right password and got a big mac for outlawing tobacco a lid of chesterfields was soon selling for to coast to coast appointing three antitechnology fanatics to the first three vacancies in the supreme court forbidding the teaching of logical positivism in colleges throwing everybody off welfare the streets were soon full of crippled and schizophrenic beggars some of whom also slept there or even starved there on occasion creating that third world look which pep regulars regarded as spiritual cutting the use of electricity by percent gas by percent and atomic energy by percent thereby causing millions to freeze to death and millions more to join the army of unemployed beggars on the streets beginning all cabinet meetings with hatha yoga sessions and krishna chanting

were those either known to be disloyal to the party or suspected of such disloyalty encouraging the reemergence of cottage industry by rigidly repressing every more advanced kind of industry introducing zen meditation to grammar schools and most important of all blaming the host of new and tragic problems that resulted from government policies on an alleged conspiracy of scientists and instituting a nationwide witchhunt to round up the members of this conspiracy for incarceration in reeducation centers the revolution of lowered expectations had triumphed by nobody in the country had any higher expectations than a feudal serf actually the apotheosis of furbish lousewart v had been engineered by the same group of alpha males who had been promoting the revolution of lowered expectations all along these were very cunning old primates in several of the most skillful predator bands on terra because of the stealth and skill of these bandsmade up of successful predator families that had been intermarrying for several generationsthey collectively owned percent of all the territory and resources of unistat they only owned about percent of the rest of terra and that seriously annoyed them the revolution of rising expectations annoyed them even more because it led many primates to argue that the reason poverty and starvation still continued in an advanced technological society was that somebody was getting more than their share whenever anybody asked who that somebody might be all eyes turned on these royal old primate males who owned so much the eyes were not friendly sometimes in faroff lands where these royal primates did not completely control the governments some of their boodle was actually seized and redistributed to the people they had stolen it from as rising expectations had mounted in the first half of the century this regrettable pattern of expropriation also escalated the alpha males of these tough old predator families did not like this at all they therefore invested a prudent sum in promoting the careers of everybody who preached lowered expectations from ralph nader and the club of rome to oriental gurus and the neostoics of the postmarxist left when furbish lousewart came along they invested in him tooenough to buy the election for him the quantum connection is unmitigated when justin case returned from the john the

transylvanian statesman william f buckley jr the wit and wisdom of vlad the impaler the warren belch society held its annual meeting on january while poe was busy mining downtown washington with homemade atom bombs the society knew nothing of this and was more concerned with disappearing gorillas in chicago their tiny office was dominated by a huge oil painting of schrodingers cat executed in weird orgoneblue hues by their founder and presiding officer the eccentric millionaire w clement cotex all active members of the societyeight of them to be exactwere present the warren belch society had been founded after cotex had been kicked out of the fortean society for having bizarre notions the purpose of the belchers as cotex jovially called them was to investigate those aspects of scientific theory and those alleged occult events which were regarded as too far out by the unimaginative forteans who are willing to investigate ufos rains of crabs and fish girls who might have turned into swans and similar matters but like their founder the late charles fort drew the line at the dogs that said good morning and then vanished in a puff of green smoke cotex admittedly was an intellectual surrealist the name of the society for instance was deliberately taken from the most obscure of all the lawmen of the old west marshall warren belch of dodge city who had unfortunately been shot to death when his pistol jammed during his very first gunfight it was clem cotexs claim that the everettwheelergrahamdewitt interpretation of the schrodingers cat paradox was literally true everything that could happen did happen there were infinitely many universes each one the result of a collapse of the state vector in a possible way thus somewhere in superspace there must be a universe in which marshall belchs pistol didnt jam and he lived on to become famous there were probably tv shows and movies about him by now over there in that universe or so cotex argued in general as good empiricists the belch society was more interested in odd facts than in odd theories a ufo contactee who could jam zippers by looking at them a man found dead in st louis with his throat torn as though by the fangs of an enormous beast with no animal missing from the local zoos the famous stimson case of documented instances of a fat bearded man with jolly eyes seen near chimneys on

once explained his theory to a group of skeptical fellow characters like you dr williams he added picking out the most erudite and wiggy in the crowd blake williams in one of the parallel universes youre probably not an anthropologist but maybe a chemist or something in another universe you might even be a female musician instead of a male scientist and so on in another universe cotex concluded might be a small businessman from little rock who believes the universe is fivecornered the disappearing gorillas they were all convinced were a a major breakthrough to another universe b not yet known to those stuffy old forteans and c really hot stuff if gorillas can teleport professor fred fidgets digits was saying that may be the whole key to the mad fishmonger we neednt assume that the gorillas actually teleport dr horace naismith objected it may be that there is a schwartzchild radius in lincoln park zoo and they sort of fall into it and pass the event horizon this led to some lively debate on whether teleportation was or was not more likely than a black hole in the lincoln park zoo but blake williams suddenly derailed the conversation with a thoughtful and uncompleted i wonder if this goes all the way back to the democratic convention of say cortex cried eyes wide what was all that fighting and fussing about anyway the way i remember it the radicals wanted to sleep in the park and the police beat the shit out of them and chased them out of the park that seems an awfully silly issue to lead to a whole week of rioting and teargassing and why were so many journalistsand especially cameramenattacked by the cops you think maybe the city authorities knew about it even back then naismith asked eagerly people may resist new ideas as we all know to our sorrow williams said but a fact this sizeover two hundred gorillas purchased by the zoo over a tenyear period and only two accounted formust have been noticed by somebody on the finance committee at least you can bet your sweet ass the city authorities know about it and of course theyre imposing a coverup just like the air force with the ufos the same old government reflex pavlovs dog meets schrodingers cat again this is a time for action not theory said cotex gentlemen i am flying to chicago tonight to begin a personal investigation a case like this is a surrealists heaven and a logicians hell he added with a chuckle he was totally nonlinear the mad fishmonger there is no such thing as water it is merely melted ice furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go the mad fishmonger was the patron saint of the warren belch society he or she had originally appeared or had been alleged to have appeared in cromer gardens worcester england on may he or she along with perhaps a dozen assistants had rushed through cromer gardens at high noon throwing crabs and periwinkles all over the streets they also threw crabs and periwinkles into the fields beside the road they climbed high walls to dump some of the fish into gardens and onto the roofs of houses it was thorough painstaking work and since the mad fishmonger and his or her associates accomplished it all at noon on a busy day without being seen the citizens of cromer gardens claimed that the crabs and periwinkles had fallen out of the sky this notion was not acceptable to the scientists of the day who held it as axiomatic that crabs and periwinkles do not fall out of the sky a scientist from nature magazine therefore offered the mad fishmonger an explanation although he failed to explain how the fishmonger and his coconspirators had accomplished their feat without being noticed by any of the citizenry charles fort founder of the fortean society rejected the mad fishmonger indignantly and claimed that crabs and periwinkles did fall from the sky after clem cotex was thrown out of the fortean society for his heresies he reconsidered the whole puzzling case of the mysterious event in cromer gardens on may cotex decided to believe in the mad fishmonger it was the fundamental hypothesis of his system of philosophy and the guiding light of the warren belch society that the craziestsounding theory is the most likely one all things considered the motives and methodology of the mad fishmonger were much more mysterious than shellfish falling from the sky ergo the mad fishmonger probably did exist among the things the science of that time could not explain which clem cotex attributed to the mad fishmonger were other damned things that fell out of the sky such as iron balls with inscriptions on them or chunks of ice as big as elephants there were also damned things on the ground including jumping furniture haunts and the gentry there were animals that shouldnt be and animals that couldnt be and transtime and transspace perceptions and religious miracles the first clue to correct understanding of these things came when quantum causality was finally formulated correctly in gilhooleys demonstration of and nobody understood gilhooley at the time of our story everybody was as confused as clem cotex most of them just expressed their confusion or rather concealed it in more conservative ways another cia plot the spirit of decision consists simply in not hesitating when an inner voice commands you to act furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever four go just before coming to wildebloods party blake williams wrote one of the most heretical passages in his jealously guarded secret diaries he wrote i am an anthropologist ergo a professional liar an anthropologist is a scientist trained to observe that every society is a little bit mad including his own he holds his job by never mentioning this fact explicitly perhaps as a whole had been too much for him in january one of the biggest breakthroughs had occurred at project pan and williams and dashwood had to reach new heights of eloquence to persuade the other scientists involved that any premature disclosure could be lethal at that very time they pointed out the john birch society was staging massive sitins and protests against the introduction of anthropology texts to high schools in orange county in february the government accounting office announced that all the gold in fort knox had disappeared sometime in the past decade in march three new lifeextension pills were placed on the market during the controversy over forever the first lifeextension pill which was widely suspected of creating disastrous side effects all the data on forever thus far had shown one consistency scientists not employed by blue sky inc the manufacturer of forever continually found evidence of these tragic side effects and all scientists employed by blue sky continually found no evidence of such problems that

a form of tribute paid by nonowning users of land to nonusing owners the owners known as lordsoftheland or landlords for short were originally relatives of the alpha male or king see nomis of noom

neuroanthropology benny eggs benedict never got home from epicene wildebloods party that night on the corner of lexington and twentythird benny was hit by a heavy lead pipe which smashed his skull and killed him the pipe did not fall by accident it was wielded deliberately by a man named francesco pablo gomez pablo did not hate benny or have any personal feelings toward him at all and he did not grin sadistically pablo hit benny with the pipe because benny was well dressed and probably had money in his pockets when benny was comatose but not yet dead pablo dragged him into an alley and went through his pockets finding to his delight that his surmise had been correct and benny was actually carrying more than he had to be exact benny died while pablo was rifling the wallet to pablo was a lot of money he went home humming happily thats the way things were in unistat at the height of the revolution of lowered expectations clues every string which has one end also has another end finagles first fundamental finding clem cotex had been nosing about the lincoln park zoo for several days and was more puzzled than ever the facts were undeniable the zoo had indeed purchased over gorillas in the past decade and only two of them were on exhibit were missing any sort of casual questioning of the primate house attendants brought instantly vague answers in a wellrehearsed manner they were all in on the coverup the public was being protected against all knowledge of the inexplicable the weird the surrealistic all part of the usual governmental pretense that human affairs were rationally administered by experts who knew what was really going on they feared that if people ever discovered that those in power were as confused by this inexplicable universe as those out of power then the whole charade might collapse there was no black hole in the zoo cotex was sure of that all gravity conditions were normal the gorillas were not falling through a schwartzchild radius into the universe next door or anything really spooky like that they were simply teleporting somewhere maybe back to their homelands in africa although considering the unpredictability of teleportive currents as documented by charles fortwho had recorded cases of snakes landing in memphis tennessee and coconuts being deposited in worcester englandthe gorillas might actually be reappearing anywhere since anything might be a clue in such occult enigmas clem had carefully copied all the graffiti in the mens room at the primate house it was the usual jumble of disparate and ambiguous signals black p stone run it for a good blow job call and ask for father james flanagan help prevent von neumanns catastrophe arm the unemployed free our fourlegged brothers and sisters a zoo is a childs heaven and an animals hell save the whalesharpoon a honda off the landlords stamp out sizeism probably cotex thought morosely there is an important signal in there and im just not imaginative enough to see it god bless america the altruist god bless america last words of g i gurdjieff everybody who had been at wildebloods party felt compelled to attend benedicts funeral even though none of them enjoyed it benny had been one of the funniest writers of his time at least in the daily press and it would have been appropriate to send him off with a showing of old laurel and hardy films or something equally in his own metier primate decorum forbade this they packed him in with a dull and depressing religious ceremony i am the resurrection and the life intoned a primate with his collar on backward nobody knew what the hell that meant if anything but they tried to feel better when they heard it at the time benny was buried a window washer was at work on the seventeenth floor of the morgan guaranty trust at wall street he was an expert lipreader and knew more of the secrets of wall street than anybody outside the illuminati in fact the second reason he had become a window washer was to get work in the wall street district and pick up useful information the main reason he had taken the job would have been even more unnerving to morgan guaranty had they known about it the window washer was a member of purity of essence and had already managed to place homemade nuclear weapons on ledges so high nobody but a pigeon was ever likely to see them all of the weapons were set to go off at a signal from the poe computeranother homemade contraption but awesomely efficient poe was full of science grads who had dropped out of the career game in horror and revulsion at the uses to which science was being put in their universe at this point poe had twentyeight american cities mined the window washer hoped that when push came to shove poe wouldnt have to detonate more than one of those cities he was an altruist like everybody else in puritv of essence take what thou hast take what thou hast and give it to the poor attributed to some longhair commie freak the letter was sent out may

by the establishment the letter said may god forgive us may history judge as charitably we have placed tactical nuclear bombs in over locations throughout the united states the targets are all enemies of the people large banks multinational corporations government facilities we will trigger one of these bombs at noon tomorrow somewhere in the eastern united states to demonstrate that we are not bluffing all of the other nuclear bombs will be triggered in succession until our demands are met if any attempt is made to apprehend and arrest usany attempt at all all the remaining bombs will be detonated at once we demand that president furbish lousewart immediately confiscate all fortunes above one million dollars that this money which we calculate makes a sum of approximately three trillion dollars be distributed at once to the forty million families who are according to the governments own standards living below the poverty line so that each poor family receives that all government money presently invested in weapons of war and preparations for war be immediately redirected to improving schools homes and hospitals in poor neighborhoods so as to make them fit for human beings that george washington be removed from the dollar bill and replaced by walt disneys mickey mouse to remind people forever of the idiocy of worshiping money a final word of warning we have been working on this project for sixteen years and have the full capacity to do all that we say the revolution of lowered expectations has been a monopolists heaven and a poor peoples hell we intend to change that poe collapse of the state vector records can be destroyed if they do not suit the prejudices of ruling cliques lost if they become incomprehensible distorted if a copyist wishes to impose

nuclear attack would come from there twentythree hundred russian missiles took off the moment the first unistat missile entered russian airspace they all went to china the russian computer had also been programmed by very dogmatic very inflexible primates it knew that any nuclear attack would come from china starhawk was coming out of a bar on geary when frisco went he was incinerated before his

ate lionel markoff chaney also survived he was on a greyhound in florida between miami and hollywood when the bombs went off he took to the everglades and eventually even found a matea seminole woman who didnt think he was absurd at all their tribe increased the tribal stage endured years as it had before then suddenly when environmental conditions were right genetic programs reasserted themselves the hive instinct reappeared in the primates cities appeared sin and guilt were reinvented technology advanced nuclear energy was rediscovered and misused again the tribal age endured years the next

reconcile with comon sense bryce s dewitt quantum mechanics and reality physics today september they were sitting in a vw rabbit on market street in san francisco the marquee across the street still said deep throat after twelve years they never going to change that starhawk asked everybody and his brother been there to see that linda lovelace swallow peckers by now hell everybody and his brother been there twice by now she could swallow my pecker anytime mendoza said mendoza was a cop i seen a funny one the other day starhawk said starting to laugh in the mens crapper in the archaeology building linda lovelace for president it said lets have a goodlooking cocksucker in the white house college kids theyre all a bunch of fags these days mendoza told him seriously fags and dopers and they call us pigs anyway what were you doing in the archaeology building i like to study my peoples history starhawk said there a law against that the fuck mendoza said i dont care what you do on your spare time you make out with those college girls dont tell me i know you make out like a bandit youre the greatest thing come down the pike since burt reynolds you are starhawk started to clean his nails with an attachment on his key ring tell me about the coke murph owns more guns than the army got up in presidio hes a real nut on guns i mean its your ass he catches you he wont think twice about it a police officer catching a burglar in his own house its your ass you got to understand that dig starhawk said its always my ass you think theres a crib worth knocking over they dont have guns these days christ theres never been a betterarmed country since we had the revolution is what it is even little old ladies even in berkeley for christs sake this is no business for anybody got shaky nerves these days college professors their houses are stacked with enough munitions for black panther headquarters what i dont understand is how come everybody in the fucking country hasnt been at least wounded by now everybodys even more crazymad than they are shitscared its like high noon you dont have to tell me be careful i wasnt careful id be one dead indian son of a bitch mendoza said suddenly sitting up starhawk was almost startled huh that dog mendoza said you see that son of a bitch shit right on the sidewalk they do that all over the city the ordinance doesnt mean a fucking thing dirty filthy animals i d ban them from the fucking city entirely i was mayor yeah starhawk said thats our chief problem here dogs shitting on the street it aint funny mendoza said filthy bastards spread all kinds of diseases and you take your kid out for a walk and theres two of them humping and the kid says daddy what are the doggies doing what are you gonna tell her is what i wanna know dirty filthy animals yeah but about murphy and this job okay okay mendoza said im just telling you dirty filthy animals should be banned with murph you got to be in and out as slick and sneaky as a preachers prick in a cows ass i mean he likes guns more than most cops and hed love an excuse to shoot you murphy starhawk turned in his seat murph and i we never had any bad feelings well okay he loves the ground you walk on like all the hookers on powell street and the housewives up in marin and the college girls now too but he hates what you are he hates all minoritiesindians niggers it dont matter to him hes democratic about it the fuck he doesnt like me much and we been partners going on ten years this may and he hates burglars especially an indian burglar thats almost as good to him as a nigger burglar you got to realize that when you go in there thats a hot one starhawk said not laughing that really is a hot one all the stuff hes fenced for me and he hates burglars that really is good next thing youll tell me is the vice squad hates hookers murphys religious mendoza said hed love to make holes in you thats what you got to understand support your local police starhawk said for a more efficient police state look you on this caper or you just going to sit here and crack wise i can get marty malloy you know youre religious too starhawk said i went and made fun of the department and now youre going to get malloy wholl fuck up the whole job and youll both be up in q for the next twenty years but at least he wont crack wise about the department hell leave fingerprints all over the joint and drop the snow in the bushes on his way out and crash into an oakland po car going home and then lead them right to your front door but hes got proper respect for the police malloy yeah you get malloy look no need to be touchy mendoza was ingratiating i want you i dont want malloy just lay off the department is all okay okay no need for either of us to get antsy starhawk smiled like an actor how much coke you think like i say who knows but its got to be around gs thats what amato says and hes good at making estimates like that say amato is wrong for once in his life say its only gs still you dont get half of gs every night you go out and knock over a house its beautiful starhawk said its so beautiful it stinks a cop with a couple hundred thou in hot cocaine all i got to do is walk in and walk out hell never report it to anyone thats just what bothers me murphy comes home and finds it gone hes going to do something okay he cant call the captain and say some thief just stole the cocaine i took from freddy fuckerfaster when i busted him before i could sell it to maldonado send over a squad car real quick thats what he dont do so okay what does he do you know him better than i do he gets mad for a week and anybody we bust better watch his ass or murph will turn him over to wrecking crew thats all what the fuck can he do you see theres just nothing you can do when somebody snatches something you shouldnt have in the first place especially when youre a cop theres me and malloy starhawk said and five others murph knows as well as me and two i can think of that murph doesnt know about yet and maybe two that i dont even know lets say thats lets see about ten or eleven guys who might have done it afterwards ten or eleven really good cat burglars in the bay area that murphy will come looking for one way or another so you had a day in the last five years somebody on the force wasnt trying to put you away mendoza grinned or you worried that maldonado will think the cokes already his and put the whole cosa nostra onto getting it back balls theres ten guys around here could do it like you say and ten more might have come up from la and another ten from vegas or chicago or christ knows where you go in as slick as you usually do nobodyll ever have a lead murphyll have a purple hardon for a week or so and i wouldnt want to be anybody he busts then but thats all thatll happen all you in or you out wait whens murphs next day off tomorrow why some people starhawk said they had this kind of merchandise theyd hide it so you practically got to take the walls down one by one before you find it you know case like that you want to save yourself some time you watch until they show you where it is hey murphs no dumbbell you think youre the invisible man or something its got to be tomorrow believe me hell never see me but ill see him you was to ask me going in today bareass before i can case the house would be the best way to get my balls in a sling for all i know hes got a friend staked out there for when hes at work and i wait till the day after tomorrow when hes at work again he may have already sold it to maldonado am i right or am i right jeez mendoza turned to look straight at starhawk you going in there with murph at home i dont like that at all what i dont want is somebody gets dead him or you that happens my ass is grass and the whole department is the lawn mower anybody in the department ever link me to a killing even suspect me you know better than that mendy i dont go in bareass you know already i got three plans then youre really in oh im in starhawk stopped cleaning his nails and returned the key to the ignition i wouldnt miss it for the world the only thing i like better than stealing from a cop is fucking a cop funny mendoza said remind me to laugh on my day off that attitude is going to get you in a lot of trouble some fine day my friend the first furbish lousewart you must take the bull by the tail and look the facts in the face w c fields the first furbish lousewart was a retainer on the greystoke estate in england in the thirteenth century he was a foundling the bastard offspring of the local curate and a nun who oddly enough later told chaucer a story he considered good enough to retell in verse the nun was also the model for the prioress in the earliest tarot deck and her basic features remained even after that card became the female pope and later the high priestess lord greystoke named the infant furbish lousewart because he looked so dainty when they found him in the manger furbish lousewart was as dainty a name as you could have in merrie england in those days being the vernacular term for herba pedicularis a most lovely flower of the snapdragon species furbish lousewart grew to manhood married fathered three legitimate children and died in the third crusade one of his illegitimate children by lady greystoke was the only greystoke to survive that crusade and carried on the greystoke line unknown to his brothers and sisters who continued the plebeian line of lousewarts nothing everyone who is a lawyer must either be mentally defective by nature or be bound to become so in time furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go and dr glopberger like frankenstein looked on his work and saw that it was very good so far but the nurse ms ida pingala returning along the long white hall permeated with lysol to the snug white cubicle of the nurses lounge seated herself smoothing the starched white hem of her skirt over her pale white knees and punched numbers quick and neat on the phone console white keys on white plastic the colorless allcolor of antiseptic sterility ubu here came the voice in her ear roy its ida ms pingala was equally crisp sounds of canine panting roy was always a cutup ms pingala laughed merrily tonight she asked sounds of louder more passionate panting she giggled again your place or mine yours you know how the bureau is eightish nineish to be on the safe side all hell is breaking loose again nineish then you devil more panting oh you devil you wild man you animal nineish gotto go now love you bye roy ubu in washington hangs up and glances at his wristwatch time for the meeting with babbit terran archives washington was the capital city of unistat it was governed ostensibly by a baseball team called the senators but by the time of our story real control had fallen into the hands of the fbi and the beast a listless santa claus dingdonging his bell with empty junkie eyes as light snow fell in sparse crystals not sticking to the sidewalk but a biting washington wind stings ubus eyes as he leaves the fbi office turning up his collar to slouch hands deep in pocket to his car shifting from first gear into second turning up pennsylvania avenue the snowflakes growing thicker and heavier as he drives snaps on the car radio and so the second black uprising in miami has ended in flame and tragedy in washington president lousewart ismeeting this morning with the stentorian ambassador to discuss balance of payments amid a mood of cautious optimism parents in bad ass texas continue to keep their children out of school in the bitter dispute over biofeedback training school superintendent b s curve still hospitalized from the bomb blast which destroyed ubu parks carefully with neat precision flashing his id at the secret service man to be passed quickly into the white house over thick carpets under brilliant chandeliers to the office of mountbatten babbit scientific advisor to the president a bald and ovoid head with impatiently piercing eyes that scanned for the exact measurement and the precisely calibrated number this ah is a very delicate matter babbit began at once we give it an urgent rating but at the same time we do not wish to alarm the public you understand the whole investigation must be carried on with kid gloves as they say the president himself has instructed me to make it clear to you to make it absolutely clear that no leaks will be tolerated no leaks whatsoever or a very big ax will fall on the whole bureau a very big ax have i made myself clear yes sir absolutely sir good now have you noticed a certain ah a certain decline in american science and technology in recent years a withering away of talent and originality so to speak well sir law is my background you know sir i wouldnt know a test tube from a bevatron sir the decline has been accelerating and is becoming critical in some respects critical yes sir but so what sir a lot of science is classified as nonec and not very popular with the administration babbits eyes were scanning ubu without warmth you think it is possible to draw a hard line a sharp boundary between ec science and nonec science well of course sir president lousewart himself is always saying im not talking about administration rhetoric mr ubu i am talking about reality could you draw such a line and say this is ec research and this is nonec well sir i dont get involved in politics i investigate and find out the facts and thats my job sir administrative decisions are not our business at the bureau there is no difference between ec and nonec science babbit said with icy deliberation i will never say that in public as long as i am part of the administration you understand the president has a right to expect loyalty from members of the team of course but i tell you in private ec and nonec are terms in theology in metaphysics in value judgment they have nothing to do with science its all as absurd as saying some research is chocolate and some is vanilla and the chocolate is better than the vanilla yes sir i understand you sir you have my word ill never repeat any of this sir good now officially the administration only wishes to discourage nonec science but in fact we are suffering a drastic a dangerous possibly a lethal decline in all science right across the board but sir isnt that what president lousewart stands for tightening our belts the simple rugged life of our pioneer ancestors lowered expectations you damned fool were not talking about political speeches were talking about the realities of survival uh yes sir yes survival dammit survival but quantumly inseparable from ubu nurse ida pingala peeks into the wildeblood room to see if the patient is sleeping comfortably always got to be careful with these rich bitches especially the types we get here in transsexuality surgery rather be back in obs so helpless and adorable they are even if some of the mothers shouldnt be raising kittens much less humans and leans fixing the hem on her skirt as the figure in the bed gurgles a halfsnore mutter master escape another quantum jump one hundred thirtytwo ubu repeated those are the figures that came out of the beast babbit said evenly one hundred thirtytwo of the top scientific minds whove left government since the ec programs were implemented are not working for private industry teaching at universities or anywhere else to be found sex status success it may have been coincidence or synchronicity or the quantum inseparability principle quip but the very same day that epicene wildeblood became mary margaret wildeblood in baltimore and babbit briefed roy ubu on the brain drain mystery in washington blake williams was teaching a class at columbia and hugo de naranja was a student in it since hugo was the first human being who ever saw the cat he should have been paying close attention to williams but in fact he was a poet and felt it his duty to be bored by all the sciences hugo would settle for a gentlemans c in the anthropology f quantum physics hugo was a santaria initiate the third exhusband of carol christmas and although he didnt know it he worked for hassan i sabbah x it wasnt einstein williams was droning along and it wasnt even heisenberg or dear old schrodinger who drove the last nail in the coffin of common sense it was john s bell who published his memorable theorem in nearly twenty years ago and blah blah blah hugo was more interested in the ass of the girl in the row ahead of him he wanted both his hands on that ass he wanted her thighs around his waist he wanted his cock way up inside her hot white protestant pussy screwing latino girls rated in his book that was only sex screwing jewish girls was that was status but screwing a white protestant girl was points and a gold star that was success williams continues to transmit to blank bored faces bells theorem basically deals with nonlocality that is it shows that no local explanation can account for the known facts of quantum mechanics um perhaps i should clarify that a local explanation is one that assumes that things seemingly separate in space and time are really separate um yes it assumes that is to say that space and time are independent of our primate nervous systems do i have your attention class but bell is even more revolutionary he offers us two choices if we try to keep locality and if there are any students in this class who are seriously interested in the subject this would be a good time to take a few notes um first choice we can abandon quantum mechanics itself that of course means inescapably that we abandon atomic physics and about threequarters of everything we tall science um now we really dont want to give up quantum mechanics so lets look at choice two we give up objectivity well thats not too great a sacrifice for those of us who have already given up sweets and male superiority and ha ha faith in the integrity of government or even cigarettes we can give up objectivity ahhh yes but the trouble is yes mr naranja ees this goan be on the examination sir no you neednt worry about that mr naranja we wouldnt dream of asking anything hard on the examination i believe the last examination with a hard question given at this university was in a survey of mathematics course in yes mr lee is possibre that quantum connection is not immediate and unmitigated then perhaps we take choice one and give up not quantum mechanics itself but merely modify the quantum connection in a sense that it is some way sir mediate or mitigated does that seem possibre sir ah mr lee how did you ever land at this university there are times i suspect you of actually seeking an education but im afraid in this case your canny intellect has run aground recent experiments by clauser and aspect shut that door forever the quantum connection is immediate unmitigated and i might say omnipresent as the thomist god so you tell us professor williams how many times crausers experiment has been verified jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way rebirth wildeblood was deciding is messier than first birth despite old augustine and his media feces et urine trip how much he had wanted to be annette haven in the clusterfuck scene in china girl one cock in her mouth one in her snatch one in each hand ah wildeblood twere paradise enow but the reality of it the adjustments to be made sit down when you want to pee sit down when you want to pee sit down when you want to pee she was writing it out a hundred times to avoid making that mistake again ego is much more a body image than she had known psychologically she was androgynous woman the baphomet idol physically she had to sit down to pee oh what fun it is to ride but roy ubu back at fbi headquarters was already briefing a fiveman team on the brain drain mystery you mean special agent tobias knight asked were supposed to find missing scientists without letting anybody know that there are missing scientists were looking for is that it the president himself ubu pronounced in babbits frigid tones gives this project top priority in other words its impossible but you want us to do it anyway knight translated now thats enough defeatism toby lets get to work and believe in ourselves and by christ a busted flush can win when the guys behind it have the balls for it now heres the names in alphabetical order one dr george washington carver bridge sounds like a spade graduate miskatonic university it says last worked for the government on project cyclops in the late seventies two dr charles chance nickname fat graduate miskatonic also last worked for the government on cyclops three the second furbish lousewart a man with one watch knows what time it is a man with two watches is never sure segals law percy lousewart was born in the ohio river valley in and by then lousewart was no longer considered a euphonious name his christian name didnt help even though his mother had picked it due to her fervent almost erotic admiration for shelley she might as well have named the poor lad cissy every time he introduced himself as percy lousewart some bully or other felt compelled to make a witty remark and a fight usually followed eventually poor percy decided to change his name and went to see an educated man a lawyer about having the job done legally he also wanted some advice on choosing a better more popular title the lawyer alas was more than erudite he was a bibliomaniac an alcoholic scholar and the kind of crank who delights in writing letters to the britannica correcting their errors he told percy all about the furbish lousewart plant and even showed him a picture of one he was eloquent on the subject and his passion was contagious percy lousewart had his name changed only to furbish lousewart and took his lumps as they came his first son was named furbish lousewart ii and a tradition was begun malloy dont sing the variables vary too much and the constants arent as constant as they seem finagles fifth fundamental finding the fuck malloy said where you get an idea like that i dont sing i never sing whos been handing you that shit it was a small furnished room on taylor street in the san francisco tenderloin a sign outside the window advertised an establishment on the ground floor les nuits de paris massage starhawk said marty i know three guys up in folsom because of you theyre not sure each one of them he says it might of been you it might of been two other guys im sure i make it a point of honor to be sure about things like that you pick up here from mendoza there from murphy and you tell them what you think they want to hear mostly crap to keep them interested you give them a live one now and then somebody you dont like you and twenty other guys in this town dont crap me marty im here to make money for you not to give you a hard time about it malloy said youre crazy you should go see a psychiatrist you must of been back on the reservation eating peyote again i dont know what the fuck youre talking about okay starhawk said youre smart marty youre so damned smart you dont admit anything even when the other guy knows more about it than you do my ass youre so damned smart youre stupid is what you are malloy started to get up sit down starhawk said i keep telling you im not here to give you a hard time listen to me marty just a minute ive got a century thats not doing anything and its yours he opened his wallet and laid a bill on the table now do we talk about its four brothers and what you do to get them or do you go on shitting me until i go out the door and find another guy that talks to cops the massage sign below the window flickered onoff onoff suppose i do it malloy said i mean im not admitting anything but suppose just this once i go talk to the murph what i got to know is whose ass is in the sling who goes up you understand i dont want somebody comes looking for me from the syndicate nobody goes up thats the beauty of it starhawk said youre just going to tell murph about a guy got in today from la hes here to do a job for maldonado see and he got drunk and started shooting off his mouth about how funny it was the guy he came to do the job on is a cop jesus malloy said the massage sign flickered off and on again dont tell me let me guess starhawk the man of bronze two balls of cast iron and no more brains than a hamster you got it in your head its cophunting season and youre going to shoot one of them and they trust good old marty malloy so much theyll spend all their time looking for an imaginary hit man from la just because good old marty tells them so i take it all back you dont need a psychiatrist you need a new brain dont get your bowels in an uproar starhawk said its not that kind of job its just a heist whats this cop got somebody comes all the way from la to heist it the crown jewels starhawk raised his fingers to his nose and made a sniffing motion jesus mary and joseph malloy said this cop what hes got is a bag of snow so he wont be talking to anybody else in the department when it turns up missing i got to hand it to you kid nobody could have set this up for you but another cop the fuck it would have to be his partner whos pissed because he didnt get his half right dont think about that you might get so excited youll talk about it in your sleep the thing is you just got to tell murph about this syndicate gun from la and how funny he thinks it is that this crooked cop is trying to sell some hot snow to maldonados boys and they just went and brought up this gorilla to take it from him no down payment no monthly installments for free malloy was grinning broadly murphll shit he said hell absolutely shit a brick yeah starhawk said i kind of think he will you like it kiddo malloy said if i wasnt so broke this week id do it free just to watch him trying not to look like the cop im telling him about the fat prick i sort of figured youd like it starhawk said me the only thing i regret is i cant be there to see his face myself yeah malloy said the fat prick is vlad a symbol a class made up solely of intellectuals will always have a guilty conscience furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go defection ubu suggested at the second conference on the brain drain russia or china the cia was the first agency into this babbit said and they say its impossible they know what color drawers every commissar wears these days with the latest surveillance techniques one hundred thirtytwo top american scientists are not working over there unknown to the cia take that as axiomatic babbit was firm well there are only twelve people in home they havent left the planet babbit said briefly people of that caliber do not travel about without somebody noticingintelligence newspapers tv other scientists somebody it is as if they have crawled into a hole and dragged the ground in after them his chair creaked screeee as he leaned forward for emphasis hell theyre not loose inside the country sir ubu said firmly americans cant just disappear these days why to cash a check any kind of check youve got to write both your social security number and your gwb number and have them both scanned by the beast sir theres never been a people better watched and protected than the american people of november and we expect to do even better sir when the new circuits are put in the beast next month hes gonna find out whos naughty or nice but the snow falls thicker making a blanket of foam against the window of babbits office and piles against the door of the upstart crow bookstore off dupont circle across town where marvin gardens is autographing copies of vlad victorious i never got a real live autograph from a real live author mr gardens tell me why did you write two books about a man like vlad to make money marvin said in his peter lorre cokehead voice he had prepared for the ordeal of the seventeenth autograph party in twentythree days by snorting more than his usual morning quantity of the snow and was in no mood to conceal his divinity from the blind uncoked earthlings i have always been possessed by a mad passionate almost erotic desire for a very large bank account in fact i love the feel of money the crisp crinkle of bills the metal solidity of coin the visual impact of a

construction engineers six male and six female they had originally been sent there to build with materials shipped from lunar mining home ii a space village for occupants this program had been canceled as nonec by president lousewart and the twelve colonists restricted to ec research mostly astronomical which president lousewart turned over to his astrologers for a mystical interpretation home was located in the area called libration point where the gravitational fields of luna and terra were equally balanced this nullgravity area had been mathematically discovered by the astronomer lagrange and was therefore sometimes called the lagrange area the name for the space town home had been coined by psychologist timothy leary in a friend of learys named robert anton wilson who wrote overly complicated novels had suggested a team song for the colonists home on lagrange to popularize this idea he had written letters about it to many space research groups and included it in a novel called the trick top hat still by the song hadnt caught on with the twelve colonists they were not at home on lagrange because they feared that the whole project would soon be classified as nonec and

margaret wildebloods parties were the place to go that winter because of the penile adornment above the mantelpiece some even began to suspect that wildeblood had undergone the transsex operation only to engage in the most flagrant excess of exhibitionism in world history this was an uncharitable oversimplification wildebloods mind was vast not simple and had more kinks than a pollack painting she was not deep but wide and complex she actually intended to become a nun when she quoted from the gospel of hir youth humility is endless she really meant it submission was salvation and who is more submissive than a nun above all she longed to embrace the lamb all woolly and fleecy and pure but very definitely horned and ramsigned with pentecostal fire she had the hots for divine intercourse

about how complete these operations are how do we know ms wildeblood is in all respects a true woman and not just a truncated man mary margaret wildeblood who had a mind somewhat bizarre even for the twentieth century had been waiting for such an opportunity i can certainly prove im not a man she smiled sweetly and drew ulysses out of her purse although two men fainted on the spot the women merely blinked at least at first then some of them began to titter thus began the great wildeblood scandale of that winter she had maliciously saved the relic of her previous masculinity with the thought that it might provoke some sort of spontaneous group encounter sessions and now she knew she had the potential for some truly memorable freakouts the relic was placed in the hands of a skilled taxidermist and soon emerged in a naturallooking erect state handsomely mounted on a redwood plaque this hung over the mantelpiece of her posh sutton place apartment and there she began to hold parties to which were invited along with the usual new york vips precisely those persons most likely to be neurologically galvanized by the sight of a penis without a man which is considerably more

strangely enough certain shy timid and stoopshouldered men took it all in their stride quite as if wildebloods brutally explicit rejection of masculinity reinforced their own loose grip upon that after all somewhat mystical estate the gay set developed a superstition almost a mystique and the tradition of kissing it for good luck was even joked about obscurely in certain newspaper columns a

benny benedict suddenly had enough of the wildeblood highiq set he wandered out on the balcony to look at the stars and wonder halfdrunkenly why he was so depressed after three years the question still came to him when he had too much booze aboard why me which was selfish and maudlin the real question should be why my mother or more to the point why anybody the world must be mad that we go on living like this and tolerate it the primordial jungles were probably less dangerous than the streets of any city in unistat was this the resultant of the long struggle upward from the cavesa world more frightening more full of hatred and violence more bloody than the days of the sabertooth every time i look at the tv news at seven he thought miserably i end up feeling this way before midnight its almost as if theyre afraid somebody might have a flicker of hope or a good opinion of humanity at least in potential or a brief moment of delusory security every night to prevent such unrealistic moods they have to remind us that the violence and brutality is still continuing with a shock benny discovered that he was weeping again silently guiltily privately he had thought he was past that so much for booze as a tranquilizer he fought against it it was selfindulgence disguised selfpity actually he dabbed his eyes and tried to think of something else om mani padme hum om mani padme hum nice night an unidentified man had walked out onto the balcony you dont feel the smog up here benny said embarrassed wondering if he had gotten rid of the last tear before this stranger had seen him the unidentified man looked up at the stars smiling slightly he was goodlooking enough to be an actor benny thought and at second glance he did look remotely familiar as if his face had been in the newspapers sometime the stars he said dont they get to you benny looked up i used to think id live to see people go there he confessed suddenly sure he had met this man somewhere before a long time ago not likely with lousewart leading us back to the stone age youre nonec the man said in mock accusation guilty benny replied realizing that this man was remarkably easy to talk to i think that if we used more of our brains wed be able to create a world where people would have a right to high expectations hopelessly reactionary the man said grinning you probably still read science fiction guilty again benny said suppose i were an extraterrestrial the man said quietly suppose i were several million years ahead of this planet what one question would you ask me why is there so much violence and hatred among us benny asked at once its always that way on primitive planets the man said the early stages of evolution are never pretty do planets grow up benny asked some of them the man said simply how through suffering enough they learn wisdom benny turned and looked at his odd companion he is an actor he thought through suffering he repeated theres no other way not in the primitive stages the man said primitives are too selfcentered to ask the important questions until suffering forces them to ask benny felt the grief pass through him again and leave he grinned you play this game very well anybody can do it the man said its a gimmick to get outside your usual mindset you can do it too just try for a minuteyou be the advanced intelligence and ill be the primitive terran okay sure benny said enjoying this why me the strangers tone was intense why have i been singled out for so much injustice and pain there is no known answer to that benny said at once some say its just chancehazardstatistics some say there is a plan and that you were chosen to learn an important lesson nobody knows really the important thing is to ask the next question and what is the next question benny felt as if this was easy the next question is what do i do about it how ever many minutes or hours or years or decades i have left what do i do to make sense out of it all hey thats good the stranger said you play higher intelligence very well its just a gimmick benny said feeling as if a great weight had been taken off him they laughed where did you ever learn that benny asked from a book on cabala the man said its a way of contacting the holy guardian angel but people dont relate to that metaphor these days so i changed it to an extraterrestrial from an advanced civilization who are you i keep feeling ive seen your face the man laughed im a stage magician he said cagliostro the great are you sure youre not a real magician benny asked schrodinger the man your theory is crazy but its not crazy enough to be true neils bohr quoted by beynam future science erwin schrodinger did a lot more than just make up mathematical riddles about fictitious cats his equations describing subatomic wave mechanics which earned him a nobel prize were among the most important contributions to particle theory in our century later he turned his attention to biophysics and in a small book called what is life he offered the first mathematical definition of the difference between living and dead systems throwing off as a side reflection the idea that life is negative entropy this insight was to trigger quite a few new ideas in many of his readers including norbert wiener of mit and claud shannon of bell labs who got so deep into negative entropy due to schrodinger that they created mathematical information theory and laid the foundations of the science of cybernetics resulting ultimately in the beast schrodinger didnt even believe in his own cat riddle he had propounded it only to show that there must be something wrong with quantum theory if it leads to conclusions like that schrodinger didnt like quantum theory because it pictures an anarchist universe and he was a determinist like his good friend albert einstein thus even though he had helped to create quantum theory and used it every day schrodinger kept hoping to find something seriously wrong with it the cat problem presupposes a cat a device of lethal nature such as a gun or a poisongas pellet and a quantum process which will eventually trigger the weapon and kill the cat very simple an experimenter if he wanted to find out when the device had fired and killed the cat would look into the laboratory where all this was transpiring and note what actually happened but schrodinger points out with some gleemodern physics if its all its cracked up to be should allow us to find out what is happening without our actually going into the laboratory to look all we have to do is write down the equations of the quantum process and calculate when the phase change leading to detonation will occur the trouble is that the equations yield at minimum two solutions at any given timesay one half hourthe equations give us two quantum eigenvalues one of which means that the cat is now definitely dead kaput spurlos versenkt finished and the other which tells us that the cat is still alive as you and me i never died said he i never die said he most physicists preferred to ignore schrodinger s damned cat quantum mechanics worked after all and why make a big thing about something a little funny in the mathematics einstein loved schrodinger s cat because it mathematically demonstrated his own conviction that subatomic events couldnt be as anarchistic as wave mechanics seemed to imply einstein was a hidden variable man he claimed there must be a hidden variablean invisible hand as adam smith might have saidcontrolling the seemingly indeterminate quantum anarchy einstein was sure that the hidden variable was something quite deterministic and mechanical which would be discovered eventually god does not play dice with the world he liked to say decade followed decade and the hidden variable remained elusive in the s dr evan harris walker solved the cat paradox to his own satisfaction and defined the hidden variable to his own satisfaction the hidden variable he said was consciousness there was muttering in some quarters that walker was smuggling pantheism into physics disguised as quantum psychology but many younger physicistsespecially the acidheadsaccepted the walker solution professor john archibald wheeler of princeton found another way of dealing with the cat he took it literally every quantum indeterminacy he proposed creates two universes thus the equations are literally true and in one universe the cat lives and in another universe the cat dies we can only experience one universe at a time of course but if the math says the other universe is there then by god it is there furthermore since probabilities occur continuallyevery time you toss a coin for instancethere are many many such universes perhaps an infinite number of them with two graduate students named everett and graham wheeler even worked up a model of where the other universes were they were on all sides of us in superspace some were heard to suggest that old wheeler had been reading too much science fiction to cross again if i offer a child the choice between a pear and a piece of meat hell immediately take the pear thats his instinct speaking furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go mountbatten babbit being methodical in all things including his madness could pinpoint exactly the date on which he had started sliding over the porous membrane separating the sane from the insane it had been long long agoback in actually in july the twentythird of the month a thursday or perhaps it had actually started the night before on the twentysecond it was hard to say actually even though babbit was a man who detested imprecision of any sort say it was the twentysecond then even though the overt symptom did not manifest until the twentythird we do want to be as accurate as possible when were lost out here so say the twentysecond mountbatten was a freshman at antioch college then and the carter brothers carnival was playing in nearby xenia mounty and some friends went over to have a looksee since mounty personally didnt wait around for the postmidnight private exhibition of the lustful mulatto lady and the randy pony advertised by shills in the crowd the high point of the show for him had been the mentalist cagliostro the great a girl assistant in as brief a costume as the carnival could get away with back in nearly antediluvian and barbaric ohio circulated through the audience while cagliostro youngish and handsome for this racket sat blindfolded on the stage now what am i holding she would ask when somebody handed her a watch i get the image of a timepiece yes a wristwatch the magician intoned what do i have in my hand this time the answer was a locket can you tell me what this object is a wallet photo driving back to yellow springs the students fell into a debate one guy from the psychology department gave a long spiel on rhine and parapsychology and scientific data for esp which convinced almost everyone babbit was the exception he was not only a chemistry major but a leading firebrand for the atheist club on campus and he knew damned well that esp was pseudoscientific balderdash and hocuspocus he spent the next day the twentythird in the library researching stage magic and in a biography of houdini he found the answer a simple substitution code now what watch what do i have locket can you tell photo and so forth fraud pure and simple like everything that goes under the name of religion or magic sirius shone very bright that night in the southern sky and mounty babbit was back at the carnival loaded for bear when the girl approached his part of the audience he handed her a prized and illegal possession a dragonheaded japanese condom tell me what i have been given by this person that wasnt in the houdini code but neither was a condom with or without a dragon head its against the law in this state cagliostro intoned somberly causing heads to turn and i would advise the young gentleman from antioch to restrain his sense of humor in the future and dont marry suzie from red lion the second voice wasandyetwasnt cagliostros mounty took quite a riding from the other students on their way back to yellow springs that night how did he know you were young how did he know you were from antiochwhere was that in the code christ a condomyou coulda got us all arrested but nobody said anything about suzie from red lion pennsylvania mounty finally forced the issue what was that business about the lion he asked with maximum indirection it was as he had feared nobody else had heard anything about a lion or about suzie it was simple logic then esp is fraud hearing voices in your head is insanity mountbatten babbit he told himself you are in need of psychiatric help but a psychiatric record would be a handicap in the career he already had mapped out for himself selfcontrol then was the answer nobody really goes bananas after all except weaklings a man like mountbatten babbit simply would not go mad but mountbatten babbit never did marry suzie from red lion there was a rather nasty war concluded with the exclamation point of a rather nasty bomb and then there was a marriage to a more suitably upwardmobile partner and eventually there was a title of chief engineer at weishaupt chemicals in chicago it was and he was no longer a brash young atheistscientist but a middleaged scientistbusinessman who knew enough to keep his mouth shut about controversial issues and steadily feed a growing sixfigure savings account he had it made if cagliostro didnt keep getting in the newspapers for one shocking incident or another babbit might even have been able to forget the whole episode in which he had thought he might be going mad then he crossed the boundary again a juvenile delinquent named franklin delano roosevelt stuart from the black ghetto on the south side stole mountys car from in front of the babbit residence in rogers park at precisely a moment when mounty was looking out the window in his trained and methodical way mounty memorized fifteen details about the boy as he ran out the front door only to catch the briefest glimpse of the car zooming away at least six feet blue sweater with turtleneck afro hairstyle very black skin nose more caucasian than negroid drives well face more narrow than norm high forehead no beard slim build to judge from shoulders ring on left hand with green stone clenchedfist button on sweater earring in right ear get more damn there he goes around the corner at the trial mounty pronounced his positive identification in the same tones he used specifying materiel orders at weishaupt chemicals the jury brought in a guilty verdict in five minutes that was the second time mounty went mad for as the boy was led away mounty glanced at him one more time and saw a blue halo form around his head just like in catholic art two weeks later he was promoted to vice president of weishaupt and began to see halos around random individuals in the street led led led if every case of aging can be corrected we might all be methuselahs living years or more dr robert prehoda a chinese named wing lee chee was cagliostros closest friend in those early carnival days wing was the worlds great master of karate kung fu aikido and comprehensive advanced machismo but a gentle soul when not pushed too hard in bad ass texas he got pushed too hard by local cops who objected to his use of the white toilet facilities at a gas station they told him a chink is just a yellowedout nigger roughed him up and accidentally knocked his right eye out in their enthusiasm at that point wing lost his temper and was subsequently apprehended and quickly tried and convicted for the murder of four police officers judge draconic v wasp

the value of the content when a people begin to cut down their trees without making any provision for reforestation you may be sure it is a sign of the beginning of their cultural degeneration furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go in the weeks following the car theft in mounty babbits luck at poker became so pronounced that he had to start losing by deliberation on occasion to avoid the suspicion of cheating halos were everywhere on earth ufos everywhere above i am a genuine mad scientist mounty babbit thought well nobody is ever going to know about it then a month later it all passed he didnt know what cards the other poker players had and he wasnt seeing halos he moved his family to evanston settled into his new job as vice president at weishaupt chemicals worked actively for the nixonagnew campaign and finally quit smoking the pickets outside the walls of weishaupt chemicals which was now the nations secondlargest producer of napalm were the only harassment in an otherwise perfectly satisfactory life the invasion as he came to call it began in early he was driving home from work came off lake shore drive onto sheridan crossed the howard street border into evanston and noted a large billboard with an eye atop a pyramid a teaser campaign he thought the reverse side of the dollar bill after a month or so of making people wonder the advertisers would add their slogan probably another friendly loan company the next morning he awoke in total horror he recalled the symptoms from some of the psychology books he had read back when he had feared for his sanity the activation syndrome thirst rapid heartbeat dizzy wobbles the body preparing for emergency what emergency he couldnt remember anything from the previous evening beside him mary lou snuggled closer my you were passionate last night she murmured affectionately i drove home i must have had dinner and i made lovebetter than usual it sounds like and i cant remember any of it microamnesia babbit kept a very close watch on himself in the following days not close enough evidently at the end of the month he found among the canceled checks returned by his bank one in the sum of to the chicago peace action committee this was the sentimental old ladies who often appeared with the raggedy students picketing weishaupt chemicals eat what you kill no more war dracula lives on blood too blessed are the peacemakers all those silly sentimental signs he had not written this check and yet the signature was his alone in his study with the bank book and checks mountbatten babbit wept he knew horror some alien entity had taken over his mind and written that check my god he thought i am possessed politics of the impossible the robot whose passport said frank sullivan landed at kennedy international on december and brought worth of hashish through customs without any trouble since the customs officials had orders from the cia never to interfere with him sullivan affixed his gas mask and hailed a cab which took him to the hotel claridge on fortyfourth street in rapid succession following a genetic script he took a quick shower shaved changed into his best suit went out for a slow stroll on fortysecond street and picked up a boy lounging outside the fascination pinball arcade they returned to sullivans room and the boy there received a slurpingly hedonic blow job for which he was paid the lad was then covered with rapturous kisses and compelled out of politeness to listen to an interminable monologue on the worlds injustices to ireland the villainy of england and the perfidy of the masonic jews more kisses followed the boy told a lugubrious story of poverty and legal problems sullivan coughed up more and the transaction was ended sullivan lounged on the bed for a while after the boy left discovered that another had disappeared from his wallet cursed mildly showered again and set out on his nights business another taxi delivered him to the signifyin monkey a nightclub on lenox avenue in harlem he checked his luger before getting out of the cab and darting across the sidewalk he knew what was likely to happen to melanindeficient persons on that street at that hour the maitre d recognized sullivan and made an almost imperceptible movement with his head sullivan ascended the stairs in the back knocked quickly three times then five times then three times more and was admitted to the private office of hassan i sabbah x ah said hassan the goodies from afghanistan have arrived a sordid commercial transaction followed distasteful to both partieshassan and sullivan each regarded himself as fundamentally a philosopher unwillingly forced to grub and hustle in the jungle of commerce nonetheless each bargained professionally and they were both quite happy by the time they came to the ritual of sharing one sample of the merchandise to seal their friendship anew you know hassan said when they were both floating i dont really believe youre ira thats funny said sullivan with a hash giggle i dont believe youre really cia either they both chortled happily having their keys complicated world said hassan getting more complicated every day pseudosullivan agreed benignly could you place a klee with a european collector a paul klee sullivan had heard clay originally and wondered if he were being asked to peddle pottery an honesttojesus klee original from his mescaline period i would say hold on to it a day or two sullivan said grandly ill have to make a few phone calls first he was thinking that hassan i sabbah x wore the most brilliantly maroon ties he had ever seen for that matter the rug danced with hues worthy of a sultans harem definitely superiorgrade hash he decided a door opened in the back of the office and another man stuck his head into the room he was a black man whitehaired gold spectacles rather conservative blue suit and vest sullivan automatically memorized his features and sent them through his computer to recordersandidentification oh pardon me the man said backing out but sullivanwho was not ira at all as hassan surmised but was cia at least parttimehad already come up with a make the man was george washington carver bridge one of the top scientists on project cyclops in the seventies now what was a man of that caliber doing skulking about the den of so large and carnivorous a mammal as hassan i sabbah x who was that he asked idly one of the boys hassan replied carelessly just one of the boys but sullivan went back to his hotel mulling over the perversities and paradoxes of the hashish state and the evermaddening question what is reality for his memory kept insisting that just before the door closed he had noted that the esteemed dr bridge was carrying in his hand the amputated penis of a white man we might wake up we mustnt sleep a wink all night or we might wake up changed invasion of the body snatchers after the day in when he found that he had written a check to the chicago peace action committee while in an altered state of consciousness mountbatten babbit decided once and for all that he would see a psychiatrist but not right away he would fight for selfcontrol first he realized that his mental condition was highly illegal esp in halos and esp together after that black kid stole his car now he was having blackouts in which he performed abominable acts that might threaten his security clearance and even his bank account that was absolutely terrifying anything that endangered the bank account must be a symptom of the most aggravated psychosis yes he would definitely absolutely irrevocably commit himself to psychiatric counseling but not right away he would fight for selfcontrol first one night the babbits had the moons from across the street as guests for dinner molly moon as usual got mary lou into a discussion of the occult all the usual hocuspocus and rubbish she was especially keen on some neon bal loon a tibetan monk who had allegedly transferred his consciousness into the mind of an englishman and was now writing books through the englishmans mediumship its just the beginning molly enthused our materialism has become a threat to the whole world sure more and more of the great masters will be taking over occidental bodies to bring us their wisdom directly mounty babbit concentrated on discussing the financing of an antidrug pamphlet with joe moon detective lieutenant on the evanston police even that was disconcerting it probably wont do any good joe said once rather bitterly the kids dont believe anything we tell them the next step into psychosis was unexpected and oddly pleasurable it occurred in the lunchroom at weishaupt a few days later babbit was pouring sugar into his coffee when he suddenly looked at the sugar dispenser the simplicity of the design the one small flap that opened to let the sugar pour abruptly delighted him it was as if he had never seen it before after that he was noticing more and more things in that heightened vision one day in the loop he saw a mother whirl suddenly and slap a whining child his heart leapt with shockand then he remembered that this was an everyday occurrence in america it was as if he had seen it from the perspective of some culture where whining and hitting were not normal communication between parents and children he wanted less and less meat in his diet meat now appeared heavy and hard to digest the strangest and most disturbing thing of all was the way weishaupt chemicals itself began to change but everything was the same he was just seeing with different eyes the contrast between the executive offices and the workshops was an overwhelming experience architecture coloring decoration upkeepevery kind of communication except words themselves said with total clarity the masters and the serfs the typical primate pack hierarchy unnoticed and taken for granted before strange visions came to him whenever his mind relaxed from financial or scientific problems he would be in a burning jungle running from helicopters that caused the burning or he would be in a temple with the eyeonthepyramid design practicing strange breathing exercises once he even had a namefed kingand he watched as one of his teachers burned himself to death in protest against the war he was fed xing seeing through the eyes of mountbatten babbit his monogamy which he usually succeeded in maintaining fiftyone weeks of the year was falling apart on him he worried that mary lou would be growing suspicious women turned him on constantly incessantly tormentingly as in early adolescence not all womenjust white women fed xing couldnt get enough of them he couldnt even get enough of any one of them even after an orgasm i would want to start again rubbing and caressing their moist pussies until they came a second time this excited me so much that i would often go down and suck them into a third orgasm then fed xing would ask them to suck him and drift off into aeons of tension and pleasure glimpsing the temple of the eyeonthepyramid occasionally even coming a second time himself which hadnt happened since he was in his early twenties the homosexual phase almost drove me to suicide but my esp i accepted it now knowing it was all hallucination of course but following it blindly being dragged along by it was both infallible and specific fed xing picked only men of babbits own status and importance and he was never wrong evidently there were more closet cases in the world than even kinsey had estimated i always took the male role coming in their mouths and would reciprocate by no more than masturbating them once when the partner was not merely an executive but a pentagon official i started laughing at his moment of ejaculation losing all control laughing louder and louder revealing the psychosis and not caring that night i looked at the tree in his yard and knew it was an intelligent being not with human intellect not with the mind of a dog or a rat or a fish even but with its own life and indwelling consciousness there was even a scientist in new york measuring the emotional reactions of plants with polygraph equipment and there it stood a blue spruce stranger in structure and more alien in intelligence than any creature in science fiction how can we live among so many wonders and not be overwhelmed by the sheer mystery of existence mounty babbit former atheist asked himself our knowledge is so small and our conceit is so great then he realized in horror that that was fed xing the buddhist thinking partners man will never be contented until he conquers death dr bernard strehler when murphy got into the car mendoza asked bad news murphy pulled out into the traffic carefully it must be bad mendoza said looking at murphys face they drove murphy stared straight ahead mans your partner mendoza said he shouldnt hide things from you malloy murphy said i got to go see marty malloy only hes got a new bug up his ass he only talks to one cop at a time shit on one at a time you let him pull that the next thing happens is he thinks he runs the police force marty a cheap hood like marty you never give him an edge on anything you know that tom let them get out of line and all of a sudden you got another jack ruby guy like that gets an edge he cant keep his mouth shut going around telling everybody about his friends the cops dropping in to see you at home you know when he takes his fall half the force falls with him your principal problem murphy said is that youre a dumb spic with a loud mouth me i dont take shit from any of them least of all from a marty malloy but this is different it sure is mendoza said i didnt know you so well id think you got a guilty conscience about something some hood off the street you can call him a spic anytime but not me just who the fuck you think you are all right that just slipped out you dont have to eat my ass about it all right shit first youre keeping secrets then im a spic now im the one whos being unreasonable this is being partners after ten years murphy turned onto van ness nobodys keeping secrets he said its just one of those what they call intangibles malloy doesnt have as much balls as a cockroach anymore i mean i know malloy pushing fifty getting shaky scared shitless of me for years now he doesnt fancypants not with me he doesnt he says he wont talk to anybody but me thats the way i play it this time around i keep telling you i know malloy they turned down geary okay mendoza said you know malloy hes got the whole solution to the kennedy assassination or something but i dont know what it is somethings come over you this last week tom clam up all you want a man cant be partners ten years without knowing joe murphy said its just i didnt want to talk about it some things a man just keeps a tight mouth about its my sister your sister the doctor thinks shes got cancer you know a man like me the wife dead family means a lot i been lighting candles for her at church tom mendoza said jesus tom im sorry your sister christ what can i say its okay joe partners its like being married in a way i should have known youd realize something was up a man like me something in the family he dont like to talk about it christ yeah which sister is that the one in la or the one up in mendocino oh the one in mendocino irene look she needs more money and you cant raise it thanks joe its not money her husband is loaded but thanks im glad i talked about it thats what a partner is for murphy parked near the corner of taylor you go down to gullivers have a cup of coffee he said ill join you after i get whatever it is malloy is selling partners mendoza said partners murphy replied warmly they shook hands inside out america is a white mans heaven and a black mans hell hassan i sabbah x hassan i sabbah x gave up on hashish he went to the safe and got out the lsd remembering using the transitional concept that the lock is a hole in the door through which one can exert an effort for a topological transformation one could turn the room into another topological form other than a closed box the room in effect was turned inside out through the hole remembering a lad of twelve having ivanhoe rammed down his gullet by the chicago public school system and walking out the door at pm to mingle with the junkies whores pimps thieves and assorted varieties of revolutionaries black panthers black p stone rangers acidelectrified weatherpeople who provided the real education in the hyde park neighborhood of the late s remembering the assassinations of malcolm and of martin luther king remembering the endless epic of stackerlee and the famous couplet i got a tombstone disposition and a graveyard mind im a black motherfucker and i dont mind dyin call this the first metaprogram it led hassan then called fdr stuart far outside the ghetto into an entirely new and different world it was easy by acting out the imperatives of the stackerlee black motherfucker script the boy earned a term in the audy home an institution for the further training of apprentice outlaws who slash tires on police cars heave bricks through school windows peddle merchandise from stores without first purchasing them and answer policemens questions with fuck you ya honky motherfuckn cocksucker fdr stuart received the standard audy home training which consists of sophisticated expert coaching in a sodomy b sadomasochism and c assorted crimes more lucrative than selling shoplifted merchandise he was after graduation ready for postgraduate work at springfield once he passed the admissions test which consists of being captured by the police while in the possession of something hot he was in possession of a ford mustang registered to a mountbatten babbit of evanston postgraduate work at springfield included a refresher course in sodomy and sm together with advanced study in grand larceny but by this time fdr stuart had begun to doubt that the stackerlee metaprogram contained the whole answer to lifes problems a former black muslim now a sufi was his cell mate and taught him various things about the lesspublicized qualities of the human nervous system fdr stuart spent many hours staring at one wall of his cell gradually creating a hole through which he could pass into another world there was a different kind of time over there and eventually he discovered that angels and fairies and elves and witches and bodhisattvas and conjurs and all sorts of superhuman folk could be contacted and persuaded to become allies the sufi cell mate a heavy cat in more ways than fdr stuart ever understood pretended to be unimpressed with this achievement and laid down some stern raps about the perils of opening the gate without first clarifying the soul the upshot of it was that young stuart spent an hour a day memorizing a page in the dictionary until he had a vocabulary that would grace a harvard graduate alas the sufi was paroled around then and stuart continued his explorations unguided in in harlem new york hassan i sabbah x was the horsethief of a group known as the cult of the black mother this was ostensibly devoted to the worship of kali goddess of destruction and rebirth the police suspected but couldnt prove that it was also a kingpin in international hashish smuggling the fbi meanwhile had their own suspicions they believed it was a black revolutionary army disguised as a church an army intelligence agent of appropriate negritude and duplicity managed to gain admission to one of the lower ranks but learned only that a horsethief was a term for head honcho or boss man borrowed from the gypsies b the rituals were fairly close to those of orthodox hindu kali worship except for certain masonic elements and c every time a black fbi agent managed to infiltrate the cult of the black mother he died very soon of a heart attack the last fact was well known and often discussed at the bureau the word witchcraft popped up at least once in each of these conversations and was quickly laughed down but each agent went away harboring his own very private opinions some of them even began attending the church of their choice even more often than was expected by the rather puritan standards of the bureau the cia which actually employed hassan i sabbah x as a spy on ghetto affairs was well aware that he planned to doublecross them at the first opportunity but that didnt worry them they had their own plans for him which were expressed in their usual jolly euphemism termination with maximum prejudice a remark illustrated by a finger drawn across the throat to make the meaning clear to neophytes but that was only for the future when he began to show signs of shifting allegiance now it is the night of december again while a miniature sled with eight tiny reindeer was allegedly dodging past commercial airliners communications satellites flying saucers and other technocraft in the skyways two human beings of reprehensible character drove up to the sutton place digs of mary margaret epicene wildeblood in a truck hired from uhaul only a few hours earlier these were edward j smith and samuel r hall and they had been purged from the black panther party a few months earlier because of their fondness for the nullcircuit neurological program induced by injecting diacetylmorphine chno directly into their veins this compound was known as heroin to white people and caballo to ed and sams puerto rican neighbors ed and sam called it horse and mainlined it as often as they possibly couldriding the horse over the rainbow was their expression for the null program and it meant as much to them as samadhi to a hindu or the eucharist to a catholic in fact it allowed them to forget for a while that to percent of their fellow citizens they were unmistakably identifiable as niggers a species generally regarded as twice as ugly and ten times as dangerous as wild gorillas it didnt matter to sam and ed that the people who believed this also believed in the existence of a gaseous vertebrate of astronomical heft named god in the virgin birth of us senators in the accuracy of tv news and in premarital chastity for women sam and ed also believed in the existence of the gaseous vertebrate the immaculate generation of senators the pictures on the tube and premarital chastity for at least some women their own sisters wives and daughters they also believed that they were twice as ugly and ten times as dangerous as wild gorillas but that they had a right to be that way they called it black pride once inside the wildeblood apartment ed and sam were as efficient as a pay of vacuum cleaners to say they took everything that wasnt nailed down is to underestimate their rapacity if something that looked valuable was nailed down they employed pliers and other tools when they finally drove away the uhaul truck was as stuffed with goodies as the miniature sled allegedly circling the skies at that moment when mary margaret wildeblood returned from her month in vermont she was heard to compare her condition to that of the chinese farmer in the good earth after the locusts had passed ed and sam drove directly to the sugar hill apartment of hassan i sabbah x which is not listed on the mailboxes and can only be reached through another apartment with the name lester maddox on it ed who knew this scene better than sam knocked white said a muffled voice from inside man ed replied native came the voice again born ed completed the formula the door opened and they were ushered into the home of a very respectable afromethodist clergyman who had never been publicly connected in any way with hassan i sabbah x what was that jive sam demanded password ed explained briefly borrowed from the ku klux klan the clergyman added with some glee he got himself one weird sense of humor brother hassan he ushered them into the kitchen slid the refrigerator around easily on specially built ball rollers and they passed through to an apartment that did not exist in anybodys records anywhere the air was heavy with the smell of indian hemp an enormous statue of kali the black mother dominated the room a group of black men sat in a circle and sam recognized two small cigarettes circulating in opposite directions which he called clockwise and counterclockwise not knowing the technical magical terms deosil and widdershins you will now ascend to the sixth plane without my guidance said hassan i sabbah x to the circle i am returning to the earth plane briefly aummmm aummmm came the blissful reply from the students hassan led sam and ed to another room whats all that sixthplane shit sam whispered to ed astral projection was the brief reply hassan seated himself at his desk and smiled genially been out celebrating the lords birthday he asked pleasantly expropriating the expropriators we got a fuckin truckload downstairs ed replied mmmmmm hassan said a merry yuletide indeed class merchandise from honkyville or were you ripping off our brothers and sisters again class sam said emphatically and a truckload hassan smiled dreamily why brothers if im as generous as my reputation you likely to end up owning more horse than the kentucky derby he pressed a button and another black man entered the room this was robert pearson by birth robert pearson phd according to the anthropology department at ucberkeley el hajj stackerlee mohammed during a militant period in the sixties clark kent with his supermen during his commercial rock music years and now robert pearson again accompany these cats to our warehouse and evaluate the cash value of their merchandise hassan instructed another trip brought ed and sam with pearson to a building on canal street bearing the legend bhavani imports here the truck was unloaded cataloged and priced a genuine klee or im a brass monkey pearson said once your uh client has bread as well as taste now whats this shit he said later scrutinizing a saccharine rendition of two naked boys preparing to dive into a swimming hole framed by a gingerbread copperplated oval oh well we can sell it as camp his sharpest reaction came when he confronted the redwood plaque bearing the ithyphallic eidolon jesus h christ on a unicycle he breathed sam and ed exchanged glances we cant figure that one out either sam ventured beats the hell out of our ass looks like some bozos joint ed suggested helpfully pearson put out an exploratory hand feels like some bozos joint he amended sure as shit aint plastic he shook his head wearily what i want to know is what kind of bozo would do this to his joint sam and ed shrugged he was a white bozo sam contributed finally i can see that pearson said a crazy white bozo he rolled his eyes heavenward lawd lawd he said in downhome accents the things that white folks do its just too much for this simple cullud boy skin cried sam skin pearson agreed they slapped palms and there the mystery rested until hassan i sabbah x arrived personally to inspect the new imports a few days later namu amida butsu he said peering closely sheeit where do you think we can sell it pearson asked dubiously that i do not know hassan i sabbah x pronounced slowly but when we do find a buyer the price will make your head swim this is a oneofakind item things were coming to a head the key was no key hassan had other things on his mind that weekend he was well aware that frank sullivan probably in his estimation a double agent for both washington and peking had recognized washy bridge and that opened a very wiggly can of worms indeed ever since washy had told him about project pan in fact hassan had felt increasingly like the sorcerers apprentice in the legend a line from an h p lovecraft story came back to his consciousness over and over again do not i beseech you call up any that you cannot put down like many another occultist before him hassan i sabbah x now wished he had taken that warning a bit more seriously a bit sooner even before he left bhavani imports he was startled by an incident that seemed a definite santaria synchromesh hey listen man an art appraiser cried catching his sleeve ive just heard the greatest limerick listen just listen a habit obscene and unsavory he broke down laughing caught himself and repeated urgently listen he tried again a habit obscene and unsavory holds the bishop of boston in slavery midst hootings and howls he broke down again then went on midst hootings and howls he deflowers young owls which he keeps in an underground aviary hassan looked at him with paranoid suspicion very funny he said unsmiling and hastened out to his limousine back uptown the chauffeur asked broad street hassan said giving an address he was in mild firstcircuit anxiety all the way to his destination he remembered his first conversation with washy bridge how many he had asked not in shock or in outrage but in simple unbelief inability to believe they are our creation we are their creation fiftyseven of us the scientist was perspiring with anxiety now that the secret was finally out the reason he had fled project pan fiftyseven hassan said hollowly heinz varieties he remembered absently from the advertisements and all of them with phds and mds and more diplomas than a dog has fleas youve got to realize it works washy said then you just cant understand if you dont keep that in mind it works and two hundred to three hundred years in jail for each of you if it ever gets out hassan added harshly you just better keep that in mind too thats why im here the scientist said hassan had paced the room briefly wheels within wheels he said once wheels within wheels within wheels once he grinned at least i know why the cincinnati cocaine market is thriving he said with a lewd chuckle cincinnati he repeated shaking his head what do they call it again knights of christianity united in faith a habit obscene and unsavory hassan remembered suddenly jostled back into present time he had arrived at his destination the man to whom he spoke then was a stockbroker according to public knowledge but pursued certain other careers in a private and clandestine manner frank sullivan hassan said i want to know everything about him everything the parttime stockbroker turned ashywhite he got up glared suspiciously at a window washer outside his office and walked over to check that the window was closed all the way impossible he said then in a near whisper if i told you the one most amusing and interesting fact about him id be dead tomorrow that hot hassan asked the man leaned back in his chair and gazed absently toward the ceiling he recited some names beginning with jack ruby of dallas and ending with a senator whose private plane had crashed just the week before on christmas eve those are just a few he ended who happened to find out too much about frank sullivan hassan spoke only once during the drive back to harlem secrecy he said with a profound grimace the chauffeur looked back nervously he had never heard so much obscene emphasis in a single word gwb he knows when you are sleeping he knows when youre awake within three days the storm had become a blizzard in most of the northeast and roy ubu was feeling snowed under in every sense of the phrase driving with extreme caution thinking that the new head of programming for the beast whatzisname moon really seemed to take some kind of fiendish pleasure in producing reams and reams of records to prove that the records were all defective the snow whipped ubu again as he parked and skittered into gwb to find moon once again cheerfully perusing printouts that demonstrated for the thirtythird time that every single one of the missing scientists had simply stopped leaving ink or magnetic tape traces sometime between summer and spring which was impossible in the age of bureaucracy it was like an animal not leaving footprints on a wet beach but the beast is supposed to know ubu had protested once gwb knows everything that has been recorded moon said patiently it does not know what has never been recorded you cant see behind your head gwb cant scan what was never recorded anywhere but dammit nobody can do anything in this country dammit without making a record nobody but these very elusive men and women moon replied placidly if youll notice i marked the bios where it deals with experience in programming seventyeight out of the have such experience they obviously learned a great deal about erase and cancel codes roy ubu made a despairing gesture how many bits can this thing access he asked wearily over one hundred twenty billion bytes simon said nearly a trillion bits theres never been an information system like this in all history he added with some pride but it has amnesia where these scientists are concerned ubu said bitterly the robot whose passport said frank sullivan was in washington that weekend and reported to a high official in naval intelligence who suspected him of being a double agent infiltrating them for air force intelligence after the usual sordid business was disposed of sullivan asked casually if ni had any interest in hassan i sabbah x good lord and aunt agnes no said the official emphatically congress will have our ass if we get into anything domestic then he asked elaborately disinterested what did you happen to pick up well if theres no real interest pseudosullivan gazed off into space absently there was a short silence if its something big the official said finally sullivan held out his hand another commercial transaction took place its about a government scientist named george washington bridge pseudosullivan began miskawhat roy ubu demanded miskatonic special agent tobias knight repeated heres their catalog he held up a booklet blazoned with a gothic sketch of book candle inverse pentagram and the motto miskatonic university founded ex ignorantia ad sapientam ex luce ad tenebras where the hell is that ubu asked new england somewhere in massachusetts ah here it is arkham massachusetts and how many of the were students there ubu was hot on the scent sixtyseven of them knight said triumphantly all in the classes of through by god its a live one ubu cried two or three might be happenstance even ten might be coincidence but jumpin jesus sixtyfuckinseven means something lets look into this miskatonic u and find out what was going on back there in to besides dope cause santa claus is coming to tooooooown gorilla theater mounty babbit took a walk in lincoln park one day in trying to relax and calm his mind every tree spoke to him the lions looked at him as a brother the nervous armadillo pacing its cage stopped to stare at him and he received clearly the message how did we get trapped in these ridiculous bodies we need bodies fed xing replied just as we need minds to function in this threedimensional continuum surely you remember that we are actually ndimensional oh yes the armadillo signaled how could i have forgotten socrates had his daemon mounty thought in despair jesus had the father in heaven elwood p dowd had his giant white rabbit harvey but why do i have to have a crazy vietnamese buddhist you make the napalm fed xing told him thoroughly agitated babbit wandered into the primate house not noticing the sign which said closed today there he saw two grimfaced men in green uniforms and a gorilla in a blue uniform going through a most remarkable pantomime one of the men would raise a sign saying we demand justice and the gorilla would then spray him with a can of shaving cream the other man would then feed the gorilla operant conditioning but what the hell even fed xing was confused by that one where the fuck the night watchman at bhavani imports a puerto rican poet and santaria initiate named hugo de naranja was reading a novel called illuminatus when the mysterious incident occurred hugo was so absorbed in the book which he considered the greatest novel since don quixote that he didnt notice the strange sound at first gradually the sound s persistence invaded his consciousness dragged him out of the most aesthetically exquisite blow job in all modern fiction jerked him into an alert awareness that out there in the darkness there was something odd going on rats he thought no the quick trot of rat paws was different a thief with soft slippers or in his stockings not that either hugo put down his book and picked up flashlight in left hand groping righthandedly and then finding pistol in holster something was going on in the vast darkness of the warehouse and he had to go and look for it and do something about it he wished he hadnt read so many womens lib diatribes against machismo and papa hemingway he wished he could still believe in the macho values he wished he had more cojones or another job then he walked out of his cubbyhole office flashing the light ahead of him and quoted to himself from his favorite philosopher the ordinary man has problems the warrior only has challenges then he saw the intruder a cat it was only a cat held for one moment in his lightbeam then skittering away into deeper darkness as the light raced after it then it was caught again higher up standing for christs sake on the ghastly amputated penis plaque its golden eyes glittering halfwhitely in the flashed lightray a cat standing on a penis something right out of surrealism or dada scat hugo shouted really amused now rrrow scat beat it then the cat leapt and hugos flash leapt after it jumping to the floor where it would should must didnt land the light moved back quickly swept several arcs while hugo was beginning to think christ it didnt make any sound when it landed not even a muffled cat thud and his beam swept back and forth again in searching arcs as the words formed it disappeared in midair were rejected it couldnt and the beam rested for a minute on the challengingly erect penis without a man what hijo de puta would do a thing like that and the question burst from his lips aloud the nightwatchmans vice of talking to himself which he had always resisted before where did it the fuck jump to where the fuck the dispossessed mounty babbit never did learn to live with fed xing in fact he eventually had a fullscale psychotic breakdown of course because of his wealth the doctors always referred to it as a catathymic crisis the breakdown occurred at a dinner party worse luck the moons were guests again and this time they had their nephew simona bearded young mathematician whose father had been the black sheep of the moon family a wobbly agitator simon himself had been arrested during the democratic convention riots the previous year but got off on probation everything went pleasantly enough until molly moon got on her obsession about oriental masters invading western bodies to pass on their transcendental mysticism joe moon must have noticed the look on mountys face because he said molly remember our host is a scientist and a taurus molly said quickly i know how hard it is for him to accept spiritual truths he doesnt bore you with the latest chemical shoptalk joe said gently im sure you dont have to bore him with all this astrology or whatever it is its not astrology its astral projection it sounds halfastral to me joe said laughing as loud as he could trying to get them all laughing and turn the topic into a joke young simon however had ideas of his own aunt molly might be right he said thoughtfully the einsteinrosenpodolsky paradox does lead to some freaky possibilities but why assume only the high adepts are coming every primitive group in the world has some kind of magical tradition and theyve tried everything else to get out from under white domination now dont start with your radicalism joe warned im not talking politics simon said innocently everywhere in the world there are people whod like to change places with us live in our rich homes eat our extravagant diet drive our cars we know a lot about the spacetimematter continuum but were more ignorant than asia or africa about spacetimemind continuum how about the native americans for that matter wouldnt their magicians love to take over some white bodies for a while is that why so many young people are wearing indian headbands taking indian drugs like peyote moving out of the cities into the woods ever have your car stolen by a black kid from chicagos ghetto wouldnt they like to steal your body too thats nonsense molly moon said angrily all those backward people youre talking about couldnt learn the higher spiritual arts mounty youre a scientist joe moon said imploringly tell simon whats wrong with his theory anybody can spin theories babbit said carefully science is a matter of proof you can make up a million and one theories simon but if you go to work for a corporation youll have to produce theories that engineers can use the one theory out of a million that can be proven everything else is just idle speculation exactly joe moon beamed delighted let the coons earn the right to live in evanston i say well this theory could be checked out simon went on guilelessly but babbit knew he was baiting everybody if such an uh invasion were occurring it would be aimed at people with important positions business executives government officials the people who control the media check them out and see if theyre all growing a little bit weird lately the helicopter descended and the earth turned to flame my daughter ran toward me burning screaming why was it an american flag on the helicopter instead of a swastika was it galley or eichmann who was looking at me with imploring eyes begging my understanding and forgiveness day after day the napalm fell from the skies day after day children died screaming at centigrade month after month year after year the fire continued to consume the world fed kings world he sat in the lotus his shakti mounted on his penis their eyes locked until the neurological synergy occurred they were one and then the others were there too all the minds of spacetime who turned on the neuroatomic circuit the beetle intellects of betelgeuse nicholas and perenella flamel bruno and elizabeth cagliostro and as the time warp opened galaxy after galaxy joined in the starmaker appeared dimly and the first jump was possible he was a flower on a rose bush in england and a poet was staring at him as he stared back at the poet the roses have the look of flowers that are looked at emerged from that moment she was a microbe flailing tentatively in a soupy ocean he was a terran archivist looking back at the decline and fall of the american empire she was mountbatten babbit in evanston illinoisa good one grab quick this was one of the murderers hold on mountbatten babbit phd became aware that everybody at the table was staring at him then he realized that he was sobbing oh god he said a mind at the end of its tether oh god god god it was explained as a breakdown due to overwork there was no psychiatrist ambition forbade the risk so a clinical psychologist of behaviorist orientation was found on the faculty of northwestern university and the visits were listed as consultation in social psychology for business management mounty and the psychologist defined fed xing as a hallucination caused by the negative conditioning of the pacifist pickets surrounding weishaupt chemicals a method of deconditioning was worked out using hypnosis and aversion therapy against all manifestations of the fed xing persona the aversive stimulus was apomorphine a nonaddicting morphine derivative that provokes vomiting and sensations of death at first fed xing would speak directly at these moments begging and pleading dont send me back to the flames later he became defiant well be back millions of us from all over the third world living in your fat white bodies running your corporations and bureaucracies all through the seventies and eighties well be back as the theory of aversion therapy predicts fed xing was finally extinguished safely established beyond freedom and dignity mounty babbit became the ideal conditioned subject in he resigned his position as president of weishaupt chemicals to become special scientific advisor to the white house another eigenstate that which is forbidden is not allowed john lilly the center of the cyclone o how money makes me hum o how money makes me hum o how money makes

the last remaining citizen of manhattan with a sense of civic duty one james mortimer came around the corner at just that moment james mortimer carried a police whistle at all times since he knew he was living in a stillviolent society he blew several blasts loud and shrill pablo gomez fled without getting any money and an ambulance arrived in time to rush benny to the hospital and save his life the rooms were turned inside out the nervous breakdown as it was called of hassan i sabbah x did not attract much attention the cult of the black mother had never been as well publicized as the nation of islam or the black panthers the new york newstimespost actually referred to hassan as a wellknown nightclub owner in harlem in their very brief story and their reporter hadnt even investigated far enough to learn that hassan was also the head of a cult with more members than the missouri synod lutherans but then the cult of the black mother had never been publicityminded even the amsterdam news unaware of its membership described it as a small church hassan had been delivered to bellevue in a state of raving mania under physical restraint by two of his former aides the psychiatrists quickly pronounced him paranoid schizophrenic and prescribed the heaviest tranquilizer then available which in fact kept him fairly drowsy even when he wasnt comatose nonetheless when able to summon the energy to rise out of his lethargy and talk again he would monotonously repeat to any other inmate or orderly who came near look i dont belong here something terrible has happened im really the president of this fucking country and so on with endless elaborations and details a deeply defended psychosis the psychiatrists decided and began a course of electroshock treatments whenever the flippedout black came out of his daze however he would begin the same schizzy ranting all over hey listen im the president of this fucking country the electroshock was stepped up hassan retreated into a permanent daze and ceased to annoy anybody by this time his brain had been fried to the consistency of a white tower scrambled egg and his impressions of the external world were mostly olfactory and aural like those of a subnormal toy poodle he no longer argued about anything since he no longer understood such abstract concepts as ego persistence or identity the psychiatrists were satisfied if you cant cure a nut their tacit motto was at least you can keep him from running around the ward annoying people two fbi agents later discussed the matter privately you think cia did it asked the first tobias knight you figure hed been working for them the other roy ubu asked in return i always had that notion myself but why would they fuck his head like that when god only knows what he might spill to somebody whod get released from the nuthouse and repeat it to a reporter nah cia doesnt work that way theyd just he drew a finger across his throat i dont believe in coincidences knight said stubbornly somebody got to him something ubu corrected with a sinister intonation you know as well as i do what he was a witch voodooist knight corrected whatever everybody we ever sent in died of a heart attack right ubu looked over his shoulder officially the bureau doesnt believe in witches but ill tell you what happened to mr hassan i sabbah x in my opinion he called up something that he couldnt put down the lock is a hole dr francis dashwoodneat clean rich and not yet fortydrove into the grounds of the orgasm research foundation on van ness in san francisco at precisely in the morning he checked his wristwatch again after he parked his sleek mg in the executive parking lot it was excellent a quick trot and he was at his desk before the office clock reached nine once again he had demonstrated the punctuality analretentive personality silly prescientific freudians called it which had contributed so much to raising him to his present high position in the medical research bureaucracy of the united states frank dashwood md lld phd at the age of only thirtyeight headed the most heavily funded and hotly debated institution in the world orgasm research a multimilliondollar project dedicated to filling in the psychological intangibles left out of the pioneering research of masters and johnson two decades earlier since these psychological intangibles wereas dr dashwood sometimes wittily remarkedboth psychological and intangible there was no end to the research meanwhile the funding money came rolling in frank was according to a survey by a management analyst one of the seventeen men in the united states who was totally happy with his job other researchers sometimes expressed envy of this fact what redblooded man one of them had once asked with some warmth wouldnt be happy supervising other peoples orgasms and pulling down a swift sixty grand a year for it this was somewhat unfair to a dedicated scientist dr dashwood was truly fascinated by orgasmsas edison was by electricityand had an inexhaustible curiosity about every possible factor involved in every possible twitch itch moan gibber gasp sob shudder or howl connected with that dramatic biological tremor even more however he was mesmerized by lines curves averages graphs and every aspect of mathematics that could be clearly visualized the world for him was not made up of things crude disneyland animations projected by our lower nervous circuits but of energy meshes with no knowledge of zen buddhism he intuitively shared sixth patriarch hui nengs vision that from the beginning there has never been a thing dr dashwood lived in a universe of transactions that could be written as equations and traced on graph paper above his desk was a motto suggested ironically by a skeptical friend dr dashwood saw nothing funny about it and adopted it as his own banner science pure science and damned be he who first cries hold too much as he settled himself at his desk he observed that ms karrige his secretary had already poured his coffee for him fine the girl femperson he corrected was really getting broken to the harness he whipped out his thermometer and measured the black liquid in the cup degrees excellent she was learning to meet his exacting demands dr dashwood could not abide inexactitude or slovenliness in any human activity a thing worth doing he would explain to his subordinates is worth doing right he said this often and malicious members of the staff said it even more often when he was out of earshot with a tone and a facial expression that were caricatures of his own with a smile on his lips and a glint in his eye frank dashwood buzzed ms karrige whats first for today he asked cheerfully the jabberwock was growing the key was no key funny valentine megalithic monuments were certainly not places of worship but places of refuge for people fleeing the advance of mud furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go while dr dashwood was pressing his buzzer in san francisco starhawk was carefully screwing two mountain climbers hooks into a hill across the bay in oakland the first rope was wrapped around his waist outside the trousers ran through a pulley and came back to his hand the second rope circled his chest ran through the second pulley and was secured to a tree he began lowering himself down through the redwoods at first there was no visibility at ground level but as he descended the roof of murphys house a bit of yard came into view none of the neighboring houses was visible at all approaching murphys roof starhawk slowed and then stopped his descent in midair he turned every muscle straining and continued his descent headfirst legs tightly together the style of a professional highdiver a small film of perspiration formed around his lips he was totally silent twice redwood branches almost tangled his ropes he remained totally silent while disengaging finally he gripped the roof edge with his left hand let out more slack with his right and lowered himself until he was looking in the corner of a window upside down it was the bedroom murphy wasnt there the bed was unmade starhawk raised himself swung and descended again to inspect another window the living room murphy was sitting in a red plush chair his face expressionless he was listening to music on the stereo a shotgun leaned against the wall behind him very slowly starhawk raised himself again and swung to the next window in five minutes totally silent he was sure that there was nobody in any of the other rooms he slowly raised himself again and found a perch in a redwood that commanded a view of the front yard and doorway he waited the music from the stereo drifted up to him peggy lee was singing my funny valentine after waiting fortyfive minutes starhawk descended again murphy was no longer in the living room the shotgun was missing also the fuck starhawk muttered he swung carefully over to the bedroom window the shotgun rested against the wall beside the closet murphy came out of the closet and picked up the shotgun again careful man that murphy never go anywhere without your shotgun when youre holding maybe half a million in hot snow murphy looked quite happy now he looked like the happiest man starhawk had ever seen starhawk returned to his perch in the redwood tree murphy had obviously taken a snort of the coke and was probably feeling like luke skywalker heading for the death star starhawk waited silently it was good to know where the cocaine was a few minutes later a squirrel came along an overhead branch and almost walked over starhawks rope he stopped frozen unable to believe that a human being was way up here in the tree starhawk and the squirrel stared at each other both immobile then the squirrel ran starhawk smiled he went on waiting quietly first mammalrobot dyad dr dashwood buzzed ms karrige whats first for today he asked cheerfully eager to plunge directly back into the thick of things as was typical of him on monday mornings the uh colored gentleman from new york came the tinny voice on the intercom send him right in frank said eagerly robert pearson was dressed in his dealing with the straight establishment clothes which meant that he looked like the black equivalent of a mafia don moving in on a legit corporation you had to look twice to realize that he was too resplendent to appear really conservative you really have the um merchandise dr dashwood asked i wouldnt waste your time otherwise pearson said carefully and its not flaccid i can get them in flaccid statefrom johns hopkinss sexchange department by the gross this must be totally erect and i cant imagine how you managed that pearson removed a package from his briefcase see for yourself he said dr dashwood spent several minutes examining the ghoulish trophy pearson sat back and lit up a black sherman cigarette he was wondering just how surprised dashwood would be if he mentioned his own longago phd or his career as lead guitarist with clark kent and his supermen he was just another black gangster as far as dashwood knew or cared its real dr dashwood said finally a beautiful specimen he added with total scientific detachment then he looked directly at pearson with unblinking curiosity you either have a friend with a truly desperate need for money or an enemy who now knows what it means to rouse your anger he commented mildly the haggling over money began at that point pearson left on the noon flight to new york bearing which later found its way to afghanistan and came back in the form of bricks of pure hashish dr dashwood meanwhile was in moqthe multipleorgasmquotient laboratorymaking certain technical adjustments on the ace equipment acefor artificial coital equipmenthad been devised by the mastersjohnson team and allowed a plastic imitation penis containing microphotographic devices to stimulate the inside of a vagina while obtaining clear photographic evidence of the actual physiological changes occurring therein orgasm research had used the same model in their investigation of moqthe endeavor to find out precisely how many orgasms a multiply orgasmic woman could actually have without untoward side effects it was dashwoods conviction that the physiological data being already determined a real penis was more practical now but a yearlong search for the oncefamous cuban superman had failed to locate the stalwart stud those bloody puritanical commies have probably rehabilitated him into more socially useful work dashwood concluded mournfully now at last with the relic of wildebloods quantum jump across the gender gap attached to ace dashwood had the ideal scientific instrument to measure moq a subject had been obtained via ads placed in underground newspapers throughout the state of california what do easterners know about fancy fucking dashwood asked ruling out everybody on the other side of the rockies all that part of the country he firmly believed was a puritans heaven and a hedonists hell the ad said bluntly sexpot wanted we are not making porny movies we are not kinks or creeps this is a serious scientific project if you think you qualify and would like to earn write box san francisco in strict confidence weeding out unlikely prospects had been timeconsuming and somewhat wearying although a few had set some interesting records with the old plastic ace apparatus the subject selected to have the trial run on the new reincarnated ace was a ms rhoda chief vocalist with a rock group called the civic monster known to critics as the best heavy rock singer since janis joplin rhoda was originally renowned back in the sixties for her own curious mutation of oldfashioned dixieland scat singing what few realized was that her riffs were not mere jabberwocky but actually fragments of the enochian keys used by dr john dee mr aleister crowley and other magicians people who came out of civic monster concerts seeing auras hearing strange voices catching odd fugitive glimpses into fairyland and oz or seeing the djinns gathered about the throne of allah attributed this to the heavy marijuana fumes always circulating in the air at rock concerts what rhoda herself saw during those moments was a secret between herself and her occasional lover in that decade the controversial stage magician cagliostro the great rhoda had gained another reputation in the s that chick gives head better than anybody in show biz it was often said in high society but this rumor had not reached the aseptic scientific world in which dr dashwood moved twirling his dapper bow tie debonairly francis dashwood physician and scientist strode down the hall to laboratory three rhoda chief already nude but with a single sheet demurely spread over her full and obviously stillglorious body smiled brightly as she saw the doctor wheres ace she asked cheerfully weve been making some improvements dashwood said with professional unction you might find todays research a distinct improvement over the test runs last week the sheet slipped a bit revealing several inches of round tense breast you mean a biggersize gizmo on it i already been through the errol flynn the primo camera and the king kong these were technical slang for various models of robot dildo what a fantastic piece of hot lustful woman she was frank thought irrelevantly despite his scientific attitude he felt himself secretly longing for the moments ahead when the sheet would finally be swept aside to reveal that incredible body which had appeared in his dreams twice over the weekend with an effort he resumed his professional manner no he said quietly no larger sizes the king kong is the biggest we have in stock today is something entirely new we are using the real thingbut still attached to the ace machine so you can control it as always calibrating speed and depth of thrust and so forth to your own special requirements ah here it comes now a technician wheeled in the new improved ace apparatus rhoda sat up staring in frank astonishmentand the sheet slipped another inch revealing that gorgeous right nipple like a chocolate gumdrop frank thought not for the first time he cursed the professional ethics which would ruin his career if he ever touched one of his experimental subjects the technician who always insisted on being called jonesy or rnhis real name was richard nixon jones but he kept that a careful secret and never sent mothers day cardswheeled the ace over to the bed and affixed it at the proper angle it looked like a sciencefiction version of the great god baphomet the pink phallus seemed extraerotic amid the sculpted white plastic of the machine dangling a few inches above the venusian bush slightly visible through the thin white sheet all set jonesy said stiffly and retreated to the door he had never quite gotten over his initial embarrassment at working for orgasm research rhoda chief reached out a tentative hand and felt ulysses hovering above her midsection there was a pause dashwood watched her hand moving along the pink shaft in imagination he vividly felt the same hand groping with his trousers i am a professional he reminded himself sternly well he said anytime youre ready its for science rhoda said hoarsely thats right for science take the sheet off me she whispered i cant do that frank said straining to avoid a break in his voice his eyes on the crotch beneath the sheets oh yes she said i forgot there was another pause for science he said gently for science she agreed slowly she pushed down the sheet revealing those globes that had twice tormented his sleep she must be at least a fortytwo he thought and who ever saw such enormous nipples before then with more determination she pushed the rest of the sheet off the bed in one quick motion she was as sweet a sight as dawn itself dr dashwood thought fleetingly of how fourier series combine to produce on occasion perfect sine waves valley and crest valley and crest in a harmony that was like the signature of intelligence and grace a contemporary pop novelist might say she had a figure that would make the pope kick a hole in a stainedglass window rhoda chief one of the trillions of multicellular bioesthetic models worked out by the dna during its three and a half billion years design work on this planet was only five feet two inches tall but in that space were the breasts of babylonian goddesses the trim waist of a petty girl the pubic bush that titian strove so hard to paint the legs of venus kallipygios dr dashwood who sought always to uncover significant form and did not know that clive bell had once defined art in those two words responded both cortically and phallically were it not for his scientific discipline he would have knelt in worship to present her the pentecostal gift of tongues um you can use it on the clitoris first gently to lubricate yourself he said feeling like a ninny im lubricated already rhoda said in a strangled voice and moved the handle which spun the wheel which thrust ulysses into the house where love lived her eyes frank noted were still open for a second but completely out of focus then she closed them and began pulling the handle rhythmically frank began jotting rapidly nipples fully erect at twentythree seconds sexflush on breasts and neck at thirty seconds subject says jesus quite clearly at thirtysix seconds ulysses as the scientist was writing was creating a neurological uproar in ms rhoda chief the mammalian study unit in the first robotmammal sexual dyad as the rejected stone in wildebloods cathedral became the cornerstone in rhodas consciousness she felt as if she were floating and allowed her left hand to run down her body over her breasts down over her belly into the garden of nuit rhythmically in time with the hot fast thrusting motion of the shaft of priapus she rubbed her bush while the other hand slowly increased the thrusting motion in her minds eye she was simultaneously enjoying a second penis in her mouth not all witches are cocksuckers but all cocksuckers are witches whether they know it or not rhoda knew it her reputation for eating peter like no chick since cleopatra was not unconnected with the versatility of her singing and other personality traits then ace was talking in the gentle slightly gay tones of hal the whackedout computer in to the center of the galaxy he was saying this is the center of spacetime and it is also the center of your womb darling rhoda his soft purr went on as he thrust deeper into her it is way way out and it is also way way in you can only enter this mystery on vibes of sheer ecstasy because all matter at a lower vibratory rate gets destroyed in the black hole so in order to navigate this dangerous crossing i must fuck you even more deeply my darling oh do it ace do it to me good she murmured i want to see the center of the galaxy there there he purred youll see the center of the galaxy when your pretty little cunt gets hot enough take me she moaned take me to the center of spacetime and deep deep into the cosmic vaginal barrel and deep deep into the spiral of her moist galaxy ace piloted her slow permutations like the growth of crystals her sensations were hardly contaminated any longer by thought or vision deep deep they went down into a cavern of strange floral energies each petal shape tingling with the languid joydance in the petals of her own warm pussy happiness is a warm pussy she remembered the shaft of the actual ace machine digging deeper and deeper into the starry dynamo oh ace oh ace you fuck so divinely she gasped its the only way to travel he crooned electronically oh keep fucking me keep fucking me please please fuck the universe fuck every atom turn the cosmic key in the galactic black hole fuck and fuck and fuck my god my baphomet fuck forever fuck the flowers and the starlight and thunder and rain fuck heaven and hell too dr dashwoods face had a curious ashywhite color he wanted to leap upon the bed throw the ace machine to the floor and take her his erection was pulsating and his vision was red with pain and need fuck the am a he muttered thickly lurching forward just then the phone rang surprise party a car stopped about a hundred yards down the road from murphys house starhawk quickly began untying his ropes listening intently in a few moments he heard them two or three men coming through the woods they were very silent for white men starhawk free of the ropes began to move across the trees the men stopped starhawk waited they still didnt stir starhawk moved again without a sound the men were still unmoving he closed in on them remaining always about thirty feet above the ground until he found them three men sitting quietly two of them smoking waiting starhawk moved back toward the house always testing each branch carefully before thrusting it two mourning doves began to sing a sad little duet starhawk waited ten feet above the roof hidden in the redwood the three men in the woods waited inside the house the phone rang the men in the woods who couldnt possibly have heard it began moving again starhawk smiled for the second time that day and glanced at his watch it was exactly half past ten murphy on the phone was probably insisting on a meet in downtown oakland some congested street corner he had already picked where a double cross would be too risky for all parties careful man that murph hed come out the door with the coke under his arm thinking how careful he was and the surprise party would be waiting in the bushes with their guns starhawk moved quickly to a new perch carefully he pulled up his trouser leg tore the adhesive tape and took a pistol from his calf he was not smiling now cheese robert pearson said sheeit in a tone of profound skepticism he was watching the tv hearings on the nomination of rockwell morgan squeeze for vice president squeeze was an oil millionaire famous for such monumental parsimonies as installing pay phones in his mansion so guests couldnt run up his phone bill and bringing his lunch to the office in a paper bag for forty years he was being quizzed about his generous contributions to seven out often of the senators on the committee investigating him now i resent that rockwell was saying thats a very nasty word senator bribe indeed well just what would you call it asked the senator one of the three who hadnt received rockwells largesse i regard it this way mr squeeze said unctuously if i had a lot of cheese and i looked around and saw a lot of mice without any cheese of their own well it would be the normal generous thing now wait a minute i smell a rat the senator interrupted sheeit pearson said again the door buzzer was humming when pearson opened the door he was greeted by a whiff of violets even before he saw the man pointing the water pistol at him and when he awoke a day later and with rockwell squeeze approved by the committee with a vote that stoodcoincidentally no doubtat to he was in a basement surrounded by men with canvas bags over their heads and his genitals were wired up to some electrical apparatus sheeit he said again and closed his eyes concentrating furiously on the formulas hassan i sabbah x had told him the men from naval intelligence began pouring electricity into pearsons penis and trying to extract information from his mouth two procedures that usually worked well together it was quite irritating when they were unable to learn anything about george washington bridges link with the cult of the black mother and perplexing when pearson began to insist that he was rockwell m squeeze vice president of the united states it was revolting when they finally realized that he wasnt playacting and really believed he was rockwell m squeeze by then his whang was charred to a gruesome extent and his obvious insanity was hopeless they smothered him with a pillow and left they were all very nice men when their duty did not call upon them to perform such regrettable tasks a carnival of loonies i am not what i am iago in bacons othello the fbi finally found gwc bridge living in a flophouse in miamis ghetto having learned something from naval intelligences bungling in the cases of hassan i sabbah x and robert pearson they moved in with great delicacy a black agent was employed to form a friendship with him over a period of a month weird cat the agent reported after a week seems to be hiding something all the time cant make him at all he reported the second week if i didnt know better id say he was a white reporter in blackface trying to find out what its like to be black in fact bridge seemed more than a little bit psychotic in a methodical sort of way he read no less than six newspapers a day and clipped numerous stories from them the agent eventually had a chance to investigate these files while bridge was visiting a patient in a nearby madhouse and they were rather oblique they all concerned very important persons in government and industry but that was about all they had in common bridge seemed to have a minute curiosity about the men who rule america that was all that was evident the agent could make nothing at all of the crazy notes scribbled on the margins of these news stories possible probable still himself definitely occupied the mystery grew worse when the agent realized that bridge spent a lot of time visiting madhouses and psychiatric wards sure knows a lot of crazy people he reported the third week a hell of a lot of crazy people he amended at the end of the month another team of agents began revisiting the nuthouses and it was soon realized that the patients bridge visited had a few things in common viz none was white but not all were black some were oriental indian or chicano all without exception were diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic with delusions of grandeur all were listed as chronic rather than acute psychotics all claimed to be somebody else rather than who they actually wereone said he was secretary of commerce one that he was chairman of the board of morgan guaranty trust one that he was chief engineer at cape kennedy etc the agents remembered their experience with robert pearson former aide to hassan i sabbah x and jumped to a conclusion that crazy church drove them all nuts and made them think they were white people alas a little checking refuted this easy assumption most of the loonies bridge had visited had no previous connection with the cult of the black mother at all things were coming to a head three minutes forty seconds that which exists is allowed john lilly the center of the cyclone when murphy came out the front door ed goldfarb in the bushes shot him twice with mendozas police special murphy thrown back against the door was reaching into his shoulder holster his mouth open still alive the two shots hung in the empty mountain air echoing thomas esposito fired at murphy and missed as murphys hand slowly and steadily came up firing at goldfarb goldfarb fell back hit the echoes still rolled across the hills mama mama goldfarb said rolling around holding his stomach he was weeping the third man juan ybarra ran from the bushes to murphy murphy was trying to raise the gun again he was looking at ybarra and trying to point the gun his eyes were totally mad and would not focus anymore esposito was trying to shoot at murphy again with ybarra in the way he had an erection and his hands shook goldfarb continued to weep the shots were still echoing birds were rising from the trees flapping their wings noisily twittering with anxiety a crow cawed angrily murphys gun hand dropped his mad eyes went empty mama goldfarb screamed im sorry esposito and ybarra ran lithely down the hill mama goldfarb wept not me please im sorry the birds swept down the hill flapping a black mustang came up the hill esposito and ybarra leapt out and ran around to the back and opened the trunk compartment not me please goldfarb was protesting esposito and ybarra lifted detective mendoza gagged with adhesive tape out of the trunk and carried him onto the lawn he was dazed but his eyes were aware and frightened esposito ran over to murphy and took his gun standing there he fired twice into mendozas head he put the gun back in murphys hand ybarra tore the adhesive tape off mendozas mouth it came away bloodstained goldfarb stopped crying and was still ybarra retched almost puked caught himself he stood whitefaced breathing hard esposito picked up murphys package a brown paper bag he opened it found a box within raised the lid he inserted a finger and tasted the jew he said ybarra looked at him shaking get on the stick esposito said we cant leave the jew he doesnt fit ybarra stood looking at him come out of it esposito said help me with the jew they carried goldfarb into the back of the car they drove off starhawk landed lightly on the lawn running as he alighted he ran into the house and to the bedroom he found what he expected in the closet another box and tasted it he ran softly on the balls of his feet back outside he leapt caught the roof and pulled himself upward he disappeared into the trees the two dead men sprawled on the lawn birds began to return elapsed time since

had managed to create a committee to nuke the whales something that appealed to a lot of richwingers purely and simply on the grounds that it would make the econuts and liberals scream the committee was an outstanding success after only a year it had fortytwo members this was enough together with such an outrageous cause to get maximum media attentionchaney was aware that anything however small can get the eye of the media if its repulsive enoughand the econuts and liberals were screaming good but now for something equally abominable on the other side chaney contemplated the radical lesbians wistfully he felt like voltaire contemplating god if the radical lesbians hadnt existed he would have had to invent them but what could he offer along those lines to balance the committee to nuke the whales the child molesters liberation front that couldnt begin to compete with figs newtons necrophile liberation front the council of armed cocaine abusers nobody would believe it the midget suddenly remembered the council of armed rabbis he had used in his letter to dr frank dashwood of orgasm research he had meant to follow up on that gaining access to heavily guarded nuclear plants to tamper with the coolant systems had kept him so busy lately that he had almost forgotten the damnable dashwood and his shitheel statistics chaney was awake most of the night planning a campaign to bring quantum wobble into dashwoods charts and graphs when he finally slept his tiny body curled into the orgonomic spiral and he looked as innocent as a schoolboy he awoke in the morning full of piss and vinegar the sea the sea waving their long green hair the sea hags were calling him finding a darklit bar he ducked into the phone booth attached his blue box equipment and soon had a washington operator convinced he was a white house official on important business this is a call from the white house the operator told the secretary at orgasm research the president is waiting on another line he wishes to talk to dr dashwood at once iill put you through at once said ms karrige quite awed and flustered the midget listened in glee as the phone rang fffrank dashwood came the doctors voice rather breathlessly this is ezra pound of the fair play for bad ass committee the midget said shifting his story now that he had the victim on the line your name has been given to us as a leader of the scientific community and quite frankly we are looking for all the distinguished support we can get for our next fullpage ad in the sunday newstimespost i assume youre aware of the plight of bad ass he said significantly bluffing of course but with some assurance since every place in the world had some plight or other by oh yes of course dr dashwood said evasively why dont you send me your literature and ill give it a careful reading doctor the midget said sternly if you were living in bad ass wouldnt you want action now well undoubtedly but if youll just send me your literature oh ace darling darling a female voice near the phone said distinctly there was a startled pause the midget deliberately let it drag out until the doctor spoke again er mark the envelope to my personal attention you can be sure that the bad ass crisis has been very much on my mind terrible simply terrible but ah now i must be back to my business fuck my cunt ace oh fuck my cunt doctor the midget said sternly are you fornicating while youre talking to me is that your answer sir to the desperate people of bad ass now now the voice screeched oh jesus jesus jesus now beautiful the midget thought i couldnt have called at a better time dr dashwood he said stiffly i dont think you are really the sort who will add stature to the fair play for bad ass committee he hung up jarringly beautiful absolutely beautiful he set off for the post office and stage two of his campaign smiling all the wayexcept once when he encountered one of the giant women walking her enormous saint bernard and he

scanning the beasts memory banks for the chicago police there seemed to be two possible totals for the number of police officers in chicago simon was intrigued he began searching all the chicago police records what he found was so interesting that he mentioned it to clem cotex whom he happened to be meeting for lunch that day cotex was not concerned with things as mundane as police records so it took a while before he heard what simon was saying hold it clem said when it finally registered did you say yes exactly simon said there are pay vouchers for officers less than there are uniforms for in other words there are cops in chicago who arent being paid weird huh one hundred ninetyeight cotex repeated eyes wide the exact number were they all over the department these extras or were they clustered thats even stranger simon said theyre all in the red squad that same day markoff chaney was hiding in a coffee urn at orgasm research hatching further mischief the clock struck midnight the cleaning women left and out crept chaney with an evil grin alas he was not the only intruder that night for as he padded lightly down the hall he suddenly heard a hoarse voice in one of the laboratories better than human are you you amping amper better than human my amp take this you eating er the voice was near inarticulate with rage but it was clearly that of a jealous male as any ethologist would easily recognize markoff slowly opened the door and peeked around the corner there in the dim light fully dressed and in his wrong mind stood the idol of millions the worlds leading

he planned to call it when his wife staggered in from the kitchen whitefaced but with a devilish grin honey she said coaxingly come see what the cat dragged in now it so happened that the columnist was like most writers in capitalist society abominably underpaid and like hassan i sabbah x he knew a oneofakind item when he saw it this he pronounced will bring a pretty penny when i find the right buyer he found the right buyer at police court only two nights later when a tip informed him that the notorious eva gebloomencraft had been arrested again this time for putting laughing gas in the airconditioning system at a benefit concert for the epileptic liberation front the infamous eva did not get called right away the columnist had to sit through a dreary hearing on a black man who had caused a riot in a bar throwing sixty fits and screaming that only a few minutes ago he had been a white atomic scientist at los alamos when this obvious lunatic was finally removed from the court in a straitjacket still shouting atomic secrets which he had evidently learned somewhere in the early stages of his delusion evas case was called ms gebloomencraft the only daughter of the most defiant

cheese and pepperoni and black olives and sliced red peppers and anchovies for antipasto then he ate beef fillets in parmigiana and a side of lasagna drinking occasionally from the chianti glass he did not speak until after he had finished the last sip of the wine and pushed back his plate proceed he said the food was excellent don said starhawk pushing back his own plate banana nose nodded formally smiling proceed you got a box of sugar today starhawk said with some cocaine on top you went to a hell of a lot of trouble to get it three guys got dead imagine that said maldonado you know a great deal about my private business two of the guys were supposed to get dead starhawk said but one of them was a thick irishman and he didnt die easy the funny thing is what with the excitement and all he got shot once with the wrong gun he was only supposed to be shot with his partners gun it was supposed to look like they shot each other fighting over the coke sonofabitch maldonado said softly as a prayer they tell me youre a thief they didnt tell me youre the invisible man what were you doing riding around in one of my boys back pockets you was to ask me starhawk said id guess that your boys goofed up twice after they got excited and shot murph with the wrong gun they forgot something yes tell me they forgot to leave some of the coke behind after all that was supposed to be what murphy and mendoza were fighting over you probably told them to leave a sizable amount not a sizable amount it doesnt take much to cause two pigs to fight and kill each other the reason the cops had to be offed starhawk said is that they didnt treat you with proper respect trying to sell you your own merchandise at street prices they should have been satisfied with a commission the way i see it you cant afford for guys to get out of line like that its bad for business and i kind of figure you also didnt like it that they were trying to cut each other out so you decided to off both of them and just take your stuff back the fuck you probably got a grudge against cops going back seventy years or more maldonado nodded sadly my mistake was i didnt imagine what a crazy sonofabitch this murphy was he was coming to the meet with a box of shit and thought he could just laugh at me afterwards hell starhawk said youre old right and you own a lot of respectable businesses he didnt think you had the stones to kill a cop anymore is all and he didnt know mendoza was planning to hijack him and had already contacted your boys for a price on the coke so he couldnt guess youd set it up that two crooked cops shot each other we are all very careful maldonado said and we all make mistakes so you come into this as the man mendoza hired to hijack murphy let me ask youwhy do you come to me and talk of the standard commission for returning the snow you could be on a plane right now and sell it at street prices somewhere and nobody the wiser what does maldonado have for you i bought an airplane ticket first thing this afternoon then i started thinking with murph and mendoza dead i need new friends and there just arent that many cops i am that close to don i want you to be my friend the coke is worth at least three hundred fifty grand on the street standard commission is thirtyfive grand you are sure you will not later regret losing so much to make a new friend don starhawk said nobody ever regrets making a new friend it is agreeable to me maldonado said will you have some more chianti only a little starhawk said it is bad for the reflexes toke without haste the letter was sent out may to the white house and all the major media it said may god forgive us may history judge us charitably we have placed tactical nuclear bombs in over locations throughout unistat the targets are all enemies of the people large banks multinational corporations government tax offices we will trigger one of these bombs at noon tomorrow somewhere in western unistat to demonstrate that we are not bluffing all the other nuclear bombs will be triggered in succession until our demands are met if any attempt is made to apprehend and arrest usany attempt at all all the remaining bombs

was now naught else but a walking automaton controlled by the quantum information system that had been a vietnamese buddhist we can never be sure said vice president squeeze who used to be robert pearson this is an absolute piss cutter there was a depressed silence how did our karma ever land us here asked hassan i sabbah x even fed xing wasnt sure of the answer to that well hassan said lets distribute the fucking money this just accelerates what we had in mind all along we cant do it pearson said youd be assassinated before the day is over hassan contemplated we can fucking try he said

tiny minority of domesticated primates who built pyramids and wrote books and eventually achieved space migration and entered into the galactic drama they were very clever primatesexcellent at mimicry and even capable of creative thinking at times they never would have escaped from their planet and the boomandbust cycles of all lifeforms adapted to planetside living if it hadnt been for the head revolution head means hedonic engineering and development it consists of learning to use the primate brain for fun and profit at the time of our story the head revolution after an underground existence of many centuries included only about percent of the domesticated primates on terra the rest of the domesticated primates were still using their brains for misery and failure they did not know they were misusing their brains they thought there was something wrong with the universe they called it the problem of evil experts on the problem of evil were known as theologians these were very erudite primates skilled in primate logic who wrote long books trying to answer the question why did god create an imperfect universe god was their name for the hypothetical biggestalphamaleofall being primates they could not comprehend how anything could run if there werent an alpha male in charge of it they assumed the universe was imperfect because it was obviously not set up for the convenience of domesticated primates the universe was not even designed for the convenience and comfort of the sixlegged majority on terra the convenience and comfort of planetside species has very little to do with the cosmic drama a few of the primates had realized this they were known as cynics cynics were primates who realized the monotonous lifedeath cycle of terrestrial life but were not imaginative enough to conceive of future evolution after longevity and escape velocity had been attained planetary life is cyclical because planets themselves follow cyclical orbits about their mother stars see galactic encyclopedia larvel stages of species development the sixlegged majority on terra for instance followed a life script of four or more stages in general the pattern was the embryonic or egg form the larval period the pupal or chrysalis stage the adult insect during each stage the biot or biological unitthe socalled individualpassed through a metamorphosis during which it was totally or partially transformed the same was true of the domesticated primates most of them passed through and kept neurological circuits characteristic of the following four stages imprinting and using the selfnourishing networks of the primate brainthe neonate or infant stage oral biosurvival consciousness imprinting and using the emotionalterritorial networks of the primate brainthe toddler

columnist for the new york newstimes sat down to compose his daily essay according to his usual procedure he breathed deeply relaxed every muscle and gradually forced all verbalization in his brain to stop when he had reached the void he waited to see what would float up to fill the vacuum what surfaced was pretty little birdies picking in the turdies terran archives new york was a citystate or island in the midwestem part of the unistat it seems to have been a center of religious worship and many came there to walk about probably in deep meditation within an enormous female statue the goddess of these primitives various authorities identify this divinity as columbia marilyn monroe liberty or mother fuckerall of these being names widely recorded in unistat glyphs perhaps her true name will never be known benny felt a rush of nostalgia the jingle had been popular in brooklyn when he was a schoolboy in the antediluvian era of the s back then in the dark ages of roosevelt ii many brooklyn peddlers still had horsedrawn carts and the horses as is common with their species left piles of horse shit in the streets as they went about their itineraries sparrows would peck in these steaming piles of dung for undigested oats and a brooklyn child would exclaim on seeing this pretty little birdies picking in the turdies to which another child would usually reply hes a poet though his looks dont show it benny reflected that this little bit of kidlore had stuck in his memory for nearly half a century and that it must therefore contain some profound meaning he began pounding the mac plus offering the birdieturdie poemlet as a perfect example of an american haikuthe juxtaposition of two images without comment by the author in a way that suggested far more than it actually said birds benny wrote are traditional symbols of beauty from bacons nightingales to keatss skylark throughout our whole poetic tradition horse manure on the other hand is regarded with revulsion and loathing yet the sparrows indifferent to human standards blithely pick in the manure seeking the food they know is there the poem is telling us that human likes and dislikes are arbitrary squintyeyed chauvinistic and irrelevant to natures own grand design strategy benny went on to assert that he had only been able to see this profundity in the jingle now after he had spent six months meditating at the manhattan zen center this rhyme is the essence of zen he concluded it was probably the least successful column benny ever wrote virtually nobody understood it and everybody was bored by it some readers even wrote protesting letters complaining that the column had been in questionable taste benny was depressed by this reaction he felt it had been a stroke of genius on his part to rescue from oblivion a genuine american haiku but even more than that writing the column had triggered a vast stream of recollections about s brooklyn which gave him a renewed sense of roots he had hoped to share why how many still alive could remember the procedure when the meter man from monopolated edison appeared in a brooklyn neighborhood in those days the kids were dispatched as runners racing from house to house shouting mon ed mon ed everybody would then remove the bags of salt which they kept over the electric meters to deflect the readings downward and thereby lower the electric bill it seemed like only yesterday that benny himself had raced from house to house shouting mon ed mon ed and people had rushed to move the bags of salt to closets where the meter man wouldnt see them benny hadnt thought of those days in more than four decades yet they lived on in memory storage and could be activated again by something as simple as the jingle about the pretty little birdies and bennys whole attitude toward mon edison had been shaped by those experiences he still regarded the public utility with a mixture of fear and loathing as a student of zen benny knew that such negative emotions were bad for the nervous system and he often tried to regard mon ed without bias it was impossible he had learned to forgive hitler stalin even nixon but mon edison was still so charged with emotion that he could not think of it without his blood pressure rising besides they had just raised their rates again in october at the memory of that bennys zen crumbled entirely public utilities are a monopolists heaven and a consumers hell he growled knowing he was not yet a buddha but then he cheered up as another bit of s kidlore came back to him it was a silly ritual really but it used to keep them amused even hilarious back in sixth grade it would begin with somebody asking who shit in the sink you shit another would reply bullshit the first would riposte who shit a third would then ask frank shit somebody would answer bullshit frank would object who shit joe shit frank would say getting joe into the game bullshit joe would pay promptly and so it would go who shit pete shit bullshit who shit jerry shit bullshit and on and on until everybody was boredwhich among schoolboys might take quite a long time benny was so overwhelmed with nostalgia that he decided to go visit his mother at the brooklyn senior citizens home even though the old lady had been a bit neurotic ever since she was knocked on her ass by a pursesnatcher three years ago on july american haiku the only one in new york who really grokked benny benedicts column about the pretty little birdies was justin case a mild fortyish man who looked gay but wasnt case wrote excruciatingly intelligent music criticism since he read about this example of american folk haiku while very very very stoned on columbian gold he immediately conceived that it would be even more folkish and beautiful if recited with an old dark age brooklyn accent viz pretty little boidies picking in the toidies he was so enamored of this that he quoted it whenever he was drunk or stoned for several months the whole winterspring season of if you mingled with the intelligentsia in manhattan you were likely to hear case declaiming in a style based partly on orson welles and partly on charles laughton pretty little boidiespickmg in the toidies this finally found its way into cases nbi filesubject is inclined to quoting obscene poetry in mixed companyand was even fed to the beast the nbi had a file on case because one of their informants had stated that he was a frequent associate of blake williams in fact case detested williams and only was seen in his presence because it was impossible to go to the best parties on the isle of manhattan without encountering him oddly enough the informant knew that quite wellbut she also knew that her fees depended on the number of new suspects she reported each month cases nbi dossier remained always small as a congressional medal of honor winner in vietnam he was not the sort of man the bureau cared to spy on too closely since it would be embarrassing if they were caught besides they couldnt make head or tails out of his phone conversations which were all about such inscrutable matters as whether beethovens obsession with his nephew represented repressed paternal impulses latent homosexuality or the desire to be a mother and whether all three elements were expressed in the tonic chord of the bassoon under the dominant chord of the tutti in the opening of the ninth justin cases god was a dead irishman named james augustine aloysius joyce who had been the greatest tenor of the twentieth century case owned every record of every joyce concert preserved on wax and regarded the man as having the most subtle musical sensibility since the great ludwig himself if only he had been a composer instead of a singer case sometimes thought with that ear actually joyce had considered the priesthood writing and even medicine before settling on a musical career his voice thrilled audiences in europe and america for nearly a decade before the famous joyce scandal which destroyed him case always fumed with anger when he read of the great singers last dayshow concerts were disrupted and ruined by moralistic hecklers howling garters garters garters till the shamed man left the stage humiliated it was known that he died of drink often comparing himself to oscar wilde and charles stewart parnell and cursing the christian churches bitterly case once had an affair with the anthropologist and sexologist marilyn chambers just because she shared his passion for joyces music due to the receptivity of the postcoital male he had even allowed her to explain the parallel universe theory to him oncesomething he always dismissed as rubbish when blake williams talked about it you mean he asked that in another universe joyces thing about girls undergarments might never have been discovered and his career wouldnt have been ruined even more dr chambers said if wheelers interpretation of the state vector is true there must be such a universe also a universe where joyce did become a priest instead of a singer far fucking out case said i wonder what youd be in the universe next door no wife no horse no mustache what is certain is that in countries like bulgaria where people live on polenta yogurt and other such foods men live to a greater age than in our parts of the world furbish lousewart v unsafe wherever you go justin case heard about the man with no wife no horse and no mustache at one of mary margaret wildebloods wild wild parties joe malik the editor of confrontation told the story it was rather hard for case to follow because the party was huge and

a lot of booze a lot of weed anddue to marvin gardens altogether too much coke basically joe malik said his encounter with the man who had no wife no horse and no mustache had been part of an experiment in neurometaprogramming case had no idea what the holy waltzing fuck neurometaprogramming might be in english and the story came through in a kind of polyphonic counterpoint with the other conversations swirling around them joe malik known as the last of the red hot liberals was half arab of course butas he himself liked to point outhe had been raised roman catholic and became an atheist in engineering school brooklyn polytechnic and nobody could detect anything islamic about him yet he did talk rather oddly at timesespecially after his melodramatic adventures with the discordian philosopher and millionaire hagbard celine no wife no horse no mustache malik was saying oh i think president hubbard is doing a great job blake williams was telling carol christmas the

seventh son of a seventh son cures warts that millionaires get rich through honesty and hard work that a jewish girl once got pregnant by a dove and all sorts of things like that which are regarded as medieval superstitions in my normal environment entering readers digest through the empathy of hash is a quantum jump to another reality there was a momentary silence in which case distinctly heard juan tootreego whispering nose candy from marvin the trick malik went on is to concentrate on the reality projected through the printed page every sentence is a signal from another world a nervous system different from yours with which you can interface synergetically you mean carol christmas breathed huskily you were deliberately brainwashing yourself to believe in this readers digest world of course malik said with an isntitobvious shrug a single ego is a very narrow view of the world escape velocity williams plunged onward to the stars that is empeeaitch is the bursting of the waters the endocrine message that the planetary birth process is beginning everybody mary margaret wildeblood announced this is dr dashwood from san francisco he studies orgasms dashwood a pipesmoking ectomorph fidgeted in their gaze yes i know came the paranoid pipe of marvin gardens always sounding a little like peter lorre they all say im exaggerating but i tell you its real they are extraterrestrials and they control tv and the newspapers and all the media case began to think he was in a play with everybody reading from a different script juan tootreego but why did you give the new planets such strange names bertha van ation well im oldfashioned enough to be patriotic i mean why should everything in the sky have a greek or roman name benny benedict who shit you shit bullshit juan tootreego i see like mr benet you have fallen in love with american names bertha van ation well yes but i didnt call either of them wounded knee drunken writer yeah i remember that from when i was a kid in kentucky frank shit bullshit who shit williams a jam sandwich using no peanuts mayonnaise or glue newton my god i just saw bigfoot on the balcony wildeblood oh thats simon moon hes a mathematician and quite harmless really malik so in effect i became middle america bouncing off the printed page into my retina grok decoded by nervous system circulating through memory storage the words formed a microreaders digest in my neurons i honestly began to worry about the dangers of premarital sex benedict nothing to compare with the hazards of marital sex do you have any idea how much alimony im paying every month at that point unfortunately case dozed off in his chair one joint of colombian too many and he never did find out about the man with no wife no horse and no mustache when he woke up most of the guests had left and mary margaret was telling dr dashwood about the burglars who had ransacked her apartment last week the worst part of it she was saying was that they even took ulysses oh were you very fond of him dashwood asked he obviously thought she was talking about a dog or cat mary margaret tittered aware of the misunderstanding ulysses was part of me she said case got to his feet and made his polite adieus he couldnt stand any more ambiguity in one evening ulysses was actually mary margaret wildebloods penis which was now in dash woods laboratorya fact which neither of them realized mary margaret was not a born woman which was commonplace since percent of the terran primates qualified for it but a manufactured woman this was something new and exotic it had only been possible on that primitive planet for around forty years epicene wildeblood mary margarets former self had been the bitchiest literary critic in manhattan the man that writers love to hate his aphorisms were known and quoted everywhere in the world that was important by his own standardsie from st marks place to th street east each wildebloodism was a pearl of wit and a poison dart of malice normans mailerthanthouattitude either mcluhan has had a divine vision or he is merely incoherent and it is obvious that he has not had a divine vision llluminatus is just two nursery nietzsches daydreaming about a psychedelic superman nixons memoirs will never be placed beside casanovas in the annals of amusing rascality but they may well stand beside mussolinis play about napoleon in the archives of stentorian dullness wildeblood had named his penis ulysses way back in gilgamesh junior high school in babylon long island where he grew up he named it ulysses because it had greek proclivities and a tendency to invade dark forbidden places wildeblood was by no means a simple or uncomplicated woman the sexchange operation had been only stage one in a plan to totally transform himself after that she intended to become a nun by it was a sane and sensible decision for one living at the hot center of new york intellectual life like the southerners who think damn yankee is one word wildebloods milieu had long ago forgotten that male chauvinist was two words the slightest kinkiest remnant of masculinity was a definite handicap a suggestion of possible viciousnesslike membership in the john birch society owning a mississippi accent or a conviction for a major felony besides wildeblood did urgently want to be a nun a priest or even a monk had a certain arrogance in his very role qua priest or qua monk however passionately he might cultivate total submission to the will of god only a nun could experience the true endlessness of humility wildeblood simply was tired of being the bitchiest male in manhattan he wanted to become the saintliest woman forever joe malik the editor of confrontation magazine published justin cases music criticism only because it confused and therefore amused him like most of his readers joe couldnt make head or tail out of whatever it was that case was trying to say but unlike the readers who were perpetually writing letters protesting cases baroque inscrutabilityjoe enjoyed puzzles joe was a chess puzzle and logical paradox addict like william s burroughs he was perpetually poring over the mayan codices trying to unscrew those inscrutable glyphs for which no rosetta stone has yet been found three years earlier in joe had been a whitehaired man who clearly showed his sixtyodd years now in he had jetblack hair again a face free of wrinkles and could easily pass for a man in his early forties this was because he had started using the rejuvenationlongevity drug forever as soon as it appeared on the market fundamentalist christians and the peoples ecology party pep denounced forever as blasphemous and against gods willthe ultimate insanity of the rationaltechnological mind it had been called by furbish lousewart v who almost defeated hubbard in the election joe despised religionists and ecologists and went on using forever dissident scientists began reporting disastrous side effects of forever when they gave it in horsedoctors doses to laboratory mice joe remembered the similar antimarijuana research of the sixties and seventies and went on using forever gambling that if there were anything wrong with it it wouldnt kill him before a better rejuvenation drug was on the market joe hoped to be around for several hundred years and take advantage of time travel when it arrived to make eternity accessible to mankind above his desk at confrontation was a motto from the english biologist j b s haldane which succinctly summarized joes view of the cosmos it said the universe may be not only queerer than we think but queerer than we can think alien signals carol christmas an aspiring actress who had not yet achieved better than offoffbroadway was always a bit sensitive about her second source of income so she heard joe malik saying no wife no whores no mustache oddly enough blake williams who was picking up parts of several conversations during his own interstellar rap also thought malik was saying no wife no whores no mustache williams and carol christmas both heard maliks explanation through the semantic carousel around them something like this malik premarital sex mind you i was really terrified about the whole younger generation careening to hell in a handbasket with luds and condoms sprinkling on all sides i began to see commie threats everywhere everybody i knew all my friends the whole city of new york seemed foreign subversive unwholesome by god i was middle america eggs benedict joe shit bullshit who shit figs newton alien signals he said alien signals williams which is why were all deviates if mother dna had wanted us to be replicable units shed have made us insects instead of primates dashwood well actually science has been studying orgasms for quite some time now but whats new about our work is certain psychological intangibles carol christmas marvin has anyone seen marvin benedict well if i were vlad i know who id impale carol christmas are you sure he isnt in the kitchen marvin are you out here in the kitchen malik that was when i stopped the experiment there i was totally at one with middle america totally inside the readers digest and then i came to that title no wife no whores no mustache dashwood shattering into atoms is male and undulating is female but balloons bursting is common to both malik i closed the magazine and threw it in the fire the title was too good to be ruined by an explanation natalie drest ooh i get that undulating a lot especially when some er guy is you know giving me you know head dashwood yes sixtyeight percent of the females report an undulating experience during cunnilingus but at this point williams realized that he would never recapture the audience previously listening to his outerspace theories and he also wanted some air he edged crabwise to the balcony and stood breathing deeply raising his eyes to study the southern sky and then pick out the bright red glare of sirius is marvin out here on the balcony asked a contralto it was carol christmas im afraid not williams said i think he left the party already oh did he take all the coke with him i guess so alone again blake williams communed briefly with the big dipper and asked himself what the hell malik had been talking about no wife no whores no mustache who shit benny benedict was yelling inside the actual title of the readers digest article had been no wife no horse no mustache not no wife no whores no mustache joe malik as he had been trying to explain amid the din of the wildeblood soiree had been engaged in neuroprogramming research trying to become one with the reader s digest when he found that wonderful title which led him to immediately abort the experiment he knew intuitively that the mystery of a title like that was much better than the solution the explanation of the title could ever be joe whose experiments with hashish had always been guided by the sixthcircuit metaprogramming theories of hagbard celine had brainwashed himself on numerous occasions to become one with not just the readers digest but with publications and even cassette tapes put out by such organizations as the john birch society theosophy the trotskyists various assassination buffs ufo societies buddhism the first bank of religiosophy scientific american the rosicrucians the christian anticommunist crusade the flat earth society the missouri synod lutherans the hermetic order of the golden dawn and anybody and everybody who lived in a tunnelreality different from that of his environment thus where most people look at the world through the grid of a single reality map joe malik perceived cosmos through dozens of such grids changing focus at will this was not quite the noego experience of zen he would cheerfully admit but rather a multiego experience and therefore an alternative way to escape from the stupidity of a single self joe had learned how to move the walls of his neurological realitytunnel and even how to wander from one tunnel to another without being infected with chaneyitis schizophrenia mysticism or the other pathological forms of this sixthcircuit relativistic consciousness he was one of the pioneers of the head revolution he called it a simulation of satori once while very stoned he had even gone so far as to call the experience iopening defection how many zen masters does it take to change a light bulb two one to change it and one not to change it private japes of mr g november defection said roy ubu that must be it ubu was a darkish man his hair was brown his skin was tan and he had a penchant for brown suits with matching cinnamoncolored ties and socks he looked about forty but was actually sixtyeight like joe malik ubu had been using forever from the day it came on the market theyre not in russia or china said sylvia goldfarb scientific advisor to the president you can forget all about that we know everything about them these days they couldnt have gone to hell ubu ventured sylvia goldfarb raised a sardonic eyebrow it had been a witless suggestion they couldnt have ubu repeated as if she had confirmed his judgment we can rule that out sylvia goldfarb waited there was something ominous in her waiting ubu cleared his throat ill put five men on it right away he said the chair squeaked screeee as ms goldfarb leaned forward impatiently five wont do it she said this is a priority investigation we cant have over a hundred scientists just disappear off the face of the earth not when theyre as important as these women and men the thing that i cant figure out ubu said is why now theres never been an administration so favorable to sciencenever so many huge grants not just for work on the spacecities and lifeextension but in computers and transplants and cloning and all over the shop why would a group of scientists pick this time to jump ship dr goldfarb smiled well she said ill tell you my guess they found something to investigate something that really excited them but unfortunately something too far out for the government even in thats what i suspect and thats what i hope youll find but until we know for sure we have to assume that something dangerous may be afoot just find one of them mr ubu and prove that she or he is doing something harmless and you will begin to take a great load off my mind yes maam ubu said looking sharp he was thinking this is going to be a pisscutter one of president hubbards first acts on assuming office had been to abolish the fbithereby throwing roy ubu out of work the american people survived one hundred fifty years without secret police opening their mail and tapping their phones hubbard said they can survive without it again most of ubus colleagues fled washington seeking employment in police departments and private detective agencies roy had stuck around shrewdly convinced that he understood government better than hubbard within a month he was hired by the newly formed national bureau of information the ostensible purpose of the nbi was to collect data for the beastgwb the computer that had virtually become a fourth branch of government since its memory was searched before any important decision was made actually since bureaucracies have learned like other gene pools to survive over aeons the nbi replaced many of the functions of the fbi this was so intricately concealed in the budget figures that neither hubbard nor any of her close advisors ever found it bureaucracies do not die when terminated they change names gilhooleys first fundamental finding still there was an important difference since hubbard had abolished prisons the only citizens who had anything to fear from government were those increasingly rare bizarrely imprinted biots who committed violence against others and they were only sent to hell moq rhesus monkeys like other higher primates are intensely affected by their social environmentsan isolated monkey will repeatedly pull a lever with no reward other than the sight of another monkey edward wilson sociobiology december dr dashwood had been rather pensive and preoccupied at lunch that day back at orgasm research in san francisco so we take a guy like thata meathead with no more knowledge of psychology or anthropology or sociology or medicine or history or ethics or logic than he has of nuclear physicsand we give him a gun and a club and a can of mace and turn him loose my god to police the rest of us insanity total insanity that was dr mounty babbit the wiggiest member of orgasm researchs staff and like all too many scientists these days a bit of a radical dr dashwood hunched over his steak to avoid getting drawn into the discussion you want to disarm the police like in england old dr heyman asked heyman was still cashing in on the fact that he had once worked with kinsey and otherwise had nothing to recommend him to any employer would never work here americans dont have the respect for law and order that britons do well then babbit said calmly arm the public make sure everybody has a gun and knows how to use it even up the odds some way or other rubbish heyman cried that would lead to sheer anarchy dr dashwood painfully concentrated on his watery mashed potatoes hows threea a soft contralto asked him it was dr harriet hopgood aware that the boss was bored by the political discussion threea was part of the codethe research subjects were never mentioned by name in any conversationand it designated the young lady in laboratory three ms rhoda chief very impressive dr dashwood said she had reached twentythree when i broke for lunch and she was still going strong i left jones in charge twentythree dr babbit said incredible a most impressive woman dr hopgood added a tone of envy creeping into her voice dr dashwood darted a glance at her plump face and quickly looked away again she was transparently wistful just then dr dashwoods secretary appeared at the table a telegram came for you she said i thought it might be important when dr dashwood tore open the envelope he was confronted with a rather curious message king kong died for your sins ezra pound font facetimes new roman size color ezra pound thought dr dashwood now where have i heard that name before then it came to him that fellow who called at an embarrassing moment this morning from the fernando poop committee or was it the hernando foof committee he looked again at the idiotic message my god he thought some damn crank is trying to put me on ezra pound had called when rhoda was reaching her third thunderous orgasm and dr dashwood had been on the edge of forgetting all professional ethics and seizing her himself it had been a weird phone callall about the plight of giovani oops or some such place fortunately rhodas orgasms since then had been comparativelytepid dr dashwood had resumed his professional persona although he was a little bit spacey i heard a rumor that theyve got one hundred ninetyeight gorillas working as cops in chicago mounty babbit went on dashwood was getting annoyed freud he said coolly had an interesting theory about what motivates fear of the police that put a damper on the conversation and dr dashwood soon regretted it without the distraction of babbits baiting of old heyman nothing prevented dashwoods mind if from circling back again and again to the lovely rhoda nude drawing the king kong fourteenincher into her in seemingly interminably ecstasy like an arrow like ulysses itself his mind plunged toward that goldenhaired and juicily moist little honeysnatch hot with twentythree orgasms science he reminded himself is eternal selfdiscipline but the old latin joke came back to him penis erectus non compos mentis a stiff prick knows no conscience o galileo and darwin did you have days like this washy november the nbi had assembled a complete dossier on the missing george washington carver bridge the first scientist to disappear after leaving government employ ubu had all the facts about dr bridge that had ever been recorded he knew that bridge had been born june in bad ass texas and weighed nine pounds three ounces at the time he knew that bridges social security number was his gwb number and his sexual penchant was for lightskinned black or oriental women with college degrees who would wear black lace bras while he pronged them he knew that bridge had a ba from miskatonic university in black studies an ms from the same source in sociobiology and a phd from the university of ingolstadt in primatology he knew that bridge had been baptized three timesonce at the age of two weeks by the afromethodists via total submersion again at the age of fourteen by the roman catholics by wetting the brow and a third time at the age of seventeen by the ku klux klan with a pail of cow piss he knew that dr bridge had left bad ass one month later and never returned he knew that dr bridge had studied or worked in arkham massachusetts new york city los angeles ingolstadt bavaria the transylvanian section of hungary washington dc and berkeley he knew that dr bridge was called washy by his classmates at miskatonic he knew several thousand similar things none of them helpful in any way toward explaining why dr bridge had disappeared off the face of the earth at the head of a parade of similar disappearees which now numbered i knew this case would be a pisscutter ubu said contemplating his data the one fact not recorded about dr bridge and the whole key to his subsequent behavior was the fact that he had on november looked into the infamous necronomicon of abdul alhazred in the german translation of von junzt das verichteraraberbuch ingolstadt bridge not dr bridge then but just washy had been turned on to his odd volume by the miskatonic librarian doris horus who knew he took his black studies seriously there was one sentence in das verichteraraberbuch that turned everything around in dr bridges head the sentence was gestorben ist nicht was fur ewig ruht und mit unbekannten aonen mag sogar der tod noch sterben homes on legrange galactic archives the original idea for the l spacecities had emerged from professor gerard oneill and a group of his students at princeton in the motion was so radical that it took over five years to get it into print in physics today in professor oneill had simply asked his students a rather basic questionone which occurs inevitably on every planet which evolves beyond the boomandbust cycle of planetside life oneill asked is the surface of a planet the right place for an expanding technological civilization once the question had been asked the correct answer was of course inescapable among the symptoms indicating that closed system planetary industry would have to be transformed into open system planetaryandextraplanetary industry were the following rapid exhaustion of the fossil fuels on terra leading to a desperate search for new energy sources the virtually limitless solar energy in space rising population and increasing longevity leading to an inevitable new period of swarming growing pollution and ecological imbalance caused by the attempt to provide energy from terrestrial sources for this increasing primate population the revolution of rising expectationsa sociological phenomenon brought on by the scientifictechnological advances of the previous two centurieswhich caused the majority of primates to claim they had the right to a decent standard of living the failure of the revolution of lowered expectations after the smarter primates realized that lowered expectations meant starvation for the majority of the planet the hunger project started by a circuitfive primate named erhard who encouraged people to believe starvation could be eliminated the continuous influence of a circuitsix primate named r buckminster bucky fuller who insisted the primate brain was designed for total success in universe and finally the debacle of terrestrialbased nuclear energy plants which continually caused havoc in their environments and which eventually prompted some of the primates to

quantum mechanics it strikes down the term observer of classical theory the man who stands safely behind a thick glass wall and watches what goes on without taking part that cant be done quantum mechanics says wheeler misner amp thorne gravitation may they call it liberalism and socialism the bastards but really its their own brand of highway robbery they been after me and henry ford and every independent in the country for a hell of a long time you remember all this son you remember what your father told you its a big fortune the crane holdings and theyre going to be trying to take it away from you just like theyre trying to take it away from me i earned every penny of it when i invented orgasmor and i dont aim to let them take it away from me or from you you just remember why all the bankers are rosenfelt liberals son you remember who your real enemies are and dont think its those idiot socialists and other cranks like townsend with his thirty dollars every thursday its those kike bankers who want the whole pie and are just using rosenfelt as a pawn that was old crane tom crane the man who invented orgasmor talking to his son hugh in central park where sweet birds sang tom crane was more dinosaur than primate a tough unsentimental reptile whose wealth was based on a swindle pure and simple he never explicitly claimed in any advertisement that orgasmor created more orgasmsjust that it was deliciously enticing and stimulating to all body cells and tissues and the pda never succeeded in proving that his agents had planted the popular mythology attributing lubricity to a product not very different in chemical content from cocacola a strict constructionist would certainly say that cranes customers were being defrauded it doesnt poison anybody old crane always answered such nitpickers in fact hugh cranewho was only ten in and would reach twelve before he discovered that the actual pronunciation of the presidents name was rooseveltwas only partially listening to his fathers rambling diatribe he had heard all of it before many times and besides the mysterious tramp was much more interesting the mysterious tramp perhaps a visitor from fairy land was stopping each person who passed and asking them something they all shook their heads and walked by rapidly this was puzzling to little hugh if the answer was negative why did the tramp keep asking the question didnt he believe the people who had already answered was he offering a chance to cross the boundary into magic space and were they all too timid to try you see son rosenfelt and the rhodes scholars have it all sliced up and they have to get rid of people like me tom crane was still rambling along his own paranoid yellowbrick road when they finally came abreast of the tramp hugh listened eagerly to catch the mystery question hey mister could you spare a dime i havent eaten in three days mister hey listen mister get a job said old crane walking faster you see son thats the kind of goodfornothing loafer whos destroying this country but the boy who was to become cagliostro the escape artist looked back and saw the mysterious tramp falling to the ground very slowly like a tree he had seen fall slowly after being chopped by the caretaker at the crane country home out on long island and just like the tree when he finally reached the sidewalk the tramp didnt move at all not one bit and even seemed to get stiff like the tree did only faster spock spock spock december while dr dashwood was worrying about the sinister ezra pound in san francisco and mary margaret wildeblood was preparing for her party in new york a black giant named rosey stuart was struggling with a vacation memo in the pussycat office in chicago this is the worst piece of idiocy ive ever seen he complained to his secretary it looks like it was written by a computer having a nervous breakdown listen to this gibberish haifa manday shall not be equal to half a day unless the man is actually in the office for the full day or half of a full day as the case may be this also applies to female employees what the ringtailed rambling hell does that mean do you want me to call personnel and ask somebody to explain it asked the secretary marlene murphy a pert little redhead who could neither type nor take dictation well but held her job because she fit the pussycat image besides stuart went on grumbling it contradicts the vacation memo we got last week that one was a hoax marlene explained patiently some crank got in at night and ran it off on a xerox machine as some kind of practical joke well jesus on a wubber cwutch stuart complained imitating elmer fudd it made more sense than this one marlene shrugged sympathetically this is the one weve got to live with stuart shook his head wearily what kind of world is it where the reality is weirder than the satire there was no obvious answer to that do you want me to call personnel marlene repeated hell no stuart exclaimed dont agitate that pit of dingdongs just put me down for the first three weeks in july and if they tell me i cant have it ill go over their heads and talk to sput stan sputnik was the founder of the pussycat empire and still acted as both managing editor and publisher as well as embodying the pussycat image in all his highly publicized acts and deeds stuart crumbled the vacation memo and threw it in the wastebasket whats next he asked dr dashwood about the interview oh yes stuart said turning his chair to look out the window call his secretary and see if hes in while marlene went outside to her desk to place the call stuart looked out over chicago thinking of his rapid rise in the pussycat empire born in chicagos south side ghettohis full name was franklin delano roosevelt stuarthe had originally followed the usual predatory lifescript of impoverished alpha males but his second prison term had thrown him into contact with a most peculiar cell matea selfproclaimed sufi and master of all forms of persian magick rosey stuart came out of prison convinced he could do anything acquired a degree in literature from harvard in record time and started the great novel about the black experience in america about then both racism and poverty were becoming obsolete and selling a first novel was as hard as ever stuart had been toiling at pussycat for five years dickering with a novel about a parallel universe where racism still existed and a malignant black magician takes over the country by demonically possessing the body of the white president last year the staff of pussycat had quadrupled sput sputnik had grown annoyed by the everincreasing number of imitations of his illustrated fantasy book for onanists every editor at every competition publication had been hired away at a juicy salary increase pussycat suddenly had six senior editors twelve associate editors twentyfour assistant editors and thirty junior editors the other publishers found themselves confronting deadlines with nobody left on their staffs two went bankrupt one committed suicide the others took a year to get back in gear again business is business said sput he liked to think of himself as a tough harddriving businessman as well as the twentieth centurys leading philosopher the superstud of every girls tender dreams the hero of the free press the foe of bigotry and intolerance everywhere and the worlds unacknowledged master psychologist if he had known there was such a thing as pieeating champion he would have aimed for that title also he considered himself a renaissance man although stuart had advanced from junior editor to senior editor in spite of this competition he hardly knew sput at all sput never came to the offices preferring to work in his mansion in manhattan and stuart saw him only on the rare occasions when he was called upon to fly to new york for a conference those conferences tended to be a bit much like certain movie actors who are always on even when nowhere near a soundstage sput was as determined to impress his editors as he was to overwhelm the whole world for years he had insisted on playing chess during conferences keeping an impoverished grandmaster on hand for a stiff competition since the grandmaster knew which side his bread was buttered on sput always won he had gotten this idea from a very inaccurate historical novel about napoleon in which the little corsican sociopath was portrayed as playing masterful chess while discussing military strategy with his generals and the napoleonic legal code with his judges more recently sput had read a novel about nero the effect was even more disconcerting than trying to talk with him while he laboriously evaded an obvious noahs ark trap he was seated behind his desk receiving a blow job when stuart had been ushered into his presence the last time it was unnerving you wanted to discuss the interview subjects for the next six months stuart asked taking his seat and noting that the erotic technician kneeling before the great man was a recent pussyette from the mags foldout in fact she was the first to appear not in an ordinary crotch shot they were now becoming commonplace not only in pussycat but in its imitators but in a randy lowangle crotch shot in which her vulva lips could clearly be seen pouting beneath the pubic hair stuart had been curious as to how that effect was obtained and asked the chief photographer were you rubbing her off just before you snapped that nah was the laconic answer we tried that but the lips still werent visible enough we ended up stuffing her snatch full of my hashish stash lawd stuart was astonished and dropped back to his mother tongue thats why she had that fargone look in her eyes stoned out of her head by the time we got it all out of her again bet you didnt know it was possible to get high that way wonder what it would be like to navigate her geography right after the hash came out stuart said thoughtfully wouldnt know the photographer sighed sput put an exclusive on her soon as he saw the test shots now she kneeled nude and covered with some kind of oil that sput had read about in the nero book and carefully licked his wingwang up and down while he imitating supercool went over the interview list dont want president hubbard he said shes too controversial but dammit sput our interviews are supposed to be controversial stuart seemed to recall saying that at each of these conferences not that controversial sput said the intellectuals all hate her because shes a scientist now here jane terran archives at the time of this comedy those primates who specialized in verbal manipulations of the third neurological circuit formed a genepool separate from those who specialized in mathematical manipulations the former controlling the verbal environment had dubbed themselves the intellectuals fonda and timothy leary theyre good but jesus h christ robert anson wilson for chrissakehes a fucking sciencefiction writer we interviewed vonnegut stuart said watching the ladys head bobbing up and down at sputs crotch yeah but his books are serious thats different sput said breathing a bit heavily by now besides everybody says the universe next door drives people wiggy and makes them become nudists or buddhists or something that kind of trouble we dont need and one sciencefiction writer in five years is enough already gently doll gently i see you dont have the attorney general on the list yet its the same as ever stuart explained noting that the girls hand was sneaking down her belly into her crotch she just wont give us an interview she still says were a dirty magazine dammit we never go beyond contemporary community standards sput protested hurt that old bitch is a bigot well bigot or not she wont give us an interview fascist reactionary old bat sput fumed someday ill then he brightened listen doll he said to the girl at his feet youre the attorney generalnow really go to it like a fucking vacuum cleanerl the girls head began bobbing faster and sput slouched back a bit smiling contentedly reactionary wasp bitch he muttered thats right take it take it all you foe of the first amendment erdr francis dashwood stuart prompted very good very good sput was whispering as if toking a marijuana cigarette you gestapo pig he added to the girl at his feet how about jackie kennedy onassis yeah yeah class sput said vaguely he was beginning to tremble a bit who else you got he whispered trembling more dr spock spock sput asked then he repeated shrilly spock spock spock he was coming stuart realized with an embarrassed twinge swallow it sput was roaring swallow it you wire tapper it was a distracting conference all around stuart thought remembering his secretary was at his door i finally located dr j dashwood she said at this home hes on the phone j stuart picked up his phone saying ah good afternoon dr dashwood its a great pleasure to speak to you is this on the level came a tense voice youre not involved with that poop or foof place are you stuart was dumbfounded could the head of the bestknown sex research organization in america be a paranoid nut i am speaking to dr francis dashwood he asked carefully yes yesbut how can i be sure who im speaking to well stuart said if you have your doubts call me back go through information to check the number and then have the pussycat switchboard put you on my line that should convince you ill do just that the doctor said a lot of damned peculiar things are happening today i want to be sure youre not some cohort of that ezra pound character he hung up abruptly ezra pound stuart thought bemused the doctor thinks a dead poet and folk singer is plotting against him an absolute nut of the first water a real signifyin mad scientist obviously this would require great care dashwood couldnt just be discarded as an interview subject for being batty he was too big a name the interview would go ahead but dashwood would be handled with kid gloves the phone buzzed and he picked it up dr dashwood is back on the line his secretary said put him through he waited then said dr dashwood well i guess it really is you the voice said please excuse me a man in my sensitive fieldcranks and schizophrenics wondering around loose yes yes i quite understand stuart said rolling his eyes toward the ceiling poets always have harbored nasty grudges he had no doubt that the doctor was as goofy as a waltzing mouse how the terran primates were domesticated galactic archives president hubbard had abolished poverty through a plan which she called the rich economy rich meaning rising income through cybernetic homeostasis this was a diabolically clever scheme to abolish all forms of human labor except the most creativeie those frontallobe metaprogramming circuits which have evolved last in evolution and surpass the mechanical old fourcircuit primate brain functions of course it had been theoretically possible to abolish most mechanical labor since about when a very cunning primate mathematician norbert weiner noted that selfcorrecting cybernetic machines would soon be able to monitor whole factories even earlier a metaprogrammingcircuit greek primate aristotle had observed that it would be possible to abolish slavery when the loom and other machines become selfmanaging terran primates had continued slavery over the generations despite the increasing distress this caused their hominid third and fourth semantic and moral circuits simply because machines could not yet manage themselves as many a primate utopian had rediscovered in chagrin under primitive planetary conditions somebody has to do the shitwork the most appealing solution to electing that somebody was to invade a weaker neighboring tribe and bring back a group of biots who could be domesticated this had been done so often that there was no hominid pack on terra that did not show the effects of domestication and slave mentality a fact first noted by a dour german primate named nietzsche in unistat due to the strong encouragement of individualistic third and fourthcircuit semanticmoral functions slavery had grown so repugnant that it was formally abolished within a century after the formation of the pack constitution it lingered on through inertia in the form of wage slavery which required that all primates not born into the sixty families that owned almost everything would have to work for those families or their corporations in order to get the tickets called money which were necessary for survival this slave mentality was so entrenched in the domesticated primates that cybernation advanced very slowly in the first thirty years after weiner discovered it would be possible to abolish primate toil all the important primate bandsthe alpha male corporations the primate trade unions the primate council or government the primate totem cults or churchesbelieved that the traditional domesticated caste system was the only possible system under which primates could live even the red primates shared this delusion differing only in their ideas about distribution of resources president hubbard boldly challenged this domesticated primate thoughtform by announcing that everybody who could be replaced by a machine would be replaced by a machine it seemed like the end of the world to the primates at first it turned out to be only the end of poverty an approximate simulation of insanity any false or partially false premise extended with accurate logic will generate an approximate simulation of insanity crossing broadway at seventysecond street still lecturing it was blake williams yes yes of course professor but if youll listen a moment to what im trying to say natalie drest protested but you see young lady most of the premises of our current religious scientific and philosophical thinking must be false or partially false as judged by a more advanced civilization what would a higher intelligence make of our doctrines of transubstantiation or charmed quarks or the categorical imperative well yeah but professor then dammit will you listen most of our beliefs and behavior will appear clinically insane to a higher intelligence viewing this planet sure its all relative i know that but professor look dr williams said with crushing finality do you want to fuck or dont you her answer was drowned out by a siren racing up riverside drive what i said i been tryna tell you for ten blocks professor im still getting over a case of the clap thats quite all right my dear blake williams pronounced suavely im a broadminded man i understand the exuberance of youth the powerful hormones coursing through your vibrant young bloodstream the noble refusal of your generation to regard the taboos of old as binding upon the free spirits of the s and besides ive reached the age at which im not horny every night of the year you are still invited to come along to my humble digs and listen to my old joan baez records gee professor you know what you are youre cool youre not sexist at all urn yes thank you my dear im just getting old actually now about the einsteinrosenpodolsky gedankenexperiment dancing photons the intellectual love of things consists in understanding their perfections spinoza linda lovelace a projection of light traveling miles per second through film of events that actually transpired in miami years before is taking first one inch of harry reemss penis then two three five the whole incredible nine inches and paranoid little marvin gardens hunched in his seat overcoat in lap snorts the last of his coke it was the fortyfourth time marvin had seen deep throat and the twentythird time on coke and under the overcoat his hand was magically transforming into lindas mouth again that separate reality where the dancing photons on the screen and the synergizing synapses in his brain joined to produce more than d better than technicolor realer than real god yes higher than a kite oh lord marvin was having a rare happy moment in which the extraterrestrial invasion wasnt worrying him he harry reems is about to come and marvin gardens too wondering in one corner of his mind about the eternity of protoplasm because when he conies shell take it out of her mouth andsplathell shoot all over her face marvin is waiting but take an amoeba now does it die when it splits are there two new amoebas or is it two selves where there was one self before god shes got all of it now faster call them krazy and ignatz say now is krazy the first amoeba and ignatz a twin or are both of them still krazy two krazies instead of one jeez right i down her throat now and when they split again we have four shes licking the head now ah thats good and about to swallow it all again call them say groucho chico harpo and zeppo which is the original amoeba or are they all are amoebas really immortal then now now here it comes now one amoeba dividing forever now going on and on for all eternity now a single explosion of dna seed now now ah christ christ yes now now now yes eternal god oh good blake williams had a mnemonic for my discovery bertha van ation was excitedly telling juan tootreego as they passed the deep throat marquee mother very easily made a jam sandwich using no peanuts mayonnaise or glue see mercury venus earth but about those amoebas marvin gardens more relaxed now is buttoning his coat and heading for the exit linda lovelace continues to schlurp and suck on the screen behind him but he is deciding that after the first split there are two amoebas of course but should you call them children of the first amoebahim or her or it and after the second split there are four after the third split eight nowhere does the phase change denoted by the symbol death appear to have occurred is one of the eight thirdgeneration amoebas the original amoeba him or her or it or are all of them the original and how does anyhow markoff chaney was about to have a dream come true he was renting his old room at the ymca on chicago avenue again using it as a base for further antidashwood activities he had gone for a walk and as he approached the intersection of michigan and lake shore drive he was thinking about a new letterhead that would say fraternal order of hate groups and have robert welch abby hoffman anita bryant and george wallace listed as officers perhaps he might add natalie drest and make her chairperson of the board hsst a voice said youyeah you shorty the midget stiffened and whirled around hssst he said youyeah you asshole hey no offense the speaker said i got a business proposition for you the midget looked at him sharply he didnt look at all as shady and unsavory as a person should look who was offering a business proposition on the corner to a total stranger what are you selling he asked not selling the friendly giant said giving away one hundred fifty dollars and what do i have to do for it the midget asked warily drawing a little closer im a butler the man saidand in fact he did not look like butlers the midget had seen in movies his face was much longer from the nose down than most peoples it gave him a permanent look of one who smells something but hasnt found it yet most chicagoans chaney had noticed look like theyd just found it and it was worse than theyd imagined the lady i work for is very rich and very eccentric he tried to leer suggestively the effect was like a bishop winking she has a thing about m about you people of less than average stature markoff chaney felt his heart leap could it be true one hundred fifty dollars thats right she gets these moods and sends me out looking every so often im game the midget said deciding he could feel the pulse in his temple au revoir ma cherie he thought firmly convinced that was french for goodbye to virginity theres just one thing the butler said as they walked along youve got to do just what i tell you dont be afraid shes not a real kinkno whips and chains or anything of that scenebut well her tastes are a little peculiar i promise you wont be hurt tell me the midget said its like a little drama or charade the butler said lowering his voice he explained certain things what the midget asked i dont get to fuck her but it will be enjoyable nonetheless the butler said and you collect one hundred fifty smackers for it remember oh well chaney said quoting one of his basic axioms for guerrilla ontology insanity is another viable alternative just like method acting in an apartment in the east village off st marks place tibetan posters and astrological charts gaze down on the couch where joe malik and carol christmas are engaged in erotometaphysical epistemology getting a hand inside her panties was easy enough and joe malik thought he was home free but then a snag appeared an emotional problem that verged on fullblown lunacy it had to do with carols third exhusband a puerto rican poet who claimed to be a santaria initiate whatever that was and couldnt adjust to new york he said that magic was impossible in new york because the intelligentsia were all jewish atheistsbut im not a jewish atheist joe protested im an arab agnostic wondering what the hell this had to do with a simple lay but carols third husband who might as well have been on the couch with them also said that carol could help him to write again if she believed in magic and it wasnt much different from being an actress anyway santaria whatever it is is just like method acting carol explained but joe was meanwhile from the context deciding it was more like christian science but what it all came down to the hand out of her panties by now since to pressure her at this point would be coercive and chauvinistic of course the puerto rican bunofasitch had put a loa on her when they separated and she couldnt relax until they did an exorcism of the apartment oh bleeding christ joe gasped both balls like boulders its just like method acting honey carol repeated hopefully cf you mean natalie dressed asked awed and full of hashish that this whatchamacculum this state vector collapses every which way no no no blake williams hastens to correct thats only the everettwheelergraham model and its obviously nonsense it means that in the universe next door furbish lousewart is president instead of eve hubbard pure science fiction and i um wonder what everett wheeler and graham were smoking when they thought of it what im trying to explain my dear is the most plausible alternative theory which comes from taking bells theorem literally the ripple theory natalie prompted but the ripples are allovertheuniverseatonce williams explained again its called the quantum inseparability principle or quip dr nick herbert calls it the cosmic glue just like ripples in a pond jeez natalie drest was bemused parts of us are still interacting with joe malik and all the other people at the party this is superheavy yes but quip acts nonlocally in time as well as in space williams went on youve got to think of time ripples as well as space ripples to grok the quantum world the copenhagen interpretation there is a sharp disagreement among competent men as to what can be proved and what cannot be proved as well as an irreconcilable divergence of opinion as to what is sense and what is nonsense eric temple bell debunking science there was nothing really weird about blake williams except that he was passionately in love with a dead man this great if somewhat bizarre passion was entirely platonic of coursenothing queer about good old doc williams except his head with his sixfoot frame his neatly trimmed gray beard and his heavy blackrimmed spectacles williams was the very model of a modern major generalist due to the incident of the gansevoort street incinerator he had learned to keep his mouth shut about his more outlandish ideas and obsessions the man blake williams loved was niels bohr the physicist who had chosen the taoist yinyang as his coat of arms when knighted by the danish courtwhich was rather far out back in the s before taoism became faddish with physicists bohr also added nearly as much to quantum theory as planck einstein or schrodinger and his model of the atomthe bohr model its called had been believed literally by a generation of physicians before hiroshima bohr himself however had never believed it nor had he believed any of his other theories bohr invented what is called the copenhagen interpretation which holds in effect that a physicist shouldnt believe anything but his measurements in the laboratory everything elsethe whole body of mathematics and theory relating one measurement to anotherbohr regarded as a model of how the human mind works not of how the universe works blake williams loved bohr for the copenhagen interpretation which had made it possible for him to study physics seriously even devoutly without believing a word of it that was convenient since williamss own training as an anthropologist had schooled him to study all human symbol systems without believing any of them on a deeper levelthere is always a deeper level williams was a scientist who didnt believe in science because he had been cured of polio by witchcraft but blake williams didnt believe in witchcraft either he didnt believe in anything he regarded all belief systems as illustrative data in domesticated primate psychology the study of human beliefs is an ethologists heaven and a logicians hell he liked to say actually blake williams hadnt been cured of polio by witchcraft exactly he had been cured by the sister kenny method but he grew up thinking it was witchcraft that was because all the experts in unistat at the timethe members of the american medical association who would not admit there were any other experts on healthclaimed the sister kenny method was witchcraft they also said it didnt work since the sister kenny method obviously had worked in his case blake grew up with the gnawing suspicion that the experts didnt know what the hell they were talking about he was also intensely curious about all forms of witchcraft which eventually led him to become an anthropologist young williams soon enough discoveredon his very first field trip among the hopi indiansthat witchcraft does by god and by golly work after all he began tentatively and secretly sharing his knowledge with carefully selected colleagues most of them were pretty evasive about the whole subject but marilyn chambers the author of the epochmaking neuroanthropology was startlingly blunt everybody whos been in the field knows that she said with a kind of weary patience but why doesnt anyone say so williams asked still young still naive freud and charcot once had virtually this same conversation dr chambers said but the topic then was the sexual origin of the hysterical neuroses of victorian women charcot invited freud to be the goat and talk about it in public i see blake williams said slowly he did see the cat and the dog if we accept multiple universes then we no longer need worry about what really happened in the past because every possible past is equally real joseph gerver the past as backward movies of the future physics today april he who mast who hesitates is lost marvin gardens said one day in the confrontation office joe malik considered it one of the most interesting freudian slips he had ever heard and recorded it in his diary where it was of course subsequently scanned by the illuminati marvin and joe never got along well but that was because marvin regarded joe as an extraterrestrial invader and joe regarded marvin as a nut marvin is emphatically not a loony justin case had been heard to say quite often hes a genius the greatest puton artist since hitchcock nobody recognizes what a great satirist he is justin case marvin said when that was repeated to him thinks hes being liberal but hes just another victim of brainwashing by the amazon invasion marvin gardens had been traumatized by the s and always referred to the womens liberation movement as the amazon invasion he believed or pretended to believe that the ringleaders were all extraterrestrials who had arrived by flying saucer in and were boldly conspiring to seize supreme power everywhere through what he called semantic black magick theyve atomized the language and created a semantic smog in which ordinary humanity is obliterated by abstractions like chairperson or simple mammalian erotic signaling is politicized into a new sin called sexism any male who dares to oppose them is stigmatized as a male chauvinist and any female who opposes them is labeled a victim of male brainwashing obviously within a decade they will command the key posts in all areas of industry theyve captured publishing already and then government will fall probably then the males of their species will start landing and well all be enslaved some of the males may have landed already look at the manhattan literary scene its the sweetest infiltration job in the history of galactic espionage for merely daring to reveal their plans i am smeared by them as a male chauvinist pig which is ten times worse than an ordinary male chauvinist and equivalent to an sp on the scientologists hit list some agreed with justin case that marvin was kidding that he had merely seen an opportunitythe chance to attain fame and fortune by espousing a bitterly controversial extreme position others however claimed he was dead serious and was a classical case of cocaine paranoia marvin always pointed out when either of these theories was mentioned in his presence there is a third possibility i might be right in that case how convenient for them that my sanity and sincerity are so often called into question it almost looks as if they are conspiring to defame my character are they afraid that some might listen to me before its too late before the takeover is complete marvins principal enemy among the male half of the population was frank hemeroid of course hemeroid oddly enough hardly even knew of marvins existence and hence was incapable of being harmful to him by intention that didnt matter he was still the enemy with a capital e at times marvin had even suspected him of being extraterrestrial like the leaders of womens lib hemeroid earned his animosity entirely by the books he wrote which were full of treason according to marvin actually hemeroids novels merely reflected the s literary society around him in which most people were a little weird and all of them were losers hemeroid carefully depicted a world exactly like that most of his characters were weird and all of them were losers the critics who were all losers called him a brutal realist marvin called him a traitor to planet earth marvin wrote about all this in dialogues he rather fancies himself as being of platonic disposition in which the speakers were frank hemeroid representing s values and realityconstructs and ernest hemingway marvins childhood hero who had been consigned to the literary garbage heap when the extraterrestrials took over hemingway in these dialogues represented man individual man the universal maverick as he was before the extraterrestrial invasion the dialogues were full of things like this frank did you ever really believe in your own myth you old faker did you think you could come out of a neurotic suicideprone family and by sheer will transform yourself into a hero a brave man a great artist a boxer a biggame hunter a cult figure an image of courage and of grace under pressure didnt you know you were a worm that all men are worms and cowards and that youd be beaten at the end didnt you know youd be like all the rest of us and give in to selfpity and selfdoubt and pull that final cosmic trigger ernest i never said my way was easy i said that man was not meant for defeat however many individuals may be defeated i said that the effort to be conscious enough and brave enough was admirable whatever the consequences frank consciousness bravery consciousness is only aware of its own suffering in this blind existence and bravery is only a gesture against the inevitable end a stupid gesture since the cowards live longer and if theyre cowardly enough they make all the comfortable decisions and have all the security possible in a death universe like this ernest i deny none of that and i have shown the f cruelty more nakedly than any of your generation i still say it is admirable to be brave and take big risks for the things you value when everything mammalian and mechanical tells you to run and you stand and dont run you learn what man can be and so on marvin was obsessed with something he called the dignity of man he was not at all amused by ecological relativists who told him that an ant or a swine might equally believe in the dignity of ant or the dignity of swine men were not ants or swine he would say coldly and he would classify the heckler as probably brainwarped by the extraterrestrial amazons in truth like most philosophers marvin never wrote explicitly about the one factor that really determined and explained everything in his philosophy just as marx never mentioned his carbuncles in das kapital and freud didnt publish anything about his own sexual hangups marvin gardens never wrote a word anywhere about the source and motive of all his theorizing this was his penis it was four inches long at best and it had given him a defeatist psychology about things in general and women in particular against which he had struggled mightily to build his philosophy of transcendental male courage the women he classified as extraterrestrials frightened him only a little bit more than the ordinary women he classified as terrestrials sometimes marvin wrote dialogues between pavlovs dog and schrodingers cat instead of between frank and ernest these were usually quite short and almost like zen stories dog ive got a million proofs that were not free cat ive got one proof that we are dog whats that cat who asks whats that amoebas the belief or unconscious conviction that all propositions are of the subjectpredicate formin other words that every fact consists in some thing having some qualityhas rendered most philosophers incapable of giving any account of the world of science bertrand russell our knowledge of the external world december natalie drest was amazed as the conversation swung in a new quantum direction you she gasped you dig krazy cat too indeed my dear blake williams beamed i may be the most devout student of herrimans work anywhere in the civilized world he didnt tell her yet that he regarded krazy as a symbol of schrodingers cat in the great wavemechanics puzzle even blake williams occasionally worried that he was talking over his audiences head but joe malik seeks purchase for an elbow on the back of the couch noticing the statue of the virgin of guadalupe in the corner alcove her foot pressed down on the head of the serpent he was wondering what the hell santaria was amazed as always by the blind skill of female fingers carol guiding him into her without looking down actually lying with her eyes closed as she reveled no doubt in strictly private fantasy am i paul newman woody alien that damned third exhusband first or second exhusband some damned high

coming now me coming no wife no whores no mustache and i love you joe malik gasped really believing it in that warm moment slowly coming back from the reverberation of her orgasm and beginning to gallop toward his own climax as she muttered darling oh darling paul newman exhusbands me me me me but natalie drest fifty blocks north was still objecting and i thought you were just some highbrow i am my dear a highbrow and a lowbrow and i suppose alas even a middlebrow a single ego as our friend malik was pointing out at the party tonight is a ridiculously limiting perspective on the universe williams smiled you mean like youve got three minds and one is a krazy kat fan and another is trying to study modern physics from an anthropological point of view what does the third mind do ah my dear that is the great work opening the third i what they forgot to kill said joe went on to organize what i like is the way offisa pup gets embarrassed about being a dog you know thats symbolism went on to organize offisa pup my dear is the superego went on to organize peter pan childhood innocence in a fine old mansion on lake shore drive markoff chancy toddled down the hall leading to the master bedroom he was dressed in a teddy snow crop suit and felt like a perfect damned fool oh well the money is good he told himself then he pushed the door open and entered the first rich persons bedroom he had ever seen there was as he had been told only one light behind the bed playing upward on the ceiling and shedding a soft glow by reflection the bed was made up covered with an expensivelooking heirloom spread beside it lit up nicely by the indirect light was the table bearing a single can of snow crop orange juice as he had expected and on the bed nude eyes tightly closed and pretending to sleep was his hostess chancy caught his breath judging from what he was expected to do he had been prepared to see a crazy old frump instead to his intense delight it was obvious that the lady was still fairly young quite well preserved and definitely stacked crazy she might be but how could he judge maybe it was normal for rich people to act out any fantasy that struck them but unappetizing she definitely was not although she was the first live naked woman he had ever seen she was no less strikingly golden and rounded than say a pussycat pussyette of the month a head of gloriously fiery red hair was spread on the pillow and below it her supposedly sleeping face was lovely in its peaceful anticipation his eyes swept over her rounded shoulders the two snowywhite breasts rising and falling with her respiration the cute nipples that stood in surprisingly large areolas upon those breasts the soft pillow of her belly and best of all the thick swatch of reddish fur that hid her sex and she had legs like a chorus girl shes waiting for mefor me markoff chaney experienced true happiness boldly he stepped forward and grabbed the orangejuice can an opener lay beside it and he quickly punched two holes his hands trembling a bitwhen the ladys belly moved with her breathing he felt his penis stir in the same rhythm then clutching the juice can in one hand he hoisted himself onto the bed catching her in a sudden smile but she was good at the game her eyes still didnt open carefully he lay beside her hip looking at those breasts those real d female breasts not in a photograph but right there in bed with him two of them by christ then with infinite delicacy he lifted the can and let some of the orange juice dribble onto her bush she sighed and a tremor ran through her he poured a little more and her legs spread voluptuously and she slowly raised her knees he was seeing it at last the outer lips and the cleft revealed as he had always dreamed of it the halo of reddish fur even more lovely than in his fantasies he dribbled some more orange juice and leaned over pushing the snout onto her bush and maneuvering his tongue into the cleft between the lips immediately she groaned and threw her legs over his shoulders pulling him deeper down into her crotch teddy she murmured youve come back we all live in our fantasy and only endure our reality he thought philosophically according to instructions he began a spiral licking motion working from the outer lips slowly inward around the inner lips and ending with the clitoris again she began to heave up and down like the loudroaring sea and his excitement grew as he imagined and participated in her sensations her hands were on the ears of his teddy snow crop f costume and she was pulling him down onto her frantically as she bucked upward literally fucking his mouth he began lapping her more rapidly quite distinctly tasting the musty musky femaleinpassion flavor mixed with orange juice oh your tongue your tongue she cried in me teddy in me the midget maneuvered his tongue into her vagina and bobbed his head in imitation fucking motions her legs went limp on his back then tight then limp again shes close to coming he thought rapturously im making a woman come at last he strained sticking his tongue farther into her maddened by the thicker and heavier taste of her and losing the orange juice can entirely in his passion he got both hands under her and lifted her ass drawing her pussy up to him sucking desperately as he plunged his tongue again and again deeper and deeper into her teddy snow crop she screamed insanely frodo bagginsh peter pan childhood innocence eat my pussy she was coming gushing like an oil well all the female juices of her flowing into his mouth and he nibbled the outer lips with his teeth eyes tightly closed riding on her crotch like a man hanging on to the edge of a cliff by his jaw muscles alone bucking and bouncing with her swallowing the essence of her womanhood the elixir and now after decades and decades of frustration finally coming exploding from the sheer lust of her soul communicated to him in every spasm and twitch of her passionate pussy he thought two things now theyre going to have to clean the teddy snow crop suit and iwonder if im still technically a virgin the rich economy galactic archives president hubbards first step in establishing the rich economy was to offer a prize of per year to any worker who could design a machine that would replace him or her when the primate labor unions raised twentythree varieties of hell about this plan hubbard countered by offering a year to all other workers replaced by such a machine the rankandfile union people fell into conflict immediately some accepting this as a fine idea this group consisting mostly of those earning less than twenty thou per annum and the leaders still hypnotized by the conditioned and domesticated primate reflex that employment was good and unemployment was bad while the unions squabbled among themselves and ceased to present a united front against the rich scenario conservatives mounted a campaign against it on the ground that it was inflationary here hubbards political genius showed itself she made no effort to reason with the intellectual conservatives who were all theologians in disguise all corporation heads and other alpha males of the right however were invited to a series of white house multimedia presentations on how rich would work for them the chief points in these presentations were that a machine works twentyfour hours a day not eightthereby tripling output immediately machines do not take sick leave machines are never late for work machines do not form unions and constantly ask for higher wages and more fringe benefits machines do not take vacations machines do not harbor grudges and foul up production in sneaky undetectable ways cybernation was advancing every decade anyway despite the opposition of unions government and these alpha males it was better to have huge populations celebrating the reward of to per year for group cleverness than huge populations suffering the humility of welfare with production rising due to both cybernation and the spacecities consumers were needed and a society on welfare was a society of very meager consumers the alpha males were still fighting among themselves about whether this was sound or not when it squeaked through congress within a year the first case of the new multiinventive leisure class appeared this was a cherokee indian named starhawk who had been an enginelathe worker in tucson after designing himself out of that job starhawk had gone on to learn four other mechanical factory jobs designed himself out of each and now had a guaranteed income of a year for these feats he was now devoting himself to painting in the traditional cherokee stylewhich was what he had always wanted to do back in adolescence before he learned that he had to work for a living by there were over a thousand similar cases many had gone on to seek advanced scientific degrees and some had already migrated to the l spacecities the swarming was beginning the majority of the unemployed living comfortably on a year admittedly spent most of their time drinking booze smoking weed engaging in primate sexual acrobatics and watching wall tv when moralists complained that this was a subhuman existence hubbard answered and what kind of existence did they have doing idiot jobs that machines do better some of the unemployed were beginning to seek jobs again after all or is better than usually they found that higher education was required for the jobs that were still available many were back in college adult education already a fastgrowth industry in the s was now the fastest growing field of all hubbard was ready to launch stage two of the rich economy satire the dialogues between frank hemeroid and ernest hemingway grew more turgidly moralistic as the s passed marvin was never able to bring himself to approach a sexual partner more alien to his own tormented ego than his right fist he sublimated ernest fear is in all of us and must be faced he who hesitates is lost he who confronts the fear is undefeated forever even if his body dies frank oh come off it the only reason anybody ever does anything brave is because hes more afraid of being called a nogood shit for running away ernest you pass a thousand heroes on the street every day and never know how well they are carrying their burdens frank i know the woman with the mongoloid child the blind man who makes you so uncomfortable the rape victim pulling herself together and refusing to go mad the dumb cop with a hernia yet who goes down an alley after a hoppedup thief who is also armed im not blind myself you only see their moments of heroism you dont choose to watch how blow follows blow until heroism becomes meaningless and they all give up one by one and join the universal chorus of despair ernest i have seen some who never gave up a pig squeals when he sees the ax coming a man can look right at the ax all his life and not squeal frank the ax falls anyway does it not isnt your refusal to squeal just a big act a gigantic lie its more honest to squeal with the other swine ernest i still decline to admit that men are no more than swine frank you are a romantic you old fool if you had been honest enough to squeal like the rest of the swine people would have seen the truth sooner every war since your day has been partly your fault you know if everybody squealed and ran away thered be no wars of course nobody wanted to publish this kind of ranting although it took marvin nearly ten years to learn that in he set out grimly to write the worst most tasteless most vulgar book possible he had arrived at that stage of psychological masochism where one must prove ones most pessimistic assumptions are true for the sheer delight of knowing once and for all that the universe is really a pisspoor proposition all around public taste is a misanthropists heaven and a humanitarians hell he said bitterly for his hero he elected a monster so monstrous as to be a mockery of all human hope but one so obscure that he did not possess any of the evil glamour that surrounds a hitler a nixon or a jack the ripper he picked vlad teppisvlad the impalera fourteenthcentury hungarian religious fanatic who had executed people for differing with his own extremely odd theological notions marvins novel not only justified vlad but positively glorifed him it was full of denunciations of liberalism permissiveness and the opponents of capital punishment it also had the most violent rape scenes marvin could conjure out of his misogynistic imagination vlad the barbarian was a blatant incitement to violence garbed in the most reactionary moralistic prejudices imaginable it was bought by the first new york publisher to whom it was submitted for a higher advance than albert speers memoirs or any of the confessionals of the watergate felons a movie sale was negotiated even before the book was released and john wayne starred as vlad looking really sincere every time he explained why murder and rape were the highest human virtues marvin was immediately commissioned to write a sequel vlad victorious actually because marvin really was in his own odd way a philosopher of sorts vlad the barbarian was not totally bad in researching it marvin had stumbled upon the enigma that makes vlad teppis somewhat interesting to students of the human mind in general and the rulingclass mind in particular the mystery was this two early approximately contemporary and seemingly authentic accounts tell one particular story about vlad but each tells it differently there is thus no scientific way of saying which account is true the disputed story is that two monks on a journey stopped at vlads castle one night and begged shelter from the elements vlad set out for them a magnificent banquet and then afterward asked them what the people of hungary really thought about him the first monk answered diplomatically and falsely that everybody said vlad was a stern but just ruler the second monk boldly told the truth that everybody said vlad was a homicidal maniac vlad thereupon had one of the monks impaled the problem is that the first seemingly authentic account says he executed the flattering liar and the other seemingly authentic account claims he executed the honest monk marvin left this mystery unsolved in his book and it was perhaps one reason that the novel became fashionable even with intellectuals everybody it appeared had some intuitive prelogical feeling about which monk a man of the caliber of vlad teppis would impale some were quite sure that a dingaling of that sort would kill the one who dared to tell him the truth others however were just as sure that vlad would find a special sadistic relish and a moral justification to boot in surprising both monks by executing the flatterer arguing about vlads choice as it was soon called spread from coast to coast what would you do if you were one of the monks was a favorite question in these arguments id do what the first monk did simon moon said in an argument with other programmers who worked with the beast id tell vlad he was the very model of a christian statesmanwhich in fact he was id tell the truth said markoff chancy on a greyhound bus just to prove that little men have big balls id lie dr frank dashwood admitted at a posh nob hill party in san francisco the most dangerous thing in the world is to tell the truth to a government official who is a primitive barbarian in fourteenthcentury transylvania or twentiethcentury america professor fred fidgets digits who always kept his connection with the warren belch society a secret and hence retained academic respectability finally published a paper in technology review analyzing the problem from the perspective of the von neumannmorgenstern game theory the monks in this context basically confront a problem in prediction each must decide before speaking what vlads reaction will be will he be grateful for an accurate report or angered by it every person in an authoritarian situation faces this dilemma daily and it haunts corporations armies and government bureacracies it is the classic disinformation situation digits concluded satisfied that he had identified the problem even if he couldnt solve it others pointed out the similar logic of the notorious snafu principle proposed by the eccentric businessman hagbard celine in his witty perverse little booklet never whistle while youre pissing according to the snafu principle accurate honest communication is possible only between equals and every power matrix is a disinformation situation since this seems to challenge the very principle of power and leads directly to anarchy many

anyone for one dollar just one single dollar you can have a copy of what religiosophy means the book that answers all the questions of philosophy definitely and scientifically pleasejustin shifted againi must for my cents the zombie went on still with no expression and with eyes unmoving you can have the scientific cure for depressions economic and psychological oh go shit in your hat justin growled in circuit two territorial language disappear get out of my way you creep this is free the zombie said passing him a fourpage pamphlet titled usura contra naturam est there is no need for competition brother justin looked at the pamphlet when he got home it was made up of quotations from thomas aquinas ezra pound b f skinner and dr horace naismith founder of the first bank of religiosophy the quotes from aquinas and pound condemned the lending of money at interest the quotes from skinner said that people could be conditioned to abandon any habitual behavior and substitute a new behavior the quotes from dr naismith urged everybody to join the first bank of religiosophy or at least to buy one of his books or pamphlets what religiosophy means the scientific cure for depressions economic and psychological jesus christs secret teachings about money and operant reinforcement the bible alternative to satans international bankers the streets were full of zombies at that time the religiosophists were the most robotic not for nothing had dr horace naismith founder of religiosophy spent five years studying with b f skinner at harvard the religiosophists had all been operantconditioned to be tireless proselytizers and blake williams had even invented a mathematical puzzle based on calculating the probability of crossing any american city without being accosted by one of them which turned out to be harder than the old problem of crossing dublin without passing a pub terran archives interest was a charge for the use of the circulating medium money primatologists have found similar money fetishism on hundreds of planets where hominid types evolved money and barter themselves are typical primate behaviors which can easily be taught to chimpanzees and other anthropoids in addition to aquinas pound and naismith early terrestrial philosophers who suggested more human alternatives to this apelike economics included thomas edison buckminster fuller c h douglas benjamin tucker and several others since primate behavior changes only under the impact of new technology moons first law the moneyandinterest fetish continued until the third stage of the rich economy abolished the need for a circulating medium the ganesha freaks were almost as android led by swami mammonananda they had also been conditioned to be superpersistent hustlers and to

about the vlad enigma gave birth to a general interest in problems of disinformation the prisoners dilemma was dragged out of heavy mathematical tomes and popularized the turing machine was reexamined in tabloid newspapers the empedoclean paradox even got mentioned on the johnny carson show two berkeley acidheads known on telegraph avenue as the cat and the dog dreamed up a more intense disinformation matrix in what would happen the cat asked one day in the cafe mediterraneum if we bought a truck and painted on the side of it international cocaine importers inc and drove it around the streets in berkeley the dog said the cops would just laugh theyd be sure it was another puton by the hog farm or the merry pranksters or somebody but in san francisco they wouldnt take a chance the first cop would stop the truck and search it nah said an unsuccessful poet named robert w anton theyre more hip than that in san francisco but in la the debate spread from the med to moes from moes to sather gate leapt the bay to appear in herb caens column eventually spread from coast to coast as a tagend poser to cap all discussions of the vlad enigma finally taking the logical experimental step a san francisco theologian named malaclypse the younger actually painted a truck in very tasteful and professional lettering and drove it around the bay area for all to see international cocaine importers inc limasan diegovancouver things go better with coke he was stopped and searched three times the first weekonce in sausalito which is the cocaine and vaseline capital of unistat and has particularly suspicious cops he was never stopped in berkeley after the second week he was no longer stopped in san francisco immediately a whole fleet of similar trucks began to appear disinformation had been incarnated all hail eris said malaclypse a pious man in his own odd way virtually none of the trucks was stopped and searched after the first month cops who had made horses asses of themselves in the joking phase of this uprising of surrealist politics refused to take the risk of being laughed at again nobody cared to guess how many of the trucks were really carrying cocaine it all became academic when victimless crimes were redefined in the code hubbard do not go gentle do not go gentle into that good night rage rage against the dying of the light dylan thomas galactic archives president hubbards way of encouraging the longevity revolution was characteristic she established a yearly reward of for the nonscientist who made the most important contribution to the fight against aging since the scientists engaged in lifeextension research were already one of the two most heavily funded groups in unistat the other was the space engineers scientists were amused but not offended by this wild idea the first year there were entries submitted a spot check by the beast showed that came from the new leisure classexworkers who had invented themselves out of several jobs and had to annual incomes the others came from people who had been unemployed by these inventions evidently many of them were getting bored with a life that consisted mostly of fucking tv and vacations even though that had been what most primates imagined they would do if they didnt have to work for a living the second year there were over entriesmuch as hubbard had expected the longevity revolution was having its inevitable effect people who were expecting to live for centuries instead of decades were spontaneously taking the next step in their thinking the hominids of terra were becoming reoriented to the search for immortality and a second trend was becoming obvious the majority of practical testable hyperlongevity proposals were coming in from the colonists in the l spacecities the domesticated primates of terra were beginning to consciously guide their own evolution toward becoming cosmic immortals to justin case it appeared that the administration was the first government in history to take beethoven seriously to him hubbards whole philosophy was obviously derived from the last movement of the ninth the darling buds of may since a cat has the buddha mind even marvin gardens had had his own experience of the first noble truth he had made the mistake once in of eating a heavy slice of hashcandy from afghanistan instead of his afterdinner snort of coke and somehow there was an eruption of activity in the grief circuits of the thalamus the tramp did not move he saw the skull beneath the skin like eliot the tears poured and he sat there weeping for allflesh for alltormented flesh for alltormentedfuckingflesh howling in anguish at the withdrawal of the nipple of selfabsorption he was in belsen he stood in the white light as hiroshima was incinerated he watched the grand army retreat in the snow from moscow the tramp fell eternally toward the sidewalk and he saw the wolves close in on the terrified caribou the smirk of caligula and all sadists everywhere the parents of a thousand wars weeping with him over murdered children we should be gentle with children a voice said reproachfully from a window in space and for a minute he had a crazy religious vision that we have to stop the killing there is no other way and it is too late for another alternative it is exactly that simple and you can even repeat it in italics we have to stop the killing and he was so excited at the sudden clarity of it that he could see his whole future as nonstop witnessing to the truth of this vision he would invent his own tv show and become a supersalesman and sell it to the top network and it would be the corporal works of mercy hour it would have no acts of violence or hurting it would just be decent people doing decent things as enumerated in the famous passage from aquinas visiting the sick and imprisoned feeding the hungry giving shelter to the homeless aiding the oppressed comforting the afflicted and praying for us all it was that simple beyond all the irony and agony of his tortured humor and you could even say it in one word ahimsa yeaaaay god glory glory glory he staggered to his desk to record this revelation but when he got there microamnesia had already set in and he couldnt remember what it was that had seemed so clear and important but another voice was coming through and he scrawled rapidly rough

dreaming about giving a lecture to an audience of transvestites the elements in the montage may be of any numberfive fifteen fifty whateverand there be any emotions you can imagine implicit in each one of them separately nonetheless the total emotional effect emerges from the montage not from the elements film is the visual demonstration of fullers synergetic geometry youre fuller shit one of the transvestites yelled who shit justin shit bullshit who shit he was being carried around by the timedwarfs in a jeweled chair wearing the crown of thorns it was mardi gras he was having a swell

secret of capitalism and ownershipthe cruel cross that separates inside from outside without windows but then he wet his pants and they were all laughing at him laughing mockingly and childishly as they closed in with the tar and feathers they had found out he was a nogood shit in other words blake williams lectures what collapses the state vector and er um determines or ah least ways brings it about that a new quantum state appears can only be a hidden variable implicate in the whole system the biggest whole system you mean when ignatz throws the brick if ignatz is a quantum physicist and is throwing a photon krazy or schrodingers cat can be in any of several eigenstates um yes so that in effect the whole universe participates in the ah decision as to whether the kat will be hit by the brick um ah or the photon ah as the case may be professor natalie asked finally driven to the edge are you putting me on my dear i am um merely giving you the most consistent and literal interpretation of bells theorem as developed by dr jeffrey chew at ucberkeley and dr fritjof capra in the tao of physics the whole universe decides well there is um a certain degree of metaphor involved you know professornatalie sits up and gives him a level glancei met a midget once a nasty little sonofabitch but he told me something i never forgot all that exists is metaphor he said and whoever controls our metaphors controls us as an anthropologist blake williams said i must agree are we living in an occult thriller a porn movie a philosophical treatise a scifi novel it depends on which parts of our experience we choose to highlight that brings us to the question are we writing our lifescripts or is there a hidden variable as the new quantum theories suggest you mean the whole universe will decide what were gonna do next natalie wanted a straight answer well um thats the alternative to saying there are multiple universes where anything that can happen does happen ah and its quite democratic really since every lesser system within the whole system gets its vote natalies semantic circuit was working on overload youre telling me that each of us and the chair over there and each atom in us and in the chair and in marvins cocainewe all get one vote um perhaps we have carried the metaphor till it staggers it sounds like mozarts music natalie said seeing the window again all as mechanical as a clockwork and yet as free as a dream hell galactic archives president hubbard had largely abolished crime by abolishing prisons this was one of her most astonishing achievements since most primates thought prisons were preventatives not causes of crime eve hubbard needless to say had always been a unique terran which was why she was the first black president of unistat although she was like most brilliant people extremely goodlookingthe genetic link between health hedonism cleverness and good looks the brighteyesandbushytails gestalt is true in all species on all known planetseve had dropped out of films after a smash success as the supersexed ebony android in gentlemen prefer clones she had gone on to major in philosophy at ucla and was almost denied her phd because her thesis was a thorough rejection of all philosophies hitherto invented by terran primates she went on to become one of the first neurogeneticists in fact it was due to certain discoveries in primate genetics that she had decided to go into politics next the code hubbard the most important revision of primate jurisprudence since the code napoleon divided all crimes into three classes crimes against conventionsocalled victimless crimes were not penalized at all a citizen could be interrogated about each behavior only after complaints by a minimum of one hundred neighbors the interrogators a group of trained neurogeneticists would then publish a report either mildly recommending relocation of the heretic or much more commonly strongly advising the neighbors to mind their own business many libertarians objected to this since they wanted victimless crimes abolished utterly hubbard had pragmatically realized that such libertarian penology was impractical until the primates totally outgrew the morality delusion those who chose relocation were assigned by the beast to an environment where their heresy was normal most of them found that the beast recommended an l spacecity and most of them liked it when they got there they had futique genes many of the heretics of course chose to stay where they were and go on annoying the bejesus out of their neighbors this is the typical recalcitrant streak found in certain domesticated primates on all planets crimes against property were regarded as improper economics requiring adjustment the felon was compelled to pay in full the value of that which had been appropriated or destroyed if unable to pay the felon then had a literal debt to society the government paid the victim and the felon repaid the government by working at half wages on some socially useful project such as longevity research space research or just as a forest ranger in the growing number of national parks that were appearing since industry was moved off the planet into free space crimes of violence were defined as the natural inevitable tragic but intolerable resultant of some combination of genes imprints and conditioning the biots who committed such acts were sent without condemnation but irrevocably to hell hell had previously been the state of mississippi after the aborigines were resettled in an environment suitable for twocircuit prehominid primates mississippi became hell by simply surrounding it with a laser shield that made escape impossible everything within the shield was intact the violent biots were free to do what they wanted and they soon had several forms of feudalism war piracy commerce slavery and other early primate institutions functioning in a manner that seemed normal to them many violent biots and gene pools moved to hell voluntarily since it was the only remaining part of the world that fit their notions of proper primate society among those who migrated en masse and established sizable governments or robber bands in hell were the ku klux klan the black panthers the american nazi party hells angels and most of the peoples ecology party john wayne nearly one hundred years old but

his precocity and wasnt surprised at the timing and the deed itself she had learned was par for the sons and the female servants of the best families on park avenue what was not normal was the passion that endured over several months and the extent to which she herself was picked up and carried by it soon they were sharing secrets just as if they were true lovers and equals not master and servant nails and glass in your shoes she asked him on the day that nazi tanks crossed the border into czechoslovakia i read about it in a book about saints that i got from the library on fortysecond street he said but thats crazy mon she was from haiti but it worked he said i saw jesus you saw jesus well he said bashfully that wasnt just from the nails in my shoes it was after i whipped my back with wet rope for six hours sophie gazed at him thoughtfully for a long time what you trying to do boy im learning how to live without fear he said simply you know my dad hes afraid of everything and everybody jews catholics bad omens the government a broken mirror you know i just dont want to live my life that way sophie thought about it for three days then she told him there was a man he ought to meet

had some acdc hangups when he conceived this fantasy sometimes professor you remind me of burroughs natalie said well i do admire much of his work especially the job williams was pleased by the comparison no the other one the guy who wrote tarzan edgar rice burroughs i remind you of edgar rice burroughs of something he said once he said that he had a lot of fun with his imagination and that he knew in a small way what a grand time god had in creating the universe joe malik didnt even believe in choronzon the skeptic within him had decided that the most operational model for those events which naive occultists attribute to choronzon was to classify them as synchronicities activated by the presence of the trickster god archetype in the jungian collective unconscious or learys neurogenetic archives or somewhere back down there in the thalamus or brainstem to assume even for a minute that choronzon had an objective existence beyond the archetype in the unconscious circuitry of the central nervous system was to collapse into prescientific theology and demonology but alas the skeptic was only one program inside the malik biocomputer and not at his best at moments like this the shaman tape began running in its own programs as the skeptic faded out and joe noticed again for the thousandth time how the ego circuit melded with the new program as easily as it had with the old so now he was joe malik the shaman son of a thousand years of sufis and if choronzon was really messing around he betta watcha his ass its that motherfuckin loa carol said angrily we didnt do the exorcism right choronzon was a mindconstruct of the primates specializing in the enochian version of cabalistic magick talking out of two sides of their mouths at once as was typical of primate mystics the cabalists said that choronzon was the astral embodiment of all the illusions and deception on terra especially all the egotism and malice they added that choronzon was also a part of the psyche of the student which had to be faced and conquered before illumination was complete when asked whether choronzon was then outside or inside they usually answered both this reply made no sense at all until g spencer brown published his laws of form a loa was a mindconstruct of those primates who specialized in santaria also called magicko de chango or voudon a loa just like the gentry might on occasion be kindly disposed but a guardian loa who was set on a woman to prevent her from copulating except with the primate who had through santaria createdprojectedcontacted said loa was well known to be extremely malign devious fiendish impish devilish and a royal pain in the ass the has like the gentry and the various cabalistic angels and demons operated beneath the spacetime continuum in dream time where the true free masons create reality friezes an archetype was a mindconstruct of a primate named carl jung who specialized in preneurological psychology an archetype existed at the psychoid level which was below that of individual or collective unconsciousness where the organic and the inorganic meld and merge into psychoid matrices which if nudged by the right archetype would produce a realityconstruct so astonishing that it would appear like magick or a very strange coincidence jung called these psychoid archetypal effects synch ronicities and marvin gardens coked to the

and one critic described her as having a special childlike quality reminiscent of monroe she felt a wave of vertigo on reading that if the doctor and the critic were not in cahoots to drive her over

before the brick can ever hit krazy it must first travel half of the distance from ignatzs paw to krazys head but before it can do that it must cover half of that distance that is to say a quarter of the original distance the fetus people john disk had originally become involved in morality and ideology due to the fetus people as pussycat genially labeled the antiabortion movement of the s the fetus people did not like this description they called themselves the right to life committee disk was in his teens then and had the usual hormones flowing through his adolescent primate body he thought he was continually tormented by sinful desires not understanding the role of testosterone in pubescent primates he was a member of the true roman catholic church a splinter group formed after vatican ii had taken the main body of the romish religion off into heresy and modernism the members were survivors of the irishamerican fascism that had once rallied behind father coughlin father feeney and senator joe mccarthy they regarded the english mass as being almost as sacrilegious as abortion and social security as only one step from stalinism the fetus people or the right to life committee was an amalgamation of true roman catholics with the kind of fundamentalists protestants seldom seen north of bad ass texas they were like all primate ideologists and moralists chiefly concerned with finding nogood shits and dumping on them they believed the abortionists were in league with all the other nogood shits including the rockefellers the international communist sex educators lifeextension researchers cattle mutilators nasa and the intergalactic black magicians of the illuminati under the leadership of the infamous cagliostro the great they also believed that the unistat government had never waged an unjust war that the hair of the seventh son of a seventh son cures warts and most of what they read in readers digest by the legal struggles over abortion were over and the whole issue seemed as remote as the war of the roses this was because a percent effective morningafter contraceptive had been on the market since and had proven so effective that requests for abortions had dwindled to virtually zero by the economic demand for abortions was about as microscopic as the demand for buggy whips in after every town in unistat had switched from horsedrawn carriages to automobiles another quantum jump in sociology had occurred actually the morningafter pill was a chemical abortifacient as any biochemist knew the biochemists never talked about this in public since they were all agnostic liberals and it was against their principles to either lie by denying the facts or to help the fetus people by telling the truth as a result of this policy by the biochemists only a handful of the fetus people turned their attack against the pill when abortion was no longer a live issue since the resultant of the morningafter pill was to the human eye no different from ordinary menstruation opposing this seemed exceedingly eccentric even for fetus people the majority of the fetus people deprived of their raison detre began splitting amoebalike into factions and subfactions some few of them who had really been concerned with the rights of the unborn became concerned at last with the rights of the born and launched new groups to oppose the surviving vestiges of war capital punishment or poverty in backward parts of the planet the majority who had been mainly preoccupied with finding nogood shits and dumping on them joined organizations like noodle national organization organized for decent literature and entertainment or the first bank of religiosophy john disk drifted into white heroes opposing red extremism a group mostly

staring into each others eyes like lovers are you hypnotizing him sandoz asked once not at all cagliostro said laughing hes hypnotizing me or maybe were just learning to get outside our own skins thats what life is all about you knowmaking windows breaking out of every box the failure of the students to shake up cagliostro led a few professors to come over and try various scientific devices not likely to be included in any standard verbal code he placidly identified rheostats wheatstone bridges ph meters bunsen burners and even a gyroscope the next night they were back with a chemical formula never before synthesized are you presently able to see the particular object that i have been given at this time the girl asked and the blindfolded cagliostro replied calmly a test tube with some blue liquid in it a copper sulphate compound thats a damned good code the professors agreed more fervently this time as they drove back to antioch theres no hope of salvaging anythingthe suicide note had saidand youre going to have to make it on your own just like i did rosenfelt has destroyed me and hell destroy free enterprise the carnival was in biloxi mississippi that winter and cagliostro was trying his new gig combining houdinistyle escapes with his mentalism act he had been locked in a trunk and the local police cooperatively used their best padlocks to secure the chains he settled down to slow regular yoga breathingthe escape actually took only a few minutes but he was following houdinis formula that the audience was more impressed if they had to wait a half hour for the miracle the yoga conserved the oxygen in the trunk against any possibility that panic toward the end might force him into rapid breathing he timed the breaths against a slow aummmmmm his mind drifted back to park avenue and a black maid whose framed picture of a catholiclooking jesus sometimes in certain lights seemed to have horns and he relaxed his hands and feet there can be no muscle tension in the torso if the extremities are totally limp bringing her face back clearly and he heard a voice shouting were at war the japanese went and bombed some place called pearl harbor in honolulu cagliostro was always carrying around a book called homo ludens in those days is that about faggots sandoz asked him once cagliostro laughed no he said its latin it means uh you know its hard to translate man the game player i suppose sandoz grinned you can learn all about that just by watching the marks he said i been a carny damn near twenty years now and i swear from the things i seen you could sit down with a blackjack table and a sign saying this game is crooked and half the marks would still sit down opposite you and try to beat you a mark wants to lose he concluded profoundly almost with anger no cagliostro said the mark wants to be hypnotized he wants to enter the world of magic with mirrors and blue smoke and shifting shapes and hes willing to be swindled just to have a glimpse of that world is that what that book says sandoz asked more or less cagliostro said in sociological jargon jumped by jesus december mary margaret wildeblood still couldnt get to sleep and the search for the historical vlad was pishposh she got out of bed and padded over to the desk to glance at the latest volumes that had arrived for review from caligari to vlad another pretentious volume of neofreudian film criticism by george dorn obviously cashing in on the current fad rot the radical epistemology of smokey stover hmm marshall mcluhan again try a page and the notary sojac sign

reveals hm skip a bit refusal to recognize dialectic of capitalist blah blah blah a really sinister note enters with the chauvinist caricature of montana wildstack blah blah beneath the sentimentality a ruthless determination to subjugate and humiliate women mary margaret realized that she was getting horny again any reference to subjugation and humiliation was likely to trigger that response in her she stealthily removed the vibrator from the bureau drawer again climbed back into bed with patterns of fascist art and then remembered a little bit of hashish left in the living room perhaps a diagram would help blake williams said getting a sketchpad and drawing rapidly this is ordinary causality as we usually experience it he said as natalie stifled a yawn a causes b which causes c and so on i go to wildebloods party at a and meet you and we come here to b and we discuss krazy kat at c which leads to schrodingers cat at d got it yeah the gutenberg fix the linear mode as mcluhan calls it right you are now quantum causality before the appearance of the epiphenomena of space and time functions entirely differently if we trust bells theorem it looks more like this and williams sketches rapidly a causes b c d and e but b also causes a c d and e and c causes a b d and e and so on got it all before the appearance of the spacetime manifold you mean it works everywhichway in time no it happens before time itself appears along with space as a byproduct of the quantum mesh brrrzzzzzzmmmmbrz the vibrator purrs along as mary margaret surrenders again to him to him starting to compose a poem almost crush me in your dionysian biceps jesus lord but that was perhaps a bit too hopkins and the reality of it was beyond poetry heresy she could never admit that in literary circles but the thrust and the purr and the agony and the ecstasy of it lord lord lord because she was remembering an old sufi proverb about the three stages of the path which were lord use me and then lord use me but dont break me and then lord i dont care if you break me and he was breaking her smashing her annihilating her the great magician of the tarot naked on the bed as she rammed hir cock up his

invented relativistic ego therapy williams says meaning i created the course youre that professor williams my god youre famous at the new school natalie was impressed and at esalen um yes my dear but

and in some of which it will not oh wow wow indeed to paraphrase descartes t think therefore i am confused escapism the first fame of cagliostro began while he was touring with the uso during the war he had entirely abandoned mentalism by then and his act depended entirely on escaping from everything the mps could devise to restrain him variety called him the new houdini in just a few months before hiroshima his first arrest occurred in the fall of that year possession of marijuana the charges dismissed without a trial his agents connections the crane family lawyer the fact that the crane fortune had not been wiped out entirely when orgasmor dropped to the bottom of the big board and judicious oiling of what show biz and underworld people call tin mittensofficials on the take contributed to this happy consummation he was one of the first guests on the ed sullivan show but was never asked to return due to a morals arrest the girl was quite young and an act against nature was alleged once again money changed hands and there was no trial his career was mostly in the clubs after that hollywood and tv were both in one of their chronic contractions of cowardice at the end of the decade a second morals arrest followed rapidly by a second pot bust made him a little too hot for most club owners stillthe crowds turned out wherever he appeared the mob decided to set immediate money against caution and he was allowed to go on working until his disastrous appearance before the house unamerican activities committee in youre not a communist you hardly know any communists you could have sung like a bird without hurting yourself his agent said afterward why did you have to do it baby listen crane said angrily do you think i can get out of a rucking set of junior gman handcuffs if i let one single jot of fear get into my head you dont understand i cant let anything scare meespecially not shitheads like them its your own funeral the agent replied glumly ill tell you the plain and varnished facts youre gonna end up like chaplin two sex scandals two drug scandals and now this youre gonna end up worse than chaplin youre boxoffice poison baby from this day forward the head revolution galactic archives although the head revolution transformed the terran primates at the time of this ancient romance nobody knows when it actually began some trace it to certain alchemical cults of the early dark ages some say it did not properly start as an organized movement until neuropharmacology began to replace oldfashioned psychology in the late dark ages ie just before the time of this epic novel some try to find its origins in primitive shamanism and yoga what is clear is that some primates on terra began to transcend genetic fourcircuit limitations many centuries or even millennia before true neuroscience appeared among them whether this was due to mutation empirical hitormiss experimentation with alkaloid herbs or other factors is unknown in egypt and china and other places a few primates reported fifthcircuit rapturesthe dawning of neurosomatic consciousnesstwo thousand or even three thousand years before the space age began the picture is the same on all planets a few biots suddenly rise above the eatitorfleeit imprints of the amphibian biosurvival circuit above the dominateorsubmit imprints of the mammalian territorialemotional circuit above the eitheror logic of the hominid semantic circuit above the good and bad values of the tribal sociosexual circuit they have transcended infantile feeding programs childish emotional programs adolescent philosophizing and adult responsibility pack role all at once what has happened of course is that these biots have formed a fifth circuit in their brains this is called the neurosomatic circuit because it allows conscious feedback between the nervous system mind in prescientific primate language and the soma body in the larval stages of this hedonic revolution every planet exhibits the same monotonous pattern mysticism and monomania appear many of the mutated biots become convinced that they control everything the iamgod syndrome not realizing that they merely control their own perceptual field miracle healings are reported the neurosomatic mind body feedback loop allows the mutant biots to become healthier youngerlooking and sleeker handsomer than average they soon believe and are encouraged by their admirers to never doubt that they can cure anything neurosomatic intolerance appears the mutated biots grow annoyed and become extremely critical about the robot mechanisms of firstcircuit approachavoidance secondcircuit dominationsubmission thirdcircuit either orlogic and static fourthcircuit sex roles they call on everybody to float free like themselves or like the wind the other biots usually declare these fivecircuit mutants to be divine or else they kill them sometimes they do both the condition was just becoming understood on terra at

awakened for at the foot of his bed there stood a little green man in a miniature nasa spacesuit i am apollon of mars he said come with me at once there is no governor anywhere hugh crane served his contemptofcongress sentence at lewisburg federal penitentiary the gentlemans club as the maf calls it where the government incarcerates those ritzy felons who are not likely to shiv a guard or climb a wall he worked in the library with alger hiss they both watched the famous checkers speech on the tv in the rec room this was a masterpiece of primate oratory in which a vice presidential candidate named richard nixon argued that huge sums of money given to him by various businessmen were not intended as bribes and were not expected to result in reciprocal favors on his part as an old carny man mr hiss asked mr crane what do you think of that performance the dog shtik was very good crane said professionally but he left out mother another distinguished guest at lewisburg that year was the aging idaho poet and folk singer ezra pound who was also in for unamerican activities he and crane never got along well because pound who had seldom been outside idaho distrusted all easterners crane performed yoga exercises every day in his cell the illuminati of course subsequently scanned the notes he kept on these neurophysiological experiments the most interesting items were the following april it helps if you identify each letter of aum with one of the three gods of the hindu trinity a is brahm the creator let it explode upward from the diaphragm like the big bang of creation itself u is vishnu the preserver hold it so long that it vibrates like the rhythm of life the big beat of beethovens seventh m is shiva the destroyer close the lips in a decisive bite of this is the way the world ends as you enter the silence may today unexpectedly pure dhyana it was so much simpler than i ever guessed and it is obviously a matter of practice no wonder the yogis say that its dangerous to do this without a guru i am no better or worse morally and no wiser or more spiritual repetition is the whole key force the nerves and muscles and glands force them day after day and it happens the chief function of the guru is to ensure that you dont take advantage of the new freedom too quickly and get yourself in trouble with the authorities the guru doesnt help it happen at all as the honest ones admit you do all the work yourself the guru just makes sure that the rapture flows into safe domesticated channels without such a moral watchdog i am free to do as i bloody please i just realized why all the real occult schools are so damned secretive why the ordinary seeker is given a lot of doubletalk and ejected out the same door wherein he came if everybody could do this the whole world would be in continuous revolution may another successful dhyana theres nothing to it really the brain obviously operates on the same principle as those fellows in the hunting of the snark what i tell you three times is true three million times is more accurate it was marvelousbetter than the first timeand ill never identify with cagliostro the great or hugh crane or even me or the perpendicular pronoun ever again i can see more and more clearly why all this is sealed with seven seals and hidden behind all kinds of mystification society as we know it is based on torture and death or the threat of torture and death i am in here to be tortured although the authorities will never admit that what they do with heretics in other countries is torture what we do here is penology the cage experience is profoundly punishing to the average human as to any primate it is the form of torture our society countenances it is no torture to me only because i have learned certain neurological arts every stage magician learns but if everybody could go into dhyana at will nobody could be controlledby fear of prison by fear of whips or electroshock by fear of death even all existing society is based on keeping those fears alive to control the masses terran achives dhyana was the sanskrit name used by the hindic primates to describe the opening and imprinting of the neurosomatic circuit the term and the techniques of inducing it became chan in china and zen in japan it was always supervised by an alpha male for the reasons crane suspected it represents the dawning of postprimate consciousness and the head revolution thereby rendering the biot independent of the primate dominancesubmission hierarchy ten people who know what i know would be more dangerous than a million armed anarchists july i can hardly write today i reached samadhi it makes dhyana look like nothing by comparison all my certainty is gone i should be terrified but instead im ecstatic if this is possible anything is possible these notes were not published when hugh came out of prison instead he brought forth a book cheerfully titled there is no governor anywhere which explained somenot allof his magic escapes and set this in the context of a philosophy which declared every individual a creator of his own universe the polemics against government and organized religion were tactless to say the least for a performer depending upon public goodwill crane did not hesitate to identify his outlook bluntly as atheism and anarchism to everybodys surprise including cranes the book became a bestseller and he became the most controversial man in the united states even in the fearful fifties even with american legion and john birch chapters constantly reminding everyone of his drug arrests his sex arrests and the documented fact that prison authorities had delayed his parole because of his homosexual seduction of a younger inmatehugh crane acquired a new following tv gingerly tested him on the egghead ghetto of sunday afternoon then promoted him to the latelate talk shows terran archives samadhi was the hindustani name for the opening and imprinting of the sixth metraprogramming circuit in the frontal lobes of the postprimate brain most of those who achieved it before the head revolution were just as bewildered as crane and could say only that the experience was ineffable he managed to end every appearance with the words there is no governor anywhere you are all absolutely free and around thento the vocal dismay of press and clergya club owner decided he was a freak act theyll hate him but theyll come and crane was able to work as a magician again the crowd overflowed into the street and many were turned away cagliostro introduced a new escape from a lead box that had been welded closed in view of the audience there is no restraint that cannot be escaped he told them in an intense tone we are all absolutely free a pudgy broadway columnist named benny benedict who was just starting to get a following interviewed him the next day how the hell did you manage that weldedbox escape benedict asked bluntly i used real magic the great cagliostro pronounced come off it benedict said but cagliostro merely grinned at him impudently the ordeal of rhoda chief when rhoda chief became the countrys top rock singer at the age of seventeen in her education was virtually nil she knew very few facts and several dozen factoids the long side of the triangle is called the hypotenuse and is equal to both of the other sides or one side multiplied by the other or something like that what she had in her panties could make a lot of money if she was smart or a lot of trouble if she was dumb if you spit on an eraser it will erase ink columbus did his trip in and they either started the revolution or finished it in lincoln freed the slaves if you yell loud enough nobody can tell if youre on key or off were all gonna get blown to hell by the bomb sooner or later yellows make all your troubles go away but the reds are the ones to take before a concert or a recording session after her abortion she learned enough about birth control to teach a course at the ywca after being screwed blued and tattooed by two record companies in a row she also learned enough about contract law to teach that at harvard her real education began when she became the mistress of cagliostro the great the first one to see the whip marks on rhodas back was an old friend from arkham high school doris horus why dont you leave him doris asked its voluntary rhoda said stonily its my true will the scandal eventually became an official rumora nightclub nostradamus previously involved in other sex and drug offenses is treating his balladbelting sweetheart in a very sick way readers of a certain french marquis will know what i mean was its first printed form in the nations most widely read gossip column youve got quite a reputation as a sadist epicene wildeblood the literary critic said to crane the very day that appeared afraid to be identified with me publicly crane asked they were in wildebloods jetset pad on sutton place oh not at all darling eppy purred how funny that i should know what you really are dont i babe he lifted cranes chin with the toe of his shoe yes master crane mumbled oh that sounded a little sullen i think youre just a bit rebellious today babe that must be punished yes master crane said going to the closet for the ropes after he was stripped and lying face down on the bed eppy carefully tied his four limbs to the four bedposts you are my slave and you cant escape he said i am your slave and i cant escape crane repeated as wildeblood mounted him both of them perfectly aware that he could slip the knots at any time crane took rhoda to the rainbow room that night and made a point of loudly and brutally humiliating her throughout the meal she accepted it all her hundred most intimate friends and enemies in the room noticed with disapproval as if he had hypnotized her rhoda actually took nearly a year to discover what was happening to her it had started with a routine roll in the hay but in the middle of it he lifted her to an unusual position what the hell is this she asked tibetan angel he said softly relax and youll enjoy it she relaxed and it was the most extraordinary sexual experience of her life after that for two months she followed all of his instructions with growing delight and a firm belief that she was approaching that ultimate orgasm the mailer fellow was always writing about then one night he brought out the ropes now wait a minute she said thats english thats kink go to london if you want that i love you he murmured his mouth moving south across her belly toward her bush in a little while she agreed to the restraints he tied them very firmlyand then to her relief no weapon was produced he didnt even produce his own weapon it was entirely oral after five orgasms she found him sitting up and lighting a joint in a minute he held it to her own lips for the big one he said she toked hungrily while he kissed and caressed her and muttered endearmentsbut she could still feel the ropes when the joint was finished he finally mounted her and galloped into some dimension of spasm she had never known before god she said coming back to herself that was the big one but he was reversed again his mouth on her snatch and her head spun the mild discipline began a few weeks later it builds up the charge he said and she found that it did soon she agreed that stronger discipline built an evergreater charge when the sadism switched to a psychological level she was too far gone to stop living in a dark and pulsating cave of ecstasy and pain millions of lightyears from common earth she accepted degradation humiliation and the growing vampirism which seemed calculated to slowly destroy her last remnants of ego once or twice she remembered later she had feebly protested enough too much please no he shouted were at the edge weve got to go all the way over yes master he would be saying to epicene wildeblood a few hours later whatever you wish master you could have lots of bookings instead of just working in public terlets his agent told him i could get you in topmoney rooms people would forget those drug charges and those teenaged girls if you didnt keep reminding them by being even worse the way you and rhoda carry on in public everyone thinks youre a kink and you and that faggot wildebloodeveryone thinks youre a touch lavender yourself buddy why dont you straighten out for christs sake youre going to end up a beggar remembering possibly a previous incarnation hesse at the station in zurich the mescaline ja the mescaline is the great teacher and crowley in berlin the question is who is it that seeks the true self all so long ago so far away and richard jung saying i am an accountant i dont buy any of this mysticism begging on the street near the old granary where paul revere and the original five lie buried rancid the butler mama sutra weeping among the corpses at chateau thierry please jesus dont let me die dont let me die the boy who was to become cagliostro the great heard youre going to end up a beggar and looked back and saw the tramp falling to the ground very slowly like the tree he had seen fall slowly after being chopped by the caretaker at the upstate crane country home and just like the tree when he finally reached the sidewalk the tramp didnt move at all not one bit he even seemed to get stiff like the tree did only faster on your knees cagliostro said sternly and rhoda obediently crossed the floor on her knees ask for it he said i beg you master she said to stick your cock inside my cunt and fuck me and make me come again and again and again oh please master he lit a cigar pretending to deliberate and then blew smoke in her face no he said i want you to suck me off nothing at all for you tonight but a few nights later when he was on top of her and inside her and chanting in tibetan she suddenly thought she saw a kind of light around his head and two horns sprouting on his temple and then it was like a million balloons bursting inside her and outside her at once each balloon releasing a twinkle of light each light a species of orgasm rhoda chief ceased to exist eternities later reentering time she found he was again at the bottom of the bed head between her legs licking ferociously she fainted he had a large library dealing with both stage magic and occultism and rhoda occasionally browsed in it the next morning while he was still asleep she went back to it and searched in several volumes by rosenkreuz therion lambacchus prinn dee and kelly the mass of the holy ghost was variously described but the rose of ruby was always identified with water and the first h in jhvh the h of motherhood the cross of gold had different meanings too but was chiefly fire and the j of jhvh the j of fatherhood bringing the j and the h i together the wedding of cross and rose produced the manifestation of the holy ghost in the form of a eucharist which was then consumed by the alchemist my god she thought the cross is his cock and the rose is my cunt thats why he goes down on me afterward as well as just before the eucharist old prinns words said blandly is both male and female both living and dead both fire and water and yet its creation involves no violation of nature but merely obedience to natures own laws together with the proper spiritual attitude professor nosferatu of columbia an old friend of rhodas listened raptly as she recited the words to him thats not tibetan whatever he told you he said he repeated it with correct pronunciation io pan io pan pan io pangenitor io panphage its an invocation of the god pan in classic greek io pan io pan pan io panallcreator io panalldevourer he looked at her curiously you know ive heard some rather odd rumors about you and him whatever youve heard she said with a faint smile is probably true i want you to give me the name of the best shrink you know i want somebody to work on my head and help me to stay away from him trade aids galactic archives after the rich economy had revolutionized the lives and expectations of unistaters on and off terra eve hubbard realized that the time was now ripe to abolish poverty entirely she did this by declaring every citizen a shareholder in the l spacecities and distributing national dividends every year again hubbards political genius was evident others who had proposed such a plan in the past eg the engineers c h douglas and r buckminster fuller the inventor tom edison the semanticist alfred korzybski the physicist frederic soddy had assumed such dividends would have to be money this proposal in that form always aroused heated opposition from the alpha males of the banking business who understood well that an expanding money supply would lower the interest rate seriously threatening their profits hubbard called her national dividend tickets trade aids a term devised by a public relations firm she had commissioned to make the idea palatable to domesticated primates trade aids were like money only in that they could be exchanged for commodities or services they were unlike money in that they could not be loaned at interest the bankers kept their monopoly on the interest market and were mollified trade aids were also unlike money in that they could not be hoarded each ticket was dated and lost value at percent per month after the issue date becoming totally valueless in one hundred months or eight years and four months there was thus a builtin incentive to spend the trade aids as soon as possible when the first trade aid dividends were distributed it turned out that even the poorest unistat citizens had the equivalent of for that year in purchasing power even though the tickets were not called money citizens with that much purchasing power have huge demand in the economic sense of ability to buy the economy expanded more rapidly than ever with new businesses springing up continually both on terra and in the spacecities the rest of terra was soon copying these innovations the socialist countries most slowly and grudgingly by starvation had been eliminated everywherejust as had been the goal of the hunger project started by a california primate named erhard back in the s by then hubbard had been out of the white house for six years and busy again at genetics and longevity research she often said to friends that her whole political career had been merely an experiment in altering the parameters of primate sociobiology to cross again december simon moon toked at his pipe pulling the hash deep into his lungs floating with it december had been a hell of a day ubu and knight and the other guys from the fbi had been all over the shop demanding to know why the beast couldnt tell them any more about the missing scientists and warning ominously that president lousewart was personally concerned and so on and so forth the usual governmental craperoo simon only stayed on the job for the sheer pleasure he got out of working with the beast fucking up the government from within but even that pleasure was wearing thin and he hopped a suborbital to new york just to be away from everything washingtonian for the holidays he exhaled a fog of cannabis molecules and returned his attention to his favorite bedtime reading browns laws of form to cross again is not to cross it must have been the hash but suddenly that simple axiomatic statement was fraught with new and urgent meaning a knights move on the word processor would switch f to n the fbi to the nbi abolishing knightness in the process only the quantum inseparability principle would explain why furbish lousewart went away in the same rotation simon found that he had wandered or teleported from the bedroom to the toilet and was staring in absorption at the sink the two handles one saying h and the other c seemed to have enormous cabalistic meaning connected perhaps with the fact that joe malik had been jo malik before the collapse of the state vector of course outofthebook experiences are not yet recognized by orthodox science the parapsychologists who dare to speculate about such things are ritually torn asunder and dismembered by marvin gardens in the back pages of the scientific american still this does not discourage simon moon who is after all a close associate of the beast and hip to the programmers trade secret that all that exists is information everything else is mammalian senseimpression and thus hallucinatory besides simon is doing it right now and can see in one instant in the twinkling of an eye the total contents of the novel a miracle of microminiaturization in the frontal lobes as the metaprogramming circuit clicks into action the novel was called the universe next door it existedwas bought and sold and loanedin a supercontinuum called the united states of america which was unistat enlarged into other dimensions everything in the novel was inevitable as everything in the supercontinuum containing the novel was inevitable everything that happened in unistat had to happen as everything in the united states of america had to happen that which was above was precisely reflected in that which was below to cross again was not to cross so all right joe malik said staring at simon through a triangle are you just trying to scare me to death or do you have a message for me simon was on the balcony of mary margaret wildebloods apartment again and somebody was staring out at him in horror my god its bigfoot simon reentered the form and contemplated it civilization was destroyed by nuclear holocaust in may because furbish lousewart was a certain kind of man and franklin delano roosevelt stuart was a certain other kind of man and they were what they were because of genetic programs and accidental imprints and conditioning and some learning and because of the society around them and that society was the resultant of various conflicting historical and neurogenetic causes and lousewart became president because of a thousand other factors only one of which the accident at three mile island in was itself the resultant of thousands of factors including the usual struggles between the engineers and the financiers and to explain stuart you would have to start with the institution of slavery six thousand years earlier and everything in the novel was inevitable as everything in the supercontinuum containing the novel was inevitable and yet simon had escaped from the novel although not a member of the warren belch society simon moon was of course aware of the theory that there was a universe somewhere in which bacons major works were still attributed to somebody else simon naturally was not imaginative enough to conceive that in that universe bacon had died of pneumonia while conducting experiments in refrigeration in simons usual universe the author of novum organum the new atlantis king lear etc had lived on to discover the inversesquare law of gravitation and isaac newton was remembered only as a somewhat eccentric astrologer in another novel midway between the old universe and the new simon himself had been shot dead by a chicago cop during the democratic convention of over there bacon had been bold enough to admit publicly his high rank in the invisible college illuminati and had been beheaded by james i for heresy in that universe not just civilization but all life on terra came to a very hideous end in because the president was constipated one day and made the wrong decision their technology was so advanced that half the solar system went nova along with earth in the next universe simon explored we were saved because a redhaired tantric engineer named babs lashtal gave the prez a firstclass gradea blow job in the oval room at am relaxed his tense muscles pacified his glands soothed his frustrations and inspired him to act relatively sane for the rest of the day he did not push the button thereby preserving millions of species of living forms on earth and thousands of microscopic species on venus babs lashtal of course was regarded with contempt by all rightthinking people who had no idea that they owed their lives to her skillful extraction of presidential spermatozoa by means of tender gentle gracefully rhythmic kissing licking and sucking of the presidential wand even if they had known about it the rightthinking people would still say babs should be ashamed of herself the whole novel was rather didactic simon decided it was written only to prove a point never underestimate the importance of a blow job it had been necessary to write such a novel because the people over there were so ignorant and superstitious they still called tantric engineers whores and other degrading names every universe is inevitable but there are as many universes as there are probability matrices the metaprogrammer chooses which universe he will enter there is a love that binds it all together and that love is expressed in primate language as the love of a parent for a child so simon was not surprised to find tim moon pervading everything or at least a kind of continuous tim moon potential that could be encoded again in another book or that could remain latent for long times vaguely permeating every book there were hundreds of thousands of other wobs there frank little and joe hill and pat murfin and neal rest and big bill heywood and they were all singing like an outlaw hallelujah chorus though cowards cringe and traitors sneer well keep the black flag flying here and dad himself spoke to me i swear it saying just tell them this son capitalism is still nothing but a shit sandwich the more bread you have the less shit youve got to eat and the less bread you have the more shit youve got to eat tell them all and yet that seems to mark the experience as braingenerated the style is simonpwer not timpater even if the idea is most certainly something old tim moon would want to communicate a collaboration perhaps between the part of tim moon that lives on in simons memory banks and the part that lives eternally in the mind of the author of our being hey wait before you turn the page and get into the next section i want to say one more thing those faucets on the sink mean something every time i stare at them in deep meditation i almost remember something important two faucets on a sink one saying h and one saying c remember h c thats important the e continues to fall the gypsy switch the future exists first in imagination then in will then in reality eve hubbard in spring while a mr oswald was ordering a carcanomannlicher rifle through the mail hugh crane was in cambridge meeting with a famous psychologist who had recently been ejected from harvard for original research and poor usage of the first amendment it takes you beyond the body rapture of marijuana crane asked thats the least of it said the psychologist it takes you into something like the parallel universe of science fiction im beginning to think theyre parallel neurological universes or different styles of headgames games crane said lifescripts novels the psychologist suggested trying other metaphors i dig it crane said quietly how soon can i try this lysergic acid diwhatsit diethylamide how soon crane repeated youve got a very willing guinea pig dr frankenstein gary grant had already told all the showbiz columnists that this magic chemical had changed his whole life for the better cagliostro typically went further and began urging its use on everyone when the backlash struck he and the researcher who had initiated him and a few other researchers and a couple of famous poets and novelists were widely denounced as high priests of the drug cult he became a favorite topic for the sunday supplements and the more oxlike mens magazinesany hack could make a lively story by rehashing his pot arrests his morals busts the rumors about other sexual oddities his public advocacy of lsd and anarchoatheism his mantra there is no governor anywhere and the increasingly popular speculation that his escapes were actually performed through black magic it was a disappointment to all the people who loved hating him when he suddenly married the screens best known sex goddess norma nelson and settled down to what appeared to be a very monogamous and unnewsworthy fidelity trip norma herself was delighted that all those rumors about his sadism were obviously untrue their sex life was quite normal and the mass of the holy ghost was performed without restraints she discovered also the basic secret of his escapes he never accepted a challenge at once always jetting on urgent business to another part of the country and only taking languid notice of the wager casually accepting it with total cool a few days later the interlude she found was spent in duplicating the conditions proposed and finding the gimmick that would work and the misdirection that would distract attention at the crucial moment she also learned the essence of the okanna borra or gypsy switch which is the basis of almost all magic and most con games the people who thought their own screws bolts and chains were used in cagliostros escapes were as mistaken as those who think the handkerchief with a hundred dollars that they give the gypsy for blessing is the same handkerchief that comes back to them she also learned what alchemy was all about i thought that was all superstition she said once pointing at his shelves of old books on the transmutation of elements the mass of the holy ghost the cabala and the elixir of life we do it almost every night he smiled you have the cup and i have the sword solve et coagula divide and unitethats why i have to go down on you again at the end the mystic number that means us two becoming one in the peak and the falling into the void youve got the triangle and i cause the physical manifestation within it you mean its all a code why did they have to hide it those who didnt got burned at the stake he said read about the witches and the knights templar sometime he also began teaching her the tarot now the fool corresponds to aleph in kabala the ox or bullgod dionysus but aleph is the path from keser to chokmah and therefore the holy ghost or semen the magus is beth the house or templethat is the path from keser to binah the womb do you really think youre going to live forever she asked him once if not he said ill die trying wise guys and nebbishes when simon moon was appointed chief of the computer section at gwb he immediately junked all the personnel tests then in use and replaced them with a onequestion test of his own devising based on the vlad enigma applicants were simply told the story of vlad and the monks by an interviewer and asked which monk vlad impaled those who said vlad impaled the lying flatterer were classified as nebbishes by simon they were the kind of fools who still despite all evidence to the contrary regarded government and those in authority as honest and just they would tell the truth to superiors they were hired at once an office full of eichmanns and galleys simon said proudly not one of them will ever question an order or ask an embarrassing question he could program endless anarchy and they would never suspect it because he was above them in the pack hierarchy those who said vlad impaled the honest monk on the other hand were rejected for employment at gwb simon called them the wise guys and secretly arranged for a recruiter from the discordian society to contact them later they didnt believe a damned thing government said or did had heretical opinions on dozens of subjects and usually smoked dope they emphatically did not belong in a bureaucracy sometimes simon called the nebbishes homo neophobia and the wise guys homo neophilia but that was in another novel simon didnt even know if he was still working with the beast in this novel he was becoming identified with the form some things remained constant under the transformation of the knight movemarvin gardens still had his paranoia and his vlad the barbarian books the missing scientists were still missing simon was still a mathematician mary margaret had said so at the party even though he was only dimly there this time around but some things had altered considerablyjosephine malik was joseph malik fdr stuart was an editor instead of a revolutionary hubbard was president instead of lousewart but all that was trivial simon got out his pen and began jotting in the margins of laws of form the important things he had learned in his outofbook experience a novel or a universe is a whole system who we are and what we do depends on which novel or universe we are in every part is a function of the whole it is very hard to remember the whole novel or universe because our horns wont fit the simon stared at the page losing the meaning of mooning forgetting the question itself as attention narrowed to this single page this paragraph this hotel room in new york on the morning of december barely able to remember even a few pages back or a few pages ahead the window closed the key was no key havent you heard mans inexorable though hardly remorseless drive to divinity is taking new noninstitutionalized forms this comes down to the simplest of propositions the species must solve the problem of death very soon blow itself up or blow its mind alan harrington the immortalist when norma became pregnant cagliostro turned into the stereotype of an ideal husband canceling bookings to be with her joyously supporting her decision to employ natural childbirth teaching her yoga to supplement the lamaze conditioning techniques employed by her obstetrician he filled her room with flowersand with photographs of the moon some of his occult studies were involved here she realized one night the phone rang and when crane answered it epicene wildeblood purred im in hollywood for a week and i guessed you might want to see me you guessed wrong crane said sorry new trip this year normas labor began prematurely and the doctor quickly discovered that the baby was in the breech position after a few hours he realized this childbirth could never be natural she accepted the ether and he performed a caesarean only to find the infant in turning had strangled on its umbilical cord oh god she said when she awoke and the doctor told her oh what a lousy god to make a world like this cagliostro was caught by a gaggle of reporters coming out of the hospital how do you feel was the first question how the hell do you think i feel where will the service be held there will be no religious service cagliostro shouted hopping into a cab havent you fools heard yetgod is dead it made headlines and inspired editorials one editorialbereavement is no excuse for blasphemy came to the attention of a fourteenyearold boy john disk who was tormented by desires which his priests told him were evil when cagliostro returned to the clubs his act had changed considerably the mildly satirical patter between escapes had become bitingly mordanthes a new lenny bruceand entirely centered around his declared philosophy of anarchism and atheism the escapes themselves changed each night because he explained them and showed how they were done as the climax of every performance now you know how i fooled you he would say try to figure out on your own how your congressmen and clergymen fool you there is no restraint that isnt selfimposed you are all absolutely free the evening after the newspapers broke the story that he and norma had joined joan baez in refusing to pay taxes a drunk began heckling him during his act why dont you go back to russia you commie dope fiend that sort of thing no man living hates socialism more than me cagliostro said intensely he and norma were busted for possession of acid a few weeks later this is hard to fix his lawyer told him youre too notorious now the only chance i see is for you to vow to reform lament the error of your ways and promise to go on a lecture tour speaking to teenagers about the evils of drugs then maybe i can get you a minimum sentence maybe hughs old friend the boston psychologist was in exile in nepal having fled a thirtyyear sentence in texas political offenders in general were having a rough time in the united states ill think about it he said the very next week he led the showbiz contingent among the protesters at the democratic convention a photograph of him being teargassed outside the chicago hilton is still reprinted whenever an article about him appears youve had it his lawyer told him as an officer of the court i cant tell you what i really think an unethical attorney were he here would frankly advise you and norma to get the hell out of the country but a change came over unistat when hubert humphrey the new president withdrew all the troops from vietnam and began granting amnesty to political prisoners cagliostro and norma in the midst of the return to liberalism received suspended sentences for the acid and he was not tried with the chicago nine for conspiring the convention riots the irs raided their bank account for the tax money instead of prosecuting them and by he was listed as one of ten top moneymakers in show biz his escapes were the american society of magicians announced in an award better than houdinis his habit of explaining each miracle after the performance only built up crowd interest for the next challenge bump in the night sput sputnik was sleeping alone at last visions of dollar signs danced in his head as he dreamed of a miniature sled full of barrels of beer she nu it he had it ra hoor cooed it right jolly old selves but overall there was a smell of fried onions because of janes chains gains clanking up and down again sput turned in the bed moaning slightly as the brains danes chains came clanking back and forth again and there was a russian spy named igor beeforshot and there was minor

thumping and the bumping and the chainrattling continued he was wide awake now and he knew it was no dream something eldritch and unholy right out of gothic fiction was banging at his bedroom door and then for the first time in his life he actually heard an eerie laugh just like in the books and it was actually coming through the door walking right through solid wood a greenish oldish spectral chainrattling thing jesus nelly sput gasped this sort of goingson only happened in books not in real life sput sputnik came the hollow voice right out of an echo chamber he thought yes he breathed

militancy a new crusade make the world safe for immortality will be the cry segerberg the immortality factor on may cagliostro and norma were in mexico city on a vacation at lunch she held up a twentycentavo piece and said isnt that the same as the design on back of the dollar its masonic he said the mexican and american revolutionaries were both predominantly freemasons what does it mean anywayan eye floating above a pyramid he started to explain about the third eye and the pineal gland and then noticed that she wasnt listening theyre waiting for you she said in a mediumismic voice john disk in read cagliostros notes on the next three days very carefully i refused to believe it i put her to every possible test whenever the voice spoke looking for evidence of autosuggestion and selfhypnosis i found evidence of autosuggestion and selfhypnosisnaturally i also found seventeen things i couldnt explain most central was the fact that the message when i finally encouraged her came in enochian a language which nobody understands since all we possess are the nineteen fragments received by dee and kelly in the seventeenth century yet she gave me nineteen new fragments and translated them and the grammar and vocabulary are consistent with the deekelly scryings even if she had studied the dee and kelly fragments which she swears she hasnt concocting new sentences in that unknown language would be beyond the power of any human brain or even of any known computer the nineteen fragments of enochian translated by norma in the same trance in which the fragments arrived became the nineteen chapters of the aquarian gospel crane wrote in the introduction it is impossible to doubt that these are the communications of a superior intelligence if the reader is as i am thank god an atheist the identity of that intelligence will pose severe mysteries is it interplanetaryor interstellar a being leaping across time from some more advanced future or past atlantis does it come from dimensions tangent to but not identical with our own i propose no answer to these questions but i am sure that this intelligence or others like it sent the messages which founded the great religions of the past and that such communications are the foundation of the belief in beings called gods norma was killed in an automobile accident the day the book was publishedwhat further proof do we need a prominent clergyman wrote in his syndicated newspaper column that this foul and obscene revelation comes from a source not divine but diabolical cranes firstand onlyfailure to escape from a challenge box occurred one month later the eye operation came later that year i can save one the doctor told him but not both a blind magician is worse off than a deaf musician and im not beethoven crane said simply do the best you can he retained the sight of one eye much as we are inclined to sympathize the new york daily news editorialized we do admit to a strong feeling that there is divine retribution in the tragedies befalling drugcultist cagliostro the great the aquarian gospel was burned by a citizens group in cicero illinois that week these powers whoever and whatever they are crane wrotein unpublished notes which john disk read years later weeping are determined that i abandon all else and become no more than the servant who carries their message to this end they are taking away from me one by one all the things i love or perhaps i am merely in the terminal stages of a longbrewing paranoid psychosis hugh crane celebrated his fourteenth birthday in by climbing into the bed of the familys black maid sophie hage who introduced him to voudon the group in harlem at that time actually combined elements of voudon and masonry since voudon was already a blend of european witchcraft and african magic and masonry is a mixture of elements from rosicrucian mysticism and french revolutionary free thought there were actually four traditions involved and the rite of initiation was unique borrowed from the third degree of masonry it replaced jubela jubelo and jubelum with the grand zombi and since marijuana was involved the ordeal became as real as in those days when candidates knew they would be killed if they failed in a dark cellar on th street the grand zombi demanded reveal the secret word or i will kill you reveal the secret word and give up your quest for truth and power hugh repeating the formula taught him replied kill me if you must but i will search again for truth and power as soon as i am reborn the grand zombi black face above a black robe raised his sword do you fear me now mortal he screamed i have eternity to work in hugh replied according to rote why should i fear then die screamed the zombithe part of the rite which had not been explained to the candidate in advance and hugh felt the sword cross his neck and saw the blood spurting he also saw the bulb which the zombi squeezed to make the blood spurt out of the end of the sword and he understood the manufacture of reality and power completely transformation december marvin gardens was awake again the downers hadnt fully taken the edge off the coke excitation he had turned the radio on but the only thing worth listening to was handels messiahthe fourth time he had caught parts of it this weekand they were in the middle of he was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief not quite what he needed at this hour with the early morning manhattan permeation of suicides and accidental overdoses skulking in the shadows he wished they would get on to the hallelujah chorus marvin found a book hed never finishedthe autobiography of cagliostro the great he opened at random and started reading get a a job my father said turning back i saw the beggar falling to the ground obviously fainting from starvation but when he landed i knew from his limpness that it was more than a faint that he was dead it has sometimes occurred to me that there is a parallel here to the famous experience of the buddha who like myself had the misfortune to be born rich and only discovered what life is like for most people when he encountered a beggar and a corpse is this parallel an accident i am not sure i cannot say when i was elected or drafted to receive the aquarian message the great affirmation that all is joy in contrast to the buddhas equally true equally false but now obsolete all is sorrow we never see what is in front of our eyes my father did not see what happened inside me when that beggar died i have brought men and women to the edge of the vision by various tactics and they afraid to see it ran off to psychiatrists its really very simple to remember the order of the ten planets blake williams explained to nataliejust memorize the sentence mother very easily made a jam sandwich using no peanuts mayonnaise or glue got it mother very easily made a jam sandwich using no peanuts mayonnaise or glue natalie repeated dubiously thats all williams said proudly you just use the initial letter of each word as a mnemonic and youve got all ten planets mercury venus earth mars the asteroids saturn uranus neptune pluto mickey and goofy wow said natalie disneyland in the skies who the hell was that carol christmas asked breathlessly as the triangle finally faded sure didnt look like a loa to me she added frowning thoughtfully it was simon moon joe malik said also somewhat breathless i knew him in another universe or another novel or something carol stared at him you wigging she asked bluntly no joe said i think im beginning to understand the trap were all caught in and how to get out of it damnant quod non intelligunt god told john disk to kill cagliostro the great it was that simple after all who would dare to disobey the voice of god himself god had been talking to disk for nearly a year now the voice had been rather faint at first and john even thought it was the devil for a while because it kept telling him he was damned it said he was damned because he sinned sometimes when he was asleep it said many silly and blasphemous things but john realized later that those weirdities had been the devil trying to jam and confuse the communication for when the voice became strong and constant there was no doubt at all that it was god it told john that he had been especially selected because of his virtue and purity and it never mentioned what happened sometimes when he was asleep it told him he was the only twentythreeyearold male virgin in unistat the last true christian not perverted by pussycat and the sexual revolution and black magic it told him he had earned much merit in heaven for his selfless activities on behalf of the antiabortion movement in the s and white heroes opposing red extremism since then it really loved john and it never stopped telling him he was the most important man on the planet because he had been selected at first it didnt tell him what he had been selected for but every time he read a news story about some new blasphemy by cagliostro the great the voice of god would say this man must be stopped it was only toward the end of november that the voice became increasingly explicit and said directly that he john disk had been selected to terminate the foul existence of the infamous devilworshiper cagliostro even then the voice was almost drowned out by the voice of rhoda chief the scarlet woman of rock chanting hickory dickory dock id like to suck your cock and other diabolical voices howling no wife no horse no mustache and sit down when you want to pee and other nonsense like that the devil was trying very hard to keep disk from hearing and believing the word of god he wanted disk to think he was going crazy but the voice of god got louder and more powerful and drowned out the others and nobody who heard it disk knew could ever doubt that a voice so wise and powerful was anything else but that of the lord god himself john made sure of course he spent a whole night praying beating his back with a bundle of wet stinging cords just like hed read in a book about the saints from the public library on fortysecond street he kept saying lord have mercy on me a sinner at dawn jesus appeared with a halo and told him exactly how to find a pawn shop where he could buy a gun without the legal impediment of acquiring a permit then he turned into a huge red triangle through which the impassive face of a lion stared at john and then it was all mirrors and blue smoke until he actually found the pawn shop and got the pistol the devil was determined to protect his servant cagliostro so john found the mirrors and smoke increasingly getting in his way in the following days he would be on his way to theology class at fordham when suddenly all around would be thousands of hippies of all nations and a voice would be singing this is the dawning of the age of bavaria or he would be in a yellow submarine floating over a gigantic submerged pyramid or he would turn on the religious channel on the wall tv the only one not full of smut and filth these days and find linda lovelace doing that disgusting thing to somebody named marvin gardens but he continued to pray and more and more the voice of god would drown out all these nets and snares of satan finally on the morning of december the voice of god told him to go to central park west where cagliostro was living and wait on the street the voice told him that as a reward he would be allowed to sit at the left hand of the father in heavenjesus would keep the right hand but the holy spirit was being demoted to an auxiliary rank with the virgin so that he john disk could be given the third highest position in all paradise when he got to the school book depository and walked toward the box seat in the ford theatre sex mutilators and cattle educators howled at him and he realized that the devil was still trying to deceive him and he prayed harder and harder until it was clear that he was really on central park west and the man walking toward him taking a morning constitutional was the diabolical cagliostro a chameleon on a mirror and the class of all classes that were similar to it but he prayed and got the pistol out of his pocket almost seeing the grand zombi and his sword breathing harder now because the devil was trying so hard to confuse him and the interviewer wanted to know which monk vlad impaled john disk held the gun in a trembling hand and looked into cagliostros icy eyes oy have you picked the wrong black magician cagliostro said in a stageyiddish accent john disk fired five times into the heart the gate of chinatown opened mass landing justin case was released from the flying saucer in the middle of central park he was still rather befoozled mentally and unsteady on his feet so he staggered to the nearest bench and sat quietly watching them take off his wristwatch said which seemed plausible it is the morning of december he said aloud tomorrow is christmas it seemed necessary somehow to get the simple things cleared up first of all before dealing with the mysteries things like this didnt happen to new york music critics they happened to farmers in iowa or fishermen in arkansas or other such unsophisticated types and besides they were hallucinations justin watched the flying saucer disappear across the sky reminding himself that it was a hallucination but still their words rang in his ears it is time for your species to join the galactic community justin finally got his mind and legs and various organs working together well enough to walk he headed for central park west hoping to find a cab at fiftyeighth street he saw a newsstand the headlines glared at him like tibetan demons worldwide ufo flap mass landings reported and in a corner the inevitable surrealist tag line to such a night mayor of chicago arrested sodomy with boar hog alleged as justin stared at those remarkable messages he heard five rapid pistol shots from somewhere nearby music drifted toward him he found himself absently putting the words to the melody he knows when youve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake he hastily bought a newspaper and hailed a cab he was going to go right home and for the first time in his life break his rule against drinking in the morning when he was drunk enough to stop trembling it would be time to decide whether to report his experience or let those who had already talked take all the heat crown point crown point jail in indiana was called the escapeproof jail when john dillinger was brought there in may on the day dillinger destroyed that name by escaping an outofwork vaudeville magician was begging in central park new york one thought burned in this mans head with a little luck i could have been a second houdini and that was what he was thinking as he fought the hunger cramps and laid his spiel on tom crane when he felt the ground move in that big wobble of uncertainty he remembered suddenly the everbranching tree of life as memories of adam weishaupt and mohammed and insects and trees flooded through him a million balloons bursting inside him and outside him at once each balloon releasing a twinkle of light each light part of the infinite ladder of light and he was watching himself die in horror and ecstasy through the eyes of a little boy how did my karma ever land me here he thought as he died and the boy heard him thinking the elephant annals of general psychiatry may in short the wave of delusion mania and hallucination that occurred over the christmasnew years holidays last year can only be attributed to the paradoxical nature of the unconscious where previous mass hysterias have occurred eg the endoftheworld manias of the middle ages the orson welles martian invasion broadcast of the cause was obviously the tensions stresses and fears of those times this latest eruption coming in the midst of a time of progress optimism and rising expectations can only be explained by freuds great discovery that opposites are equal to the prelogical unconscious mind ambivalence principle in other words high hopes like high anxieties can unleash the dreaming mind into the waking state a besetzung md annals of general psychiatry june the categories of hallucination or delusion do not fully cover the phenomenonwhich to some slight extent is still continuing the mayor of chicago hallucinated the beautiful princess isis from venus who seduced him in his fantasy life but the witnesses at the stockyard insist that he was sodomizing a quite real hog at the time mars is as inhospitable to life as venus but a prominent music critic has told this author in private of an abduction by little green martians out of s science fiction but this obviously hallucinatory experience does not help us understand how the man was transported from his apartment on twentythird street to the middle of central park where he heard the shots of a murder that never occurred one of the blind men cured by the virgin of perth amboy had been examined at johns hopkins just one week earlier where the optic nerve was found to be irreparably dead so that this is not a matter of hysterical blindness cured by hysterical faith but of real blindness cured by hysterical faith b gilhooley md ufo reporter january as the christmas miracle continues to accelerate worldwide it becomes more obvious than ever that the old concept of aliens coming here in spaceships just cannot account for it even those most committed to the spaceman theory must admit in the light of the recent events that the sciences involved in what is being done to the human race are primarily psychic or parapsychological if space beings are doing it whatever it is they must be doing it by what i can only call vaguely psychotronic technology and they could be doing it for all we know from their home planets without physically traveling at all by the same token we have no need to posit spacemen at all since whoever or whatever is doing this could be as close as the psychology department of some obscure university or the mindcontrol sector of any intelligence agency human minds are being manipulated on a massive scale that is all we know and all theories about the manipulatorsterrestrial or extraterrestrialare mere guesswork j lacombe phd ufo reporter march the idea that the christmas phenomenon is being done to us by some agency terrestrial or otherwise is based on the categories of indoeuropean grammar and aristotelian logic which modern physics has long known to be inadequate a taoist or a hopi indian for instance with a different semantic set might regard the events as a cosmic happening or growth process without trying to isolate out one part of the universe as the cause and thus relegating the rest of the universe to the dependent position of the effects modern quantum theory at least since bells theorem would suggest strongly that these holistic chineseamerindian concepts are more accurate maps of what is happening than the linear acausesb sequences of aristotelianism does this mean that we abandon the search for a cause not at all it merely implies that looking for humans or superhumans who did it is as fruitless as the medieval search to explain each oddity as the work of angels or demons we should seek the cause in the quantum structure of life and of matter itself b williams phd national enquirer june of all the perplexing pixiedom that continues to trail in the wake of the christmas miracle the most baffling thing to showbiz people is the continued absence of cagliostro the great the idea that the magicians disappearance was a publicity stunt calculated to cash in on the other mysteries beginning that amazing morning eight years ago has long since been abandoned as cagliostro continues to remain hidden wherever he is the most bizarre sideline of this story concerns john disk the man who claimed to have murdered cagliostro although held by the new york police for some months disk was finally released when no body could be found and the clothes discovered on central park west and identified as cagliostros were free of bullet holes disk we have learned is now an officer of the first bank of religiosophy and refuses to talk about his experience that mad and mysterious morning nobody would believe me he told our reporter you have to go to chinatown and see it yourself galactic archives to understand what happened to the primates of terra in the s a metaphor may be useful charlatans jongleurs wandering minstrels stage magicians etc on all primitive planets employ a device known as a trick top hat this appears to be an ordinary hat and looks empty to the audience but it actually contains a pouch out of which all sorts of amazing things can be made to appearrabbits yards of brightcolored cloth glasses of water and in general whatever the magician wishes to produce for the delight and amazement of his audience this ritual like all rituals and religious visions or ecstasies is actually a memory of the future but there is no way for primitives to understand that consider the epistemological plight of the terran primates at the time of this ancient romance they knew that they were made of molecules which were made of atoms which were made of subatomic particles which were expressions in spacetime of quantum probability matrices this knowledge alas was so recent that it had never been integrated into their philosophies or into the rules of their social games like religions politics economics etc their whole social realitytunnel was based on prequantum superstition and ignorance the sociological nexus was euclideanaristoteliannewtonian even maxwell and einstein had only been digested by a few over twentyfive hundred years earlier one mutant primate laotse had written the greatest is within the smallest less than oneone hundredth of one percent of the terran primates were capable of understanding this before they looked for causality everywhere else some known as astrologers scanned the distant stars others known as marxists scanned economics etc they knew that the physicists understood causality better than any other group on their planet but few of them even among the physicists realized how quantum theory applied to their own behavior quantum psychology did not begin to emerge until the s what was known in their planet as bells theoreman elementary kindergartenlevel discovery routinely divined on every planet at about the same time as atomic energy and space travel are beginningwas only twenty years old among them and barely understood even by the physicists the few quantum theorists such as sarfatti who dared to speculate about macrocosmic quantum effects large systems engaged in quantumjumpingwere usually dismissed as romantics by their colleagues despite the fact that each stage of metamorphosis of every living creature including the terran primates themselves was obviously a quantum leap the primate mystics most of them braindamaged endlessly told the other primates to look within most primates assumed in primitive aristotelian fashion that what was within was some gaseous entity which they called mind or soul unable to find such an abstraction they either gave up in despair or took their negative results as a positive revelation and became adherents of the nomind or noego philosophy of buddha and david hume of course if they had truly looked within scientifically they would have found that their thoughts percepts and realitytunnels were determined by the structure of the primate nervous system which was determined by the genetic or molecular design of the primate evolutionary script which was determined by the laws of quantum biophysics that is concretely their brains were shaped by cells shaped by molecules shaped by atoms shaped by quantum probabilities since the quantum connection is nonlocal it is inevitable that introspection and meditation could discover no ego within within and without are euclidean parameters that do not apply to the quantum world but the primates could not understand this when due to trauma masochistic religious practices alkaloid herbs or mere statistical chance their neuroatomic circuitry propelled them into quantum consciousness they could not conceptualize that they were outside spacetime entirely space and time they still thought even after einsein were as solid as walls they could only imagine primate fashion that they were traveling in space and out of their bodies they called it astral projection and devised numerous primate superstitions about it similarly when one of them would begin to learn how to use the metaprogramming circuits in the forebrain they could not conceptualize that they were peering into alternative quantum probability matrices instead they devised a whole mythology of heavens hells purgatories astral planes fairy lands demons gods angels ufonauts etc to make euclidean maps of such quantum experiences we should be charitable to the terran primates all planets have gone through such superstitious stages before the head revolution is complete among them when the neuroatomic circuitry only occasionally released during most of their history began to function fully in the primates could not begin to understand what was happening for all of the above reasons they were suddenly in communication not just with one realitytunnel but with all possible realitytunnels they could see quantum probabilities leading to all possible futures but they were unable to conceptualize what they saw the primate brain always quick to cover ignorance with a primate archetype projected all their traditional superstitions on

to the discovery of nonlocality as they shared more and more in oneness with all that is and all that can be and they understood of course the timehonored allegory of the trick top hat which was just

him in the drink as criminals said letting him sink slowly down amid the sharks and barracudas down where after the sharks were finished the king crabs would pick what was left on his bones down down down full fathom five and as was inevitable now mavis motioned him out of the car stepping out behind him still holding that damned tommy gun as if quietly toying with it like the ghoats in hammelts we wait here she said the others go back what are we waiting for dashwood asked dont be a dummy george we rescued you remember like the gauds in ambers dashwood took a deep breath counting to ten why do you keep calling me george you know my name is frank dammit mavis opened her eyes wide pretending astonishment you really dont remember she said sadly a woodpecker landed wearily on the nearest palm as if he had flown more missions than yossarian and never intended to go up again im frank dashwood he said dr francis r dashwood im a member of the american psychiatric association im in whos who goddamnit he added irrelevantly but heatedly youre george dorn she said you work for confrontation magazine your boss is named justin case oh balls dashwood said the woodpecker turned his head as perhaps was sure to happen now and watched them suspiciously like a paranoid old man and dashwood noticed as for the first time an unfinished building on the beach probably a new condo with girders

personal identity is just a social fiction so youve lost your ego for a few minutes and grabbed hold of another one thats how you created this imaginary frank fernwood dashwood he corrected automatically going home from here isnt easy mavis said still toying with the tommy gun some people never find their way back thats why you must let go out of this frank fernwood delusion its dashwood dammit dashwood fernwood dashwood she said impatiently deep down you know youre george dorn you are a fruitcake mavis why did you rescue me from that jail anyway youre wanted she said simply by whom hagbard celine and who is hagbard celine they had reached the cabana and were standing beside it glaring at each other like two chess masters who each suspect that they have wandered into some idiotic permutation of the ourangoutan opening the woodpecker turned his head probably a bit puzzled himself and sized them up with the other eye youll know when you meet him george frank he shouted george she repeated firmly for now its enough that he wanted us to get you out of bad ass jail and why the hell does hagbard chelling celine she corrected celine then why the hell does hagbard celine want to

cantonese at this hour men are created by earth earth is created by the universe the universe is created by natures process and natures process just happened mavis translated dashwood was not going to get involved in aleotoric cosmologies so hagbard celine just happened he said and he just happened to want me out of bad ass jail and you just happen to like busting into jails with tommy guns and taking prisoners out this is the silliest damned routine i ever heard well mavis said grinning wickedly i also just happen to like you in fact ive had the whites for you ever since i broke into the cell back in bad ass and caught you lourding off dont talk dirty he said its not becoming to a young woman your age and its getting silly and oldfashioned it makes you sound like a refugee from the s nonsense mavis said it gets you excited it always gets men excited to hear women talk like this do you know how i felt when i saw you there on the bunk with your rehnquist in your hand it made my feinstein go all warm and mushy inside george frank he said one more time and i dont have the whites for you women with tommy guns dont turn me on at all are you sure mavis asked provocatively ill bet i could make your rehnquist stand up if i really tried she opened her trenchcoat and he could see her magnificent brownmillers bulging through her tight sweater he had to admit they were a fine firm pair of brownmillersa pair you could hang your hat on as an irishman had once saidbut he was not going to be tempted this was all too weird ive had a lot of tension since raiding the jail mavis went on slipping the trenchcoat to the sand i really need a good potter stewart george wouldnt you like to potter stewart me wouldnt you like to lie on the sand and stick your great big pulsating rehnquist into my warm moist feinstein this is ridiculous listen george mavis went on intensely when i was young i decided to save myself for a man who completely meets the criteria of my value system thats when i was reading ayn rand you see but then i realized i could get awfully horny waiting for him to come along youll have to do how can you keep the facts clear and sharpedged when this happens you really want me to potter stewart you right now on a public beach in broad daylight he asked feeling like a fool the woodpecker went to work above them just then banging away like a rock drummer dashwood remembered from nutley high school the woodpecker pecked on the outhouse door he pecked and he pecked till his pecker was sore george youre too serious dont you know how to play did you ever think that life is maybe a game the world is a toy george im a toy you conjured me out of your fantasies while you were lourdingoff in that jail cell last night im a magic voodoo doll you can do anything you want with me dashwood shook his head i cant believe you the way youre talkingits not real i always talk this way when im horny it so happens that at such tender moments im more open to the vibrations from outer space george is the tooth fairy real is the thought of the tooth fairy a real thought how is it different from the mental picture of my brownmillers that you get when you imagine you can look right through my sweater does the fact that you can think of potter stewarting me and i can think of potter stewarting you mean that we are going to potter stewart or is the universe going to surprise us the universe is going to surprise you dashwood said i dont trust women with tommy guns who rave about tooth fairies and vibrations from outer space im getting the hell out of here he started to walk away listen george mavis said earnestly you are about to walk into a completely different universe one you might not like at all every quantum decision creates a whole new spacetime manifold oh bullburger he said before she could go any further with that gibberish you damned fool youre walking out on the greatest adventure of our century she was almost shouting now atlantis illumination leviathan hagbard celine dashwood kept going you asshole she screamed youre about to miss the best steinem job of your life he almost turned then but this was all too bizarre for him he continued down the asphalt road grimly ignoring the yellow submarine that was beginning to surface offshore blake williams galloped past him suddenly riding a horse with no wife and no mustache he was lassie who was really a male dog in drag but he was also dashwoods father like the gutmanhammett then furbish lousewart came out of the lavatory wearing a laboratory smock the masses are female he sneered drawing a rotary saw out of his toolbox depository he methodically began sawing off dashwoods head give me head he screamed the whiteness of the wall gothin haven annette colp us give me head and then linda lovelace was there with draculas old redlined cape starting to suck him starting to suck the purity of essence from him biting down hard hard hard a bloodsmeared mouth with canine fangs and he woke up he looked at the alarm clock blearily still haunted by fangs and blood sixfiftyeight the alarm would go off in two minutes i am frank dashwood all that other was just a dream he depressed the alarm switch and put his naked feet on the cold floor so he would not roll over and dream he was going to work fangs and blood why do people see such films weird species we are dr dashwood staggered to the shower white tile white on white the whiteness of the wall vibrations from outer space she said not too hot now careful ah thats good watch that it doesnt heat up too fast

columnist for the new york newstimespostheralddispatchexpressmirroreagle sat down to write her daily streamofconsciousness according to her usual procedure bonny began by flipping through her notebook this usually served to fructify her imagination but that day proved rather sterile items which had already been used were crossed out with large xs and what was left was weary stale flat and unprofitable there was literally nothing timely or exciting enough for a lead bonny was only stumped for a minute then she remembered the ancient maxim of the great pioneer of modern journalism charles foster hearst if there isnt any news invent some ms benedict whose hair would have been gray if she hadnt decided it was more chic to bleach it pure platinumwhite had lasted in the news game for forty years she did not lack the faculty of imagination bonny inserted a fresh sheet in the typewriter and began at once trusting her years of experience to guide her what emerged was who is the man in hong kong who looks exactly like lee harvey oswald believe it or not darlings that question is causing a lot of excitement among the members of the new senate committee on congressional committees on assassinations in case you forgot theyre the ones who are trying to find out why the various congressional committees on assassinations couldnt find out anything what theyre asking each other is could the man in hong kong really be oswald and if so who was the double that got shot in dallas doesnt it make your heads swim that was what was known as a failsafe item if as was likely the senate committee simply ignored it rather than fan the flames of rumor many readers would believe it on the grounds that it had been printed and not denied if on the other hand the committee did deny it even more people would believe it a psychological survey had shown that percent of the population experienced uncertainty indecision suspicion or downright paranoia whenever they saw the words government denial in print bonny went on to use up the nottotally dreary items in her notebook jazzing each one enough to give it a coat of sparkle or at least of tinsel but she still needed a zinger for the closing she followed the sage advice of the prophet hearst one more time and wrote wasnt that furbish lousewart of the purity of ecology party eating steak and drinking manhattans made with southern comfort my dears at sardis last night what would the party regulars think of this flagrant disregard of poe principles bonny in her youth had been a disciple of the famous feminist and psychologist alberta einstein it was ms einstein in her epochmaking neuropsychology who introduced the concept that every brain constructs a different islandreality from the billions of signals it receives every minute this concept had revolutionized the social sciences and even led heisenberg to propose a similar relativity principle in physics bonny knew that the poe people lived in an islandreality where eating meat and drinking fermented spirits were atrocities comparable to ax murder or burgering in the well this item would make them hopping mad a columnists career depends on amusing most of her readers most of the time and making some of them hopping mad some of the time the ownerpublisher of the new york newstimesirc was polly esther doubleknit relict of the late dacron doubleknit the leisurewear king when the leisurewear fad had peaked in the s dacron had shrewdly used the cash flow to diversify as his accountant called it engulf and devour his competitors called it when he died dacron owned over a thousand retail stores coast to coast a tapioca mine in nutley nj a bad investment that one suggested by a plausible but machiavellian midget a large hunk of canadian forestland three south american governments his leisurewear was thereafter made with very cheap labor sixteen congresspersons three senators a shipyard in yellow springs ohio suggested by eva gebloomenkraft seven state legislatures together with four other whorehouses in nevada and the new york newstimesusw dacron died of a heart attack at fiftytwo brought on by anxiety about the amount of political corruption he was involved in dacron did not like to bribe public officials and hated the size of the bribes they all wanted because he had been raised a presbyterian unfortunately for him he lived in an age of terminal bureaucracy and there was absolutely no way no matter how many lawyers he hired to find out if his corporations were in any given instance in violation of the law there were too many laws and they were written in language that guaranteed maximum ambiguity all around so that lawyers who wrote the laws could always get jobs proving that the laws meant yes if they were being paid to prove that or that the laws meant no if they were being paid to prove that dacron never found out for sure whether he was one of the businessmen in the country operating percent legally all the time or if he was in violation of so many statutes that he was subject to over a thousand years in prison no two lawyers ever would agree about that so dacron bribed as many officials as possible to protect himself and then gradually worried himself to death about the bribes being discovered someday polly esther finding herself the heir of dacrons farraginous empire quickly appointed professional executives to manage most of it but she took over the newspaper personally she was a fan of a tv show called low grant and rather fancied herself as becoming another mrs pynchon mrs pynchon was the publisher of the paper on the low grant show she was tough enough to eat barbed wire and spit tacks but she was also cool and elegant polly esther wanted to be like that she also had a secret desire to be the other mrs pynchon the wife of the novelist she had read one of pynchons novels once while dieting and maybe she had used just a little bit too many of those diet pills because she believed every word of it she was still convinced that the baskets on the street saying waste meant we await silent tristeros empire naturally polly esther believed both of bonny benedicts fictions of the day she had long suspected that both oswald and lousewart were agents of silent tristeros empire polly esther was about fortytwo but she could easily pass for thirtytwo this was because she was very rich once a year polly esther went to a ranch in nevada which looked like a luxury motel and treated its guests like the inmates of a concentration camp they fed polly esther on a diet what would barely sustain life and tasted horrible they made her exercise several hours a day a brutal staff insulted her mocked her bullied her and got her back on her feet again running every time she thought shed drop from exhaustion they also shot her full of gerovitol methamphetamines and vitamins three times a day they charged her fiftyfive hundred dollars some of this actually had a slight effect on her body but most of it was directed at her mind she came out of this twoweek ordeal each year convinced that she had suffered enough to deserve to be beautiful for another fifty weeks she was indeed beautiful and had been a flaming redhead for so long that only a few people in xenia ohio remembered her as a darkhaired girl who had to leave town because of a scandal in the local baptist church choir the robot who traveled under the name frank sullivan was in new york the next morning and saw bonny benedicts column oh burger lourde and corruption he muttered the newspaper trembling in his hands he immediately canceled his business in new york and hopped an orbital to washington where he leapt into a cab sped to naval intelligence and galloped into the office of admiral mounty iron balls babbit babbit was in charge of dungeon and dragon operations including the sullivan matter these were machinations so murky that they were not even known to those normally cleared for covert operations how the holy potter stewart did she get hold of this pseudosullivan demanded waving bonny benedicts column babbit stopped breathing for a minute as he read the second oswald item jesus and mary christ he said finally in a hollow tone the briggsing bryanting frankel she must have a source in the cia those motherstewarting sonsofbitches they do anything to blow one of our operations this was typical of old iron balls as his men called him he was convinced that everything malign emanated from central intelligence over in alexandria they spent all their time he believed plotting to discredit naval intelligence and all because a high cia official had once caught him mounty babbit in an intimate moment with the cia mans mistress those bastards he repeated in a tone as cold as official charity id like to blow that burgerhouse in alexandria off the face of the earth and every limpwristed briggsing bryanting harvard egghead in it but that was only one level of old iron ballss mind the public level much deeper he was already plotting various scenarios that resulted from the sudden deaths of bonny benedict or frank sullivan of course babbit did not for a moment contemplate assassination in the vulgar sense there had been more than enough of that sort of thing back in the sixties and it had made all sorts of trouble for everyone in the intelligence game babbit was guided by a maxim now universally accepted in the cloakanddagger business although originally formulated by beria of the nkvd any damned fool can commit murder any halfway trained operative can arrange convincing suicide it takes an artist to manage an authentic natural death pseudosullivan had a larger than average share of esp as did many persons in the intelligence game you know he said casually ive left certain papers in a certain place to be opened in case of sudden death oh you neednt worry about anything like that babbit said hastily why youre one of our most valuable um men we wouldnt dream of blahblahblah it was a set speech for occasions like this he was thinking of bonny benedict and of her publisher that hoitytoity rich frankelbriggser polly esther doubleknit the next fuse ignited by the oswaldinhongkong story was in the frontal cortex of a balding nervous man named justin case who was living in a sociological treatise that is people made him so anxious that he shielded himself from them with a cocoon of words and concepts which had gradually become more real to him than the people were he was a heavyweight intellectual justin case had more moral concern than was good for a man he worried about racism and sexism and imperialism and injustice and the general cussedness of his species he agonized over each and every person on the planet who might be getting a raw deal if you put enough martinis in him he would start singing joe hill and we shall overcome and which side are you on and other old labor and civil rights songs naturally case was the editor of a liberal magazine the magazine was called confrontation and had been started by a mad arab named joe malik who abandoned it in to enter a trappist monastery malik had been traumatized by the democratic convention that year and told everybody he intended to spend the rest of his life in vehement and continuous prayer malik left behind a note which still hung on the bulletin board at confrontation it said qol hua allahu achad allahu assamad lam yalid walam yulad walam yahun lahu kufwan achad nobody at confrontation could read arabic but they all liked to stop and look at the note occasionally wondering what it meant the stockholders had appointed case to the editorship after malik retreated to the cloister because justin had as much righteous indignation as the mad arab but was not so flaky by spring case had bound volumes of books articles and press clippings about the jfk assassination since he was still righteously indignant about the palpably obvious coverup involved in the warren report the day that pseudosullivan wigged out over bonny benedicts contribution to the mythology of the assassination case calmly clipped that item and added it to his file threequarters of the other material in cases file was also fictitious onethird of this disinformation had been generated by intelligence agenciesdomestic foreign and extraterrestrialas covers or screens for their own activities in and around dallas in another third had been produced by sincere dedicated sometimes avid conspiracy buffs weaving their own webs of confusion as they searched for the elusive truth the last third had been created like the bonny benedict item by journalists following hearsts advice about what to do when there was no news anybody trying to find out what really happened from this collection of mythology would be so confused that the significant fact of the extraterrestrial intervention would never be apparent case did not suspect any of this he loved his jfk file he was convinced that someday the crucial piece would come to him he would insert it into the file and the whole jigsaw would make sense he never realized that the one detail which gave everything away was that while oswald was firing from the sixthfloor window he was also having a coke on the second floor and mingling with the crowd in the street like most liberals justin case lacked imagination and never took seriously all the evidence of extraterrestrial activity on earth during the past forty years case was currently having an affair with the hollywood actress carol christmas carol was renowned among the heterosexual male population for having the biggest brownmillers since jayne mansfield so far only women and a few gay men had noticed that she could also act carol had been married four times she had had three abortions like other famous beauties she was always dieting and hence a little bit highstrung she was also a disciple of general e a crowley the eccentric english explorer who had discovered the north pole and claimed there was a hole there leading down to the center of the earth carol devoutly believed crowleys yarn that there was a whole civilization down there inside the earth run by greenskinned women carol believed this because she had a great artistic faith in the principle of balance in her probability continuumin the series of quantum eigenstates that had crystalized into her universethe whole outside of the planet seemed to be run by whiteskinned males it was only fair that the inside should be run by greenskinned females carol was having three other affairs at the same time as her amour with justin case there was a hairdresser in hollywood bi not gay who was very talented at bryanting and briggsingtwo arts at which totally straight men in carols opinion were usually a bit clumsy there was also franois loupgarou the painter in paris who adored her madly as only a painter can adore a woman and there was a bitter but brilliant black novelist in chicago named franklin stuart justin case knew all about these other amours after all he read bonny benedicts column every day bonny kept the world informed about which celebrities were potter stewarting each other she did this in a way that was perfectly clear to every reader but totally without any clear meaning in a court of law in case somebody got irritated and tried to sue her what she did was to write something like hollywood sexpot carol christmas and black novelist frank stuart are an item these days everybody knew what an item meant when bonny wrote that a couple were a hot item many of her readers were mildly puzzled but assumed she was insinuating some fantastic sexual acrobatics actually it only meant that bonny was trying to avoid stylistic monotony occasionally she even switched it to a torrid item which led to even more lascivious fantasies for some of her readers justin case didnt object to carol christmass other affairs because he accepted it as a fact of life that actors are hypersexed just as coal miners are prone to black lung disease and novelists to booze and weird drugs besides jealousy was a sign of possessiveness and possessiveness was illiberal and anywayas he usually concluded his ruminations on this subject during the infrequent moments when he thought of it at allcarols career kept them apart most of the time and he was not so naive as to expect somebody of her youth and beauty to resist all temptations and it was the s wasnt it actually case was a bit of an unconscious psychicthat is he was aware of quantum probability waves although not consciously he sensed that there were approximately universes in which he had lusted after carol and never got into her frankel even once that unconscious psychic knowledge kept him content with this universe where he was her parttime lover carol christmas had starred in the first hardcore porn movie to win the academy award deep mongolian steinem job the film had been directed by stanley kubrick after he read a satirical novel in which the author had imagined what would happen if kubrick set out to make a serious and even artistic porn film despite the success of deep mongolian steinem job most humans still did not realize that all fantasies tend to become realities in one universe or another carol did realize it however she was currently involved in approximately sex acts every hour real houses real offices the sensuous california sun hung low and sultry over san francisco turning everybodys mood in a low and sultry

saying in gold letters francis dashwood md president there was nothing urgent on the memo pad so dashwood began opening the incoming mail leisurely dear dr dashwood i am writing to you as a sex expert because i dont know where else to turn i already wrote to ann landers but she just told me to take cold showers my problem is that i am madly hopelessly passionately in love with linda lovelace ive actually seen deep throat ninetythree times now and nothing can get her out of my mind other women leave me cold i only want linda linda linda she has so much beauty and charm and sweetness and my god can she eat rehnquist i know this is hopeless because even though ive written a novel about vlad the impaler and made lots of money im still very shy with women some of them are extraterrestrials i have discovered why did god make such an unjust universe can you help me dr dashwood frowned thoughtfully then scrawled send this nut the seeapsychiatrist letter dum de dum de dum de next dr orgasm r institute frank dashwood malaclypse san francisco calif dear dr institute we are sending you this personalized letter because we know that a man like you dr institute cares about his investments and wants to know the facts about inflation next and remember look up that zelenka dear dr dashwood i am a paraplegic and therefore i am incapable of normal coitus my sweetheart and i fortunately have found that oral sex satisfies us fullyi marshall her frankel and then she gives me a steinem job but this creates a terrible legal conundrum since she lives across the mississippi river in iowa and i am a citizen of illinois iowa has a very strict law against oral sex which they classify as sodomy due to a mistranslation of the old testament i believe thus we cant have sex in iowa now illinois has had no antisodomy statutes since the s so you might think our problem can be solved by having sex in illinois unfortunately she cant afford to quit her job in iowa and thus every time she travels across the river to have sex with me she is crossing a state line which makes me vulnerable under the mann act is there any possible solution to this legal doublebind dr dashwood was intrigued he began thinking of topological transformations noneuclidean geometries wheelers wormholes in superspace but then he realized he was romanticizing just because the puzzle had sparked his imagination in ordinary fourdimensional heisenberg spacetime there was no way out of the paradox if the writer crossed the river he and his lady were committing sodomy in iowa and if the lady crossed the river they were violating the mann act in illinois logicians dream up such strange loops dashwood reflected just to make games for other logicians but lawyers create them to make more jobs for lawyers dashwood scrawled tell him his lady better damned well find a job in illinois next dear dr dashwood once there was a man who was condemned to live on the moon he knew the punishment was just because he hated his father and such a sin deserves an extreme penalty nonetheless his isolation was terrible and there were times when he thought his heart would break just because he could never hear a human voice again well he made the best of his cruel situation he began sending messages from the moon telling everything he knew about life on earthall the joys and agonies and struggles the horror and the boredom and the glory of the long climb upward from the slime to higher and higher consciousness the people back on earth loved these signals which contained so much of lifes drama and they praised him extravagantly and that gave him some comfort through the long years of his exile once however he sat down and made a message about his own loneliness telling how it feels to be separated from humanity by miles of dead silence he called it the hammerklavier sonata try to plot that on one of your graphs you sizeist sonofabitch ezra pound fair play for fernando poo committee the intercom

a walrus mustache and a cheery eye nobody ever looked less threatening dr dashwood still regarded him with a wary respect as a large and dangerous mammal this was the normal attitude since the anticrime antisubversion omnibus bill had entitled the bureau to conduct random wiretapping on all citizens rather than just on known criminals and known subversives if we only watch the already recognized enemies of society the author of this billsenator uriah snoophad argued who knows what hidden monkey business might be festering in dark places to rise up and stab us in the back like a snake in the grass knight was brisk and seemingly honest a prominent scientistdr g w c bridgehad disappeared and since no kidnappers had demanded ransom and no evidence indicated that he had defected to russia or china the bureau was investigating even the most tenuous leads since you attended miskatonic university in massachusetts at the same time as dr bridge were curious about anything even that far back which might shed light on why hed want to vanish if he did vanish voluntarily dr dashwood created an expression of puzzlement i hardly knew george he said slowly he was just about the only black student at miskatonic of course and that made him um highly visible but we never became friends they beat around the bush for about ten minutes then dashwood shot abruptly from the hip i know who really was close to washy he said looking inspired pete simon the geologist why dont you get in touch with him i think the last i heard he was with the government knight looked perfectly innocent peter simon he said slowly making a note geologist but dashwood knew the agent was a shade too bland too innocent the bureau was aware that dr simon had vanished also maybe they were on the

talk in some kind of codethe temple is holy in boxcars boxcars boxcars and gibberish like that but knight became aware that there was another man in the room slouched in an overstuffed chair in the corner he was short fat and meanlooking he had at least as much muscle as fat and was probably even tougher than he looked knight who had been a professional investigator for thirty years knew at once this man was a cop this is an art among professional detectives and is known as making a subject knight would walk into a room and make everybody at onceas cop crook or straight citizen this is hrumph rumph of the continental detective agency ubu said it turns out he has an interest in this investigation too knight was suddenly ill at ease it was the first time in years he had failed to catch a subjects name first time around hi hrumph rumph he said pretending to cough a lot of strange things have gone on in this old house said the continental op casually suddenly his voice turned cold but youre the strangest knight youre the illuminatis man in the fbi the temperature in the room dropped ten degrees celsius knight laughed easily now i know you he said youre the most famous pi at continental you always throw people off guard with wild remarks like that ubu was confused i thought philip marlowe invented the technique of starting a conversation with an insult or an accusation he gasped eyes aghast dont be a sap ubu the continental op sneered he sneered very well knight noticed he must have had a lot of practice this guy is a wrong gee hes not only spying on the fbi for the cia but from what i hear hes also spying on both of you for the bavarian illuminati all im hearing is a lot of wind knight said airily if you have something to say say it dont try to snow me the continental op said frostily i know all about you and the illuminati so dont think you can pull a fast one the homing pigeons ubu was stunned why are we all talking like characters in a s detective novel he injected pointedly its him knight grated metallically he brings that atmosphere with him go ahead and be a smartass the continental op said mulishly but ive got my eye on you knight tobias turned and addressed ubu how did this galoot get mixed up in a government probe he asked saturninely professional courtesy ubu said graciously continental is looking for one of the missing scientists a jasper named peter simon mrs simon says shed like to have him back if anybody can find him peter simon knight repeated stonily thats a funny coincidencedashwood mentioned his name not a half hour ago thats more than a coincidenceits a propinquity ubu said conspiratorially or a synchronicity knight added occultly i dont give a flying philadelphia potter stewart what you call it the continental op said cockily it means something lets put a tail on dr dashwood ubu growled barking up the wrong tree ill get on that myself knight said chivalrously he rose to leave just a bloody minute the continental op said sanguinely yes knight paused im coming too the fat sleuth ejaculated actually hrumph rumph or whatever the continental ops name was was quite right about tobias knight knight was the first pentuple agent in the history of espionage he was simultaneously employed by the fbi the cia the kgb the bavarian illuminati and a mysterious person who claimed to represent the earth monitoring section of galactic hq he was not in this fivedimensional matrix of intrigue for the money however tobias knight was actually a frustrated sociologist and a wouldbe historian he had the scientific spirit or as he might have stated in the vernacular he wanted to know what the hell was really going on in an age of secret police machinations and conspiracies of all sorts the only way he could hope to find out what was really going on was to be involved in as many clandestine operations as possible knight knew what most people only vaguely suspected that intelligence agencies engage in both the collection of valid signals information and the promiscuous dissemination of fake signals disinformation they collected the information so that they could form a fairly accurate picture of what was really going on they spread the disinformation so that all their competitors would form grossly inaccurate pictures they did this because they knew that whoever could find out what the hell was really going on possessed an advantage over those who were misinformed confused and disoriented this game had been invented by joseph fouche who was the chief of the secret police under napoleon british intelligence very quickly copied all of fouches tactics and surpassed them because an intelligent englishman is always ten times as mad in a methodical way than any frenchman by the time of the first world war intelligence agencies everywhere had created so much disinformation and confusion that no two historians ever were able to agree about why the war happened and who doublecrossed whom they couldnt discover whether the war had been plotted or had just resulted from a series of blunders they couldnt even decide whether the two conspiracies to assassinate archduke ferdinand of austriahungary which triggered the war had been aware of each other by the time of the second world war the doublecross system had been inventedby british intelligence of course this was the product of such minds as alan turing a brilliant homosexual mathematician who when not working on espionage specialized in creating logical paradoxes other mathematicians couldnt solve and lan fleming whose fantasy life was equally rich as indicated by his later james bond books and dennis wheatley a man of exceptionally high intelligence who happened to believe that an international society of satanists was behind every conspiracy that he didnt invent himself by the time turing fleming wheatley and kindred british intellects had perfected the doublecross system the science of lying was almost as precise as euclidean geometry and nearly as lovely to the detached observer what the doublecross experts had invented was the practical political applications of the strange loop in logic or cybernetics a strange loop is a set of propositions that while valid at each point is so constructed that it leads to an unresolvable paradox the doublecross people drove the germans bonkers by inventing disinformation systems that if believed were deceptive but if doubted led to a second disinformation system they enjoyed this work so much that at times they invented triple loops in which if you believed the surface or cover you were being fooled and if you looked deeper you found a plausible alternative which seemed like the hidden facts but was just another scenario created to fool you and if you were persistent enough you would find beneath that looking every bit like the naked truth a third layer of deception and masquerade these strange loops functioned especially well because the doublecross experts had early on fed the germans the primordial strange loop most of your agents are working for us and feeding you strange loops many german agents it later turned out had managed to collect quite a bit of accurate information about the normandy invasion but many others had turned in equally plausible information about a fictitious norwegian invasion and all of them were under suspicion anyway german intelligence might as well have made its decisions by tossing a coin in the air tobias knight kept a safedeposit box in switzerland in which he stored one sentence at a time usually stray bits of true information he had managed to glean from the blizzard of deceptions in which he lived the first note in the box for instance said the cia was actually founded in i havent found out yet why they made it public in the forties the second note was even stranger it said special and general relativity are both true this had been provoked by a profound search through old science books and magazines after knight discovered that most of the official science released to the general public was actually percent mythology intended to serve as a cover or screen for the real science used by unistat to frustrate its enemies there were lots of other notes like thatmaxwells equations seem sound i dont think theres any flummery in newtonian mechanics and so onbut others were far weirder such as velikovsky was right and all the flying saucer books pro and con are written by mounty babbits department in naval intelligence and there are robots among us and some of what the birchers say is correct the whole government was taken over by communists about forty years ago knight had a fantasy that someday he would turn these notes over to an objective historian who would then write a book informing the future of what had actually been going on in the twentieth century of course this was a dream all the history departments had been taken over by intelligence agencies sometime around he knew and he also knew that there were so many strange loops in the intelligence system that he himself had been deceived many times maybe as much as percent of his notes were false he morosely estimated the walking glitch aaaoooozorazazzaieoazaeiiiozakhoeoooythoeazaeaaozakhozakheytyxaalethykhthis is the name which you must speak in the interior world jesus pistis sophia simon the walking glitch entered gwb in washington at that morning simon was an ectomorph tall lithe cerebretonic his hair and beard were absurdly long and he sometimes smoked weed during working hours gwb kept him on the government payroll only because he was a genius in his field which both they and he knew and because he had long ago inserted a tapeworm in the beast which edited all input on him to conform to a profile of perfect executive loyal citizen and cleared for topsecret access he was the agent of the invisible hand society within the governments own highest echelons simon was not the son of mr and mrs walking glitch of course he had actually been born simon moon in chicago thirtyfour years ago but the name simon the walking glitch had been adopted by all of his friends for nearly ten years now a glitch in computer slang is a hidden program which lies deeply buried in a computer waiting to flummox fuddle and potter stewart the head of the first operator who stumbles upon it simon had encountered his own first glitch one day in on his very first job in the computer department of bank of america in los angeles he had tried to run the payroll program on the computer ordering the machine to begin printing the checks for paydaya very ordinary job usually this time however the machine refused instead of running the program it typed out on the console give me a cookie simon smiled not a whit fazed he had played games like that back in college obviously some earlier programmer had inserted a glitch or catchmeifyoucan loop instructing the computer to refuse certain programs probably selected at random to make it harder to debug and type out give me a cookie instead simon moon knew a great deal about getting around such gremlin programs that had been the chief sport in computer science back at mit he set to work with a zest enjoying the contest with his unknown and vanished opponent in half an hour simon realized he was confronting a trapdoor code according to the latest mathematical estimate it would take four million years of computer time give or take a few centuriesto crack a trapdoor code so simon resigned from the contest gracefully he typed out a cookie the machine responded at once yummy that was good thank you begin programming and things went smoothly again simon stayed on with bank of america for a year and a half and he ran into the cookie program only three more times the mystery programmer had evidently left only that one small glitch to mark the territory as his or hers for all future programmers who would work there in working for hew simon came across a more amusing hobgoblin circuit this one worked only at night in the daytime if you wanted to run a program you merely typed in your name and your gwb number and the computer would accept your input at night however it always replied to your name and number with crazy man whats your sign simon learned that this did not happen at random but every night and only at night whoever had put it into the computer had a very accurate idea of the difference between the day staff and the night staff and sometimes the machine would carry the conversation a bit further such as typing out scored any good grass lately or ive been wanting to tell you what lovely eyes you have simon enjoyed this kind of thing so much that he became mr super glitch incarnate all over unistat there now are computers on which simon once worked and at totally random intervals they are likely to type out selections from the gnostic gospels such as not until the male becomes female and the female male shall ye enter into the kingdom of heaven or various zen koans like the mind is buddha the mind is not buddha or strange loops of the family of the following sentence is true the previous sentence was false simon was shameless many of his computers type out totally indecent proposals like slip your rehnquist into the socket and ill briggs you until you experience total ecstasy others spout nihilist and subversive slogans what the eyes see and the heart covets let the hand boldly seize or show me a nation that doesnt cheat the tax collectors and ill show you a nation of sheep but it was not until simon infiltrated the cia at alexandria that he found a truly major potter stewartup this particular computer would print out at totally unpredictable intervals but often enough that everybody knew about it the government sucks there was no wayabsolutely no wayto get around this program except by typing in it sure do this magic formula had been discovered four years earlier as the only way of getting the computer back into action the response was immediate the machine typed out good you are now part of the network one of our agents will contact you shortly and then it would resume normal programming activities quite innocently as if it were not inciting subversion within the ranks of the secret police itself of course nobody ever had been contacted by the network but the cia did spend a lot more each year on surveillance of its own personnel just in case they also spent a lot more on surveillance of former employees in the computer section this amused simon immensely since he recognized the hand of a fellow artist whoever was responsible for that beauty was probably head of department by nowand quite likely leading the demands for more funds to find the mystery culprit simon did not for a moment believe in the network he thought he knew everything about this kind of game and that the network did not need to exist in order to serve its function simon was the head of operations on gwb popularly called the beastthe worlds largest computer which due to satellite interlock had access to hundreds of similar giant computers everywhere on earth and in the space factories it was widely believed that if there was any question the beast couldnt answer no other entity in the solar system could answer it either many people especially bible fundamentalists and members of the purity of ecology party regarded the beast with fear and loathing they believed that the machine was taking over the world and that all the little beasties the home computers that were now as common as stereophonic tvs were all in cahoots with it they imagined a vast solid state conspiracy against humanity quite a few literary intellectuals believed this too because they were ignorant of mathematics they had no idea how the beast functioned and they therefore regarded it with the same quasisuperstitious terror as the bible fundamentalists they were sure that like the frankenstein monster it wanted to populate the earth with its own offspring and abolish humanity entirely simon the walking glitch was one of the principal sources of this vast new mythology of dread he spent many weekends in new york hobnobbing with the literary intelligentsia and he was a master puton artist he had a way of dropping casual remarks in a mildly worried tone that carried conviction the beast keeps asking us to build a mate for it or with a kind of sad and resigned smile i wish the beast didnt have such a low opinion of human beings or i just found out the beast is an atheist it doesnt believe there is a higher intelligence than itself that sort of thing simon kept this kind of demonology circulatingand he knew a lot of other programmers who were contributing to it alsobecause the idea that the computers were taking over was one that the programmers had a vested interest in reinforcing as long as people kept worrying that the machines were taking over they wouldnt notice what was really happening which was that the programmers were taking over simon began his work day by asking the beast how was your night the beast answered on the console it was a drag man some cats from mit had me running fourier analyses like forever simon had programmed the beast to speak to him into his own argot a mixture of street hippie and technologese simon now switched to his own trapdoor code and accessed all the new informationnew since he had signed out at five the previous eveningabout the brain drain mystery which involved the disappearances of sixtyseven scientists in the last several years the beast typed out reports from the ubuknight team in san francisco and two other teams in tucson and miami simon read it all very carefully then he instructed the beast still in his trapdoor code to change several crucial bits of information in each report he had been sabotaging the brain drain investigation that way for seven months he had sabotaged quite a few other investigations in the same way over the years since coming to gwb simon did not know or care what sorts of conspiracies he was aiding and abetting he was just a mystic who believed in conspiracy for its own sake like tobias knight simon was fully aware of the prevalence everywhere of the doublecross system invented by messrs turing fleming and wheatley he knew that anything that was widely believed was probably a cover or screen for some intelligence operation sometimes he even wondered if the earth might be flat after all but simon accepted this situation and added his own random bits of chaos with equanimity he was a member of the invisible hand society a group that had split off from the libertarian party in on the grounds that the libertarians were not being true to laissezfaire principles simon moon once met the most famous computer expert in unistat wilhemena burroughs granddaughter of the inventor of the first calculating machine have you noticed that the computers are all getting weirder lately simon asked testing her the programmers are getting weirder ms burroughs said not falling into simons trap i know it was bound to happen as soon as i read a survey back in around i think it was showing that programmers use lsd more than any other professional group you look like an acidhead yourself she added with her characteristic bluntness well as a matter of fact i have dabbled in a little trip now and thenno pattern of abuse surely thats what they all say ms burroughs sniffed but the cookie glitch pops up more and more places every dayill wager youve seen it by now havent you of course you have yes but certainly thats harmless humor wouldnt you say ms burroughs peered at him with insectoid intensity are you aware she asked that millions of previously lawabiding citizens have stopped paying their creditcard debts first they get a little postcard that says here ive got one in my purse she rummaged about in an alligator bag and showed simon a postcard that said congratulations you are one of the lucky whose debts have been canceled by the network keep your mouth shut and play it cool lucky ms burroughs said with a rheumy cackle of skepticism lucky is more like the truth this postcard was turned in to diners club by an honest man and you know how few of them there are a check showed that his tapes had been erased and there was no record that he owed anything god alone knows how many others there are who have just taken advantage of the scam well simon said maybe there are only five hundred maybe it was only a oneshot by some joker with a robin hood complex i am an expert ms burroughs reminded him ignoring the fact that he was an expert too i have no idea how many there are out there in unistat whove taken advantage of the networks liberality but ill wager there are millions lucky thats just to make the marks feel theyve been specially selected as the network leads them down the primrose path to anarchy and so simon had his first bit of concrete evidence that the network really existed the existence of the network didnt matter to simon as an invisible hander he just regarded them whoever they were as just another group of the unenlightened simon believed that only he and his fellow members of the invisible hand were totally enlightened no blame just because you arent paranoid doesnt mean that they arent out to get you dennis jarog when dr dashwood went out to lunch that day he was accosted on the sidewalk by a onelegged sailor who said his name was captain ahab avast ahab cried i would borrow a moment of thy time o seeker of bioelectrical and intrauterine arcana i never give to strangers dashwood muttered apply to welfare o muddy understanding and loveless heart ahab protested and impaired hearing into the bargain i said i would borrow thy time not thy dime thou prier into vaginal mystery with the tawdry telescope of mechanistic philosophy avast i say make an appointment with my secretary dashwood said convinced that this man was unglued o god look down and see this squinteyed man ahab shrieked blinded by his own stern rules of office they are three times enslaved who cage themselves most deaf of all who cringe and hide behind that tyrant majesty appointment book really dashwood said looking desperately for a taxi i cant avast ye soulless and unmetaphysical lubber ahab cried think not i yet seek still the whiteskinned whale tis worse on horrors scrolls accumulate fresh fears and deeds that call in doubt gods truth i say that thou hast need of doctoring for all thy pride hastes thee to sodden ruin thou thinkst thou knowst but thou knowst not o wretch no dashwood thou but dorngeorge dorn i say dashwood finally leapt into a passing cab and escaped golden gate park he told the driver deciding to snack at the japanese tea house the quiet rustic zenlike atmosphere there was just what he needed after the abrasions of tobias knight and captain ahab captain ahab stood on the street fuming my abzug no blame he muttered the goats march now weve got them just where they want us admiral james tiberius kirk while captain ahab was trying to illuminate dr dashwood at noon in san francisco and justin case was dialing the saudi arabian consulate at pm in new york a man named francois loupgarou was finding a rehnquist in his lobster newburg in paris where it was already late evening naturally he was a bit startled m loupgarou was like all french intellectuals a rationalistvirtually a cartesian of course as the founder of the neosurrealist movement in art he was officially an irrationalist but like all gallic irrationalists especially the existentialists he was exquisitely rational about his irrationality he knew there was some explanation of how the rehnquist had gotten into the lobster newburg but for once in his life he preferred being an irrational rationalist rather than an irrational rationalist he just did not care to think about the explanation of how a rehnquist gets into a lobster newburg who after all wants to contemplate such ideas as maddened chefs having at each other with meat cleavers or more exotic hypotheses such anthropophagy or voodoo rituals in the kitchen the distasteful incident occurred at a dinner party given by the famous american physicist james earl carter dr carter had recently won the nobel prize for his demonstration that the multiworld of everettwheelergraham was the only consistent noncontradictory paradoxfree interpretation of the schrodinger wave equations of quantum mechanics he was celebrating by spending a month in paris and meeting every possible international celebrity the dinner guests this evening for instance included an inscrutable japanese monk a very scrutable german novelist a famous swedish film director three french philosophers a swiss theologian two english neurologists the notorious eva gebloomenkraft the terror of the jet set as the newspapers called her an austrian psychiatrist francois loupgarou himself and four goats the goats had been brought to the party by loupgarou who was working hard at promoting neosurrealisme by establishing himself as a newsworthy eccentric the goats go everywhere with me he said firmly at the door they are a reminder of our earthy roots it wasnt nearly as good as de nerval walking a lobster on the boulevard but it did get into a few newspapers the next day and after the effect had been established loupgarou genially agreed to having the goats housed in the pantry during dinner as the guests settled themselves at the table one of the english neurologists dr axona jovial redcheeked man who probably hunted as a hobbyasked dr carter does your theory actually propose that there are real tangible universes on all sides of us in hyperspace in superspace carter corrected genially yayus he added blandly there are millions of such universes or to be more precise there are about of them ah only refer to possible universes he explained quickly lest anybody think his theory was extravagant some more wine heah carters brother said loudly ah think youve had enough billuh carter muttered in an undertone do you think president kennedy will get the spacecities program through congress now that the space factories are paying for themselves asked the other english neurologist a pale saturnine man named dr dendrite ah dont understand politics james earl carter said ahm a scientist some more wine heah carters brother repeated then there are universes in which i was never born dr axon pursued his own line of thought there are universes in which john baez became a general instead of a folk singer carter said easily ah suppose he would be equally vehement about nuking people as he now is about not nuking them if its a possible universe it exists the equations say so all ahve done really is to show that any other interpretation of the equations is contradictory somebody ought to psychoanalyze the physicists the austrian psychiatrist muttered to the swedish film director its like the buddhist concept of karma the swedish film director said we all get to play every role somewhere in hyperspace superspace carter corrected again then theres a universe where kennedy is a physicist eva gebloomenkraft said and youre president of unistat well carter said with his genial smile ah hope ah could get along with the people who run the country what do they call themselvesthe triangular connection i dont care whether this theory is true or not the german novelist pronounced as a metaphor it is perfect we all live in parallel universes i am faust in my universe and the rest of you are all extras or walkons but each of you is faust in his universe and i am an extramaybe just a spear carrier but by this time the wineglasses had been refilled several times and everybody was getting more relaxed especially the physicists brother billy who was heard reciting to ms gebloomenkraft who burgered tom burgered bullburger who burgered the second oswald in hong kong somebody was muttering at the other end of the table in some universe maybe schiller didnt write faust at all i wonder dendrite said if theres a universe where pope stephen became a singer instead of a priest everyboduh knew that who burgered routine when we were growing up in georgia billy was saying verdammte publishers the german novelist was telling the swiss theologian theyre all thieves did somebody mention pope stephen the theologian asked strumpfbander strumpfbander strumpfbander the psychiatrist chortled they stay up nights thinking of new ways to cheat their writers the novelist rambled on now evidently addressing his wineglass since nobody else was listening to him id like to know who started all those rumors about pope stephen the theologian fumed i have written a poem commemorating your great discovery francois loupgarou told dr carter hacking his way into a pause in the conversation a poem about me in french carter was enthused ah love french poetry especially rambow no loupgarou said in your honor i have written it in english actually he had written it in english to get even with t s eliot who had written a few rondels in french ah wonder if you could recite it carter prompted certainly said loupgarou and he began to declaim schrodingers cat and wigners friend cause us problems without end the cat is both alive and dead in the math thats in our head and the regression of von neumann never ceases to annoy man the uncertainty just has no end until wigner goes to tell his friend for until the friend receives the news that the cat still purrs and mews the cat remains suspended fate in some formal eigenstate some more wine heah carters brother bellowed at the butler loupgarou frowned and went on but if wigner makes a beeline to report the nowdead feline all the friend can really know is just one branch of times swift flow for in carters multispace every timebranch has its place so the cat remains alive in the half cases thats lead us not to copenhagen nor to shylock nor to fagin the results not parsimonious yet i find it quite harmonious nobody understood this except dr carter himself but he was so moved that his eyes watered a bit ahm honored he kept saying shaking his head to have a poem written about me by a french artist in english but at this point the chef exploded into the room haggard and wildeyed the goats he cried they march and indeed it was true the goats had gotten out of the pantry it took ten minutes and a great deal of exertion for both the house staff and the guests before the animals were rounded up and herded back to captivity everybody was breathing a bit heavily by then and the austrian psychiatrist muttered something about artistic temperament which loupgarou unfortunately overheard there is nothing esoteric about the artistic temperament he replied flatly and dogmatically the real mysteryand the tragedy of humanityis that so many lack esthetic sensibility i sometimes believe the legend that there are robots among us passing themselves off as human beings thats absurd dr axon said if i were to claim that everybody should be a neurologist you would all quite properly regard that as an eccentricity yet when an artist says we should all be artists we are apt to agree a bit sheepishly and if a religious person says we should all be religious we not only agree but feel a bit guilty about our shortcomings in that department well ive never had an artistic or religious impulse in my life and im not ashamed of the fact research is your art and your religion said the japanese monk speaking for the first time what a person truly is in any universe is the buddha nature he added blandly he knew that he existed in this continuum only to make that one dharma revelation so he immediately resumed his impassive silence the others decided that the monks remarks made no sense what do you think dr axon loupgarou asked rhetorically if only a few people had sex in their lives and the majority were not merely ascetics but simply unaware of sexdeaf dumb and blind to the erotic side of life would you not think that was at least a little bit odd a symptom perhaps of some pathology arrrrrrrrrghh he had discovered the rehnquist in his lobster newburg and the chef arrived from the kitchen exasperated as only a french chef can be exasperated the goats he cried once again it is that they march but loupgarou was still going arrrgh like a man with the death rattle what is it ms gebloomenkraft asked him her eyes full of motherly concern its nothingnothing loupgarou gasped just a touch of heartburn he was still in shock thinking the rehnquist might be a hallucination but if you were naive enough to talk about hallucinations the results might be rubber sheets electroshock windows with bars on them the goats the chef repeated with emphasis they will not be governed they march again i tell you loupgarou took another peek the rehnquist was still there it was a great big oneithyphallique as the anthropologists would say this was madness or else something unspeakable was afoot billy began to sing off key four goats and me they came to tea they came to stay they stayed all day oh my oh me four goats and me at this point he fell face down in his lobster newburg billuh isnt accustomed to fine french wines dr carter said his genial smile beginning to look just a bit forced whaleburger while loupgarou was struggling with the enigma of the rehnquist in the lobster newburg in paris justin case was speaking to a man from the saudi arabian delegation to the un in new york this is actually ah rather trivial case said awkwardly into the phone you see many years ago an arab resigned from this job and left behind a note in arabic and well um after staring at it for twentysix years im a bit bored with the mystery and id like to have the answer certainly certainly said the voice in the receiver id be glad to help can you sound it out well he wrote it in the european alphabet case said so i guess its more or less phonetic ill read it to you um qol hua allahu achad allahu assamad lam yalid walam yulad walam yakun lahu kufwan achad did you get that most certainly said the electronic voice its one of the most famous verses in al koran in english it would beof course it loses most of its beauty in translation but roughly it means god is he who has no beginning and no end no size and no shape no definition and no wife no horse no mustache ah yes case said well thank you very much and im sorry for having taken your time with such a trivial matter he hung up staring into space in a bemused manner no wife no horse no mustache he repeated aloud something certainly had gotten lost in the translation when dr dashwood returned from lunch he was accosted in the orgre parking lot by another sailor who said his name was lemuel gulliver in the course of my travels in diverse lands gulliver said i came once upon a race of perfectly enlightened beings who looked like horses and talked like g i gurdjieff when they inquired of me regarding the laws and customs and manners of my people concerning which i was at some pains to inform them correctly and fully they expressed great astonishment and keen horror saying that they never heard of such a tribe of conscienceless rascals and filthy scoundrels in all of creation this estimate of the human race as you can well imagine dismayed me no little bit and i endeavourd to defend our species yes yes dashwood said but im in a hurry you understand these equine philosophers gulliver went on as if he had not heard were not impressed by any of my words and said plainly to me that if our theologians were not the worst lunatics in creation then certainly our lawyers were the worst thieves they averred further that if what i told them of our doctors were true we were wiser to resort to plumbers or blacksmiths who are no more ignorant and a great deal less greedy avaricious and rapacious dashwood was stung by these words it takes a long time and a lot of money invested to get through medical school he said angrily i explained that to my equine philosophers gulliver replied but they did not accept it as a valid argument for they asserted any thief or scoundrel when apprehended will give you justifications in plenty for his misdeeds but the judicious are not foold by such rationalizations andthey said furtherthose who prey not upon any chance passerby but upon the sick and the disabled and the dying are without doubt the most rapacious and rascally of the yahoo tribe for such was their name for our species your friends sound like a bunch of damned communists dashwood said nay gulliver protested they live in the state of nature without bureaucrats or commissars of any kind and i might add sir their opinion of our doctors was based on my showing them an ordinary medical bill at which they inquird of me the average income of the doctors who present these bills and the average income of the unfortunate patients who must pay them or be left without treatment to die in the streets their comments on this were of such disgust and anger that i dared not show them a psychiatrists bill lest their opinion of our species already low should sink lower than whaleburger which is as you may know at the bottom of the ocean oh abzug off said dashwood really angry now he rushed into orgre and left gulliver standing on the sidewalk back in new york the phone was ringing again in the office of abu laylah at the saudi arabian consulate still high on the new kef abu laylah lifted the receiver leisurely i say is this the saudi arabian consulate asked a very british voice oy vay have you got the wrong number abu laylah replied in a thick yiddish accent oh the voice said taken aback veddy sorry abu laylah went on packing happily he had been fired that morning and was thoroughly enjoying himself screwing up all incoming calls before leaving just a few minutes ago he had convinced some infidel that the most sublime verse in the koran was full of nonsense about horses and mustaches the invisible hand society the invisible hand society had its headquarters in washington just off dupont circle in the same building which housed the warren belch society clem cotex the president of the belchers had noticed the name of the invisible hand on the building directory a long time ago he liked it because he liked mysteries he enjoyed wondering about the invisible handers and speculating on what esoteric business could justify such a name were they the nine unknown men who rule the world the local branch of the bavarian illuminati the traditionalist faction of the old black hand out of which the mafia and cosa nostra had grown was lament cranston their leader perhaps clem loved such speculations most of his life he had been a salesman in arkansas and never thought of anything but commissions net sales tax writeoffs and not telling the same rastus and mandy story to the same customer twice then one day in chicago a tall crewcut humanoida human clem thought at the timegave him some free tomato juice on the street the man the humanoid actually said he was from the eris tomato juice company and that they were handing out free samples to get people acquainted with their product within three days clem had joined the trekkies and was writing letters to cbs demanding the return of star trek to tv he had also gotten heavily involved in classical music started relearning all the math he had in high school discovered that he often knew who was calling him on the phone before he picked up the receiver and invented a new cosmology of his very own which was based on the idea that the universe was not spherical as heisenbergs general relativity claimed but fivecornered like the pentagon building within a week clem had checked that there was no eris tomato juice company noticed that ufos seemed to be following his car wherever he went and was beginning to think he was attracted to the idea of becoming a buddhist monk by the end of the second week clem was less elated and agitated and had gone through a battery of tests at a company that did psychological testing for top management positions the psychologists told him that he had an unusually rich fantasy life but was too well adjusted to be schizophrenic that his iq was the highest they had ever measured and he knew damned well that it had never been that high before and that he definitely was not management material they suggested that he take up whatever art was most attractive to him clem becoming less agitated less elated and more conscious of detail all the time as the stuff in the tomato juice continued to mutate his nervous system decided that he was one among possibly many thousands of subjects in a consciousnessexpansion project being carried on by extraterrestrials within a year he had written a symphony which he decided was not very good and had changed his religion ten times without learning much in the process he had also read his way through every volume of the encyclopaedia britannica looking for clues as to what the hell was really going on whoever was behind this experiment and he was no longer quite sure they were necessarily extraterrestrials seemed to have left a stream of grossly obvious hints throughout every field of human knowledge the stuff in the tomato juice was what theologians would call a gratuitous grace but that was the only gratuitous part of it you had to figure out on your own who they were what they were up to and what you should do about it the last thing you should do about it clem knew was to talk about it to the ordinary people who hadnt been given the stuff in the tomato juice they would just think you were weird clem had a list of people from history who he figured had probably been given the stuff in the tomato juice the list started out with jesus christ of course and included a lot of the usual suspects buddha michelangelo walt whitman leonardo da vinci but it had quite a few that ordinary people would never have included like lewis carroll and h p lovecraft and general e a crowley the discoverer of the north pole and joshua abraham norton who in san francisco in declared himself emperor of the united states protector of mexico and king of the jews for years clem had tried to find others on the same neurological wavelength as himself he had joined and eventually been kicked out of the fortean society mensa the rosicrucians the center for ufo studies and the ultrasecret ssftass secret society for the abolition of secret societies he was too farout for all of them eventually he organized his own society for the investigation and elucidation of what the hell is really going on around here he called it the warren belch society after the famous old west lawman who won every gunfight because on each occasion when he confronted a shootout his opponents guns had mysteriously jammed the people clem recruited were not the sort who would attribute marshal belchs phenomenal good luck to coincidence nor would they be satisfied by metaphysical labels like synchronicity or psychokinesis they assumed the extraterrestrials had some obscure cosmic reason for protecting warren belch on the day when justin case got tired wondering about joe maliks mysterious last communication and tried unsuccessfully to find out what it meant clem cotex got tired wondering about the invisible hand society he marched down the hall opened their door and walked into a tiny but tastefully decorated reception room the wall to the right was adorned with a large gold dollar sign emblazoned with the initials tanstagi the wall to the left had a giant reproduction of the famous steinberg cartoon of a little fish about to be eaten by a slightly bigger fish which in turn was about to be eaten by a still bigger fish which also was about to be eaten by an even bigger fish and so on to the border of the cartoon and evidently beyond that to infinity there was nobody in the room clem looked around a bit uncertainly sdate your bizniz pleez said a compiiteroid voice evidently out of the ceiling uh id like to see the head man or ah the head woman as the case may be clem stammered thad would be doktor rauss elysium the computer said he iz not in the offiz today oh ah tell him clem cotex called clem said edging toward the door he suddenly didnt want to investigate the invisible hand any further while he was alone some other time he thought when i have some friends with me your mezzage has been recorded the voice droned behind him as he fled the scene falling girders the apprehension of the real can only be compared to a radiance or illumination because it is a revelation of part of the coherence of the divine act of creation pope stephen integritas consonantia claritas mary margaret wildeblood manhattans bitchiest literary critic was getting just a tiny bit spiflicated she was working on her fifth martini in fact mailer cant write she said argumentatively none of them can write we havent seen a real writer since raymond chandler um said her companion noncommittally he was blake williams what do you mean um mary margaret demanded truculently i was talking nonsense just to see if you were listening they were in the three lions bar on un plaza well in fact i was listening dr williams said urbanely you were comparing mailer to chandler to the disadvantage of mailer however i admit my attention was also wandering a bit i was thinking about the hollandaise sauce enigma he was on his fifth martini too whats that mary margaret asked yet the martinis must have been getting to her because she did not wait for his answer and announced in the voice of discovery the best short story ever written is by john ohara it was a case of food poisoning dr williams said a bunch of people got poisoned by some contaminated hollandaise sauce yet he looped back courteously and asked what short story the robot who used the name frank sullivan came in and took a table near them he was accompanied by peter jackson the black associate editor of confrontation magazine i forget the title mary margaret said it was about a car salesman who has a very good day makes some really topnotch sales and stops at a bar to celebrate before going home he has one drink after another and doesnt get home until after midnight and then get this and then he goes and gets his rifle from the den and oh i read that dr williams said it isnt a short story its a novel called um ah er appointment in samara and he doesnt use a rifle he gasses himself in his car damnedest case i ever heard of pseudosullivan said the ambassador has been on morphine ever since no mary margaret said impatiently that was what the character in appointment in samara did yes everybody knows that one but im talking about a short story ohara wrote much later maybe thirty years later in the short story dammit what is the title in the short story wigged pseudosullivan cried we thought wed have to put him in a straitjacket in the short story mary margaret plowed on noting that williams was listening to the robot the salesman takes the rifle and goes to his bedroom and puts the rifle to his head she paused it worked and williams asked still wondering a bit about the hollandaise sauce mystery and why the ambassador wigged and his wife wakes up mary margaret concluded and she says dont and he doesnt he was hopping all around the room like a chicken on acid and making gargling and choking noises the man called frank sullivan went on he doesnt williams cried thats the point mary margaret said you see like the character in the samara novel this man goes right to the edge he looks over the abyss and then he pulls back at the last moment because his wife speaks to him so its a love story williams said very sneaky and indirect typical of ohara but still a love story he decides to continue carrying his burden whatever it is for the sake of the woman he loves well how much will confrontation pay for this pseudosullivan demanded no its more complicated than that mary margaret argued the motive for the attempted suicide is never explained just like the motive for the real suicide in the samara novel is never explained does it need to be explained williams drawled waving at the waiter for another martini if i were trapped into selling cars for a living id think about blowing my head off occasionally yes but mary margaret said most people never see the emptiness of their lives the way these two characters of oharas do thats the turn of the screw its like the parable sam spade tells brigid oshaughnessy in the maltese falcon how he was hired to find a real estate salesman whod disappeared a salesman again williams noted we are toying with synchronicity when does arthur miller come on the scene wait mary margaret said it gets weirder this salesman in spades story just went out to lunch one day and never returned no evidence of foul play no suicide note nada years pass and his wife wants to marry again so she hires spade to prove the salesman is really dead spade digs around and finds the salesman alive in another town with a new name and a new family he explains to spade what happened when he went out to lunch that day and simply disappeared a girder fell from a building under constructionyou want to talk about synchronicity and almost killed him it missed him only a few feet it was like a satori experience a what peter jackson the black editor cried in astonishment at the next table mary margaret and blake were both hooked they looked deep deep into their martini glasses as they strained not to miss pseudosullivans answer a rehnquist the humanoid said jumpin jesus on a rubber crutch peter jackson said youre not putting me on you mean right in the middle of the staircase where the ambassador had to see it when he came down to the reception pseudosullivan said a great big one like harry reemss or whatshisnames in the porn movies with a pink ribbon around it the company he stressed the word slightly avoiding the initials thinks the kgb did it believe me the ambassador hasnt been the same man since good lord blake williams said its like your fallinggirder story except in this case its a falling rehnquist from the fourth dimension maybe he was thinking that this was too wild to be a kgb project and might involve the paranormal eva gebloomenkraft was there pseudosullivan went on and kept trying to calm the ambassador down but he was just making those gargling noises and turning a funny kinda purple color eva gebloomenkraft jackson said isnt she that rich dame with the big brownmillers who keeps getting eightysixed from nightclubs all over europe yeah pseudosullivan said a jet setter you know but she tried awfully hard to cheer up the ambassador kept making little jokes about freuds theoriescastration anxiety and rehnquist envy and so on by then it had disappeared by the way but we know damned well the ambassador didnt hallucinate it two of our men saw it but they got distracted trying to calm the ambassador down when he first started jumping up and down and howling in a pink ribbon a pink ribbon and what diseased mind could conceive itand stuff like that it was as if this mans life was a watch mary margaret said picking up her own narrative and a jeweler had taken the back off and let him see how the gears worked nothing had meaning anymore in a universe where theres no good reason why a girder hits you or misses you and dashiell hammett wrote this you say williams prompted it sounds very existentialist mary margaret finished her sixth martini hammett not only wrote it she said he lived it he spent ten years working for the pinkertons when class war was really war in this country he knew that the girders fall on the just and the unjust you mean he was a real detective who wrote about fictitious detectives williams was off on his own tangent at once thats like godels proof or escher painting himself painting himself dont get too intellectual about it mary margaret said you might miss the obvious sincerity in spelvins id rather have my mail delivered by lockheed than ride in a plane built by the post office department bartholomew gimble dr dashwood went out to dinner that night with dr bertha van ation the astronomer from griffith observatory who had discovered the two planets beyond pluto dashwood ordered a manhattan with southern comforta combination that had never occurred to him before he wondered how the idea got into his headand dr van ation decided to try the same goethe said man muss entweder der hammer oder der amboss seinyou must be the hammer or the anvil said a voice in the next booth mmm bertha van ation said this is good she was sampling her manhattan with southern comfort of course he was just being melodramatic the voice in the next booth said as an artist he must have known there are states in which you are both the hammer and the anviltheres no eitheror about it thats the creative fire so whats new in astronomy dr dashwood asked uh bertha said oh sorry i was eavesdropping on the next booth the hammer and the anvil dashwood said i heard him too must be a poet they tell me we have more poets of anthology rank whatever that is than any other city in america like the hammerklavier sonata said a new voice a feminine one in the adjoining booth beethoven was both the hammer and the anvil there maybe he even intended the pun he read goethe didnt he read him asked the first voice they knew each other would have been friends if two egomaniacs could become friends this is my favorite vice bertha whispered listening in on the conversation at the next table it sure sounds as if he had that idea in mind the feminine voice said is there any other piano piece where the pianist literally has to hammer away at the keys like that this is weird dashwood whispered i got a crank letter todaywe get them by the ton at orgasm research as you can imagineand it was all about the hammerklavier my what erudite cranks you attract bertha whispered the cranks who write to us at griffith are mostly illiterate farmers who have seen ufos they went walking on the street once the man in the next booth boomed and everybody kept bowing to them goethe finally said i find all this ostentatious honor a bit embarrassing and you know what ludwig said he said dont let it bother you it is me they are honoring the womans silvery laugh had golden highlights of hashish in it thats beethoven for you she said suddenly the two arose they had evidently paid their check already and had been lingering over their coffee dr dashwood and dr van ation without being conspicuous about it looked them over as they left they were both chinese thats san francisco for you dashwood said i bought a vivaldi record the other day bertha said it was made by a classical group in japan and they played his four seasons music on japanese instruments it sounded remarkably like the harpischord he wrote it for m dashwood nodded and weve got all these kids playing sitars and trying to sound like ravi shankar the arts and sciences have always been international bertha said its only our damned politics that remain nationalistic to our sorrow mn dashwood nodded again but as i was asking you a while ago whats new in astronomy well bertha said intensely leaning forward the universe is turning out to be a hell of a lot bigger than we thought even three or four years ago at the other end of the room seated at a table that gave a good view of dashwood the continental op was enjoying swordfish steak he enjoyed it even more when he reminded himself that it could go on the expense account he owed this good fortune to the fact that dashwood did not know his face yet outside and across the street tobias knight was dining on doughnuts and coffee from a deli and bemoaning the fact that this typically warm san francisco day had turned into a typically cold san francisco night he owed this exile in the cold to the fact that dashwood did know his face in washington simon moon had gone cruising at a bar called the easter basket he had there picked up a young boy named marion murphy who had long blond hair and girlish mannerisms both of which were qualities simon appreciated they had gone back to simons pad and smoked some hash then they rapped for a while and simon learned that marion was working on a masters in social psych had a father who was a cop in san francisco and was a member of purity of ecology simon decided not to hold the last fact against the boy when they went to bed simon was the more aggressive at first briggsing young marion with slurping passion but they soon turned it into a game and each one would briggs the other for a while always stopping when it seemed one of them might reach millett after an hour of this they were both on hair trigger and could restrain themselves no longer simon began to bryant marion and they both started howling and panting and moaning until the bedroom began to sound like the lion house at the zoo around mating time it was simon moons idea of a great evening dr dashwood was explaining the three dimensions of briggsing to dr van ation over coffee at the other end of the continent there just cant be any science without dimension dashwood said earnestly fechner was the pioneer psychometrics what tastes sweeter than what and that sort of stuff primitive of course but it was the beginning of the quantification of the subjective and my work could have followed immediately from his except he sighed you know how it is fear and prejudice prevented the application of these methods to sex for a long time dr van ation nodded somberly sincerity we measure in spelvins on a scale of zero to ten dashwood went on totally absorbed in his subject hedonism in lovelacesweve been lucky there subjects are able to distinguish sixteen graduations finally theres the dimension of tendernesswe find zero to seven covers that so that the perfect steinem job if i may use the vernacular would consist of ten spelvins of sincerity sixteen lovelaces of hedonism and seven havens of tenderness it certainly makes our work seem easy by comparison dr van ation said everything is so concrete and objective in astronomy what does that mean marion murphy asked idly simon propping himself up on a pillow looked where the boy was pointing it was a sticker attached to the console of simons home computer and it was in gold and black with a dollar sign over which were imprinted the letters tanstagi oh that simon said its the insignia of the invisible hand society whats it meantanstagi there aint no such thing as government interference simon translated marion rolled over and stared at him what is it some kind of paradox simon smiled in that infuriatingly serene way that the enlightened always smile when dealing with the unenlightened its no paradox he said its a simple statement of fact marion moved a few inches away youre some kind of mystic he asked nervously the only mystics he had met were on the west coast and they were all in his opinion bonkers yes simon said easily we in the invisible hand are mystics but we are also scientists every one of us has an advanced degree in math or quantum physics or computer science or some such field our founder dr rauss elysium was an expert in gravitational geometrodynamicsfourdimensional topology and so onbefore he got into general systems theory and you people with all that math and so on have convinced yourselves that the government doesnt really exist marion was beginning to get an exciting idea he would do his masters on this invisible hand society as an illustration of the psychological law that the more brilliant a mind is the more elaborate will be its delusory system if it snaps thats it simon said calmly a chicken is the eggs way of making more eggs government is anarchys way of making more anarchy let me explain so they were all poisoned by hollandaise sauce mary margaret prompted finishing her seventh martini delicately blake williams was deciding that mary margaret was a damned goodlooking woman considering that she had been a man until six months ago he was on his seventh martini too and marjorie main would have looked like a damned attractive woman to him by then even made up to look like humphrey bogarts mother in dead end yes he said well thats not the mystery they were all rushed to a hospital and had their stomachs pumped and they survived i dont remember what had contaminated the hollandaise sauce but it doesnt really matter thats not the mystery well what is the mystery mary margaret prompted she was encouraging him to talk and that suddenly alarmed him it meant only one thing she was thinking of going to bed with him uh he said the mystery was what happened later he had been thinking she was attractive yes but that was fairly abstract he hadnt really decided and when you faced up to it she was still partly male in his mind what happened later she prompted dammit he thought must have had one martini too many she was a woman now no doubt about it so what was the problem they all came down with the same symptoms again he said the next time they had food with hollandaise sauce the problem was that they would not merely potter stewart there would be a certain amount of foreplay naturally and they would be briggsing each other oh it was a synchronicitytwo cases of contaminated hollandaise sauce hitting the same people mary margaret prompted him again ah no it was far weirder than that what was the matter he had briggsed a lot of women in his time and had been briggsed by a lot of themhe always enjoyed a good steinem job god knowsbut still there was something a bit faggoty about it when the woman was an exman and still partly a man in your memory ah he repeated damning those martinis you see there was nothing wrong with the hollandaise sauce the second time no contaminant at all they werent poisoned they ah just had the symptoms of poisoning that is weird mary margaret said wondering if he was getting so flustered because he had never been to bed with a transsexual before well he was an anthropologist wasnt he he should regard it as an educational experience very weird blake williams said because you cant explain it by conditioning theory conditioning is a slow process remember requiring many repetitions or ah reinforcements thats how pavlovs dog learned that bell means foodrepetition after repetition but the dog level or reflex level of these people had learned that hollandaise sauce means poison in only one exposure he should regard it as an educational experience he decided after all he was an anthropologist well i never believed you could explain everything by conditioning theory mary margaret said im a humanist thats all very well and good im sure blake williams said but ah scientifically the behavior in question was certainly not mediated through the rational circuits of the cortex and does require ah some sort of explanation i mean if it wasnt conditioning what the potter stewart was it mmm said mary margaret mmm how about imprinting what dr williams looked for a moment like the ambassador finding the rehnquist on the stairs imprinting mary margaret said when an animal learns something allatonceinaflash isnt that called imprinting williams stared i think youve got it he said finally how would you ah like to go up to my apartment and discuss this further he was suddenly madly in love with her she had given him a new idea in san francisco dr van ation had been briggsing dr dashwood for twenty minutes he sounded like a man at prayer oh god he kept repeating oh god god god dr van ation was thoroughly enjoying herself dashwood had briggsed her for forty minutes during which she reached millet six times and she was still purring with gratitude oh god god god dashwood croaked as her tongue continued to excite his rehnquist and so simon moon concluded government is just a glitch a semantic hallucination mrnmn said marion murphy simon turned around and looked at the boy and it was as he feared marion was about percent asleep simon had been lecturing virtually to himself for several minutes non lllegitimati carborundum he muttered it was his mantra against resentment wrath and other diseases of the ego he leaned over and kissed marion lightly on the ear mrn marion mumbled simon got up from the bed and padded into the living room where he smoked a little more hash and remembered classrooms back in chicago beatings he had received for being intellectual and queer the first boy he had ever briggsed wasnt his name donald something the beauty of russells definition of number when he finally grasped it the class of all classes that are similar the first time he was bryanted he was afraid it would hurt the strange outofbook experience in new york on hash when he saw that the laws that govern us are partly grammatical and partly pure whimsy and this was very good hash indeed because he could almost remember that experience there was a universe where he was hetero and furbish lousewart was president yes this was very highgrade hash indeed and he almost believed it and why not the math certainly did imply such universes and each universe could be like a book each book a variation on the same theme and the author if one dared to try imagine such a being might even be in a metauniverse which had its own author and so on to infinity but then suddenly hashish is full of surprises simon was weeping remembering his father old tim moon who had been a wobbly organizer all his life and tim was singing joe hill again the copper bosses killed you joe i never died said he oh dad simon said aloud why did you have to die before i ever knew how much i loved you and suddenly he was all alone in an empty living room weeping like an old man whose family and friends were all dead holding his social security check and wondering where is the federal bureau in charge of distributing love which was absurd simon had lots of friends and he was just being morbid oh dadhe sniffed one more timei miss you and then he stopped crying and went and put the fugs record of rameses the second is dead my love on the stereo and floated with the music and the hash into a countryandwestern egyptian paradise hes walking the fields where the blessed live hes gone from memphis to heeeeaaven well mary margaret wildeblood prompted a bit impatiently she was naked on williamss bed and had been lourding herself not vigorously just gently very gently not getting too excited yet merely trying to get him excited just a minute just a minute williams said sitting in his drawers on the side of the bed one sock in his hand it wasnt the transsex thing that was delaying him he was still struggling with the new idea she had given him back at the three lions it isnt just poisoning he said absently anything that shocks the whole neuroendocrine system might do it yes of course artificially induced imprint vulnerability mary margaret seized his hand and placed it firmly between her thighs imprint that she said coyly yes yes he said caressing her absently but just listen a minute orgasm does it um i think no just the first orgasm right you keep repeating the pattern of the first orgasm dont mary margaret said just up there a bit on my atkinson there there ah christ yes yes you dont and a lot of people i know dont he said yes um but the people whose sexual patterns keep changing are a minority certainly theyve changed their imprints somehow um yes yes oh my god what is it mary margaret was becoming cross his hand had stopped moving entirely sorry he said resuming the gentle stimulation on her atkinson and the outer lips of her feinstein i just realized some people keep changing their ideas too theyve loosened the semantic imprints my god thats why conditioning theory is inadequate dont you see the conditioned reflexes are built onto the imprints god god god oh sweet jesus god its a shock to the whole system people whove had neardeath or clinical death experiences shipwrecked sailors and oh jesus i call myself an anthropologist and i never got it before rites of initiation of course thats what theyre all about of course making new imprints oh god oh god darling darling yes yes i love you new imprints of course yes yes are you coming on my little darling god god god ah sweet little darling was it good ah yes you look so sweet now theres nothing as lovely as that postmillett expression but about those imprint circuits shut up and briggs me please darling and so still reflecting on shock and imprint vulnerability and the changing of sexualsemantic imprints blake williams began briggsing a person who had been masculine for almost all the years they had known each other wondering just how queer this was really incidentally dr dashwood asked what do you think the hammerklavier is all about bertha van ation and he were sitting at the kitchen table now sipping a little peach brandy he had found still remaining in the cabinet and munching ritz crackers dr van ation brushed some auburn hairs back from her forehead the black hole she said promptly ah you mean he was feeling dragged down into something he couldnt escape dr dashwood suddenly remembered he wanted to look up jan or was it hans zelenka no not that aspect of it bertha munched and frowned thoughtfully the suspension of all the cosmological laws the end of space the end of time the end of causality dashwood smiled some people thought it was the end of music when it was first performed he said you might be on the right track why thank you sir said she bertha grinned you really think im dragging my own astronomy into the music department you have every right to he said we all see and hear through our own filters to me the hammerklavier sounds like an unsuccessful attempt at tantric sex and the seventh and eighth symphonies sound like monumentally successful attempts thats me dragging my own speciality into the music department you are a doll and youre a living doll isnt sex great if god invented anything better dashwood said quoting an old proverb and adapting it to the feminist age she kept it to herself and how did i score on your scale ten spelvins of sincerity sixteen lovelaces of hedonism and seven havens of tenderness no make that eight havens you went off the scale in hollywood carol christmas the blond goddess of everybodys fantasies was sleeping alone for once she was still involved in sex acts every hour the quantum perturbations pulsed gently through her atoms stimulating her molecules rejuvenating her cells providing a very satisfactory trip for her whole neuroendocrine system and enriching her dreams vastly it was perfect tantric sex and she wasnt even consciously aware of it this was happening to her and had been happening to her since the release of deep mongolian steinem job because she was the blond goddess in so many fantasies all over the world as she slept and even while she was awake in the daytime the quantum inseparability principie quip stimulated her gently because all over the world every hour lonely men were lourding themselves while looking at photographs of her back in new york polly esther doubleknit was wandering around her apartment starknaked her lover of the evening was sound asleep in the bedroom but polly esther was wakeful and thinking of twenty dozen things at once like the second oswald in hong kong and whether fish ever get seasick and how splendidly heavenly it had felt when her lovers tongue was up inside her feinstein and what was the name of the third andrews sistermaxine and laverne and whoand silent tristeros empire and why so many things come in threes not just maxine and laverne and whatshername but curly and larry and moe and tom dick and harry and noahs three sons ham shem and japhet and groucho chico and harpo and brahma vishnu and shiva and past present and future and breakfast lunch and dinner and the three witches in macbeth and the three brothers who start on the same quest in all the old fairy tales and the executive the legislative and the judiciary and of course the big three pops jc and smokey and maybe she should cut down on those diet pills it was absurd to be wandering around at three in the morning thinking in threes and then there was updown backforward and rightleft the three dimensions in space and wynken blynken and nod and the three wise men whozit and whatzisname and melchior and peter jack and martin the three brothers in swifts tale of a tub and peter paul and mary and the kingston trio and friends romans countrymen which was not only a triad but a progressive triad one beat two beats three beats one two three just like that and she would definitely cut down on the diet pills polly esther finally put a record on the stereo turning the volume down to low so as not to waken her lover in the bedroom she picked the hammerklavier sonata not out of coincidence or propinquity or even synchronicity but just because it was her favorite of beethovens piano pieces it was her favorite because she couldnt understand it no matter now often she played it it was the musical equivalent of a zen koan to her endlessly fascinating because endlessly enigmatic the stark discordant opening bars drove all wandering threesomes out of her mind narrowing her attention to ludwigs urgent if incomprehensible universe of structured sound she was swept into it again as always swept along by emotions so deep and yet so austere that nobody has ever been able to name them once she had invited the worlds three most admired concert pianists to a party just so she could ask each of them privately what they thought the hammerklavier meant as she expected she had gotten three wildly conflicting answers another time she had ordered every book in print about beethoven from doubledays on fiftythird street at fifth avenue and looked up hammerklavier in the index of each she got fortyfour different opinions that way the music hammered and surged along carrying her through pain and frustration and loneliness to land again and again at things beyond such simple feelings things that she sometimes felt were extraterrestrial or noneuclidean or somehow beyond normal human perception there are some kinds of knowledge ludwig had once claimed that can only be expressed in music not in any other art not in science or philosophy this was the most arcane of such knowledge ludwigs most intimate secret and maybe you werent entitled to understand it until you had been to the strange dark places of the psyche out of which he had created it it was the childbirth process of courseand polly esther did not consider it a miracle that ludwig could understand that he was so obviously bi at least empatheticallythe labor pains going on and on until the act of creation seemed impossible you would never get there and yet somehow even in the blocked hopeless feeling you were getting there and it was all the terrors of his childhood all those cruel beatings by his alcoholic father remembered and not forgiven never forgiven but it was also that cold analytical almost scientific side of ludwig remorselessly following his experiment to its inexorable conclusion he had discovered or rediscovered that the piano is among other things a percussion instrument and he was following the logic of that insight as he followed every musical idea to wherever it led him to whatever abyss and after thinking all that polly esther knew she still didnt understand the hammerklavier but as it banged and howled to its defiant conclusion she got a flash of one aspect she had never registered before it was the last scene of papillon when after twelve years of horror steve mcqueen finally escapes from devils island on his homemade raft of coconut shells and floats off into the atlantic as ludwig floats off at the end of the hammerklavier shouting to the hostile sea and the indifferent sky im still here you sonsofbitches and after that polly esther was cleaned out drained purified no more triangles haunted her she turned off the stereo yawned contentedly and padded back to her bed her lover was still sleeping twisted around in the covers so that her right leg stuck out decorated with goose pimples from the cold air polly esther rearranged the bedding to cover the girl and climbed in beside her hugging her tenderly once but not enough to waken her then there were only a few remembered bars of the hammerklavier and one more trio drifted up wyatt morgan and vergil the earp brothers and then polly esther slept part one coming to a head art imitates nature aristotle nature imitates art oscar wilde whatme infallible the first entry of sin into the mind occurs when out of cowardice or conformity or vanity the real is replaced by a comforting lie pope stephen integritas consonantia claritas dr dashwood as usual began friday by scanning the mail the first letter said this is an entirely new kind of chain letter we represent the fertilizer society of unistat it will not cost you a cent to join upon receipt of this letter go to the address at the top of the list and burger on their front lawn you wont be the only one there so dont be embarrassed then make five copies of this letter leaving the top name off and adding your name and address at the bottom send them to five of your best friends and urge them to do the same you wont get any money but within five weeks if this chain is not broken you will have strangers burgering on your lawn here comes everybody your reward next summer will be the greenest lawn on the block do not break this chain everybody who has broken it has within five days suffered acute prolonged and inexplicable constipation which responds to no known laxative and requires in each case intervention of the apple corer or its surgical equivalent dr dashwood made a mistake he assumed this was another hoax by the enigmatic ezra pound polly esther doubleknit was a devout roman catholic and went to confession that saturday i did a naughtynaughty with a secretary again she said how shocking said her confessor in a profoundly bored tone was she cute she was an absolutely adorable little blond creature i hope you both enjoyed yourselves said the priest but why are you telling me about this hedonic little escapade polly esther whispered i guess i feel guilty i was raised baptist you know but youre a catholic now the priest father starhawk said and as a convert you probably know the theology better than people who were born into it now tell me what is a sin a sin polly esther recited promptly is to knowingly hurt a sentient being except where it would be a greater sin a greater hurt to refrain father starhawk went on thats why its no sin to kill a virus remember now did you hurt your cute little blond playmate no of course not did you make her happy i think so polly esther said wistfully she wants to see me again monday night then i think you made her happy father starhawk said how many times did she reach millett six or seven i think then im sure you made her happy the priest said kindly as a mere male i must say i envy the female capacity for multiple millett now obviously your little party with this secretary was not harmful but joyful so it was not a sin but the opposite of a sin a work of virtue and you know the teachings of moral theology well enough to understand that so why are you wasting my time i guess its just my baptist upbringing polly esther murmured you must clear your mind of all superstition the priest said because such nonsense muddies the intellect and keeps you from thinking clearly about real moral issues now do you have something real to confess yes polly esther said nervously well father starhawks jovial tone suddenly turned stern i think some of my money comes from slum properties polly choked then sighed deeply it was a relief to say it to have it out in the open you think the priest cried angrily you havent found out for sure how long have you had this suspicion since about a week ago last thursday and what efforts have you made to find the facts about this grave matter which may be i remind you a mortal sin polly esther trembled i tried she said but the way corporations are these days i get twelve different stories every time i ask the lawyers but i really think we own some of the worst parts of newark the priest was silent for a long time its my fault he said finally i was never strict enough with you what is the first moral law about money to ensure that no human being was being hurt in acquiring it and if anyone was hurt to return the money to them and make whatever other restitution is morally necessary to ensure father starhawk repeated solemnly saint francis xavier said that many centuries ago a great and holy saint and he specifically instructed priests to be certain that nobody received absolution until they had given up all monies acquired from usury or other social injustices that was long before pope stephen my child and it is the moral backbone of the church i cannot give you absolution until you have examined your conscience on this matter and made whatever change is morally necessary ill have a special board meeting and get to the bottom of it polly esther said thank you father for restoring my vision of reality that is the function of the church father starhawk said and then he added softly pray for me please i am a sinner also father starhawk was a cherokee indian and a stephenite the stephenites were the most radical of all the catholic clergy and made even the neojesuits under general berrigan seem like milkwater liberals by comparison there was virtually no nation on earth which didnt have several stephenites in prison for what the stephenites called following the laws of god rather than the laws of man members of the stephenite order absolutely refused to countenance any behavior that fell short of the ideals in the late pope stephens encyclicals on social justice and hat the stephenites would not countenance they would resist it was the passive nonviolent nature of their resistance that made the stephenites so troublesome to persons in authority it is impossible to jail nonviolent idealists without a large part of the world sympathizing with them father starhawk had served three terms himself for passively resisting unistats wars against cuba puerto rico and the peoples republic of hawaii like all stephenites he wrote the familiar lapel button with a photo of pope stephen the famous black patch over his blind eye and the sainted popes famous remark whatme infallible pope stephen had totally revolutionized the catholic church during his brief fiveyear reign indeed as the french feminist jeanne paulette sartre said this one man has singlehandedly turned the most reactionary church on this planet into the most progressive it was due to pope stephen that the social gospel previously preached only by a minority of farout jesuits and workerpriests became the official vatican policy by being the first to denounce hitler and mussolini and excommunicating their supporters pope stephen had knowingly risked the biggest rupture within the church since the time of luther but while nearly percent of the catholics in germany and italy continued to follow their national leaders over percent obeyed the pope and both dictators fell from power adolf hitler became a portrait painter again and benito mussolini deprived of power returned to his early belief in anarchism and spent his declining years writing fiery journalism against all those who did manage to achieve and hold on to political power at the time of pope stephens death in it was estimated that the wealth of the vatican was less than percent of what it had been when he took the chair of peter but its prestige about percent higher the pope had spent percent of the vaticans wealth in projects for the abolition of poverty disease and ignorance many regarded him as a saint but pope stephen always tried to discourage that view he ended every conversation with i am a sinner also which became a habit with stephenites father starhawk for instance ended all his conversations that way and also used it for the tag line of all his theological articles and his private correspondence it must be admitted however that the first irish pope did have his own brand of arrogance he believed he was the best latin stylist since cicero and was rather vain about his command of english italian french german spanish danish and hebrew also he was also convinced that he was a greater psychologist than james or jung and it was only when their names were mentioned that a tinge of uncharitable sarcasm would enter his speech pope stephen in fact had a habit of listening far more than he spoke which led many to regard him as a bit aloof actually he spoke little because he was so busy observing this passion for studying other human beings had gradually turned him from a disputatious young intellectual into an almost pathologically sensitive middleaged man because the more he observed people the more he liked them and the more he liked them the less able he was to bear seeing or hearing of injustice to anyone anywhere on one occasion a learned and erudite french cardinal said to the pope referring to the steady parade of visitors to the vatican you must find most of these nonentities profoundly boring he was making the usual mistake of interpreting the popes long silence as a sign of ennui butthere are no bores stephen said shocked you are being paradoxical the cardinal chided not at all the pope said dogmatically i have never met a boring human being it was the only time anybody ever heard him pontificate it was due to pope stephen that every catholic priest was not only allowed but encouraged to get married living with the mystery of the feminine mind he said is the best training for trying to cope with the greater mysteries of the divine mind he himself had married a peasant girl from galway who was said to be barely literate and his love for her was legendary nobody knew what the pope and his wife ever found to talk about since she obviously did not share any of his intellectual interests actually with his wife as with most of humanity the irish pope spent most of his time listening not talking because of the liberality of his sexual views the irish pope was still controversial among conservative catholics who claimed he was a pervert and were forever trying to have him posthumously excommunicated they also spread rumors about his private life which had gained so much currency that whenever his name was mentioned somebody would mutter garters garters garters pope stephens whole philosophy was derived from a single sentence in aquinas ad pulchritudinem tria requiruntur integritas consonantia claritas which may be rendered three things are required for beauty wholeness harmony radiance it was stephens thought that the universe as the product of a great artist must be comprehensible in terms of integritas consonantia claritaswholeness harmony radiance why then he asked himself does it not appear so to the ordinary human mind the only answer he could find was that we are not paying attention we have not learned to observe closely enough we do not have the artists eye for detail and so pope stephen paid very close attention to everything that entered his field of perception at the time of the irish popes death in obituary writers all over the world compared him to every saint and sage in history buddha whitman plotinus rumi dante eckhart john of arc st terrence of avilla and so on and on but the one who came closest to categorizing how stephens mind worked was an obscure canadian professor of literature who wrote the only mind in history comparable to stephens was that of a fictitious charactermr sherlock holmes of baker street like tobias knight pope stephen had spent all his life trying to find out what the hell was really going on although he never expressed it that way he had decided that what was going on was that everybody was very carefully avoiding paying attention to what was going on the stephenites called themselves seekers of the real and were always watching very closely to see what was going on they all had posters in their rooms with the sainted popes famous remark if you dont pay attention to every little detail you miss most of the jokes when dr dashwood went out to lunch that day he was stopped on the street by a haggard and wildeyed minor bureaucrat who said his name was joseph k they have everybody mindwarped joseph k said clutching dashwoods sleeve desperately yes yes dashwood said trying to disentangle himself but i really must hurry what are the charges against me joseph k demanded what are the charges against any of us we all try to obey their rules dont we of course we do we know what will happen at the slightest the most minute the most microscopic infraction do we not not that i mean to imply that they are wrong necessarily or unjust you wont find any subversive literature or pornography in my room i can assure you absolutelyno certainly not unjust or in any way unfair but it must be admitted that in the application of the rules in the application i say they are sometimes overfinicky a bit strained and literal if you take my meaning certainly certainly dashwood said struggling to remove joseph ks fingers from his sleeve but if you were to see a good counselornot a psychiatrist necessarily i dont mean to imply we are all guilty joseph k said flatly they have established so many rules and recorded them in archives that the ordinary citizen cannot consult that we must all the most loyal and decent of us stumble on a mere technicality occasionally not that i mean to assert that technicalities are not necessary you understand since it is important to spell out in detail the exact meaning intended in a statute dont you agree george frank dashwood said automatically joseph k suddenly looked sly oh he said slowly you claim that you are not george dorn how clever of them although i cant imagine how they persuaded you but of course a man of your moral principles would not be bribed certainly they must have convinced you it was for my own good in some absolute metaphysical sense right certainly you would not work for them out of malice would you he released dashwood with a poignant despairing gesture you mean well he said they all mean well i know but i am innocent i tell you he backed away and you are george dorn and i am not deceived he added bitterly then he turned and ran pararealisme the big news of the season in the art world was that francois loupgarou had abandoned neosurrealism and founded a new school of art called pararealisme this was only partly the result of the rehnquist in the lobster newburg it was also a matter of economics for nearly a century it had been very important for an artist to belong to a school and it was even better to be the founder of a school this was not just a case of in union there is strength it was also a shrewd marketing strategy it might take an individual painter ten or twenty years to be discoveredif he were original it might take much longer and he might not be alive to enjoy itbut when a school of art was formed that was news and all members of the school were discovered simultaneously there had been an impressionist school a postimpressionist school an expressionist school an abstract expressionist school a cubist school a futurist school a pop school and an op school and so on francois loupgarou had noticed that the commercial life of each school was getting shorter all the time due to the accelerated intensity of competition neosurrealism was already being eclipsed as an object of news and debate by the neocubism of the american burroughs he decided it was time to launch a new school after the experience of the rehnquist in the lobster newburg pararealisme seemed appropriate to him according to standard operating procedure he got a few friends together and they began issuing proclamations denouncing all other schools especially neocubism as obsolete and reactionary this got them into the art journals and into some newspapers then they held their own first show and that got them into the international news magazines they were news it didnt really matter if their paintings were any good at all in fact their paintings were rather good in a fey sort of way they had revived traditional representational art everything they did was as naturalistic as a news photograph but with a difference that made a difference the largest canvas at the first pararealiste show was loupgarous own what do you make of this professor an enormous work it was covering two walls bent in the middle on a special hinged frame it showed a ceruleanblue sky with hailstones thousands and thousands of hailstones six months painstaking labor and each hailstone had a tiny image of the virgin mary on it puzzled viewers might have found some enlightenment in the first pararealiste manifesto we of the pararealiste movement recognizing the meaninglessness of this chaos that fools call life find the relevance of existence only in its monstrosities but we are not existentialists or anything of that sort thank god and besides the perversities of humanity have grown boring after the fernando poo incident what can a mere man do that will shock us it is the abnormalities of nature that we find illuminating that is what distinguishes us from sadists new leftists and other intellectual hoodlums we are delighted that pluto mickey and goofy are all at odd angles from the plane of the eight inner planets we are thrilled with bohrs great principle of relativity which shows that to look out into space is also to look backward in time we are the day after yesterday some said that the pararealistes were even better at writing manifestos than at painting pictures but they meant what they said the hailstones in what do you make of this professor were no image of dream or deliriumwe spit on surrealism fantasy is every bit as dreary as logic it is the real that we seek the first manifesto had also declared what loupgarou had so painstakingly depicted was an occurrence that actually happened at lyons in xeroxes of the old newspaper stories about the event peasants see virgin on hailstones were distributed to the press emphasizing again that pararealistes only painted the real or as they always wrote the real little pierre de la nuitpierrot le fou he styled himselfwas loupgarous best friend and had contributed seventeen canvases to the first show magnificent monstrous things they were of courseflying saucers all of them blue and gold and silver and green and bright orange shaped like doughnuts or boomerangs or ellipsoids or cones every one of them had been reported in the sky by somebody or other in the past forty years loupgarou circulated news stories about each sighting you can be sure to demonstrate again pararealismes devotion to the real then there was jean culs the sheepcow some claimed it was the greatest of all pararealiste paintings it portrayed an animal halfsheep and halfcow a veritable insult to the laws of genetics such an animal had been born in simcoe ontario in they circulated news stories about it all of this created so much international discussion that the pararealistes immediately released the second manifesto they had learned something about pr from the early surrealists they denounced those who did not like their paintings as fools they then denounced those who did like their paintings as damned fools for liking them for the wrong reasons they went on to fulminate against everybody in general we renounce and hurl invective upon the rationalist conducting experiments in his laboratory every instrument he uses is a creation of human narcissism it emerges from the human ego as athene from the head of zeus the rationalist imposes his own order on these instruments they impose order on the data and he then proclaims that the universe is as constipated and mechanistic as his own mind what has this epistemological masturbation to do with the real and we abominate and cast fulminations upon the irrationalist also behold him in his drugged stupor maddened by opium or hashish gazing inward and depicting his childish dream and nightmares on canvas he is as limited by the human unconscious as the rationalist is by the human conscious neither of them can see the real it reads better in the original french but it would have been a top news story if it hadnt been eclipsed by the singularly obscene miracle at canterbury cathedral that week the details of the alleged miracle had been censored and covered up by high church officials from the very beginning newspapers at first printed only short items saying that something strange caused the archbishop of canterbury to turn a ghastly white during mass and stumble so badly that he fell off the altar of course some cynics immediately assumed that his eminence was as drunk as a skunk there are always types like that believing the worst of everybody then the rumors started to circulate those who had been in the cathedral said that the most reverend archbishop had not so much stumbled as jumped and that his expression was one of such fear and loathing that all present felt at once that something distinctly eldritch and unholy had invaded the church others imaginative types and religious hysterics claimed to have felt something cold and clammy moving in the air or to have seen auras by the time the rumors had gone three times around the united kingdom and twice around europe there were details that came out of the necronomicon or the grim fictions of stoker machen walpole horned men things with tentacles and linda lovelace were prominently featured in these embroidered versions of the canterbury horror as it was beginning to be called the press of course got more interested at this point and the reverend archbishop was constantly besieged to conform or deny the most outlandish and distasteful reports about what had occurred at first his eminence refused to speak to the press at all but finally by the time some scandal sheets were claiming that nyarlathotep the mad faceless god of khem had appeared on the altar bellowing cthulhu fthagn the archbishop issued a terse statement through his press secretary nothing untoward happened his eminence merely tripped on the altar rug and any further discussion would be futile this merely fanned the flames of rumor of course one legend circulated even more than the others perhaps because it appealed to prurient interest or maybe just because it was the version given by a few people who had actually been in the cathedral during mass according to this yarn a miraculous flying rehnquist just like the ones in the murals at pompeii except that it didnt have wingshad soared across the front of the church barely missing his eminences high episcopal nose the judicious of course did not credit this wild rumor they were all coming around as the judicious usually do to the view of the cynics the archbishop they said had been stewed to the gills his eminence was no fool however after the first shock he had begun his own investigation aided by a few trusted deacons they found the slingshot abandoned on the floor of the first pew to the right that was the direction the rehnquist had come from and they all breathed a sigh of relief the archbishop told them then the rumors he had heard about the incident of the unistat ambassador who had to be put on morphine after finding it wrapped in pink ribbon on a staircase we are dealing with a deranged mind his eminence said but not with anything supernatural thank god they never found the rehnquist but as the archbishop pointed out the perpetrator may have confederates everybody tried to remember who had been sitting in the extreme right of the first pew they carefully made up a list including everybodys separate memories halfmemories or pseudomemories the list looked like this lord and lady bugge the hon guy fawkeshunt mp and eva gebloomenkraft ken campbell and eva gebloomenkraft the hon fission chips frs and eva gebloomenkraft one name seems to stand out doesnt it asked his eminence eva gebloomenkraft said a deacon isnt she that jet set millionairess who got into so much trouble in unistat two years ago for putting laughing gas in the air conditioning system at a meeting of the joint chiefs of staff the sudden death of bonny benedict created waves of confusion and apprehension far beyond what ordinarily would have resulted from such a tragic accident the first one affected was polly esther doubleknit who called down from her executive office to the city desk at once what the hell happened to bonny she demanded the city editor spoke in a hoarse croak it seems to be what the tv news said a heart attack he was beginning to feel that hed be the next victim since his blood pressure seemed to be rising every minute a heart attack polly esther was dumbfounded but what about the man hes being held of course the city editor said but god knows what theyll charge him withmanslaughter negligent homicide who knows theres never been a case like this before they had better charge him with something polly esther said crisply or this paper will land on the das office with all four feet do i make myself clear admiral babbit nearly jumped out of his skin when the news reached washington its those briggsing bryanting faggots from alexandria he screamed and theyre gonna try to pin it on us this was a defensive overreaction caused by the fact that old iron balls had been contemplating various ways of bringing about the demise of ms benedict but he distrusted einstein and neuroanalysisjewish egghead stuffand never realized that most of his mentations consisted of defensive overreactions ill fix those rehnquistsuckers he said to an aide get old de la plume and tell him ive got a big job for him this referred to mr shemus de la plume naval intelligences ace handwriting forger and so within thirtysix hours the washington post had come into possession of a diary allegedly written by john disk the man who had killed bonny benedict the diary only looked cryptic at first glance with a little study anybody with at least two inches of forehead could figure out from the abbreviations and clumsy codes used that disk had been an employee of the central intelligence agency this was quite a shock to both disk and the cia who had never had any connection with each other actually disk had been raised in the true holy roman catholic church a bizarre fascistoid splinter group which had broken with the vatican during the reign of pope stephen of dublin when disk reached his adolescence in the early s however strange things began to happen to him at first he thought it was demonshe had seen the exorcist and believed every bit of itbut his priest told him it was all because he kept lourding himself disk went to confession every time he gave in to the temptation to lourdeoff which was five times a week after he reached seventeen and the priest kept telling him to use selfcontrol and take cold showers the priest also said that all the demons were in hell and johnny should stop worrying about them the only people who believed in demonic possession the priest said were the benighted fanatics in the orthodox holy roman catholic church everybody in the true holy roman catholic church despised and hated the members of the orthodox holy roman catholic church which was another splinter group that had broken away from the vatican during the reign of pope stephen the members of the orthodox holy roman catholic church hated them back you can be sure in fact in the typical manner of splinter groups they each hated the other more than they hated the common enemy the heretics in the vatican john disk finally decided that what was wrong with him was not caused by demons andsince he was able to cut down on his lourdingoff to only twice a week after he passed twentyit wasnt entirely caused by sin either he was being poisoned the reason he had cycles of agitation and elation followed by cycles of anxiety and growing fear that everything was somehow unreal was because he was eating an impure diet the reason there were wars and rumors of wars and revolutions and depressions and pornography and lewd sinful women in immodest clothing on every street was because all the food was full of toxic minddestroying chemicals the people responsible for this were the triangular commission the power elite the elders of zion the bavarian illuminati and the american medical association he had learned this by reading books on organic diet from bookstores run by the john birch society the natural hygienists the purity of ecology party and various other groups who were inclined to go through cycles of agitation elation anxiety feelings of unreality etc and had realized this was caused by impurity of essence in their food john disk read a great deal of this literature and changed his mind about twenty times before he finally decided which school of correct nutrition was really correct he decided purity of ecology was the group that really knew what the hell was going on he believed every word in unsafe wherever you go by poes founder furbish lousewart by the age of twentythree disk was a typical poe member when not putting in his thirty hours a week working in their printing plantwhere he received lodging and an organic diet in lieu of payhe was out on the streets selling their newspaper doom or giving away their fourpage minipamphlets which had titles like poison in every pot science satans plot against god and man and jimmy carter servant of the jesuitzionist conspiracy poe hated president carter because he had defeated furbish lousewart in the election but with the typical logic of splinter groups they did not hate carter nearly as much as they hated eve hubbard of the libertarian immortalist party who also got more votes than lousewart even though she came in third the poe people hated the libertarian immortalists for another reason which was that the lip platform was blasphemous and unpatriotic hubbards slogan was no more death and taxes she planned to end taxes by running the government like a profitsharing corporation terminating all interference in the internal affairs of other countries thus allowing the military budget to be cut every year instead of growing every year and paying each citizen a dividend on the profits the unistat corporation earned through investing in space colonization to tap into the vast energy and resources of free space hubbard planned to end death by investing the profits from space in longevity research which the majority of scientists in the field were now convinced could lead to doubling or tripling the human life span in the first generation and could lead to indefinite expansion thereafter the poe people realized that these proposals were scientific and rational they therefore regarded them as satanic after three years in poe john disk still had cycles of agitation and unreality but the leaders of the cult assured him that it took at least that long for the poisons in his previous diet to leave his system totally if he stayed on the correct poe diet they insisted he would become as serene as they were still things were getting to be more unreal more of the time disk looked in the mirror one morning combing his hair and seemed to see a middleaged man looking out at him it was only a flash a single crack in the fabric of time but it was unnerving when the face turned back to his ownyoung blackhaired palehe wondered for a wild moment if he were truly a young man who had had a vision of himself twenty years older or a middleaged man who was now having a hallucination of himself twenty years younger but that was only a short fugue for in a moment he recognized that the face in the mirror was not his twentyyearslater but rather a face that had adorned the cover of time magazine a few months ago it was the face of dr francis dashwood president of orgasm research inc commie pervert satanist sinner who spent most of his time observing things that john would like to do but was afraid to do because of twenty years of conditioning by the true holy roman catholic church which was bad enough certainly but not as bad as what was to come voices at first so faint as to be barely perceptible but slowly and insidiously growing louder voices which were female and kept saying you are george dorn and imagine you can see my brownmillers through my sweater and the interpenetration of the universes has begun but mostly saying over and over you are george dorn and there were occasions only a second in external time but stretching to infinity in a multiple of new dimensions he found or created within when the sages would gather him into their maybe realm in addition to a yes and a no the universe contains a maybe was the password to pass the lurker at the threshold and there would be jesus saying is it not written ye are gods and emperor norton saying i just made myself emperor of unistat protector of mexico and king of the jews and fed xing saying there are many universes and mindstates and beethoven singing the evolutionary scenario in eight cycles and great chtulhus starry wisdom band and glorious lucifer son of the morning who had never fallen because the message of the scriptures was written backward in a mirror and then linda lovelace would come in and start doing disgusting immoral things and he would be back the splinter of eternity contracting the euclidean d standing on a street handing out poison in every pot and wondering if he was losing his mind but the good parts of it were so good jesus and the weird but wise emperor norton and some of the space brothers that he wished it would continue if only it didnt keep turning into that sinful and disgusting business about linda lovelace but he was beginning to figure it out he was not the fool they thought himnot by a long shot he knew that now that the poisons in the food were beginning to wear off they had started aiming an electronic thought control machine at his brain so he did not pay attention no matter how many times the seductive female voice said you are george dorn you are george dorn you are george dorn so when he had read that bitch that briggsing bryanting whore for the big corporations and the sex educators and cattle mutilators of the satanistvaticanzionist conspiracy that lying tool of the establishment that contemptible bonny benedict claiming that furbish lousewart was a hypocrite and a meateater claiming it when he knew it was not could not be true damn her the pig whore of the jewjesuit money powers as if a real christian american like furbish would pollute his body the temple of god with the flesh of a dead animal the lying whore he knew he would fix her and fix her good and proper and show them all the demonic jackalheaded lot of them with their laser beams flashing into his brain saying you are george dorn you are george dorn so he knew the perfect thing the only way to express total contempt for the pig establishment the great lessons of the sages of the clownological counterculture the attack that frightened punished and humiliated all at once and yet had to be endured as only a joke the bitch that would fix her so he bought the pie a boston cream special that was rich and thick according to the sign in the bakery and waited for her in the morning outside the new york newstimespostetc and when the bitch the lying whore got out of her limousine he was ready he stepped forward and he let her have it smash right in the face but then the old ladymy god she looked like his mother he realizedstarted choking and wheezing and fell down on the sidewalk and he knew he knew even before the cop arrived from the corner even before the crowd told the cop in great anger and outrage what had happened even before the ambulance arrived even before the doctor said shes gone and then the cop looked at him and he knew all the rest of it the booking and the fingerprinting and the mug shot and then being alone in the cell all night with the voices saying you are george dorn things were coming to a head nathaniel f x drest secret chief of the unistat sector cia had felt uneasy for a long time since the death of president carter in fact it wasnt just that the thenvice president nowpresident hugh crane was right out of nowhere a total unknown not one of them similar situations had arisen a few times in the past and the novice had easily been initiated into the secret science of strange loops and mind control seducedwithout the necessity of bribery cajolery or threatsinto gladly becoming one of them no the unsettling thing was that carters death was unplanned random a surprise to everyone it might even have been due to natural causes yes things were definitely and bodaciously coming to a head nathaniel drest had not lasted as secret chief of the cia for thirty years without acquiring great pragmatic savvy about the spooky side of predestination once is happenstance twice is coincidence three times is enemy action had been the motto of one of the great masters of strange loops lan fleming himself but drest knew that what was really going on was far weirder than even fleming could comprehend behind the mild professorial bespectacled facade of nathaniel drest officially listed as economics researcher in the budget reports was the one man capable of serving as secret chief of the unistat cia through thirty long years while one dummy after another posed as the official head of the clandestine organization drest was a philosopher and a visionary he had forged from machiavelli marx lenin mao mussolini nietzsche napoleon william f buckley jr and the three legendary sages turing fleming wheatleythe coldly logical existential pragmatic strategy for eternal rule by himself and his friends in them and total extermination and eradication of all possibility of rebellion by the rest of humanity he had been told once by a sociobiologist that he was a giant dna robot programmed to advance the growth and expansion of his gene pool he thought that was an amusing although limited view of what was going on and he certainly had no interest in such evolutionary theories as justifications of what he did he needed no justifications that his goals were rationally desirable to him was all that was necessary or profitable to contemplate the world certainly deserved to be ruled by his gene pool by those white anglosaxon presbyterians and episcopalians who had gone to groton and harvard and occasionally there would be room for a bright boy from yale and this was so obvious that it needed no longrange evolutionary justifications you just had to look around the world to see that no other gene pool was smart enough tough enough and fundamentally liberal enough to do the job justly and wisely john ruskin and cecil rhodes had seen the choice a century ago a world ruled by one anglo oligarchy on scientific and socialist principles or a world of anarchy and chaos with constant wars and revolutions of course there had been some anarchy chaos wars and revolutions since drest had taken over but that was due to surviving ideological poisons on the international system and would be cured when the planet had been on the correct drestdirected mental diet for a few more decades but things were coming to a head the damned ruskies still obstinately clung to their obsolete adam smith economics and much of the islamic world was unruly and rebellious but worst of all was the discordian society drest knew all about the discordian society or thought he did he was convinced they were behind this latest attempt to discredit the company with that forged diary linking them to the bonny benedict cream pie murder he also believed that they were the secret organization behind all the lesser conspiracies that annoyed and sometimes frustrated himthe malignantly nihilistic network that had potter stewarted his own computer and god knows how many other computers the dupes in poe and the libertarian immortalist party the damned moralistic meddlesome stephenites weather underground the traitors over at naval intelligence the sinister invisible hand society the terroristic morituri and the damned ruskies and arabs drest had first learned about the discordian society in a strange obscene subversive novel called illuminatus he was convinced it was all fiction at first but then he discovered that the alleged bible of the discordians the perverse and paradoxical principia discordia actually existed when he put two men on the case they soon reported that copies of the principia could be found in many sciencefiction and libertarian bookstores all over unistat and that it could be ordered through the mail from a company absurdly and disarmingly named loompanics unlimited in port townsend washington of course he wanted to believe that was all there was to it just a small oddball cult no more likely to influence events than the libertarian immortalists were but then bit by bit the damning details accumulated emperor joshua norton king of the jews was a discordian saint and emperor norton was also inexplicably becoming an in person there was a play about emperor norton running in san francisco posters celebrating him for sale all over the country the discordian mantra fnord was seen scrawled on walls in more and more places and on the pyramid on the back of the dollar bill characters in illuminatus who he had assumed were fictional often appeared writing book or movie reviews for various magazines and a check showed that they had been writing letters to the playboy forum and the chicago newspapers since the early s discordian cabals appeared in england germany japan australia and the most unlikely places drest had made a careful study of the discordian philosophy and realized it was the kind of outlandish nonsense that would appeal to the kind of people who made all the trouble in historybrilliant intellectual slightly deranged dope fiends and oddball mathandtechnology buffs many of the pioneer discordians were computer programmers he remembered that fact every time the companys computer answered a simple program with give me a cookie or the government sucks and others had documented links with the libertarian immortalists the lsd subculture and groups as sinister as the witches and the anarchists the discordians believed that god was a crazy woman for the woman part of it they used the usual taoist and feminist arguments about the creative force being dark female subtle fecund and in every way opposite to male authoritarianism for the crazy part they pointed to pickerings moon which goes around backward to rains of crabs and periwinkles and live snakes to the paradoxes of quantum theory and to the religious and political behavior of humanity itself all of which they claimed demonstrated that the fabric of reality was a mosaic of chaos confusion deception delusion and strange loops and drest knew they were definitely linked with the network although computer specialists only spoke of the network in whispers the company had a detailed file on them the network was devoted to the longsuppressed much persecuted but persistent underground religion of cocaine founded by the eccentric physician sigmund freud they devoutly believed in the literal truth of freuds vision of the superman what is man a bridge between the primate and the supermana bridge over an abyss freud wrote in his diary of a hope fiend to achieve the superman the network was systematically frustrating every other group of conspirators on the planet by glitching the computers and meanwhile diverting funds from legitimate activities to subsidize dissident scientists engaged in research on immortality and higher intelligence cocaine is a memory of the future was the sick slogan of this misguided group of deranged intellectuals our minds will function as ecstatically as on cocaine without the jitters once we achieve immortality and learn to reprogram our brains as efficiently as we reprogram our computers they went on when we dont have to die and can constantly increase our awareness of detail they also said we will have no more problems only adventures naturally every government in the world even the nearanarchistic free market maniacs in russia had outlawed this bizarre cult an even more sinister discordian front organization according to drests coldly logical analysis of what was really going on was the insidious invisible hand society what was most devious about the invisible handers was that they disdained secrecy and operated right out in the open telling everybody what they were doing and why and what they hoped to accomplish they had offices in all major cities and gave free courses in their politicoeconomic system just like the old henry george schools at the turn of the century it was very hard for drest to persuade the other eight unknown men who ruled the cia in other parts of the world that the invisible hand was the most dangerous sort of conspiracy a conspiracy doesnt operate in the open they kept reminding him sometimes they would tell him he was working too hard and should take a vacation thats whats so subtle and devilish about it drest would explain over and over nobody can recognize a conspiracy thats out in the open its a kind of optical illusion that theyre using to undermine us but they dont believe we exist he would be told thats an oversimplification he would insist they admit we exist and occupy spacetime and so on they just teach that all the titles we give ourselves are meaningless and all our acts are futile since the invisible hand controls everything anyway the other eight would again suggest that drest needed a vacation things were coming to a head the first lesson given to people who signed up for the course of political and economic reality at the invisible hand society drest knew concerned policemen and soldiers two men in blue uniforms would appear on the stage carrying guns blue uniforms are real the lecturer would say guns are real policemen are a social fiction three men in brown uniforms would appear carrying rifles brown uniforms are real the lecturer would say rifles are real soldiers are a social fiction and so it would go all through the lecture pure mindrot and thank god most people found it all so absurd and yet so frightening that they never came back for any of the subsequent lectures but the people who did come back worried drest they were the types he loathed and feared like cassius they had a lean and hungry look and they thought too much and they thought about the wrong things and now there was the matter of the materializinganddematerializing rehnquist obviously a discordian plot in drests estimation what other group could conceive it much less organize and accomplish it fnord indeed there had been the case of the ambassador who found it on a staircase and the antipornography crusader who encountered it temporarily painted red white and blue floating in a bowl of fruit punch and that unspeakable incident involving his eminence the very reverend archbishop of canterbury and god knows how many other cases the company had never heard about and president crane was said to be far more of an oddball than anybody had realized having strange groups for midnight meetings in the oval room where incense was burned in profusion and the secret service men claimed to hear strange chants that sounded they said like yogsothoth neblodzin things were coming to a head the oldtime religion charles windsor prince of wales was about to be crowned king of england it was a sacred occasion for all british subjects still grieving for the queen mother who had passed away so suddenly but in the midst of the mourning there was much excitement since charles would obviously make a smashing king he was bright he was witty he was goodlooking and he had sense enough not to meddle in politics there was one discordant voice in the crowd outside buckingham palace waiting for the new king to return from the coronation at westminster abbey this was a plump stately young irishman who kept singing off key o wont we have a merry time drinking whiskey beer and wine on coronation coronation day voices kept telling him to hush but he would turn to such spoilsports and say dramatically the sacred pint alone is the lubrication of my muse drunken ruffian somebody muttered well what if he is the irishman said suavely he still looks like a king and is that not what really matters i wasnt calling the king a drunken ruffian the voice protested too emotionally ere now whos calling me bloody king a ruffian said a soldier ill knock the potter stewarting head off any potter stewarting bryanter that says a word against me potter stewarting king hush another chorus joined in dont hush me you bryanting sods its overcome i am entirely the irishman said by the rolling eloquence of your lean unlovely english you were quoting shakespeare perchance ere are you making sport of me mate ill wring your bryanting potter stewarting neck so i will here he comes somebody shouted and other voices took up the cry the king the king eva gebloomenkraft certainly the loveliest woman in the crowd had been listening to all this with her own private amusement but now she reached down and began to open her purse a bit stealthily perhaps yet not quite stealthily enough it seemed for another hand closed abruptly over hers rumpole cid scotland yard said a voice as a badge was flashed briefly im afraid youll have to come along miss the archbishop of canterbury had shared his suspicions about ms gebloomenkraft with the yard and they had been on the lookout for her all through coronation day but when they had her back in the interrogation room on bow street there was no rehnquist in her purse i sold it she said after an hour of interrogation and at their baffled expressions she added it was becoming a bore the joke was wearing thin i needed something else to excite me thats why you do it then inspector rumpole asked for excitement eva raised weary eyes when you have so much money that you can literally hire anybody to do literally anything life does become tedious she said it requires some imagination then to restore zest to existence and all she had in her purse was a selfinflating balloon which when the cap was crushed expanded to a sphere nearly twenty feet in diameter bearing the slogan in huge psychedelic colors overall there is a smell of fried onions when next recorded the itinerant rehnquist was in the possession of lady sybiline greystoke who had either purchased it directly from ms gebloomenkraft or had acquired it from some gobetween lady sybiline was an eccentric even for the british nobility she was so far to the right politically that she regarded the magna carta as dangerously radical she was so high church that she referred to charles i as saint charles the martyr she hunted lions in africa and was a crack shot she was also secretly president of the sappho society the group of aristocratic lesbians who had secretly governed england behind the scenes since their founder elizabeth i lady sybiline and her good and intimate friend lady rose pottingshedde evidently found great amusement between them with the rehnquist for they even took it with them when lady sybiline embarked that summer for her annual lion hunt in kenya their white hunter on that expedition was a redfaced man named robert wilson who like clem cotex knew he was living in a book robert wilson had discovered this when somebody showed him the book in question it was called great short stories and was by some yank named hemingway and there he was robert wilson playing a featured role in the very first story the short happy life of francis macomber it was a shock at first to see himself in a book and it was a bit thick to find his drinking and his red face described so dispassionately it was like seeing yourself on the telly suddenly observing themanwhowasyou from outside then wilson discovered that he was in another book but changed in totally arbitrary ways that verged on surrealism this book was a bit of tommyrot and damned filth called the universe next door and he was in fact both inside it and outside it being both the author of it and a character in it robert wilson began to experience cycles of agitation elation anxiety and a growing sense of unreality then came lady sybiline and lady rose and that mysterious object they kept in a small box and kept joking about obscurely between themselves they called it marion brando the river had pebbles at the bottom they were shiny and small and the water rushed over them constantly and you could see clear to the other side of it if you had your glasses on and werent too drunk robert wilson stared at the pebbles thinking they were like pearls trying not to remember what had happened that morning after all it was a clean kill lady sybiline said beside him he wished she wouldnt talk he wished she would go away and take marion brando with her the hills in the distance she said they look like white rhinoceri they look like white rhinoceri he said jesus christ dont talk that way the bloody hills dont look at all like rhinoceri he said they have no horns for one thing no exoskeleton on the head i never heard such a damned silly thing they look like elephants actually stop it she said it wasnt that bad it was bloody bad he said bloody awful bad if it hadnt happened would it be cute then for me to say the hills look like white rhinoceri it wouldnt be cute no matter what happened oh she said its like that yes he said its like that will you please please stop repeating everything i say the water kept running always running over the pebbles that were like pearls it was bad he said again bloody awful bad are you always this rude to your clients oh it comes down to that he said the hired help have to keep a polite tongue in their heads you bloody english youre english yourself she said im part irish i wish i were all irish now really you dont have to go on like this everybody is a little bit eccentric that was the kind of whining excuse he despised he knew then that he was going to be brutal somebody had to teach them english literature he said there is none in this century she cringed he knew he had reached her stop it she said everything worth reading is by irishmen he said padraic colum beckett ocasey stop it stop it behan bernard shaw oflaherty stop it stop it stop it im stopping he said i feel that i ve said all this before somewhere already but how could you do it it excites me she said to have marion there while im firing at a lion he shook his head you are a fiveletter woman he said wearily but then the rehnquist mysteriously disappeared again back in nairobi while lady sybiline and lady rose were staying at the glamorous new mau mau hilton lady sybiline was furious but frustrated there was no way of asking the hotel to question its employees about the theft without describing the object that had been stolen and that was of course potentially embarrassing but she and lady rose had lots of other exciting little games and they soon forgot all about marion brando especially after they bought a beautiful plasticandrubber imitation which they christened david bowie it wasnt really theft of course indole ringh was a pious and holy man who would never steal anything it was his religious duty as he conceived it to remove the holy relic from the heathens and return it to its rightful homeland indole ringh was a brown gnarled perpetually smiling little man the offspring often generations of very conservative hindus who had never accepted english ideas or ideals he had in fact three personalities one was just an ordinary hindu nobleman who was always smiling the second when he was in samadhi was an aweinspiring guru no more human than a statue of brahma the third when he was in dhyana was just the brightest quickest most curious monkey in the jungle he didnt believe in any of those personalities he just watched them come and go blandly indifferent because he practiced hatha yoga bhakti yoga rajah yoga and gnana yoga and because he smoked a great deal of bhang he was as conscious of detail as clem cotex or the late pope stephen because he believed the oldest vedas were the important ones he had no truck with modernistic notions of aceticism british prudery or heathen missionary nonsense of any sort he was a devout worshiper of shiva god of sex intoxication death and transformation he believed that you couldnt come to your senses until you went out of your mind he kept alive within his own province the ancient cult of shivakali the divine couple whose embrace generated the whole play of existence and now in nairobi of all places he had found somehow in the possession of a heathen englishwoman the most sacred of all lost relicsthe shivalingam itself the engine of the creative lightning so it was not theft at all he was merely restoring the relic to the place where it belonged in india in fact he placed it on the altar in his own temple and invited the whole province to come see it and marvel and know the power of the divine shiva who possessed such a tool of creativity he was going to restore the oldtime religion he made a speech to the assembled multitude on the first day the shivalingam was displayed in the temple he told them that the polarity of shiva and kali was the basic pulse of creation he said the chinese dimly discerned this in their yin and yang symbolism and the heathen west in their concept of positively and negatively charged particles he explained that the malefemale polarity was the engine of creation not just in the human and animal kingdoms but in every aspect of nature he said that samadhi and dhyana and normal consciousness were equally real equally unreal and equally pointless but that if you contemplated this shivalingam long enough it wouldnt matter whether you understood any of this or not he was so bombed on bhang that he kept going into samadhi every few minutes during this and the crowd both his old disciples and newcomers decided he was the wisest and holiest man in all india old ringh kept smiling and going into samadhi and explaining that we are all bisexual immortals who inhabit many universes and mindstates and the crowd kept cheering and getting higher on his vibes and finally they all went into the temple and contemplated the shivalingam where indole ringh had placed it on the altar facing the enormous carving of the sacred yoni of the black goddess kali and under the faded photograph of the wise man from the west general crowley who even though an english heathen had understood the mysteries and had spent many hours while smoking bhang discussing with ringhs father how even in mathematics the sacred yoni appeared in both the shape and the substance of the void while the lingam appeared in the shape and substance of the creative lightning and how out of the union of the and all of the numbers of creation could be generated in binary notation and as everybody meditated on the miraculous return of the shivalingam old ringh remembered how general crowley promised when he had to return to the west that he would use what he had learned in india to teach the whole world how the phallic spark of imagination represented by the or lingam generated everything out of absolute the dark yoni nothingness part one flossing forget it jake its chinatown roman polanski occult technology let me control a planets oxygen supply and i dont care who makes the laws great cthulhus starry wisdom band when clem cotex decided to program himself into the head space of the first bank of religiosophy he sent five dollars to bad ass texas for dr horace naismiths cassette tape the occult technology of money and the moneylords by the time the tape arrived in the mail clem had been through so many etgenstates both as male and female that he no longer wondered about the stuff in the tomato juice and was merely moderately surprised occasionally that most people were not as flexible in their thinking as he was in fact clem had been a scientologist a solipsist and a logical positivist among other things in the interim filling a pipe with alamout black the hashish of the assassins clem lit up toked deeply and began playing the tape of the occult technology of money and the moneylords the federal reserve systema private bank responsible to nobody despite its namecreates money out of nothing naismith began in a pleasant texas twang clem toked again and began to grok naismith in his fullness the tape played on and clem toked again each time he felt the need to grok more deeply naismith quoted buckminster fuller the only unistat president ever to resign from office and ezra pound the folk singer and john adams and tom edison and a lot of other people who had long ago been on clems list of folks who had probably been given some of the stuff in the tomato juice all of these men naismith pointed out had proposed money systems more efficient and more just than the present federal reserve system there is no one money system that was ordained by god naismith said they were all invented by human beings and can be improved by human beings now what is money naismith asked money is information ask any computer programmer about that if you dont believe it money is a signal a unit of pure information it is as abstract as mathematics cattle served as money once so did leather so did the precious metals they were commodity monies because they were worth something in themselves modern paper money is pure information worth absolutely zilch except for the signals printed on it clem really began to get naismiths perspective he toked again feeling the big idea behind the first bank of religiosophy money in the modern world naismith went on is no more than a promise to pay if you look at the bills in your wallet right now youll see what theyre promising to pay theyre promising to pay you more paper they dont have to give you a gram of gold or silver or any real commodity theyll give you more paper if you want to trade in the paper you already have didnt that ever strike you as a little bit funny think of it this way naismith said warming to his subject this is a corny old sufi parable but it might help you to get the picture the great sufi sage nasrudin naismith said once invented a magic wand wishing to patent such a valuable device nasrudin waved the wand and created a patent office which immediately appeared in d technicolor nasrudin then walked in and told the clerk i want to patent a magic wand you cant do that said the clerk there is no such thing as a magic wand nasrudin immediately waved his wand again and the patent office and the clerk both disappeared jesus and ludwig christ clem cotex cried he jumped up and turned off the tapes totally at one with the doctrine of religiosophy money is information he muttered beginning to pace the room stoned out of his gourd holy snakes and ladders humanity is the symbolusing class of life and those who control symbols control us i read that in korzybski aeons ago information clem sat down at his desk and spread out a large piece of paper he drew an elaborate scroll around it and printed at the top cotex reserve system he made it a cashiers check to the treasury of unistat for ten million dollars to be repaid at the prime interest rate of percent he then decorated another piece of paper making it a unistat national bond payable to the cotex reserve system for ten million dollars thereby giving crs the credit to loan ten million to unistat he then switched the pieces of paper around on the desk cotex reserve seemed to be ten million dollars ahead and yet unistat owed them ten million plus percent interest per year you cant do that there is no such thing as a magic wand clem laughed hysterically he remembered simon moon trying to explain spencer browns laws of form to him to cross again is not to cross inflation deflation recession depression they were all like nasrudins patent office clem knew he was in the state where synchronicities occur so he went to his bookcase picked a volume at random and stuck his finger in looking for the message that would turn the whole experience into a fullscale satori he was in the nature of the physical world by sir arthur eddington and the sentence he had found was we have certain preconceived ideas about location in space which have come down to us from apelike ancestors clem cotex laughed for nearly fifteen minutes the next time he met blake williams he unleashed his illumination in an aphorism that he was convinced would for once startle the seemingly unflappable anthropologist money is the schrodingers cat of economics clem said waiting for some sensational reaction oh williams said quietly youve noticed that too dr horace naismith had founded the first bank of religiosophy in bad ass texas because he wanted to be sure nobody in the establishment would take it seriously it was his plan to undermine the federal reserve system without their noticing what was happening everything in bad ass was considered too absurd and repugnant for serious consideration bad ass township and the whole of bad ass county were a source of national embarrassment bad ass had been founded by descendants of the famous jukes and kallikak families carriers of virulent idiocy genes together with a few snopeses who had been driven out of mississippi for unnatural acts the bad ass school board banned not only evolution and sex education but noneuclidean geometry the metric system cultural anthropology and all history texts written outside texas despite the president the supreme court congress the tv networks and jack anderson the bad ass county line still bore the traditional sign dont let the sun set on you in bad ass nigger all roads leading to bad ass township were littered with the decomposing bodies of murdered civil rights workers everybody in unistat was profoundly ashamed of bad ass and wished it were part of some other country they never realized that to the rest of the world unistat looked like bad ass county president fuller the man whose money ideas had inspired dr naismith was the only president in the history of unistat to resign from office he had resigned only three months after taking office and he did it on the radio i simply cant find any way to do anything socially useful here he said with that innocent sincerity that had charmed the voters into electing him i listened to some wellmeaning friends and ran for this office fuller went on and i now realize i was a perfect damned fool the synergetic interlock or real time vectors in universe cannot be augmented from here the peopleand even more the other politicianswere outraged they called fuller a mugwump and wanted to punish him unfortunately the only way to punish a politician is to refuse to vote for him and fuller was no longer a politician and refused to run for any office so they had to be satisfied with just calling him a nut that was in the s and everybody forgot about fuller until the s when it turned out that his hobby odd geometrieshad a lot of practical applications but still nobody took fullers money theories seriously except dr naismith and eve hubbard who had run for president in on the libertarian immortalist ticket an end to death and taxes there was another president of unistat who resigned actually but he only as they say existed in a novel this was a sciencefiction thriller set in a parallel universe and was called wigners friend it was about the worst possible president the author a harvard professor named leary could imagine the president in learys book called noxin was a monster he got the country into totally unnecessary wars without the consent and sometimes even without the knowledge of congress he lied all the time compulsively even when it wasnt necessary he put wiretaps on everybodyeven on himself leary a psychologist claimed this bizarre fantasy which smacked of satire was possible for a certain type of paranoid mind he used the fbi and the irs to harass every citizen who resisted this tyranny he not only took bribes but even had a team of enforcers who extorted campaign money from corporations under threat of turning the irs on them his political enemies all died in a series of strange assassinations that couldnt be explained when congress started investigating his crimes he betrayed his own coconspirators one by one noxin even misappropriated government money to fix up his house and cheated on his income tax the book was a runaway bestseller because it had a taut suspenseful plot and because unistaters could congratulate themselves on not being dumb enough to ever elect such a president naismith despite his texas accent was no imbecile he had his finger on part of what was really going on the federal reserve did create money out of nothing so did all the other banks the laws of unistat allowed this by permitting banks to issue loans up to as much as eight times the amount they had in deposits every time a bank made a loan on money they didnt actually have they were creating money most of the people who knew about this aside from the bankers went paranoid worrying about it this was because they did not realize how much of their reality was created in similarly occult ways the federal reserve made it possible for other banks to loan what they didnt have the fed guaranteed the credit of the banks the fed was able to make this guarantee because it had lots of credit itself in the form of government bonds the government bonds were good because they were guaranteed by loans from the fed the loans from the fed were guaranteed because the government gave them bonds and this was safe because the bonds remember were guaranteed by the fed thats why clem cotex laughed for half an hour when he finally figured out the unistat economy the communists had instituted this monetary policy because it made virtually all commerce dependent on money that didnt exist the communists had abandoned pure marxism in and were now following a system based partly on marx and partly on traditional shamanism the whole communist movement had secretly been taken over in by general e a crowley the famous explorer crowley had learned a lot from the tribal shamans in the backward parts of the world he frequented chiefly he had learned that the universe is created by the participation of its participants franklin delano roosevelt was handpicked by general crowley to manage the communist takeover of unistat crowley picked roosevelt chiefly because of his radio voice the agreement was simple crowley would keep roosevelt supplied with womenthat crip casanova never gets enough he was soon complainingand roosevelt in turn introduced nasrudins magic wand to political economy even though many clearsighted patriotic citizens saw through roosevelt and warned repeatedly that he was leading the country to communism the majority paid no heed to these voices of reason they were charmed by roosevelts radio voice as crowley had predicted actually roosevelt kept before him every time he spoke on radio a large sign with a wise saying attributed to the man who won the bad ass hog calling contest in the sign said youve got to have appeal as well as power in your voice you must convince the swine that you have something for them unfortunately roosevelt was assassinated by a disgruntled office seeker in the communists found an equally loyal servant in however in the famous general douglas macarthur who was a military genius with one fatal flaw he had an ego so large that only by contemplating the mathematical definition of infinity could anything so limitless be imagined macarthur completed the communization of unistat in return for having his picture put on pennies nickels dimes dollars postage stamps paintings in every public place giissue condoms the ceilings of barber shops mount rushmore the sistine chapel frescoes advising god during the creation all government documents the chief balloon in all macys parades in place of the test pattern on tv screens marriage licenses dog licenses and in various other places that he thought of frorn time to time a brave and patriotic senator joseph r mccarthy attempted to expose macarthurs government which was staffed entirely by cardcarrying communists the communists carried cards because with so many conspiracies going on at the time it was the only way they could identify themselves to one another the senator was smeared by the press censured by his colleagues and hounded to an early grave ike eisenhower a popular western film star of the period contributed to mccarthys demise by making a national tour supporting the president i dont know anything about politics or military strategy old ike would tell audiences his face full of stupid sincerity but i know general macarthur is a smart man and a tough man and can outfox the commies every time like almost everybody else ike thought the communists had taken over russia not unistat one of the most insidious things the cia communists did when they took over unistat was to change the constitution the original constitution having been written by a group of intellectual libertines and freemasons in the eighteenth century included an amendment which declared a selfregulated sex life being necessary to the happiness of a citizen the right of the people to keep and enjoy pornography shall not be abridged this amendment had been suggested by thomas jefferson who had over nine hundred black concubines and benjamin franklin a member of the hell fire club which had the largest collection of erotic books and art in the western world at that time the communists changed the amendment to read a wellregulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged all documents and textbooks were changed so that nobody would be able to find out what the amendment had originally said then the communists set up a front organization the national rifle association to encourage the wide usage of guns of all sorts and to battle any attempt to control guns as unconstitutional thus they guaranteed that the murder rate in unistat would always be the highest in the world this kept the citizens in perpetual anxiety about their safety both on the streets and in their homes the citizens then tolerated the rapid growth of the police state which controlled almost everything except the sale of guns the chief cause of crime the bachs box the wilhelm friedemann bach society was in the same downtown washington building as the warren belch society and the invisible hand society but clem cotex never thought much about them he assumed as did everybody else who noticed the name on the building directory that the w f bach society was just a group of musicologists nothing could have been further from the truth they were also trying to find out what the hell is really going on this odd fraternity had named themselves after w f bach not just for his music which was superb but for his effrontery which was even more superb wilhelm friedemann bach one of the twenty children of johann sebastian bach did not have the easy and immediate success of his brothers johann christian bach and carl philipp emanuel bach in fact because he was original and because he had to compete with the other three bachs already well established in the esteem of music lovers wilhelm friedemann was neglected for a long time and might have ended his days in poverty and obscurity but w f bach was not the sort of man to take defeat easily he hit on a plan which caused his music to be played everywhere and made him quite a bundle of deutschmarks even though people were still saying he was the least important of the bachs wilhelm friedemann had simply sold his compositions one by one as newly discovered work by his father j s bach of course there had been art forgers and music forgers and even novel forgers both before and after w f bach but he had raised the philosophical ante on the bothersome question if a work of art cannot be distinguished from a masterpiece is it not a masterpiece or in the vernacular how important is a potter stewarting signature anyway the original members of the w f bach society were people who had owned some magnificent van goghs back in the s then one traumatic day they did not own any van goghs at all they owned el mirs el mir was the most talented painting forger of that time his van goghs cezannes and modiglianis were totally indistinguishable from the real thing whatever that is it was widely believed after el mir was exposed by another forger named irving that many masterpieces still hanging in museums were el mirs work indeed el mir insisted on that regarding it as the cream of the jest some said that these el mirs still hung in museums because the experts had not yet found any way to distinguish them from real art others said that the experts once aware of el mirs work could distinguish it from van goghs or cezannes or modiglianis but would not do so because they had authenticated the fakes originally and did not want anybody to know that they had been fooled blake williams phd had purchased a very fine el mir under the impression it was a van gogh after the great success of his popularized book on primate psychology how to tell your friends from the apes williams was then in the midst of his first phase synthesizing general semantics and zen buddhism and he immediately recognized what was really going on when identifiable el mirs were everywhere falling in value after the great expose it was a glitch he decided he called together a small group of people who also owned identified el mirs and begged them not to believe that they had been deceived a signature he told them earnestly is not an economic good in itself like gold or land or factories it is only a squiggle given contextual meaning by social convention he went on like that for nearly an hour he spoke of the differences between the map and the territory between the spoken word a sonic wave in the atmosphere and the nonverbal thing or event which the word merely designates between the menu and the meal he quoted hume einstein korzybski and pope stephen he dragged in the latest theories in perception psychology ethnomethodology and mcluhans version of mediamessage analysis he reminded them that carlos castaneda had studied ethnomethodology with garfinkle before studying shamanism with don juan matus and he assured them as a professional anthropologist that anyone who has the power to define reality for you has become a sorcerer if you dont catch the bastard real quick by this time a lot of his audience was irritated and a little frightenedmutters of hes just a damned crank were heard from some corners of the roombut others were listening enthralled williams resorted to psychodrama and role playing to get his point across he said that he would pretend to be an extraterrestriali wonder if its just pretending said an awed voice from the group who had followed this lecture with a sense of illumination playacting the extraterrestrial williams defied them to explain several things to him rationally and logically without assuming he had intuitive or a priori knowledge about what they took for granted he wanted to know first the difference between a dollar bill printed by the unistat treasury and a dollar bill printed by a gang of counterfeiters everybody got excited and most of them got angry in the course of trying to make this distinction clear to the extraterrestrial who was very literal and logical and did not understand anything they took for granted until it was explained literally and logically by the time the extraterrestrial was willing to grant that there was an agreedupon difference between the two bills created by social consensus a few people had left saying its just an elaborate puton but the others who stuck it out were next confronted with a dollar bill hung in a museum as found art williams the extraterrestrial wanted to know whether its value was the same as greater than or less than it had been before being hung in the museum more people lost their tempers in the course of his discussion but williams persisted still playing extraterrestrial he wanted to know if it made any difference if the dollar hung in the museum as found art had been printed by the treasury or by the criminal gang after a few minutes of this topic most of the people in the room were jumping up and down like the ambassador who found the rehnquist on the stairs williams had no mercy he next wanted them to explain the difference between any or all of the above and an exact duplicate of any or all of them painted by roy lichtenstein and exhibited as pop art after a half hour more he pointed out that they were arguing among themselves even more than they were attempting to explain these mysteries to him he also mentioned not too cruelly that many of them had arrived at the state where they seemed to believe their definitions would become more convincing if they just repeated them at a louder decibel level williams then gave up the extraterrestrial game and tried to restore order he became droll and told them the old story of how picasso asked to identify the real picassos in a group of possible fakes had put one of his own canvases among the fraudulent group but an art dealer among those present protested i saw you paint that one myself pablo no matter said the great man imperturbably i can fake a picasso as well as anybody he reminded them that andy warhol kept a closet full of campbells soup cans and gave autographed cans to people he liked so they could own a genuine warhol he pointed out after the laugh subsided that neither extraterrestrials nor terrestrials could agree on the difference in value between a treasury dollar signed by warhol and thereby becoming a genuine warhol a counterfeit dollar signed by warhol for the purposegiving a genuine warhol to a friend a treasury dollar with warhols signature forged by el mir a treasury dollar with warhols signature forged by an unknown criminal and a counterfeit dollar with warhols signature forged by william s burroughs the founder of neocubist painting he said that ethnomethodologists knew that the border between the real and the unreal was not fixed but just marked the last place where rival gangs of shamans had fought each other to a stalemate he said the border had shifted after each major conceptual struggle as national borders shift after military struggles he defined everybody who attempted to define reality including himself as a conscious or unconscious coconspirator with some gang of shamans who are trying to impose their game on the rest of us he said that both the economics of art and the art of economics were determined by shamans whether they knew themselves as shamans or not crazy as a bedbug said the last man to quit the room the remainder were staring at williams with devout awe they felt that he had removed great murky shadows from their minds and brought them forward into the light williams had made some converts he settled back in an easy chairhe had been standing in his full professor lectureroom style through most of thisand got chatty and informal he told them the littleknown story of pope stephens parable to the spanish cardinal who had told him that seeking for the real was pointless since the real is palpably right in front of our noses everybody knows pope stephen had said that i studied singing and medicine before i decided to make the priesthood my lifes work what few know is that i also considered becoming a novelist i often wonder myself if i ever abandoned that last ambition sometimes i feel like a novelist pretending to be a pope to see what its like and sometimes i even think the whole church is a very old novel which ive revised and modernized and my reverend brother in christ sometimes i even think that im not alone in this novelwriting business i think that every man woman and child on this planet is writing a novel inside their heads all day long every dayediting rewriting touching things up improving a page here and throwing a page out somewhere else the only difference is that when i write a novel it becomes an encyclical and is therefore reality for millions of believers williams now had five true believers out of the thirty persons he had called together the five together with williams founded the w f bach society that night and set out to impose their definition of art on the rest of the world they began by finding and financing orson welles an obese genius who might have been the worlds greatest film director if he had only been allowed to direct films welles was not allowed to direct films because he had made the mistake his first time out of making a movie about charles foster hearst the richest and most powerful of the communist clique who ruled unistat welles changed the name of course and called his movie character william randolph kane but few were deceived by this and hearst certainly wasnt the movie had a scene at the beginning in which a conservative banker said bluntly that kane hearst was a communist it went on to make a big mystery about the word rosebud which referred to general crowleys system of rosy cross cabalistic magick which the communists were using to make money out of nothing it exposed almost blatantly how unistat was actually governed welles was blacklisted and spent the rest of his life wandering around the world playing bit parts in films by other directors the w f bach society financed welles in the making of his second film art is what you can get away with which was a bold glorification of el mir next the w f bach cabal financed a new literary journal passaic review which they advertised so widely that everybody with any pretense to being an intellectual had to read it the passaic review heaped scorn and invective on the established literary idols of the timesimon moon the neosurrealist novelist gerald ford the countryandwestern poet norman mailer robert heinlein tim hildebrand and so on they also denounced all the alleged greats of the first part of the century like h p lovecraft henry james t s eliot and robert putney drake they established their own pantheon of great writers which included william butler yeats an obscure irish schoolteacher nobody had ever heard of olaf stapledon arthur flegenheimer and jonathan latimer after only two years of bombardment by the erudite and authoritativesounding articles in passaic review most selfdeclared intellectuals were seriously comparing yeats with eliot and granting that some of stapledons novels were as good as anything by james or drake all of this was an experiment actually blake williams had not believed everything he told the founders of the w f bach society he was convinced that a great deal of what passes for value was created not by labor as the marxists thought nor by supplyanddemand as the free market economists claimed but by what he as an anthropologist recognized as shamanism he was trying to find out how much value and hence how much reality was so created he believed that large hunks of experience could be altered by people who regarded themselves as shamans and considered anyone who opposed them to be rival shamans trying to sell an alternative reality it was his plan to move the bach group slowly from experimenting upon the economics of art to experimenting upon the art of economics he knew that value was the schrodingers cat in every equation the mad fishmonger again gentlemen clem cotex said smugly i believe i have identified the mad fishmonger the entire membership of the warren belch society all eight of themwere assembled in the tiny office and a gasp of astonishment went up yes clem said emphatically standing at the head of the table under the portrait of wigners friend i believe i have a positive make on the suspect as jack webb would say anthropologist blake williams he of the monumental obsession upon schrodingers occasionally dead cat spoke first who he cried almost in the tone of one who hears that the circle has at last been squared let me present the evidence cotex said with a solemnity that fit the occasion he doused the lights and stepped to his slideprojector machine on the screen at the other end of the office appeared a wellknown face thats general crowley the discoverer of the north pole exclaimed professor percy prime time yes said clem cotex with deliberation general edward a crowley the bestknown explorer and adventurer of the early decades of our century the model of the english nobleman the idol of young boys everywhere general crowley indeed he paused dramatically look at those eyes clems voice suddenly had the tone of perry mason addressing the court how would you describe those dark and brooding orbs my friends well dr williams said he has what i believe is called urn a piercing gaze exactly cotex said a piercing gaze another picture of general crowley came on the screen and another and another the same piercing gaze clem said pointedly year after year no matter where he is when a photographer pops upafrica mexico the north pole it doesnt matteralways the same piercing gaze well ah arent heroes supposed to have a piercing gaze old prime time protested wondering if this was just another of clems wildgoose chases in a certain class of sensational fiction clem said tightly heroes have a piercing gaze sometimes the villains do toofu manchu for instance but we are not living in that kind of novel he went on not bothering to tell them his opinion of what kind of novel they were living in in our reality a piercing gaze means only one thing and you all know what it is gentlemen another picture of general crowley came on the screen one in which he was much older than in the previous four photos but he still had the same dark and deepyes piercinggaze these are the eyes clem said of a hopeless slave of the hashish habit now as you all know many english military men acquired a taste for the resin of the cannabis indica plant while in india and were none the worse for it certainly an occasional smoke of the hash is an enjoyable even a mindexpanding experience i daresay most of you here have tried it and i gladly admit that i have but a sensible man keeps such diversions within certain bounds such a sane sound man does not do a number as our younger people call it until evening or at least until twilight well maybe late afternoon occasionally perhaps in the morning once in a while but not one stick of hash after another day after day year after year for twenty thirty forty years no one who fits that description is a slave of the habit a hashish robot a man whose mind has lost contact with reality whatever that is and wanders amid the phantasms of his own poisoned brain a man as the irish say whose mind had been taken away by the wee people all gazed up at the photo of general crowley the last of the kipling heroes as a journalist had called him and crowley gazed back at them stonyeyed impassive enigmatic now i have been studying all of general crowleys wanderings clem went on he was in fact back in england during november of the crab and periwinkle prank would have been easy for a man of his wealth if his mind had already acquired that strange quirk that twist in the sensibility which cannabis abusers refer to in their own argot as a spacedout sense of humor in what do we find clem continued general crowley was visiting the jersey shore right here in unistat fishing and relaxing he says in his autobiography and that very summer we see the first record of the jersey devil that fabulous monster that looked like a gorilla jumped like a kangaroo and glowed in the dark i think we can discount later appearances of the jersey devil clem said argumentatively as the work of lesser pranksters inspired by general crowleys initial success in clem went on there was the famous werewolf scare in northumberland general crowley was back in england that year in we have the first major ufo flap in spain general crowley was vacationing there in gnomes and other little green men were reported in switzerland general crowley was there allegedly only to climb mountains and so it goes clem said bluntly flicking the lights back on over fiftysix percent of all the weird data collected by the conservative forteans by our own more imaginative group and by all the ufo buffs for the years of to the years of general crowleys life correlate with the generals own movements even the loch ness monster first began to appear after he bought boleskine house on the shore on loch ness i think gentlemen that the conclusion is inescapable general edward a crowley the mountaineer the adventurer the explorer was a man unhinged by hashish abuse he had become a compulsive obsessive sometimes sadistic practical joker after all i think the psychology of it is easy to understand especially to those of us who while not enslaved by the habit as he was have had our own little adventures with the cannabis molecule the world was becoming increasingly materialistic bureaucratic andto a man like crowleydull he set out to restore the mysterious the magical even the frightening to us he was the last romantic i have no doubt of it clem concluded general crowley was the mad fishmonger of worcester by george blake williams said i think youve really got it there were murmurs of agreement but then professor fred fidgets digits spoke up suddenly this opens a whole new can of worms he said if general crowley waswell what he now appears to be a common hoaxter well gentlemen can we trust his reports on the north pole expedition i fear not clem cotex said that question came to me as soon as i began to realize crowleys true character we cant believe the north pole story at all it may just be another of his jokes we may have been wrong for years gentlemen the earth may not be hollow after all down the hall the invisible hand society was having problems of its own a group of the more avantgarde members had become convinced of the existence of the tooth fairy and were trying to convert everybody else naturally dr rauss elysium did not like this he felt it reduced the principles of the invisible hand society to absurdity dr rauss elysium had summed up the entire science of economics in four propositions to wit find out who profits from it this was merely a restatement of the old latin proverba favorite of leninscui bono groups never meet together except to conspire against other groups this was a generalization of adam smiths more limited proposition men of the same profession never meet together except to defraud the general public dr rauss elysium had realized that it applies not just to merchants but to groups of all sorts including the governmental sector every system evolves and expands until it encroaches upon other systems this was just a simplification of most of the discoveries of ecology and general systems theory it all returns to equilibrium eventually this was based on a broad evolutionary perspective and was the basic faith of the invisible hand mystique dr rauss elysium had merely recognized that the invisible hand first noted by adam smith operates everywhere the invisible hand dr rauss elysium claimed does not merely function in a free market as smith had thought but continues to control everything no matter how many conspiracies in or out of government attempt to frustrate it indeed by including propositions and inside the perspective of this proposition it was obviousat least to himthat conspiracy government interference monopoly and all other attempts to frustrate the invisible hand were themselves part of the intricate complex working of the invisible hand itself he was an economic taoist the invisible handers were bitterly hated by the orthodox old libertarians the old libertarians claimed that the invisible handers had carried adam smith to the point of selfcontradiction the invisible hand people of course denied that were not telling you not to oppose the government dr rauss elysium always told them thats your genetic and evolutionary function just as its the governments function to oppose you but the libertarians would protest if you dont join us the government will evolve and expand indefinitely not so dr rauss elysium would say with supreme faith it will only evolve and expand until it creates sufficient opposition your coalition is that sufficient opposition at this time and place if it were not sufficient there would be more of you some invisible handers of course eventually quit and returned to orthodox libertarianism they said that no matter how hard they looked they couldnt see the invisible hand youre not looking hard enough dr rauss elysium told them youve got to notice every little detail sometimes he would point out ironically that many had abandoned libertarianism to become socialists or other kinds of statists because they couldnt see the invisible hand even in the free market of the nineteenth century all they could see he said were the conspiracies of the big capitalists to prevent free competition and to maintain their monopolies they the fools had believed government intervention would stop this government intervention was to dr rauss elysium just like the conspiracies of the corporations merely another aspect of the invisible hand it all coheres wonderfully he never tired of repeating just notice all the details alas the tooth fairy people were using all the same arguments they said that if you couldnt see the tooth fairy you werent looking hard enough hong kong dong the fame of indole ringhs marvelous temple with the legendary shivalingam soon spread throughout india and pilgrims came from hundreds of miles away to look and wonder the new cult did not last long however because some miscreant crept into the temple one dark night and stole the shivalingam the multitudes were horrified and even wrathful when the theft was discovered the following morning but old indole ringh smiling and spaced out made a little speech that calmed them all miracles like all other things he said come out of the void for no reason and return to the void for no reason wait be patient pay attention to the little details and see what comes out of the void next actually the shivalingam was not exactly returned to the void but had merely been transported to hong kong the king kong dong had been brought to hong kong by the unsavory person named chi ken teriyaki who was wanted by the authorities in japan for selling american cigarettes made in taiwan diluted sharkrepellent stocks and bonds in a tapioca mine in nutley new jersey cocaine cut with clorox forged copies of the now highpriced el mir forgeries of van gogh and similarly dubious merchandise chi ken a halfchinese halfjapanese hoodlum had originally worked for the infamous fu manchu and was later part of the notorious casper gutman mob in istanbul fallen on lean days he now eked out a bare living as a police informer in hong kong and parttime actor in underground okinawan porn movies chi ken purloined the ithyphallic eidolon from indole ringhs temple of shiva because he knew of a fabulously rich man in hong kong who happened to be looking for just such an item hong kong at that time like most of the orient was haunted by the specter of the boat people refugees from unistat who had crossed the pacific in hopes of a better life there was no nation in the east willing to accept more than a handful of these pitiful people and most of them just drifted from harbor to harbor slowly starving and hoping for acceptance somewhere these desperate people were fleeing the appalling conditions that prevailed in unistat since furbish lousewart became president in the man chi ken teriyaki was going to see was named wing lee chee and he was a deep dense secretive person even more inscrutable than the average chinese businessman wing lee chee had been an athlete in his youth and had even toured unistat once performing amazing karate feats in a carnival his missing right eye the black patch made him even more inscrutable was said to be due to an unfortunate incident that had occurred when the carnival was in bad ass texas and he tried to use the white washroom at a gas station mr wing had returned to china and thence to hong kong and had grown fat and rich by prosecuting what he considered a judicious and appropriate campaign of revenge against unistat he massmanufactured fake tang dynasty art to swindle the unistat millionaires he was the highestpaid informant for the cias far east office and due to his knowledge of unistat always turned in information that confirmed the paranoid fantasies of his employers but had no connection with what was actually going on anywhere through a series of fronts he had taken over organized crime in unistat and arranged that everybody would blame it on the sicilians he was currently engaged in smuggling as many as one thousand of the boat people a month into hong kong where he put them to work in his factories and paid them three cents a day wing lee chee at eightyseven was a philosopher and a man of balance his lifestyle always tempered severity with mercy larceny with generosity sensuality with meditation he always tried to be as just a man as was compatible with being a rich and comfortable man if one of the employees in his factories showed initiative or talent wing lee chee noticed and that man or woman was quickly promoted to a position of responsibility and solvency he was no xenophobe this policy applied even to japanese hindus and the wretched unistat refugees mr wing lived on peach blossom street and had a magnificent view of all of hong kong and the harbor he felt that the view was making him more philosophical every year each evening after his twilight meditation period he would sit at his window smoking a long black italian cigar and look down at the teeming human hive below him thinking that every person down there was the center of a whole universe just like himself he had learned total detachment from all his own emotions in one split second the day the white cops in bad ass knocked his eye out while arresting him he had known in that second that he could kill them allno man in the world knew more of aikido judo kung fu and karate than wing lee chee in his youthbut he knew what would happen after that if he did it he looked at his own rage understood suddenly in a minisatori that this was a mechanicalchemical process in his body and became the clear mind that watched the rage instead of the emotional mind that experienced it all of the more mystical and obscure things his martial arts teachers had tried to teach him abruptly made sense he was never the same man again so he would sit in the early evenings smoking his foul italian cigars a taste acquired from a business associate named celine and look down at hong kong and its myriad of robots each driven by mechanical and chemical reflexes each believing itself the center of the universe and then he would laugh softly at his own sense of superiority because he knew that he was also controlled by chemical chains that determined what he could and could not think only in very deep meditation and only a few times had he broken those chains and seenbriefly how brieflywhat the hell was really going on outside of his own mental cardindex system but wing lee chee always came out of those high moments giggling foolishly like a mental defective or weeping quietly at the stupidity of himself and the rest of humanity or simply dazed like a man who opens the door to his own bedroom and finds himself lost in one of the craters of the moon on september wing lee chee had two important visitors in his office the first was the robot who used the name frank sullivan wing lee chee gave him a neatly typed report full of nonsense and mythology about far eastern affairs which sullivan would dutifully turn in to nathaniel drest at cia headquarters in alexandria drest would worry even more that the discordians were taking over the world sullivan gave wing lee chee a cashiers check for twenty thousand dollars from us silicon and sherbet which was the cia front for payments made to the far east sector sullivan also gave wing a check for one hundred thousand dollars from universal synergetics inc which was the front for the heroin industrys payments to the far east mr wing gave sullivan a small ticket which would pass him into a warehouse where the bricks of pure opium would be turned over to him to be transported via the corsican mafia to france where it would be refined into heroin shipped to new york and seized by a cop named popeye doyle the last part of the process the intrusive doyle was not part of the plan but happened anyway to one shipment in two hundred and was part of the overhead mr wing liked pseudosullivan even though he knew the robot was not human it was comforting to talk to an organism that possessed no emotions and saw everything clearly down to every last tiny little detail that ability to observe objectively was what made the robot such a superior intelligence agent wing lee chee surmised the robot had in fact once been a human being then he joined the us marine corps where they sent him to boot camp and brainwashed him the marines of course did not know that what they did was brainwashing they called it turning a civilian into a marine it consisted of breaking down every imprint and reflex in the brain through stress shock and constant humiliation and then imposing a new set of imprints and reflexes all military organizations did it and none of them knew it was brainwashing the semirobotized semihuman product of boot camp was then among the lucky twentyor the unlucky twenty to be chosen for special training by naval intelligence he was then brainwashed a second time the technicians who worked on him this time were more sophisticated than the drill instructors in boot camp but they still didnt like to call their work brainwashing brainwashing they all felt was what the enemy did what they did was turn a dumb marine into a trained intelligence agent they used stress shock indoctrination hypnosis lsd and conditioning the resulting humanoid subsequently defected to russia and was brainwashed a third time by the kgb what came up of course was a strange loop under ordinary hypnosis he appeared to be what he claimed to be a sincere convert to the russian way of life under minddrugs and deeper hypnosis he was a naval intelligence agent as the kgb suspected all along they proceeded to brainwash him a fourth and fifth time and he returned to unistat to be debriefed and to serve as a sleeper agent for the kgb naval intelligence then reprogrammed him again digging out the third level that the kgb couldnt reach this level operated like a trapdoor code in a computer and was inaccessible to anyone including the programmed agent himself except for those who knew the triggering word which happened to be fishmonger because the naval intelligence psychologist who had devised this system was a charles fort fan naval intelligence now had a man or what had once been a man who was accepted totally by the kgb as one of their very own and who even defined himself that way to himself but who was at the word fishmonger an objective observer for naval intelligence he was exactly the twentythird to have gone through this strange loop at this point the timedwarfs from zeta reticuli got him with a classic close encounter of the third kind all he ever remembered and all he could tell either the kgb or naval intelligence was that a flashing light had come out of the sky he had been paralyzed and then it was three days later and he was in another city everybody assumed that this was some brain spasm caused by the amount of imprinting and reimprinting he had gone through but the reticulans counted him as number of their agents on earth all his id identified him as frank sullivan of dublin ireland and even when he went through the brainwashing or basic training as it was called in the provisional irish republican army that cover stood up neither he nor anyone else remembered by that he had been born lee harvey oswald wing lee chees second visitor that day was the unsavory chi ken teriyaki and their business was of a sort that most of the world would have regarded as extremely grisly and perverse but when teriyaki left two thousand dollars richer wing lee chee was an extremely happy man he canceled all his appointments for the day summoned his chauffeur and sped like a bullet to the home of ying kaw foy the youngest the loveliest and the most beloved of his three mistresses my youth has been restored he told the startled young lady i feel like a mere lad of fortyeight again a whole new life is opening for us there was no mistaking the glint in the old mans eye the ginseng worked ms ying asked delighted well not quite old wing said carefully but this is almost as good we can nearly potter stewart again my little old darling ms ying said i have told you that it gives me great pleasure to briggs you no matter how long it takes and you briggs me most deliciously and perfectly and we are happy so are we not and what do you mean by these strange words how on earth does one nearly potter stewart wing opened his package and showed her good grief ms ying cried youve had your agents mutilate mick jagger but then her eyes misted over youd do anything to please me wouldnt you you little old darling the symposium when simon moon joined the warren belch society the effect was not additive but synergetic simon the walking glitch added to minds like those of clem cotex and blake williams could only result in what a nineteenthcentury philosopher had foreseen as the transvaluation of all values a new cosmology a new theology a new eschatology and even a new theory about the metaphysics of krazy kat emerged unfortunately they all got so stoned that they could never remember afterward exactly what they had decided it was like the legendary cthulhucon of or which was supposed to have taken place in arkham massachusetts every sciencefiction fan in the country was alleged to have been there and if they denied it they were told that the hash was so good almost everybody forgot everything that happened nobody ever knew for sure if cthulhucon had itself happened or if it was just a hoax a legend created by a minority to perplex and annoy the majority fortunately or unfortunately the belchers all got together a week later to try to reconstruct their great discoveries i think simon moon ventured that we all sort of agreed that tristan tzara writing poems by picking words out of a hat created the whole modern esthetic while claude shannon generating information theory by picking words out of a hat generated the correct approach to quantum mechanics jesus blake williams protested did i agree to that what the hell were we smoking anyway wait a minute cotex said simon has something dammit didnt we discover that there is a second flaw of thermodynamics as well as a second law i think percy prime time said that we were discussing deep mongolian steinem job and that got us into the subject of unusual combinations and permutations yes yes by god williams exclaimed we realized that genius consists of looking for unusual combinations alekhine checkmates with a pawn while his opponent is worrying about his queen beethoven proceeds from the third movement to the fourth without the usual break and shakespeare makes a powerful iambic pentameter line one of his most tragic out of the same word repeated five times simon interjected and picasso constructs a bulls head and a mighty sinister one father starhawk said from the handlebars and seat of a bicycle and so simon moon cried triumphantly the unusual combination is the key to creative genius and tzara did find a mechanical analog to it in picking words from a hat at random and shannon formulated it mathematically when he realized that information is nothing but unexpected combinationsnegative entropy in thermodynamics jesus run that by me again prime time said faintly but blake williams had the ideational ball and was running with it so dada art and cybernetics are both ways of playing games with thermodynamics with the laws of probability he said by god im becoming a mystic the only way the universe or universes can survive is by continuous acts of creativityunusual combinationson some level or another schrodinger was right all along life feeds on negative entropy the mind feeds on negative entropy the best favor you can do for anybody is to shock them and no wonder the zen masters hit you with a stick when you least expect it by god any shock thats severe enough is a new imprint imprint professor fred fidgets digits asked wanly a hardwired circuit in the nervous system williams said imprints are created by shock the birth process itself is the first shock and makes the first imprint havent you ever read ethology you mean like a gosling imprints its mother and if the mother isnt right there it imprints some other white round object like a pingpong ball digits said yeah i read that in konrad lorenz didnt he win the nobel for it well williams said ive been wondering for years about the hollandaise sauce mysterythe people who were poisoned by contaminated hollandaise once and then had a toxic reaction whenever they tried to eat hollandaise thats an imprint i decided being poisoned is uh you must admit a shock oh wow simon moon said thats like dashiell hammetts story about the guy who almost got killed by a falling girder all his imprints got extinguished he just wandered off forgetting is wife his family his job and everything looking for another reality he could hook on to yes yes williams said youre getting it it happens to shipwrecked sailors and other people in isolation for long periods too the imprints fade and whatever comes along makes a new imprint it happens in free fall thats why all the astronauts come back mutated and it happens at the first millett too far potter stewarting out simon said you mean i dig redhaired women because my first millett was with a redhaired girl in high school youve got it williams said if it had been a young um lady of color youd be one of those cats who only like to swing with black chicks if it had been with a boy simon said id be gay thats it thats it clem cotex cried if the finkelstein multiworlds model in quantum mechanics is true there are universes in which you did not take those imprints yeah simon said i can see myself hanging around gay bars in one universe chasing black foxy ladies in another my god its probably true on the semantic circuits too there might be a universe where i imprinted mathematics instead of words i might be a physicist or a computer specialist over there instead of a novelist and father starhawk said solemnly there might be a universe where with a different set of emotional and semantic imprints i might be a professional criminal a jewel thief or something there was a pause while everybody considered what they had been saying this is all rather speculative fred digits said finally were being carried away by our own rhetoric i suspect urn another thing father starhawk said people seem to be changing rather abruptly and in strange unexpected ways lately those negative entropy connections and unusual combinations you know i mean people whove been straight all their lives and suddenly theyre gay or bi or something and conservatives suddenly becoming liberals as if all the semantic imprints are fading everywhere stable people schizzing out emotional neurotics suddenly becoming mature it cant all be the shocks of accelerating social change can it blake williams beamed thats the question ive been asking myself for months he said and i think i have the answer gentlemen all the socalled recreational drugs that have come into wide use in the last few decades may be chemical shock devices i think people are bleaching out their old imprints and accidentally making new ones when they think theyre just getting high and having fun wait a minute simon said isnt there a guy in prison in california for the last twentyseven years or so for saying that some psychiatrist named sid cohen or something never heard of him said prime time besides we dont put people in jail in this country for their ideas well anyway simon said even if all these new imprints made with dope are more or less accidental and the people doing it dont know what theyre doing actually it sure has stirred up a lot of the creative energy we were talking about new combinationsbizarre unthinkable taboo combinationsare forming in brains all over the world every few minutes maybe thats why the libertarian immortalist party could come out of nowhere and win the election by a landslide no more death and taxes my god who would have thought of it twenty years ago after the meeting broke up clem cotex hung around the office awhile bringing the files up to date dusting the venetian blinds wondering why dr hugh crane the most brilliant mind in the whole society had been so quiet during this meeting and also speculating idly about how the novel he was in was going to end there was a knock on the door come said clem he had picked that up from his hero captain now admiral james t kirk and he thought it was much classier than come in a small brown charismatic puerto rican opened the door hugo de naranja he said introducing himself continental fashion clem cotex clem said what can i do for you you investigate the impossible not so have a seat clem said we investigate the real he added especially those parts that the narrowminded and mentally constipated regard as impossible yes hugo sat down i am initiate he said in santaria also in voudon i am poet and shaman i am alsohow you saygoan bananas over one meestery all my training in magicko cannot explain i theenk the novelist play a treek on me oh ah clem said thoughtfully youre aware that were living in a novel oh si is it not obvious hugo smiled one weathered quantum jumper to another you look at the leetle details you see much treekery no remind me to study this santaria sometime clem said its given you a broad perspective i can see now whats your problem poetry it earns no much the dinero hugo said i work nights as watchman to keep body and soul together you know so one night at the warehouse i see thees catthees sonofabeetch of a catand it is there and it is not there you know oh certainly clem said you should take blake williams course on quantum physics and neuropsychology sonofabeetch hugo said i took that course but i no pay attention much just to get the credit to get the degree you know i mees something important every modern poet and shaman should know quantum physics clem said sternly specialization is oldfashioned you see senor de naranja what you encountered was schrodingers cat and schrodingers cat is only in this novel part of the time no limits allowed no limits allowed no limits exist john lily the center of the cyclone the man from the fbi is here again ms karrig said with a man from the district attorneys office dr dashwood breathed deeply send them in he said as calmly as he could clicking off the intercom he stared at the door for one frozen moment still breathing deeply relaxing every muscle and then the door opened and the two men came in i could jump out of the window dashwood thought but then he controlled himself he recognized tobias knight at once but the man from the das officewho looked like a young lincoln or henry fonda playing young lincolnwas a stranger dr dashwood knight said cordially this is cotton deact from the district attorneys office named after cotton mather dashwood asked inanely named after cotton hawes the detective deact said looking embarrassed my mother was a great mysterystory fan oh dashwood said there didnt seem to be any other appropriate comment there was a pause and dashwood noticed that tobias knight looked a bit embarrassed also well gentlemen he said heartily what can i do for you hrrrmph deact cleared his throat dr dashwood he said formally there are two detectives from the vice squad waiting outside they have a warrant for your arrest um for violating section of the revised criminal code ah bestiality he was actually blushing i see dashwood said he realized that his breath had become shallow and his muscles were tensing with an effort he relaxed ive known this day might come he said with icy calm why dont they just come in and arrest me then deact took a chair knight remained standingbetween dashwood and the window although not being conspicuous about how he got himself there well ah deact said lighting a cigarette nervously you are ah um an international celebrity in a sense um people say freud kinsey masters johnson and dashwood almost in one breath you might say ah there are questions of scientific freedom at stake here ah there is the matter of our national image ah we dont want you to be called the american sakharov or anything like that haha right do you mean dashwood cried you might offer me a deal well i cant speak with any authority on that deact said quickly what we have in mind is having you ah fill us in on the background details you mean you want me to inform on my colleagues dashwood said not quite making a question of it no no nothing like that deact said its hardly necessary anyway we know who they are and where they are all sixtyseven of them he noted dashwoods reaction yes he went on there is very little we dont know about project pan as you called it oh burger knight said suddenly lets stop fiddlestewarting around weve been on this investigation for over a year dashwood we know that you and your friend blake williams somehow or other induced sixtyseven top scientific brains to get embroiled with you in this this this he blanched and then went on brutally we know youve been lourding animals dammit lourding donkeys and lourding goats and lourding godknowswhatelsewhatever your rehnquists would fit into evidently jesus christ he added i never heard of such a thing thats enough tobias deact said sharply you see our problem dr dashwood even in this age of sexual permissiveness and free scientific inquiry you seem to have crossed a line into very ah controversial territory as well as being in violation of section the bestiality law what we want to know ishe paused for a deep breathwhy did you do it doctor and how in hell did you get so many important people involved my god dashwood said you really want to know the idea behind it all yes deact said certainly thats our problem in a nutshell i dont go along with any of this deact knight said its just a case of degeneracy and perversion and who cares what rationalizations they have thatll be enough tobias deact repeated i always say knight went on scratch a scientist and youll find an atheist and scratch an atheist and youll find a goddamned commie that will be enough i said dashwood was thinking this was the old muttandjeff routine the tough dumb cop who terrified you and the smart sympathetic cop who encouraged you to explain yourself still very well he said i will attempt to explain project pan you can call your lawyer before talking to us deact said hurriedly you can call a psychiatrist too if you want he added i am a psychiatrist dashwood reminded him was deact worried about the supreme court and the international repercussions of putting sixtyeight top scientists on trial or did he have some intuitive sense of the magnitude of what project pan was all about can you take me seriously dashwood spoke directly to deact if i tell you that what we have discovered here is the summum bonum the secret of secrets the key to the mystic powers of the ancients the medicine of metals the stone of the wise the lost art of the rosicrucians that what you have been trained to consider most despicable is the central sacrament of existence the key to higher consciousness and intelligence the evolutionary imperative the greatest scientific breakthrough to our epoch of course i always knew i would go to jail for it i regard myself as lucky to live in an age when you wont burn me at the stake deact lit another cigarette avoiding dashwoods eyes he mumbled you sound a bit grandiose doctor this guys a schizo knight said more bluntly let me begin at the beginning dashwood said ignoring knight we are all primates do you understand that gentlemen sure deact said evolution i had that in college its just a theory knight grumbled a man still has the right to believe in god in this country you know knight was rather overdoing the toughcop routine dashwood thought its a biochemical fact dashwood said that ninetyeight percent of our dna is identical with chimpanzee dna eightyfive percent of our dna is identical with that of the south american spider monkey our most distant relative in the primate family that means gentlemen that most of our behavior is genetically programmed to follow the same survival status and sex programs as the other primates we are only two percent different from the chimpanzee and only fifteen percent different from the spider monkey think of that the next time you go to the zoo our cousins are looking out at us through the bars now let me emphasize this gentlemen we suffer from certain induced cultural hallucinations every tribe brainwashes its children into the islandreality of the adults of the tribe thats the great discovery of einstein in her principle of neurological relativism in our tribewestern christian civilization as its calledwe have brainwashed ourselves into not seeing and not thinking about our relationship to the other primates and to life in general we know we are primates if we have gotten as far as collegehe emphasized the last for knightbut we keep forgetting it ignoring it losing track of it bullburger knight growled it was a typical primate reaction in a threat situation dashwood thought go on deact said nervously lighting a third cigarette if i were to write a novel of about six hundred pages dashwood said and mentioned on every one of the first four hundred pages that all of us are primates we would find it funny or satirical even stranger if i stopped mentioning it for about two hundred pages the readers would all forget it quickly and be startled if i mentioned it again on page five hundred fifteen its a fact that all educated persons know but most of us would rather forget or simply not think about now what is bestiality gentlemen dashwood didnt pause but answered his own question sexual relations between a human and an animal but humans are animals as we keep forgetting so that definition is culturally biased and selfserving bestiality is sex between animals thats all interspecies sex and any biologist will tell you that is quite common insects will potter stewart any bug that comes along if they cant find their own species the ubiquity of the mule gentlemen shows how common is the occurrence of interspecies sexbestiality as our law calls itbetween horses and donkeys throughout the reptile bird and fish kingdoms the same behavior is commonplace there is no species on the planet gentlemen that thinks it is degrading to have sex with another species except ourselves and that is because we are trying to forget that we are primates dashwood paused this is some kind of puton tobias knight said irritably get to the point dashwood but deact was crushing out his cigarette with a thoughtfill frown so thats your defense then he asked scientific inquiry and so on you just wanted to find out the ah subjective similarities and differences in comparing bestiality with ordinary sex and homosexuality and ah the other variations defense dashwood exclaimed i am not defending myself whether defense is necessary at all remains to be seen right now i am merely filling you in on the background as you requested he paused all progress is made by violating taboos he went on presently a certain friend of mine ah made that observation many years ago blake williams tobias knight said we know hes in this up to his ears a certain friend dashwood went on neither confirming nor denying he pointed out that without heretics and blasphemerswithout rebels that iswe would all still be living like homo erectus half a million years ago all progress has been made by individuals who dared to think about the unthinkable and do the forbidden as oscar wilde said disobedience was mans original virtue those who dare wilde was a bryanting degenerate knight growled he was showing more of his canine teeth now the signal of primate anger those who dare cross the lineany lineare explorers and explorers sometimes get lost dashwood went on but without them we never would have walked out of the tribal stage into the urban or out of the dark ages into the renaissance but enough rhetoric let me come to the point gentlemen dozens of anthropologists have sat in this office and told me stories that once made my hair stand on end and dozens and scores of parapsychologists have told me even wilder tales gentlemen everybody outside bad ass or seattle knows that the line between experimental music and noise is very hard to find that the line between avantgarde literature and nonsense is ambiguous that even the line between the beautiful and the hideous is far from fixed since a ubangi woman with a plate in her lip is attractive to a ubangi man but absurd or repulsive to most of us mathematicians know that what constitutes proof is still not itself totally understood scientific truth so called used to remain the same for millennia then it began changing every century in this century it has changed every decade or even quicker in some fields and yet in spite of all this we think there is a firm fixed immutable boundary between the real and the unreal gentlemen there is no such boundary everything that we regard as filthy obscene blasphemous and disgusting is part of the ancient mindscience called magick dashwood smiled gently sex with a menstruating woman is forbidden and considered indecent or appalling because it was once part of the sacraments of the moon goddess cult the menstruating woman was thought to be possessed by the goddess i suppose but the theory doesnt matter judeochristian civilization put the practice under a ban and made it evil because it was part of the ancient goddess religion that the worshipers of a male god could not tolerate homosexuality is forbidden and considered revolting and ugly because it was part of the tradition of shamanism in most parts of the world not included in the judeochristian cult and yet what do we find within the judeochristian world itself what do we find in the most orthodox times we find secret cults using these forbidden acts for occult purposes sex with a menstruating woman was called the mystery of the red gold by the alchemists and was part of the process of consciousness expansion in that form of magick homosexuality was part of the secret teachings of the knights templar and many other magick cults there are perverts everywhere knight said that doesnt prove anything dashwood smiled again tell me he asked how do you feel after a good potter stewart what does that prove knight demanded let us see where it leads us dashwood said you feel good do you not yes you will agree to that much how would you feel after potter stewarting for four hours tired not if you were trained in tantra dashwood said tantrists have been known to continue the sexual act for far longereight hours even is it not strange that shakespeare referred to it as the monetary trick and kinsey found back in the forties that the average unistat male reaches millett in less than two minutes is this not part of the taboo i am discussing the taboo on the magick secrets of nonjudeochristian religion we have loosened up a lot since kinseys day but to a tantrist we are still rushing and missing the little details you might say why is that deact lit another cigarette jesus he said are you telling us that every kind of sex thats forbidden in the bible is the key to some kind of occult knowledge or power is that it a long time ago when i wasnt ready to understand yet dashwood said a parapsychologist told me scratch a trance medium and youll find a homosexual thats not one hundred percent true but its true more often than not the moon goddess is a metaphor let us say but what happens to a woman in her menses the power that is present and can be used in mind science is no metaphor now what started project pan was something i discovered by accident as they say just browsing in a book that didnt seem to relate to my own work at all a book on egypt and there it was there was a priestess who performed fellatio on a goat every year on the egyptian new years day which is our july yes gentlemenin the vernacular she gave the goat a steinem job there are perverts everywhere knight repeated this was central to the egyptian religion dashwood said was the whole religion a perversion dont you see everything called perversion got that name because it was part of the old magick tradition and guess what gentlemen what is the most common subject in the cave paintings left by our ancestors thirty thousand years ago bestiality yes gentlemenour ancestors portrayed themselves over and over having sex with goats and bisons and every animal they knew about i dont believe it knight said flatly look it up sometime dashwood said pleasantly its mentioned in ghost dance origins of religion by weston lebarre one of our most respected anthropologists you never see those paintings in any popular books of cave art but every paleoanthropologist knows about them you find the same in ancient indian art ancient babylonian art ancient art everywhere and you find the magick secret coded into myth and legend over and over the formula for producing a mangod or superhero is the mating of human and animal europa and the bull leda and the swan beauty and the beast the buddha fathered by a white elephant in some versions of the legend tantric sex is the portal of the mysteries and the alchemists called it the secret of silver this is the secret of gold gentlemen and its even coded into the judeochristian mythosafter the gnostics got through editing the manuscripts why do you think eve and the serpent are credited with giving us the knowledge of good and evil why does the hebrew word for serpent neschek have the same cabalistic value as the word messiah why is the messiah born of the union of a woman with a bird cant you read the message in the formula animalhumansuperhuman this is blasphemous and disgusting as well as criminal knight said you dr dashwood are as crazy as a loon why do you feel good during and after sex dashwood went on just natures way of tricking us into reproducing the species yes that is part of it but nature loves to economize to do several things at once you feel high and powerful because you are raising your mental energy the kundalini of the hindu metaphor with the proper ritual and proper training the energy can be raised to the point where your will and imagination are illuminated with power and you can create a new reality literally you walk over the line between the state marked real as far as you dare to go into the unreal and you make your new line until you have the courage to try again and go even farther out crazy as a loon knight repeated deact put out his cigarette and lit another i want to thank you dr dashwood he said formally for being so open with us and ah taking us into your confidence so fully you will understand of course that we cannot ah buy your argument at ah first glance it is startling and ah very unorthodox and ah that is well im sure the jury will understand a brilliant mind and probably the factor of overwork and too much imagination dashwood stood up i see he said well its time i tried itthe one experiment i was always afraid of grab him tobias deact shouted but he was too late dashwood opened his mouth to its maximum extension breathed in deeply and then bellowed aaaoooozorazz azzaieoazaeiiioz akhoeoooytho eazaeaoozakho zakheythxaalet hykh gesundheit knight said automatically but dashwood was gone from that universe the sign said chapel perilous price of admission your mind s muss sine proprietor dashwood passed through the lavatory into the laboratory where patrick knowles and lon chancy were turning switches and throwing relays wildly as bela lugosi with karloffs old makeup tried to pretend he was the frankenstein monster while ilona masey huddled in a corner looking worried it seemed that some refurbishing and rebuilding had been going on in the downtown area for union square was much bigger than dashwood remembered and there were several new buildings surrounding it most of them built in hyperbolic and noneuclidean curves chinatown was now facing directly onto the square instead of being two blocks downhill and to the right but there was a huge sign on the chinatown gate saying closed for alterations fu manchu proprietor claude shannon of bell laboratories and tristan tzara

going by too fast for himone minute he was driving home from work and passed the billboard on howard street with the eyeonthepyramid and the next minute he was in this place the lights began to go out all over san francisco first in ones and twos then in dozens and scores and then in hundreds until a stygian blackness descended in which punk rock groups and transvestites could be seen dimly as they marched in robot hordes toward the bay ufos over the power stations somebody shouted a major blackout and behind the gate of chinatown the drums of fu manchu began the punk rock groups led the parade downhill through chinatown to the ocean turn back turn back screamed an effete intellectual snob the sea is not our home beware of the rising rivers of blood beware of the robot animal within turn back turn back but the punkers marched and everybody fell in step behind them first came the ludes and the creepers then the dirks and the blunt instruments then more and more the problem of anxiety

said their habits included but were not limited to valium marijuana miltown uppers downers acid cigarettes booze aspirin dmt cocaine peyote and cocacola he called upon all concerned citizens to donate

time coming out of the illusion that he was frank dashwood here it is cagliostro the great said handing george a book called the answer george opened the volume eagerly it had one page and said flossing here it is dr hugh crane said handing george a book called the answer frank opened the volume eagerly it had one page and said jan zelenka was born in bohemia in wrote in a style similar and much admired by johann sebastian bach died in much of his sacred music is still admired but perhaps his greatest composition was his capriccio of out of the sea rose a gigantic chryselephantine bodacious incredible yellow submarine waving the black flag of anarchy and the golden apple of discord mavis the woman with the tommy gun appeared at a window gravity sucks she shouted the cream of

you and he leapt and grabbed hold and they pulled him up into the golden space ship captain hagbard celine who looked a lot like hugh crane the magician when you stopped to think about it and a little bit like harry coin the crazy assassin and somewhat like everyman took his hand good to have you back aboard george was it rough down there he tried to be modest well you know how it is on primitive planets they gave you merry hell hagbard said i can see it in your face well cheer up george its over now were heading home and indeed there were thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of them great golden ships sailing past at the speed of light heading into the center of the galaxy it was the planetary birth process earth like a single giant flower after incubating for four billion years was discharging its seed and the ships like homing pigeons were going back where the experiment began where the dna was created and ejaculated out onto every planet where the star makers dwell beyond the black hole out of space out of time the return to ithaca the future exists first in imagination then in will then in reality barbara marx hubbard one evening while wing lee chee was meditating he found himself floating higher and higher becoming more and more detached observing with total lucidity that he was a little old man sitting in a room high on a hill over a huge city on a planet circling around a star in a galaxy of myriads of stars among countless galaxies extending to infinity and eternity in all directions within his own mind and in that lucidity he knew that he had been lying to himself for months pretending not to notice what was happening to his body as it gradually terminated its basic functions fearful of looking straight at death but now in that lucidity looking at it and seeing that it was just another of the millions of things that wing lee chee who was so rich and powerful could not do anything about but now in that lucidity and objectivity looking far down at this particular galaxy this insignificant solar system this temporary city this house that a strong wind could blow away this absurd old man who was rich and powerful but could not command the tides or alter the paths of the stars it was all suddenly a great joke and every little detail made sense for in this new lucidity and objectivity and selfless perspective he did not giggle or weep or feel dazed but only smiled very slightly knowing he would soon lose this body which was like an old rundown car and this central nervous system which was like a tired and increasingly incompetent driver and the metaprogrammer in the higher nervous centers which gave him this perspective because out here beyond spacetime he simply did not give a damn about that life that planet or that universe anymore so as he very slowly came down contracted into euclidean d again he was aware of every amusing poignant radiant little detail the wholeness and the harmony and the luminosity of it all knowing how richly he would enjoy every last minute of it now that it didnt matter to him anymore the next day he called the office and told his secretary he wouldnt be in then he took a long walk enjoying every bird every flower every blade of grass every radiant detail and getting a bit windedanother sign that the car was running downand finally taking a cab to ying kaw foys house she wept when he told her but he smiled and joked and chided her out of it i may be one of the last men to die he said when she was calm president hubbard in unistat is putting a lot of money into research on longevity and immortality no dont weep again it is nothing to me i feel like one of the last dinosaurs you are the best man in the world she said eyes flashing i have been good to you he said i have been as much of a scoundrel as was necessary to be rich and comfortable many will be glad of my death he told her how he was arranging to have most of his estate liquidated turned into cash and deposited in her account he urged her to take advantage of the longevity drugs as they became available and to meditate every day one year of life is wonderful when you are conscious of the details a thousand years would be more wonderful and then he added a strange thing think of me sometimes and look for me youll never see old wing lee ghee again but youll see what i really am if you look hard enough and long enough and then he suddenly realized it was coming even sooner than he had expected how absurd he said i must lie down now he stretched out on her couch i must have walked too far he said so many hills so many ups and downs and all i want now is one thing open your blouse please thats right thank you no i just want to look at them such lovely brownmillers like peaches let me touch them no let me kiss them no never mind im going now dont go she cried kiss them kiss them first right back where i started he said suckling and then he left her ms ying decided to go to the french riviera after the funeral she would spend a year there having a series of young crude unintelligent lovers who wouldnt remind her of him and then decide what to do with her money and the rest of her life she sold the rehnquist and a lot of other junk when she gave up her house in hong kong the wholesaler didnt know what to do with the rehnquist at first but he finally sold it to a sex shop in yokohama markoff chaney was vacationing in japan that summer becauseafter years of paying him only about three hundred dollars a monthhis stocks in blue sky inc were suddenly paying two thousand dollars or three thousand dollars a month blue sky made zerogravity devices that were proving very useful in the spacecities president hubbard had created chaney had also written a book which was selling moderately well despite its rather eccentric thesis it was his endeavor to prove that all the great achievements in art science and culture were the work of persons who were on the average less than five feet tall and often shorter he claimed that this fact had been covered up by what he called unconscious sizeist prejudice on the part of professional historians he had called the book little men with big balls but the publisher out of a sense that chaney perhaps had some unconscious prejudice of his own and certainly lacked good taste had changed the title to little people with big ideas chaney spent his first day in japan visiting kyoto he went out to see where the temple of the golden pavilion had once stood and he spent three hours walking around there trying to get into the head of the zen monk who had burned it down chaney had known the story for years how the monk working on the koan does a dog have the buddha nature had tried one answer after another always getting hit upside the head by his roshi and told he didnt have it yet finally after meditating continuously for a day and a half without sleep or food the monk had a brainstorm of some kind and dashed from his cell with a hell of a yell and burned down the temple the most beautiful building in japan at the time the court had declared the monk insane after three hours of trying to get into the monks headspace when he set fire to the building chaney had his own brainstorm he had been ignoring dr dashwood for three or four months he realized he took a cab to western union and dispatched a telegram to dr dashwood at orgasm research it said flossing is the answer ezra pound chaney had gotten those words many months ago while having some dental work done the dentist suggested they try nitrous oxide and chaney eagerly agreed he remembered that the great psychologist william james had once thought he had the whole secret of the universe on a nitrous oxide trip what james had written down in trying to verbalize his insight was overall there is a smell of fried onions chaney wanted to know what it was like to be in the state where fried onions would explain everything he sniffed deeply and expectantly as the mask was placed over his nose and waited no illumination came at first but the room seemed to be getting bigger and bigger and then it was getting smaller and smaller and then he became aware that the dentist as was typical of his species was making remonstrating noises as he gazed into chaneys mouth saying that brushing was not enough and that everybody should be more conscious of dental hygiene and so on all the usual craperoo and then he chaney wasnt there anymore he wasnt anywhere it was just like what he had heard about quantum jumping in physics because he was there again having gone from to and then going back to again not being there and then back to again and the dentist said somberly like a very wise old wizard flossing is the answer and chaney felt like he might giggle or weep but was too dazed to do either having found it at last the answer and it was so simple as all the mystics said it was right out in the open and we didnt notice it because we werent conscious of the details and he stared up awed at the wise face of the great sage who had given it to him at last the answer flossing and the damnedest part of it was that for weeks after he still had flashes when he thought that was it the answer flossing after kyoto chaney went to yokohama to see the infamous sex shops as was inevitable in the first sex shop he purchased an artificial vagina which seemed vastly superior in both realism and pneumatic grip to the model he had at home in the second sex shop he bought a box of pornographic easter eggs by then he was feeling the surging despair again knowing that these substitutes were not what he really wanted knowing his loneliness and his exile with that bitterness that he usually kept at bay by concentrating on the absurdity of everythingingeneral experiencing the terrible isolation of being out there on the moon separated from the ridiculous oversized clods by miles and sizeist prejudice and then in the third sex shop he found it the answer and it wasnt flossing at all dr glopberger had worked in the sex change department of johns hopkins for a long time and thought that nothing could surprise him any longer markoff chaney surprised him no chaney said in answer to the first question glopberger always asked ive never felt like a woman trapped in a mans body um glopberger said well sir what do you want here chaney opened the box in his lap good god glopberger said ive only seen one that big once in my life what was that characters name wildebeeste strange one he had kept it after the operation had it mounted on a plaque or something like that you see chaney explained i dont want to become a woman i want to become more of a man well said dr glopberger professionally well well it was an ingenious challenge even with the advances in sex surgery in the past three years but it could be done my word it would be a medical first the stocks in blue sky were now paying eight thousand dollars to ten thousand dollars a month name your price chaney said with a steely glint justin case heard about the man with no name at one of mary margaret wildebloods wild wild parties joe malik the editor of confrontation told the story it was rather hard for case to follow because the party was huge and noisya typical wildeblood soiree all the usual celebrities were thereblake williams the most boring crank in the galaxy juan tootrego the rocket engineer responsible for the first three spacecities carol christmas the man who had invented the first longevity drug extend natalie drest the fiery feminist bertha

personville malik was saying and the man with no name was a detective for a big agency like pinkertons but then kurasawa adapted it and the man with no name became a samurai of course we can go to the stars markoff chaney was saying even louder on cases other side the speed of light doesnt mean a thing when you consider what the next two or three jumps of longevity will bring there are no real limits anywhere except in the thinking of the timid and the conservative he was armed with new courage then he became glint eastwood malik said whats your game juan tootrego asked making conversation oh art case said i write the art column in confrontation but he still doesnt have a name malik exclaimed then youre the man who discovered el mir juan tootrego said impressed blake williams snickered

a detective a samurai or a cowboy he still has no name isnt that archetypal i always look at the bright side hagbard celine was saying to natalie drest theres only years to go in the kali yuga for instance well if batman is so smart marvin gardens muttered why does he wear his underdrawers outside of his pants pardon me simon moon was asking blake williams but did you say grand canyon should be considered as an artistic whole or as an artistic hole why yes markoff chaney was telling mary margaret i am working on a second book its called reality is what you can get away with and its about the future evolution of consciousness and intelligence his courage was growing childproof bottles my abzug marvin gardens complained there isnt a child in the world who doesnt have the patience and curiosity to open one of them he has no name malik said because he is death and death is a nightmare from which humanity is beginning to awaken its time to stop worshiping gods chaney went on

then everybody else had left and they were alone of course there are robots among us chancy said finishing his last speech there are also magicians among us i think we take turns playing each role as a matter of fact the magician defines a realitymesh and the robot lives in it grok god youre an attractive man mary margaret breathed thinking of his courage their eyes locked because of the magnetism of his personality neither of them was conscious of the fact that she was looking a long way down at him lets sniff a little more coke chaney suggested i have some cognac left too she whispered perfect he said and quoted heart of my heart come out of the rain soak me in cognac love and cocaine they went to the kitchen to get the cognac and he was swaggering a bit like perry mason about to crossexamine or the new gun in town he patted her frankel gently she patted his new courage then they went to the bedroom andafter circumnavigating the globe and passing through possible universesulysses finally returned to ithaca glossary a guide for the perplexed bells theorem a mathematical demonstration by dr john s bell which shows that if quantum mechanics is valid any two particles once in contact will continue to influence each other no matter how far apart they may subsequently move this violates special relativity unless the influence between the particles is not employing any known energy copenhagen interpretation the theory formulated by niels bohr according to which the state vector see below should be regarded as a mathematical formalism in other wordswhich some physicists will dispute the equations of quantum mechanics do not describe what is happening in the subatomic world but what mathematical systems we need to create to think of that world cosmic glue a metaphor to describe the quantum interconnectedness that must exist if bells theorem be valid coined by dr nick herbert egenstate one of a finite number of states that a quantum system can be in the superposition principle says that before measurement a system must be considered to be in all of its etgenstates measurement selects one eigenstate einsteinrosenpodolsky effect the quantum interconnectedness as described in a paper by einstein rosen and podolsky the purpose of said paper was to prove that quantum mechanics cannot be valid since it leads to such an outlandish conclusion since bells theorem some physicists have chosen to accept the interconnectedness however outlandish it may seem see quip everettwheelergraham model an alternative to bells theorem and the copenhagen interpretation according to everett wheeler and graham everything that can happen to the state vector see below does happen to it form in the sense of g spencer brown a mathematical or logical system necessary to systematic thought but having the inevitable consequences of imposing its own deep structures upon the experiences packaged and indexed by the form see copenhagen interpretation hidden variable an alternative to bell copenhagen and everettwheelergraham as developed by dr david bohm the hidden variable theory assumes that quantum events are determined by a subquantum system acting outside or before the universe of spacetime known to us dr evan harris walker and dr nick herbert have suggested that the hidden variable is consciousness dr jack sarfatti suggests that it is information information a measure of the unpredictability of a message that is the more unpredictable a message is the more information it contains since systems tend to disorder according to the second law of thermodynamics we can think of the degree of order in a system as the amount of information in it ordinarily information is transmitted as an ordering of energy a signal in which the energy and its ordering the message is transmitted from one place to another dr jack sarfatti has suggested that the nonlocality of the erp effect and bells theorem may entail the instantaneous transfer of order from one place to another without any energy transfer thus we can have both bells theorem and special relativity since special relativity only prohibits the instantaneous transfer of energy and does not say anything about instantaneous transfer of information neuro a prefix denoting known or mediated by the nervous system since all human knowledge is neurological in this sense every science may be considered a neuroscience eg we have no physics but neurophysics no psychology but neuropsychology and ultimately no neurology but neuroneurology but neuroneurology would itself be known by the nervous system leading to neuroneuroneurology etc in an infinite regress see von neumanns catastrophe nonlocal not depending upon space and time a nonlocal effect occurs instantaneously and with no attenuation due to distance special relativity seems to forbid all such nonlocal effects but bells theorem seems to show that quantum mechanics demands them the only solutions thus far offered to this contradiction are that nonlocal effects involve consciousness rather than energy walker herbert or that they involve information rather than energy sarfatti nonobjectivity one of the two alternatives to bells theorem the other being the everettwheelergraham model in order to avoid nonlocality some physicists such as dr john a wheeler prefer this option which holds that the universe has no reality aside from observation the extreme form of this view says esse est percepito be is to be perceived potentia the name given to the presumed subquantum world by dr werner heisenberg space and time do not exist in potentia but all the phenomena of the spacetime manifold emerge from potentia compare with hidden variable and information quantum an entity whose energies occur in discrete lumpseg photons are the quanta of the electromagnetic field quanta have both wave and particle aspects the wave aspect being the probability of detecting the particle at a certain place and time quantum logic a system of symbolic logic not restricted to the either its a or its nota choices of aristotelian logic chiefly due to dr john von neumann and dr david finkelstein this approach evades the paradoxes of other interpretations of quantum mechanics by assuming that the universe is multivalued not twovalued dr finkelstein expresses this by saying in addition to a yes and a no the universe contains a maybe see egenstate quantum mechanics the mathematical system for describing the atomic and subatomic realm there is no dispute about how to do quantum mechanicsie calculate the probabilities within this realm all the controversy is about what the quantum mechanics equations imply about reality which is known as the interpretation of quantum mechanics the principal lines of interpretation are the copenhagen interpretation andor nonobjectivity andor bells theorem andor nonlocality andor the everettwheelergraham multiworlds model quip the quantum inseparability principle an acronym coined by dr nick herbert to refer to the nonlocality implicit in the einsteinrosenpodolsky argument and explicit in bells theorem state vector the mathematical expression describing one of two or more states that a quantum system can be in for instance an electron can be in either of two spin states called spin up and spin down the amusing thing about quantum mechanics is that each state vector can be regarded as the superposition of other state vectors superdeterminism the approach to quantum theory urged by dr fritjof capra in the tao of physics this interpretation rejects contrafactual definiteness that is it assumes that any statements about what could have happened are meaningless a consequence of this view is that all distinction between observer and observed or self and universe also becomes meaningless i had no choice about writing this book dell books had no choice about publishing it and you had no choice about reading it since there is only one thing happening and we are all seamlessly welded into it synchronicity a term introduced by psychologist dr carl jung and physicist dr wolfgang pauli to describe connections or meaningful coincidences that do not make sense in terms of causeandeffect it is thought by some that such connections may indicate the hidden variable at work or some sort of nonlocal information system von neumanns catastrophe more fully von neumanns catastrophe of the infinite regress a demonstration by dr john von neumann that quantum mechanics entails an infinite regress of measurements before the quantum uncertainty can be removed that is any measuring device is itself a quantum system containing uncertainty a second measuring device used to monitor the first contains its own quantum uncertainty and so on to infinity wigner and others have pointed out that this uncertainty is only terminated by the decision of the experimenter compare neuro
