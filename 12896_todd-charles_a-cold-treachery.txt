charles todd a cold treachery chapter one the north of england december he ran through the snow face into the swirling wind feet pounding deep trenches into the accumulating drifts rocks their shapes no longer familiar under the soft white blanket sent him sprawling and he dragged himself up again white now where the snow clung and almost invisible in the darkness he had no idea what direction he had taken enveloped by unreasoning panic and hardly able to breathe for the pain inside him all he could hear was the voice in his head shouting at him you will hang for this see if you dont its my revenge and youll think about that when the rope goes round your neck and the black hood comes down and theres no one to save you the sound of the shot was so loud it had shocked him and he couldnt remember whether he had slammed the door behind him or left it standing wide he could still smell the bloodso much of itchoking in the back of his throat like feathers thrown on a fire he could feel the terror a snake that coiled and writhed in his stomach making him ill and the drumming wild in his head they would catch him and then theyd hang him there was nothing he could do to prevent it unless he died in the snow and was buried by it until the spring hed seen the frozen body of a dead lamb once stiff and hard half rotted and sad the ravens had been at it he hated ravens half the countryside knew hed been a troublemaker since the autumn restlessunhappygrowing out of himself and his clothes theyd look at what lay in that bloody room and theyd hate him he was crying now tears scalding on cold skin and the voice was so loud it seemed to be following him and he ran harder his breath gusting in front of his face arms pumping pushing his way through the snow until his muscles burned youll hang for thissee if you dont he would rather die in the snow of cold and exhaustion than with a rope around his neck hed rather run until his heart burst than drop through the hangmans door and feel his throat close off even with the ravens eating him the snow was cleaner youll hang for thissee if you dont thats my revenge my revenge my revenge chapter two paul elcott stood in the kitchen beside sergeant miller his face pale his hand shaking as he unconsciously brushed the back of it across his mouth for the third time theyre dead arent they i havent touched themi couldntlook can we step outside man im going to be sick else miller who had come from a butchers family said stolidly yes all right the doctors on his way but theres nothing he can do for them except pronounce them dead he added to himself poor souls what the devil had happened here we might as well wait in the barn then until hes finished elcott stumbled out the door he made his way to the barn where he was violently sick in one of the empty horse stalls afterward he felt no better he could still see the kitchen floorstill smell the sickening odor of blood and the eyeshalf closedstaring at nothing the living could see had gerald looked at hell hed said the trenches were worse he sat down on a bale of hay and dropped his head in his hands trying to regulate his breathing and hold on to his senses he should have sent the sergeant back alone hed been mad to think he could face that slaughter again after a while sergeant miller came across to the barn and the doctor was with him carrying a lantern elcott lifted his head to nod at dr jarvis he cleared his throat and said they didnt suffer did they i meanno one lingered no i dont believe they did the doctor answered quietly coming to stand by him and lifting the lantern a little to shine across elcotts face he prayed it was true he couldnt be sure until the autopsies without moving the bodies hed been able to find only a single gunshot wound in each to the chest with resulting internal trauma sufficient to kill a surge of sympathy swept jarvis and he reached out to press elcotts shoulder the bloody dead were this mans family his brother his brothers wife their children an unspeakable shock the doctor himself had been badly shaken by the scene and found it difficult to imagine how he would answer his wife when she asked him why the police had come to fetch him in the middle of his dinner nothing in his practice had prepared him for such a harrowing experience it was he thought something one might see in war not in a small peaceful farmhouse at length he said gently to elcott let me take you home paul and give you something to help you sleep i dont want to sleep ill have nightmares without warning elcott began to cry his face crumpled and his chest heaving his nerve gone the doctor gripped the weeping mans shoulder and looked to sergeant miller over his head i wish i knew whats keeping inspector greeleyhis wife told me hed gone to see if the potters needed help getting out i hope to god he hasnt stumbled on anything like this well know soon enough the sergeant replied they listened to the sobbing man beside them feeling helpless in the face of his grief i ought to take him home jarvis said hes no use to you in this state you can wait for greeley when youre ready for me ill be with elcott miller nodded thats best then he glanced at elcott then jerked his head moving to the door jarvis followed him the two men stood there in the late afternoon light gray clouds so heavy that it was difficult to tell if dusk was coming or more snow it had been a freak twoday storm fast moving with a heavy fall and the skies still hadnt cleared the roads were nearly impassable the farm lanes worse it had taken miller a good hour to reach the house even following in the ruts left by elcotts carriage theres one still missing miller pitched his voice so that elcott couldnt hear him i daresay elcotts not noticed ive walked through the rest of the house hes not there josh by god i hadntis he in the outbuildings do you think jarvis shivered and glanced over his shoulder at the unlit interior of the small barn with its stalls plows barrows tack and other gear stacked neatly the hay in the loft filling half the space two horses and a black cow watched him ears twitching above empty mangers gerald elcott was always a tidy man it shouldnt take long to search miller counted on his gloved fingers elcott penned his sheep against the storm i could see them up there to the east of fox scar stabled his horses and brought in the cow at a guess then he was alive this time sunday when the snow was coming down hard and he knew we were in for it but the cows not been milked since nor the stalls mucked out nor feed put down that confirms what i saw inside id say theyve been dead since sunday night jarvis frowned and stamped his feet against the cold torn i should stay until youve found josh in the event theres anything i can do no take elcott back if the rest are dead the boy is as well ill manage the doctor nodded he was moving towards elcott again when miller cautioned best to say nothing about what weve seenhe gestured to the housein the village until we know a little more we dont want a panic on our hands no god no jarvis handed the lantern to miller and settled his hat firmly on his head against the wind raising his voice he said now then paul lets take you home and ill find something to help you get past this someone has to look after the animals elcott protested and i want to help search for whoever it was killed them i want to be there when you find this bastard thats to your credit miller answered him but for now id go with the doctor if i was you ill see to the beasts and therell be someone to care for them tomorrow leave everything to us as soon as we know anything ill see youre told elcott walked to the barn door and stepped outside unable to turn away from the silent house just across the yard i wish i knew why he said his voice ragged with grief i just wish i knew why what had they ever done to deserve thatll come out miller told him calmly soothingly in good time elcott followed jarvis to the horsedrawn carriage that had brought the doctor out to the isolated farm the only tracks in the snow were theirs a hodgepodge of footprints around the kitchen door of the house and the wheel markings of the two vehicles cart and carriage beyond these the ground was smoothly white with only the brushing of the wind and the prints of winter birds scratching for whatever they could find as if only just realizing that the cart was his elcott stopped and said dr jarvisi cant leave it for sergeant miller if you will hell bring it back to town later i expect hell need it tonight ohyes dazed elcott climbed into the carriage and settled himself meekly on the seat stuffing his cold hands under his arms b y the time inspector greeley had completed his examination of the elcott farmhouse he was absolutely certain of one thing he needed help five dead and one missing believed dead it was beyond comprehensionbeyond the experience of any man to understand in urskdale with its outlying farms and vast stretches of barren mountainous landscape his resources were stretched thin as it was the first priority was making certain that all the other dale families were accounted for that this carnage hadnt been repeated god forfend in another isolated house and there was the missing child to find all the farm buildings sheep pens shepherds huts and tumbled ruins had to be searched the slopes of the fells the crevices the small dips and swales the banks of the little becks it would take more men than he could muster but hed have to make do with what he had summon the dales scattered inhabitants and work them to the point of exhaustion and time was short painfully short if that child had the most tenuous hope of surviving overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of what lay ahead greeley did what his people had done for generations here in the north he buttoned his emotions tightly inside and grimly set about what had to be done it was well after midnight when he got back to the small police station that stood six houses from the church on the main street of urskdale the inspector laboriously wrote out a message and found an experienced man to carry it to the chief constable make the fastest time you can the man was told its urgent on his drive back to the police station greeley had already compiled a mental list of the outlying farms roughly grouping them by proximity and then to keep his mind busy and away from that dreadful bloody kitchen he had considered what the searchers would needlanterns packets of food thermoses of tea rope but that was easier each man would know from experience what to bring locating lost walkers in the summer had taught them all how to plan jarvis had said two daysthat the elcotts had been dead two days this madman had already had more than sufficient time to track the boy over the snow and then vanish or spread his net to other victims what in hells name would the search parties discover as they knocked on doors greeley capped his pen and set it in the dish a general warning now would come far too late to help anyone else but the search had to go on a search for the boy for the killerfor other victims as he rose to leave turning down the lamp on his desk an appalling thought struck him what if the murderer was an urskdale man where had he spent these last fortyeight hours safely at home by his hearth if he hadnt found the boy after all would he make certain that he was included among the searchers what if he greeley was about to set the fox amongst the hounds unwittingly sending the killer out with an innocent man to search for himself he felt as if hed not slept for a weekthe tension in his body and the nightmare in his mind seemed to envelop him in the darkness the inspector rubbed his gritty eyes with his fists when he walked out the door to face the somber men collecting outside the station would one of them look away unable to meet his glance would he read suspicion into the turn of a head or the restless stamp of feet he knew each individual in his patch too well to believe one of them was a vicious killer oruntil now hed thought he did more to the point he needed every man he could lay hands to he couldnt afford to speculate still he would send them out in threes not twos just in case as he finally strode down the passage he could hear the first arrivals talking among themselves coming in some of them as soon as the news reached them a few at a time on foot on horseback their numbers slowly swelling the blast of icy air hit him in the face as he went through the door a shock to warmed skin nothing he thought to match his shock at the elcott farm in all his years as a policeman he had never seen anything like the scene in that farmhouse kitchen try as he would he couldnt imagine the kind of malevolence that could do such a thing try as he would he couldnt shut it out of his mind he and his men had lifted the five stiff bodies onto blankets and carried each out to the waiting cart he could still feel the small bodies of the children resting so lightly in his arms blind anger swept him so that he felt sick with it helpless and for the first time in his life vengeful as the searchers turned towards him prepared to receive their orders he winced his eyes evading theirs staring over their heads as he began to speak how could any man kill like that and not wear the guilt of it like an ugly brand greeley realized he wasnt prepared to read guilt in any face not yet not until his mind found a way around the horror then he would look h e was moving on nothing but fear now his legs pounding through the snow that was sometimes as deep as his knees his heart seemed too large for his chest but his brain was wild and tormented refusing to let his body rest he paused from time to time listening his face turned to the wind like an animal certain he could hear steps behind him a voice calling to him but there was no one alive to come after him it never occurred to him that it would be easier simply to stop to lie down in one of the drifts and let himself fall asleep forever what followed him was so terrible that his dread of its catching up with him ate him alive like the ravens it would pick and dig at him even in death fleeing was his only salvation far beyond reach as far and as fast as he could manage he had no idea where he wasin which direction hed run or how well hed kept to that line once out of sight of the lighted windows of the kitchen he had no idea how long he had been running everything was measured by his feet how far they were taking him how fast they could go away from the menace behind him but the voice was always in his ears in spite of the wind always pushing him on when his lungs begged him to stop for breath always at his heels like a living thing intent on savaging him you will hang for this see if you dont thats my revenge and youll think about that when the rope goes round your neck and the black hood comes down as a goad the voice was crueler than any whip he was terrified of it s ome time later he fell the air whipped out of his body and his chin buried in the snow for an instant he lay there listening was it his heart beating so hard that it choked himor was it the crunch of footsteps coming down the swale after him frantic he clawed his way to his feet again he turned to stare into the darkness behind him but the sky and the land seemed inseparable a blank graywhite swirl that offered neither hope nor sanctuary there was no one behind him there couldnt be and yet he could almost feel the warmth of a body coming towards him he could see shapes dissolving and solidifying in the wild eddy of flakes caught by the bitter wind like a ghost a ghost he began to cry again as he ran on wishing it was over wishing that he was dead like the others but he couldnt be dead like the others he would be hanged when they found him and the last thing he would ever feel was the jerk of the thick rope around his neck chapter three from the village itself sergeant miller had gathered some two dozen ablebodied men with a motley number of horses the plan was to send these men posthaste to the nearest farms where they would recruit others to go on to their outlying neighbors a human chain adding links at every stage reaching across urskdale as inspector greeley called out each area of search miller pulled forward those who knew the ground best and sent them on their way as if unperturbed by the dead the sergeant worked steadily and tirelessly offering encouragement and answering questions in his deep gruff voice but a slow fury burned inside him and he kept the faces of the children in the forefront of his mind for more than twenty years he had been a policeman in urskdale and he had taken a personal pride in maintaining the peace through a combination of fatherly persuasion and stern authority the murder of the elcotts had forever shattered his complacency and mind you speak to every single person miller commanded its not just the boy were looking to find the old granny and the newest babe make certain you see with your own eyes that theyre alive and not under duress dont be put off with excusesyou search every corner of every building leaving nothing to chance if theres any trouble anybody hurtor deadsend word at once dont forget the high pens or any fold or crevice that might hold a frightened lad and dont forget to look down wells up chimneys in the wardrobes and the coal bins comb the lot anywhere a killer might hide himself as you come into the yard dont waste time dwelling on events thats no help to anyone and will frighten some do your best then come back here to report or send for the inspector here if need be dont be bloody heroeskeep in mind the killer is sure to be armed we havent found the murder weapon yet off with you then w hen chief superintendent bowles was summoned from his bed by a messenger from the yard he tied the belt of his robe around his thickening waist and ran a hand over his hair before going down the stairs to find out what was so urgent he had to be awakened from a sound sleep he took the folded sheet the waiting constable handed him and scanned it swiftly then read through it more carefully hell and damnation he swore under his breath and looked up at the constable with the fierce glare of a man who needs spectacles and is too vain to wear them sanders is it any more than this do you know thats all sergeant gibson gave me sir he said weve got a man close by sir who could be there in a matter of hours if you like inspector rutledge has just finished his testimony in preston and is set to travel back to london in the morning rutledge bowles scowled he disliked rutledge with a fervor that time and various absences had not succeeded in reducing mickelson on the other hand was a man after his own heart careful never stirring up the wrong people deferential to his superiors mickelson was not always clever but steady it would take him twice as long to arrive on the scene but he could be trusted on the other hand the chief constable who had sent to the yard for immediate assistance was a man of parts with connectionsa brother in parliament and a wife whose father had a title it would not do to let him discover that chief superintendent bowles had not been as expeditious as he might have been under the circumstances five deadbloody hell they were going to attract notice these murders he couldnt afford to dally rutledge it will have to be then bowles agreed sourly tell gibson to get word to his hotel and stop him before he leaves preston ill be in my office directly he read through the message a third timeand had second thoughts yes send rutledge by all means he repeated if anything went wrong in the north it might be just as well to have a scapegoat available ill speak to him myself as soon as ive been put in the picture t he telephone call that reached rutledge shortly before dawn was from sergeant gibson a gruff man with a good head on his shoulders a message from the chief superintendent sir the sergeant said without preamble youre to stay where you are until he telephones you theres been a good bit of trouble in the north place called urskdale and it appears youre the closest man weve got i know the area rutledges voice down the line was wary he was beginning to take the measure of his senior officer there was often a whitewash of facts when bowles sent rutledge to handle an inquiry and scant praise when rutledge succeeded on his own in spite of unforeseen obstacles expected to defeat him bowless cardinal interest was in fiercely protecting his own advancement and making certain his men reflected well on him more than one ambitious inspector had learned to his cost that credit often found its way to the chief superintendent deserved or not and rutledge had discovered in kent to what lengths bowles would go to destroy a threat what kind of trouble five dead shot all of them one missing all in a single family sir gentle god any other details no sir not that ive been told theyd just been discovered the bodies late yesterday as i understand it the snow is hampering the local people but inspector greeley has got parties out searching for miles in every direction the chief constable agrees with him that the yard should be brought in as quickly as feasible very well ill wait for the chief superintendents instructions as rutledge was about to put up the telephone gibsons voice came down the line in a last word sir yes sergeant its likely the chief superintendent will have other things on his mind sir and forget to tell you but weve had a call just last night from chief inspector blakemore in preston he was pleased with your discretion thats how he put it sir your discretion it was rare praise from gibson a man not given to unnecessary speech but then sergeant gibson would do whatever lay in his power to irk old bowels as the chief superintendent was known among the rank and file and he always chose his methods with an unerring eye for what would succeed without bringing a reprimand down on his own head if bowles disliked rutledge enough to withold praise gibson took spiteful pleasure in passing it on thank you sergeant rutledge replied a wry smile in his voice and this time hung up the telephone without interruption blakemore had been kind but then the chief inspector hadnt understood fully the impact of the conviction that rutledge had helped him win b y ten oclock that morning rutledge was well on the road north a frigid wind blowing through the motorcar and clouds sweeping in again from the west he was pushing his speed taking advantage of every empty stretch to make better time taking risks where he had to to gain a few extra miles the towns and villages strung along the road like a haphazardly designed strand of somber beads often slowed him to the point of exasperation and at one point he was out of the motorcar directing traffic like the rawest constable sorting out a tangle of wagons in a narrow market square a child out in this weather couldnt survive for long the thought drove him like a spur hamish reminded him from the rear seat that the search parties were the boys best hope if hes alive the men in the district will find him no us it was true but the urge to hurry was ever present if a man had murdered five people rutledge knew he would have nothing to lose by killing more and what had become of him was as important as what had become of the lost child he picked up the snow two hours later at first a dusting that was already muddy and torn and then growing deeper by the mile rutledge swore a fresh storm on the heels of one that had already left the north buried would make the journey a trial turning the roads into slippery unpredictable ruts it would hinder the search in urskdale as well if they hadnt given it up or already found the childs body the sooner he got there the sooner he would know the latest news he was tired and adding to his fatigue the case in preston still weighed heavily on his mind the murderer had been a young man arthur marlton aged eighteen and mentally disturbed driven by voices to attempt to kill himselfand in the end driven to kill someone he had come to believe was stalking him in his confusion and emotional distress marlton had lashed out to deadly effect the man his wealthy family had quietly set to watch over their distraught son had been his unfortunate victim allegedly striking his head on a curbstone as he fell and dying without regaining consciousness the victims version of the attack died with him but the circumstances pointed to murderand witnesses supported it a tragedy compounded by tragedy rutledge wasnt convinced that an asylum was a kinder sentence than facing the hangman he himself found the thought of being shut away out of the light and air for the rest of ones life an appalling prospect but the young mans family had been in tears grateful watching their only son with inexpressible relief striving to be patient in their need to touch and hold him and the son barely aware that his life had hung in the balance for a week wore his chains in bewilderment as he listened to words they couldnt hear beyond the sweep of rutledges headlamps darkness closed down coming early this time of year gray stone villages lining the road had thinned to more open country and the rising ground that would eventually lead up the fells still lay before him the air already seemed colder as he pointed the motorcars bonnet north what troubled rutledge as he had testified against the young man in the dock was that he himself heard voices a voice not that of madness where the mind tricked itself into believing the twisted commands of its own fabrication orat least he prayed it wasnt what he heard was more fearfula dead man corporal hamish macleod pursued him like the furies following him through the last years of the war and into its aftermath as if the man were still alive so real that the soft scots accent created a presence of its own as if hamish stood just out of sight where rutledge would surely find him if he turned unexpectedly a presence that was the embodiment of too much horror piled on horror the product of shell shock the legacy of war for two days rutledge had listened to the testimony of expert witnesses aware of the difference between himself and the prisoner in the preston dock and yet at the same time rutledge had known with a cold certainty that he was the only person in that courtroom who could fully understand what the doctors and the barristers were trying to describe a haunting so real it was at times terrifying he could even understand why the prisoner had wanted to kill himself he rutledge had in the depths of his torment walked into heavy fire as he crossed no mans land with his men and waited for the peace of death and it had eluded him when against all odds hed survived the war he had made a promise to himself when he could see hamish when the day came that he could feel the dead mans breath on the back of his neck or the touch of a ghostly hand on his shoulder it would be finished by whatever means the revolver that had belonged to his father lay in a flannel cloth behind the books in his sitting room in london where he could reach it at need the legacy of war it had left rutledge so scarred emotionally that the blurred ghostly faces of men he had led into the teeth of battle seemed to mock him their useless deaths on his very soul war he thought was madness of a different kind and the final ordeal had been the death of corporal macleod not by enemy fire like so many others but by rutledges own hand the epitome of waste a man who had broken under fire even as rutledge himself was breakinga man who preferred dying in shame to leading others into another futile massacre the long deadly slaughter called the battle of the somme hamish macleods decision had left an indelible mark on his surviving officer a good mana lost manwho had perished on the unhallowed altar of military necessity in bald truth murdered and yet rutledgeand hamishhad survived the trenches after a fashion haunter and haunted they had lived through the bloodiest conflict in the history of warfare it was peace that had made the presence of the young scots soldier invisible and at the same time more real than in life an even more unspeakable burden for rutledge to carry you were one of the lucky ones dr fleming had told him not a fortnight ago but you cant see it as luck in your view its intolerable your survival youre punishing yourself because a whimsical god let you live you think youve failed the dead failed to protect them and keep them alive and bring them back home again but no one could have done that ian dont you see no one could have brought all of them through but hamish had tried rutledge answered fleming silently and so i had had to try as well rutledge had come to the doctors london rooms that fair and windy december afternoon before driving to preston to ask whenifhis expiation would end after concluding a particularly unsettling investigation where hamish seemed to be on the brink of revealing himself at every turn rutledge was looking for absolutionhopefrom a man he had once hated and slowly learned to respect only eight months before sleepdeprived goaded beyond endurance he had lived in silence and despair hardly aware of himself as a man at rutledges sisters insistence dr fleming had taken him out of the military hospital settled him in a private clinicand forced him to speak reliving the trenches had nearly destroyed him but out of the ruin of the barriers he had erected in his mind he had found a way to return to scotland yard slowly and painfully reclaiming himself a long road with no end in sight it had been a hard eight months and very lonely fleming had added cryptically as rutledge stood at the window staring out at traffic in the street it really depends on you ian i dont have an answer i expect no one does time learning to forgive to forgive yourself most of all i cant cure you but you may be able to cure yourself rutledge had had to be satisfied with that and now as he drove through the darkness hamish kept him company in the lonely silence t his part of the lake district was bounded on the east by the pennines and on the west by the sea where the high country fell away to coastal plains it was a land of farming and sheep where damsons ripened in august but apples were gnarled and sour where a mans nearest neighbor might live out of sight in a fold of the great fells and such roads as there were often became impassable in winter urskdale was not one of the famous valleys of the lake country it possessed no poetic views or famous prospects it was simply a rough lonely and wildly beautiful place where ordinary men and their families eked an existence in hard soil and harsh conditions and felt at home safe until now what had turned a killer loose in their midst h ed had the forethought to add a thermos of tea to the sandwiches the hotel had put up for him and stopped only to refuel the motorcar or walk for five minutes in the snow while the wind brought him back from the edge of sleep in the cold night air there was only the warmth of the engine to keep his feet from numbness there was no such help for his gloved hands or the back of his neck how long would a child survive in this weather lost in the open no verra long hamish at his shoulder in the rear seat had for miles been making comparisons with the highlands the poor ground and narrow valleys streams that ran crookedly over stones and sang sometimes in the silence its no the same but it makes a man homesick he added in the trenches i sometimes dreamed about the glen it was verra real wi all my heart i wanted to come home again i came to the lake district as a boy with my father for walking holidays the words were whipped away by the wind and rutledge concentrating on the road running before his headlamps was unaware that he had answered aloud they had driven through kendal two hours before one of the handful of small towns that serviced this part of the country he had seen the bridge by the church where he had stood with his father and leaned over the sunwarmed stone wall to watch for salmon in the kent years ago a lifetime ago the road just outside keswick was barricaded by police rutledge was stopped and questioned his papers examined in the light of a torch then it swept the rear of the motorcar rutledge flinched as it passed over where hamish sat but the constable nodded and stepped back the sergeant in charge hands jammed into the pockets of his heavy coat leaned into the open window and said sorry sir orders of the chief constable any news none sir that weve heard theres little enough traffic just now seeing the state of the roads at least no ones come out since weve been posted here or he got through long before that rutledge answered still we cant take that chance carry on then chapter four he turned off the buttermere road soon after following what was little more than a welltraveled track that looped the flanks of some of the tallest peaks in the district they loomed overhead hidden by the swirls of snow hulking shadows unseen but always there it was oddhe could feel them their presence confining rutledge shivered fighting a rising panic unexpected panicalmost as if it had been conjured up by the prison sentence handed down to the young man in preston but it wasnt that the heights above him the encircling fells once familiar and beautiful were now watchful and malevolent pressing in on him smothering him it was the first time hed come here since the war and in his concern for the missing child his concentration on road conditions it hadnt occurred to him that the very things that made the lake district what it wasthe high peaks and inaccessible valleyswould now threaten him as effectively as the heavy gates of a prison clanging shut at his back he had been buried alive in that nightmarish dawn when hamish was shot he had felt the earth shift and tilt under his feet as the shell exploded then hed dropped far down in the pitch dark of the erupting hole as mud and bodies and debris thundered down on him all that had saved him was the bloody tunic of one of his men his face pressed against the stillwarm cloth where a tiny pocket of air survived between the living and dead deaf and blind his extremities pinned by the weight of earth the taste of blood in his mouth and slow suffocation setting in he had seen the dying face of hamish macleod eyes begging him for the coup de grace to stop the pain a thread of a whisper that seemed to be burned in memory fiona macdonalds name by the time the frantic rescue party had dug down to him the damage had been done he could no longer endure a place from which there was no escape a shut door a small room a crowded train carriage a throng of people pushing against him but he hadnt anticipatedhe hadnt been prepared for the sense of walls around him here blinding snow and darkness and that nearly invisible presence above his head cutting him off from retreat aye theres only one way in hamish reminded him mercilessly ye saw the map for yourself the urge to turn around to go away while he could swept over him rutledge swore he didnt need hamish to remind him that he was a serving policeman that there was duty to be done god knew hed done it in france at what cost to himself and to others i cant change it he said aloud i cant build new roads swallowing hard against the panic he told himself tomorrow when the sun is out it will be different please god i can carry on until then and then the rough roadbed demanded all his attention wiping out every other thought he drove on tense watchful the fingerpost offering directions at the next turning had been shifted by the wind leaning at an odd angle and pointing skyward but instinct told him hed found the right place the track rose and fell with the land forged by centuries of traffic hooves of countless flocks cart wheels shod feet he prayed the sheep had been penned up before the storm or were hunkered down among the rocks where they could find shelter out of the cruel wind they were allowed to roam freely sometimes clogging the roads and tonight they would be nearly invisible until he had driven straight into their midst even a single animal on these icy tracks could spell disaster for a motorcar herdwicks were a sturdy breed well suited to the fells and could survive without fodder all winter scratching for their own sustenance since the time of edward i a thriving weaving business had made the north famous the coarse wiry fleece yielded a variety of cloth there was nothing in his headlamps but the snowrutted road the occasional lowlying hump of a stone farmhouse hugging a curve or the silhouette of an upright box of a house sitting on the slope above and always trees that somehow seemed determined to thrive in spite of the harshness of nature ordinarily rutledge liked the darkness the isolation the silence but now he was fighting fatigue and keeping himself alert with the image of a lost child huddled in the lee of a wall or crouched in a shallow crevice terrified and alone urskdale couldnt be much farther the road narrowed again just as a heavier snow squall was passing over obscuring everything rutledge bit back his exasperation concentrating on maintaining what speed he could only to find himself defeated by the weather already the verge was hardly visible and in the darkness to his right there was a black void indicating a long drop and a nasty slide into grief he took his foot from the pedal letting the motor slow his speed as he reached a curve his eyes fixed on the bright swath of his headlamps then his wheels began to lose traction and he fought to accomodate the skid finally bringing the heavy motorcar back to the crown of the road hamish behind him scolded sharply it willna help the lad if you wreck the motorcar and kill yoursel its no the time to be sae foolish theres no a house in sight there hadnt been for some time his shoulders ached now and his face burned from the force of the wind sweeping through the motorcar his wits were slower his reactions not as fast the engines output of heat hardly more than a breath of warmth was losing the battlehis accelerator foot was already growing numb and beneath it all the panic of claustrophobia was still there like a weight as the cold penetrated even the heavy clothing he was wearing he braked stopping in the middle of the road to drink more of his dwindling store of tea ware a sharp hiss of warning from hamish just as he was reaching for the thermos a little beyond the reach of his headlamps rutledge could just make out the telltale marks where a carriage wheel had spun across the road in front of him and veered straight for the drop that lay to his right snow had nearly filled in the trackshe couldnt judge how long theyd been there or where they were heading or whether the person holding the reins had recovered in time and driven on as he himself had just done it would have been impossible to see the marks if he hadnt stopped we havena met anyone since we left keswick hamish reminded him he may be ahead of us if he got himself righted again rutledge let in the clutch slowly moving forward a dozen feet and now could see what appeared to be a jumble of rocks some distance down the slope or no not rocks a horse lying quietly in its traces a good twenty yards below the roads edge it had thrashed a wide area into a muddy mix of black and white half obscuring itself as well where there were traces there must also be a carriage again he pulled carefully to a stop leaving the engine running and setting the brake feet and legs stiff with cold he got out slowly holding on to the motorcars frame as he tested his footing the icy crust was slick but the weight of his body broke through to firmer ground no longer blinded by the brightness of the headlamps he could pick out a shadowy tangle of reins and harness and broken shafts taking his torch from the pocket of his greatcoat he shone the light down the sharp incline sweeping the snow a small carriage its shape already distorted by a shroud of white was just visible it lay like an irregular boulder only its sharper lines betraying the fact that it had been manmade using great care rutledge scrambled down to the horse and laid a gloved hand on its hide dead still warm but already cooling he slipped and nearly lost his footing as he reached the overturned carriage and shone the torch beyond its upturned side it was then he saw the womans form curled into a knot on the ground her back pressed against the seat she responded so lethargically to the glare of his torch that he thought at first she must be dying then as she stirred he realized she was alive but very likely badly injured when she tried to turn her head to look up at him he could hear a soft mew of pain and pleading he moved around the footboard of the carriage careful not to disturb her body and came to kneel beside her can you tell me where you hurt she lifted a white face to him her eyes so dark they seemed sunken in the sockets i she was shivering violently and could hardly speak her teeth clicking together involuntarily ribs she said after a moment i ththinkribs but my ffeet are numb shed used the blanket to wrap herself and the seat of the carriage offered some protection from the wind but she was very very cold rigid with it rutledge reached down to touch the hand pressed to her side and it felt icy through his glove the woman shook her head as if afraid he was going to lift her i must get you out of here do you understand me if you stay where you are you wont live through the night please no with the snow deep enough and treacherous enough to make carrying her nearly impossible he said theres nothing for milesno house no barn theres no help he could feel the wind sucking at his breath as it had sucked at her will noi must i must she shook her head again as if her mind refused to work clearly and tell her what it was she must do making certain he said were you alone in the carriage no one has tried to go for help yesalone im going to lift you to your feet ill be as careful as i can and then you must walk with my support i cant carry you but i have a motorcar on the road after a moment she nodded with enormous effort she tried to get her feet under her and finally with her hands on his shoulders as he knelt to brace her limbs she was able to stand he was afraid to bring any force to bear on her arms or shoulders because of her ribs and instead took her hands but it wasnt enough to help her climb her feet stumbled in the snow as he pulled her upward and she cried out again from the pain even that induced the road might as well be on the moon he thought casting a despairing glance in the direction of his headlamps with nothing and no one to help them hamish carrying on a running argument in his mind urged him to hurry in the end he had to wrap his arms around the woman and almost walk her like a child leaning on its fathers legs and body her shoes on the toes of his boots it was like dealing with a puppet no will of its own yet its very awkwardness seeming to defy the puppet master at every step the effort exhausted both of them she bit her lip until the blood flowed a dark line running down her chin and fought not to cry out but her legs were stiff with cold and it was almost an act of will on both their parts to climb to the road again once he got her there in the light from the headlamps he released her for a moment to see if she could stand on her own she nearly crumpled and then managed to hold herself erect swaying he went to the motorcar found the thermos of tea and brought her a steaming cup and had to hold it to her lips because her hands trembled too badly to keep it there she took the first sip as if it had burned her jerking her head away even though the tea was far from scalding then she managed to swallow a little and the sweet liquid ran through her with lifegiving warmth not enough to stop her from shaking but enough to bring her back to her senses and her pain he took the empty cup from her replaced it on the thermos and set it back in the floor of the car under his feet fumbling in the rear without looking in the direction where hamish always seemed to be sitting he could feel the fringe of his rug and he set that in his seat as well going back for the woman he asked can you walk as far as the car but she was looking back down into the darkness my horsewe must do somethingi see him there im afraid the horse is dead oha pity she went with him docilely then and with his help was able to lift herself into the high seat her own rug was damp with snow but he left it around her and added his to cover her hamish said shes lost more warmth than she can make it was true rutledge gave her a little more of the tea and finally with great difficulty got her into his arms and himself into the passengers seat she lay against his chest quivering and he could see the tears of pain running down her face i must get you somewhere with a fire i dont know how far that will be but first weve got to make some headway in warming you up it took another ten minutes to stop the most violent shivers and then she seemed to fall asleep against him he woke her urging her to fight the cold more tea and then he set her back where she belonged and took off the brake we cant wait any longer talk to me he commanded i dont care what you say nonsense if you like verse songs but talk concentrate on that not the pain i never knew it could hurt so to breathe she said finally i can only yes i understand and thats all right go on he said again i cant feel my feet theyll be fine as soon as we find help do you know this part of the country is there a farmhouse near here ii cant remember he took one hand from the wheel and gripped hers where they were clenched under the blanket they were still cold her leather gloves wet through take off your gloves and if you can bear it tuck your hands under your arms she did as she was told cradling her body that helps she told him except for my ppoor feet she had twisted herself in the seat to shut the wind out of her face and ease her ribs he couldnt see her features except as a blur against the dark rug have you come far its foul weather to be on the road ii drove down from carcarlisle he eventually came upon a lane with winddrifted snow blocking it and got out to plow his way up the hill to the porch of a house his shoes thickly encrusted although he knocked with his fist no one came to the door and there were no lamps lit he stepped back and could see no smoke in the chimney empty as a drunkards purse hamish grumbled as rutledge started back down the drive no one at home he told his passenger as he climbed once more behind the wheel well find another soon enough and hoped that he was right chapter five the road rose over a hill and then dipped again off to his left rutledge could see a turning with a fingerpost and a hundred yards beyond that the rough shape of a house the wind carried the heavy scent of woodsmoke to him and he said cheerfully pointing over there youll be by a fire soon the lane came up so quickly he nearly missed itno more than a long rutted bit of track that twisted up to the house and around to the yard he took it carefully testing the snow depth with his wheels but the tires were able to find purchase and he went up the slight rise with less difficulty than hed anticipated the powerful motor coming to his aid a dog began to bark with savage ferocity as rutledge approached the yard behind the house it was not on a chain and ran bounding beside the motorcar lips drawn back in a snarl even after hed come to a full stop it put its forelegs on the motorcar and dared him to step down set your foot within range and hell clamp his teeth on it hamish warned rutledge blew the horn once and then again a lamp flared in an upstairs window the sash went up and a gray head looked out who are you what the hell do you want waking the family like that call off your dog and come down im a policeman and i have a woman here theres been an accident she needs help and she needs it quickly youre no policeman im familiar with inspector rutledge from london ive come north at the request of the chief constable to assist inspector greeley in urskdale and i could call myself the king of siam if i was of a mind to im not opening my door this night to any man without proper authority the dog was growling deep in its throat reflecting his masters truculence rutledge shifted the motorcar into reverse please yourself inspector greeley will be expecting you at urskdale gaol tomorrow at noon it was the voice of command the charge will be obstructing a police officer in the course of his duties the vehicle began to move stay where you are cursing the man withdrew his head and after several minutes he appeared again at the yard door he was in no hurry weighing the situation with the hardheaded prudence of the north rutledge waited impatiently but said nothing nearly certain that there was a shotgun somewhere within easy reach here bieder the farmer at last called to the dog and with a final challenging glance at rutledge the animal turned obediently to his voice pulling on a pair of wellingtons the man came out into the yard a lantern in his hand holding it high he stared from rutledge to the pale face of his passenger an accident you say he demanded suspiciously miss mymycarriagewent offthe road the woman managed her teeth chattering as she raised her head out of the nest of blankets in the lantern light the blood on her lip was a dark and ominous smudge pleasei dont think i can bear the cold much longer llet me sit by your fire for ten minutes and well bbe on our way ah he lowered the lantern and said to rutledge can she walk then her ribs are bruisedpossibly cracked her feet are numb rutledge got out walked around the bonnet and came to the passenger door opening it he said gently it will hurt to help you out can you manage a ghost of a smile appeared on the strained face if theres a fire the farmer a burly man said come along lass id lift you myself but for the ribs now between us well have you in the kitchen in the blink of an eye my wife already has the kettle on his accent was heavy the words gruff but his intentions were kind they got her down and between them on their crossed wrists to the house the dog sniffing at their heels a heavyset woman with a red face cheeks permanently windburned was waiting for them in the kitchen her hands tight together as they came through the door her expression softened she said my sweet lord oh the poor lass bring her here by the stove over the injured womans head she said to rutledge whats happened to her he could see the shadow of alarm in her eyes as if the older woman expected him to say his companion had been attacked by a murderer he explained again as his passenger was urged into a chair her blankets hastily settled around her like cushions she tried to lean back and gasped the farmers wife tightening the sash of her robe about her thick waist said jim take the inspector into the sitting room if you please ill just have a look at this young lady rutledge followed jim into a small sitting room it was already losing the evenings heat but was still comfortable compared to the raw night outside the man lit a lamp on a table settled the chimney in place again and motioned rutledge towards the best chair the fire on the hearth had been banked for morning but the farmer stirred it into life still holding the poker as he turned back to his unexpected guest if youre a policeman youll have something to show me rutledge reached into his coat and withdrew his card the farmer examined it scotland yard is it then youve made rare good time i was in preston when the summons came the farmer set the poker back in its place shaking his head bad business this there was a search party come through early this morning i asked if they needed me as well but they said they had enough men for this part of the valley they hadnt found the boymores the pity he sat heavily in the next chair tonight i put the dog in the barn with the door ajar a precaution belated though it was i dont put much faith in anyone except myself out here theres a shotgun in the entry behind the pantry door if id needed it he held out a rough hand james follet rutledge acknowledged the introduction but couldnt stop himself from casting a glance towards the kitchen dont worry about the lass jim follet told him the nearest medical man is a good twenty mile from here as the crow flies jarvis his name is my marys been doctoring the family and the animals for thirty year or more rutledge believed him in such isolated farms the wife was usually the first and sometimes the only help to be had in an emergency follet stretched his legs out to the hearth where did she go off the road rutledge told him what he could follet said aye i know the place shes not the first to come to grief there even heavy rains make that stretch hazardous well ill have a team up there at first light a pity about the horse i dont know if theres any luggage in the back but if she drove from carlisle therell be a valise of some sort yes ill look follet reached across the table to a pipe rack and began to fill one tamping it carefully before lighting a spill at the hearth and holding it to the tobacco his hair was iron gray his skin toughened by wind and cold the blue eyes squinting through the pipe smoke were sharp rutledge noticed that hed hastily pulled on his trousers and a sweater over his night clothes his braces hanging down to his hips nasty business follet said again referring to the murders not the sort of thing were used to an entire family by god it makes no sense to me did the search party bring any other news as far as i can tell inspector greeley has no idea whos behind these killings to be honest that questions plagued me as well ever since the men left here and for the life of me i cant come up with a satisfactory answer it isnt as if the elcotts were troublesome the sort whod rub people wrong and make enemies and cumminswho keeps the hoteldid tell me it appears nothing was taken that rules out thievery the best i can think of is a chance encountersomeone quietly passing through and elcott spotted him once the man was seen he mightve feared word would get out but even thats farfetched it smacks of something vile to my mindkilling those children how well did you know the family well enough the elcott farm lies across urskwater from us and i doubt ive been there more than a dozen times over the years henrythe fatheri knew best of course wed served on church committees together id meet gerald now and again in urskdale hes the older brother and high fell went to him when henry died good sheep man his wife came here in the third year of the warat the end of i think or first part of a war widow she was with two children late last summer she and elcott had the twins nice enough woman from all reports kept her house well and mary claims she was a good cook a neighbor bought a packet of her sweet cakes at the last church fair and told mary they was particularly fine if the boys dead its a kindness in a manner of speaking whats he to do on his own at that tender age besides i dont see how he could have survived for long out in that storm but what if the boy could identify the killer what if the killer and not the storm had already reached him and left him dead a sixth victim there was nothing to be done tonight hamish reminded him except to make all haste to urskdale but rutledge was considering the homey accolades they were the measuring stick of small towns and villages all across england the state of a mans stock and the state of a womans kitchen told neighbors whether they were dependable or slovenly careful or spendthrift reliable or slack perhaps more so here where isolation made a knowledge of ones neighbors rudimentary to stop next door for a cup of sugar often meant a walk of several miles still a man learned soon enough who was to be trusted and who wasnt had elcott had any suspicion at all that he and his family were in danger or had death simply walked in one evening a knock at a random door hamish who had grown up in another isolated and independent world the highlands of scotland said its a verra simple life this but it can still breed jealousy and murder greed even rutledge fighting the tiredness that was nearly overwhelming him as the fires warmth began to seep into his cold sinews caught himself in time or he would have answered the voice aloud from habit instead he said to the farmer i think we ought to see what mrs follet has found i must be on my way again as soon as possible theres still some distance to travel the lass can remain with us its for the best if shes bad hurt and in your shoes id wait until morning myself but you know your own business he was interrupted by his wife poking her head around the door and saying the ribs dont appear to be broken but theyre badly bruised ive wrapped them as well as i can and shes warmed up a bit if youd want to speak to her sir as the two men got to their feet mrs follet added shyly and theres a cup of tea for you as well if youd like one he followed her down the passage to the kitchen and found the woman hed rescued still huddled by the fire her face was very tired her eyes looking into an abyss as if she had finally realized how close to death shed come her wet clothes had been replaced by a flannel nightgown two sizes too large and the heavy quilt around her served as a robe her carriage blanket and his rug had been draped over chairs by the stove to dry the odor of damp wool strong in the comfortable room a glass of warmed milk stood at her elbow half empty she looked like a child with the thick dark hair that fell down her back in a braid a towel around her shoulders had been used to dry it turning her head as the two men came in she stirred and began to pluck at the edges of the quilt as if in modesty mrs follet handed rutledge a cup of tea and he realized with the first swallow that shed added a little something to it grateful he smiled at her then he nodded to his passenger and asked gently feeling better she said yes but her voice was a polite thread in the quiet room whats your name as if surprised that he didnt know it she answered with more strength janet ashton can you tell us what happened miss ashton that seemed to alarm her and mrs follet put her hand on the quilted shoulder comforting her the horse lost the road mrs follet answered for her and dragged the carriage a bit before it went over and pulled him down he injured himself thrashing about in the shafts and finally was still she couldnt reach him or coax him to his feet miss ashton blinked as if awakening from a dream yes iit was frightening i thought hed crush the carriage but i couldnt get out not at first she shuddered and took a deep breath trying to shut the experience out of her mind then she looked up at rutledge you saidyou did tell me the horse is dead he is rutledge pulled a chair away from the table and sat down close to hers is there someone i can contact your family must be worried about you notheres no one no what brought you out in this weather follet asked on the heels of her faltering answer it was foolishness a lass like you but she buried her face in the quilt refusing to answer mrs follet scolded dont fret her now shes that tired ill take her up to bed jim theres a warm bottle for her feet if youll bring it up in five minutes with a soothing croon that would have comforted a child she coaxed miss ashton across the kitchen and down the passage her arm around the thick wrapping of quilt follet and rutledge watched them go theres my sons bedroom at the head of the stairs if youre agreeable to staying whats left of the night hes over to keswick where hes been courting a lass thank you but i must be on my way rutledge replied with sincere regret theyre expecting me in urskdale he set his cup on the table and went out to the motorcar to bring in the empty thermos as follet refilled it rutledge reconfirmed his directions before stepping out into the cold windy night as the farmhouse door swung to bieder the dog followed the interloper all the way to the motorcar head lowered and a deep growl in his throat to emphasize a personal dislike for strangers id not like to come across you unexpectedly rutledge commented as he put up the crank and went around to the drivers side murderer or no hamish said its a pity the slaughtered family didna have a dog like yon i doubt that it would have mattered if he was armed or the killer might have been known to the animal rutledge turned the motorcar with some difficulty and went back down the farm lane in his own tracks miss ashton was safe he hadnt far to go to his destination hed had a chance to warm himself and the whisky had given him second wind he should have felt revived eager to go on but as the darkness encompassed him isolating him in the bright beams of his headlamps he could feel the mountains again out there like russian wolves beyond the campfires light it was a trick of the mind nothing more but he was thrown back into the war when in the darkness an experienced man could sense movement in the german trenches even when there was no sound nothing to betray the congregation of enemy forces before a surprise attack a s it happened rutledge reached his destination ahead of the dawn but not before hed taken half an hour to backtrack to where hed found the wrecked carriage the policeman in him the training that even war hadnt bluntedin fact had honedmade him thorough earlier the need to safeguard miss ashton had been his only priority now he could examine the scene the wind had died and with it the squalls of snow with his torch in his hand he surveyed the overturned vehicle thinking that by this timeif he hadnt come along the same roadjanet ashton would be dead she was verra lucky hamish agreed and who will rescue us ignoring the jibe rutledge got out to walk warily to the roads edge his policemans brain was registering details even as a part of his mind was picturing himself pinned under the overturned motorcar it would have been he thought an easier way to die than most to fall asleep in the cold night air was this the fate of the missing child it would be ironic indeed if the weather had claimed the murderer as well a fitting justice in a way what appeared to be a valise was just a white hump beyond the place where he had trampled the snow to get janet ashton out of the carriage it had been tossed some feet away by the impact of the carriages tumbling fall and the off wheel he noted was cracked but the horse tangled in its traces was pointing in one direction the vehicle in another it was nearly impossible to judge where miss ashton had been heading when she had skidded wildly off the road and he hadnt thought to ask her she had seemed so vulnerabledetached from the tragedy that had taken place in urskdale but a victim of the same storm the miracle wasnt that someone had found her in time but that she had survived at all it had been a nasty spill satisfied he flicked off the torch hamish said as rutledge returned to the idling motorcar if she had broken her back you couldna ha dragged her up that slope no moving her could have killed her or crippled her terribly releasing the brake rutledge turned the motorcar with great care and continued on his way but hamish responding to the weariness that still dogged rutledge was in a mood to bring up unpleasant subjects he ranged from the case just ended in preston to the letter that had come from scotland the day before rutledge had traveled north this had invited him to spend the christmas holidays with his godfather david trevor and he had answered that the weather was too uncertain to plan on driving north in december it couldna be any worse than this night rutledge argued for a time and then fell silent unwilling to be drawn again hamish was not satisfied and kept probing at what he knew very well was a sore subject it was not david trevor that rutledge was avoiding but his houseguest the woman hamish should have lived to marry chapter six the stars were just visible as rutledge drove into the small community hugging the roadside shops and houses mingled against the backdrop of the lake on the right and in the shadow of high peaks to his left the main thoroughfare was churned into muddy ruts freezing over in the predawn cold and cracking under his wheels another quarter of an hour or so and it would be morning but now the windows were dark the streets empty the door to the police station was shut and no one answered his call as he stepped inside he went back to the idling motorcar and began to search for his lodgings a long ridge loomed above the village its irregular outline smooth in the darkness the rocky slopes shapeless under their white blanket as if concealing their true nature below urskdale was oddly quiet almost withdrawn rutledge soon found the rambling stone house that served as the local hotelhardly more than a private home with rooms to let in the summer for walkers someone had shoveled out the drive after the earlier storm and the new fall was not as deep rutledge made the turning with ease and continued past the side of the house into the yard behind it here there was a motley collection of vehicles between the stable and the shedscarts wagons and one carriageleft helterskelter as if the arriving searchers had been in great haste muddy tracks led from the yard towards the sloping land beyond soon lost in the darkness as rutledge got out of his motorcar a light came on in a ground floor window and someone peered out through the curtains he walked around to the front of the house after some time the door opened and a woman asked youre the man from london wind swirled up in their faces as she looked up at him she was seated in a wheeled invalids chair her lower limbs covered by a soft blue blanket and he found himself thinking that she had been brave to open the door to a stranger when there was a killer at large inspector rutledge sorry to arrive so lateor so early the roads she nodded do come in with accustomed ease she turned her chair and made room for him im elizabeth fraser all the ablebodied men are out searching for the child mrs cummins whose house this is asked me to keep a fire in the kitchen and the kettle on shes not well and ive been staying with her inspector greeley arranged for her to put you up while youre here he stepped past her into the hall and watched as she latched the door behind him before expertly guiding the chair ahead of him through another door that led to the rear of the house he could feel the warmth as he followed her down a passage as if a stove was beckoning him or was his mind dazed with exhaustion holding another door for her he found himself in the kitchen it was bright with color the walls a soft cream and the curtains at the windows a faded dark green that complemented the floralpatterned cushions on the chairs around the table a door led to an entry from the yard would you care for a cup of tea she gestured to the kettle on the stove yes please he answered already awash with it but suddenly unwilling to be alone the kitchen was ordinary quiet cozyit had nothing to do with a murdered family or the faces of a jury or the voice of hamish macleod in the rear seat nothing to do with the overwhelming mountains outside or the duty he had come to carry out he wanted only to sit down in one of the chairs and think about the crackle of the fire and the warmth that was spreading through him and the drowsiness that would follow without dreams because the light kept them at bay and the woman in the chair somehow reminded him of olivia marlowe but olivia marlowethe war poet o a manningwas dead buried in cornwall beyond his reach shaking himself awake he began to take off his gloves scarf and coat setting them with his hat on one of the chairs miss fraser was busy with the tea and without getting in her way he stood to one side of the great iron stove absorbing the heat in the cupboard she found a plate of cakes left from tea and said i can make sandwiches if you are hungry thank you no he roused himself to ask regretfully shattering the illusion of peace any news have they found the boy not that ive heard one of the men fell and twisted his knee when he was brought down he said his party had failed to find any signs and there havent been signals from the other search parties each carried a flare elizabeth fraser glanced at the window though the curtain was drawn i cant see how joshthe boycould possibly survive in this weather its been brutaland hes so young barely ten her voice trailed off early storms are often the nastiest rutledge agreed i wonder if the killer counted on that to cover his tracksor if it was a matter of luck his limbs were on fire as circulation returned to them the room felt stifling now and he sat down on the far side of the table from the stove forcing his tired mind to concentrate he said london wasnt able to give me the usual briefing i was in preston when they reached me did you know this familythe elcotts he ought to be in his bedbut he wasnt sure he could stand up again not all that well she smiled her face lighting with it up here there isnt what youd describe in london as an active social calendar we see each other at market or at baptisms and weddings often enough at funerals but ive met them a very nice family gerald hasshe stopped and bit her lip had a sizeable sheep farm hed inherited from his father she set the pot of tea beside rutledge and then brought him a fresh cup he had noticed that everything was to hand rather than on high shelves it appeared the kitchen had been designed for her go on he urged gerald ran the sheep himselfexcept during the war years when his brother paul managed the farm for him then gerald received a medical discharge and came home to take it up again but while he was in hospital near london he met grace robinson a widow with two small childrenthe missing boy and a little girl they fell in love and were married only as it turned out she wasnt a widow her husband had survived in a german camp and came home to find his family gone and no way to trace them rutledge observed since she had remarried exactly so it was the armys fault not his or graces his name had been confused with another mans robinson is common enough i expect it wasnt really easy at the front to keep up with who was captured or wounded and who had died rutledge remembered the thousands of dead hamish among them stacked like logs rank with the stench of blood and rotting flesh and others blown to bits listed simply as missing i expect it wasnt he answered simply she sighed at any rate they were married gerald and grace with twins on the way by the wars end and then robinson reappeared out of the blue it was a shock for grace she hadnt seen her husband since christmas of and even the boy josh hardly remembered him and yetthere he was a dilemma of major proportions rutledge agreed how was it resolved he took one of the cakes and bit into it rich with egg and sugar and butter it reminded him of boyhood treats not the austere cooking of wartime and postwar when many commodities were hard to come by amicably surprisingly enough i expect a divorce was quietly arranged because gerald and grace were as quietly remarried before the birth of the twins robinson gave his blessing or so i was told the war had changed him he said and he didnt know how to begin again it was rather sad this wasnt the first marriage that had come apart with the long separation of the war some couples made do with what they had especially when there were children and others lived in silent wretchedness enduring what they couldnt afford to change socially or financially hamish said its as well ye didna marry your jean but id ha given much to ha wed fiona it was a frequent source of contention between the two menhow shallow jeans love had been while fiona had remained faithful to hamish even after his death rutledge still envied hamish that depth of love hurrying past that hurdle too tired to argue with the voice in his head rutledge said where does this robinson live now near london poor man someone will have to break the news to him im glad it isnt my lot and urskdale did the village take these events in stride miss fraser replied thoughtfully it was a nine days wonder of course the whole affair gossip flew like smoke and afterward everyone settled down again into the old way of thinking grace iswas a lovely person and we liked her well enough as herself her words ran together and then faded rutledge set his cup down with great care aware that he was losing his battle with sleep i think he said slowly that if i dont see my bed very soon youll have to step over me to prepare breakfast he had meant it lightly but was all at once reminded that miss fraser sat in a wheeled chair and was not likely to step over anyone silently swearing at himself he said abruptly im sorry she smiled again dont be id rather everyone forgot that i dont walk pity is far worse than simple acceptance he believed her he wanted no pity for his shell shock nor reminders that he had failed himself and his men dr fleming had been rightit was better to fight through it on his own whatever the toll standing he reached clumsily for his coat and gloves and watched his hat roll across the floor like an oddly shaped football retrieving it he said if youll tell me where i shall be sleepingi wouldnt want to walk in on mrs cummins go down the passage again and through the second door on your right it leads to rooms that are kept ready for guests yours is at the end a hot water bottle is over there by the hearth wrapped in a towel she added pointing id recommend it the house can be quite cold in the early morning ill see that you have warm water for shaving i can fetch it myself if you leave the kettle on the stove you must be as tired as i am watching for my arrival fair enough well then good night inspector i hope tomorrow brings news that josh is safe if anyone comes ill wake you at once good night and thank you his luggage was in the car and he retrieved that before making his way to his room it was thankfully commodious and his windows looked out on the distant lake but miss fraser was right it felt like ice and the sheets were cold enough for greenlanders he thought when he finally got into bed the hot water bottle a welcome bit of warmth made it possible to slip into quiet sleep lulled by the wind off the fells brushing the corners of the house dreams came after first light the candle guttered and the room still dark with the long winter nights rutledge awoke with a start the image of a frozen child lying deep in the snow still with him when he opened his eyes chapter seven there was still no news in the morning inspector greeley sent a man to the hotel he arrived just as rutledge had come down to the kitchen shaking snow off his shoes and his coat he strode through the yard door his nose was cherry red and he nodded as he walked to the stove and held out his hands to the warmth god its miserable out there he said without preamble and ive lived here all my life i wont shake hands sirthe fingers will surely fall off constable ward mr greeley sends his apologies for not coming in person and asked me to report that theres been no change and with all respect sir hed as soon not have you searching on your own and getting lost i can appreciate that rutledge answered but ive walked here from time to time it isnt the same in winter sir when you cant see the landmarks the constable was a thickset man with graying hair and a square face instead mr greeley has arranged for all the search parties to report to you here he doesnt want them trampling the yard at the elcott farm and this hotel is as near middle ground as you can find and a good deal more comfortable than the station any sign of the boy any idea of the direction he may have taken sadly no sir ward glanced around the room as if worried about being overheard he cant have survived someone will find whats left of him come the spring and the killer any news there ward shifted as if the admission made him uncomfortable were no closer to him than we were yesterday have you a map i need a better sense of where i am yes sir a fairly good one as it happens all the farms are shown and the elevation with the names of landmarks else the map sometimes liestracks are not always where theyre marked you mustnt count on them he reached in his coat pocket and pulled out a folded square of paper spreading it out on the kitchen table and weighting it with the salt and pepper the sugar bowl and the empty cream pitcher were here he said one thick finger pointing to the line of houses along the road and this is the elcott farm he moved his hand to indicate an isolated square some miles away as the crow flies it isnt all that far but see the terrain has to be taken into account theres no straight line anywhere even when the road curves around the lake its still the shorter route rutledge standing leaned over the map shoulder to shoulder with ward he traced the unmade road hed followed coming in noting how it skirted the head of the lake and then came straight into the village passing through to end somewhere near the bottom of urskwater blocked by the rising shoulder to the south that was notched at the top doublehead was neatly printed above it a vast expanse in which to search for one small boy or a murderer but in such a storm how far could either have got as in wasdale the road didnt circle the lake here urskwater was long and narrow running east and west but on a tilt that put the head of the lake to the northeast pointing towards skiddaw the highest peak in england there appeared to be marshes along the shore opposite urskdale and craggy cliffs rose at the head soaring like an eagles lair they were marked the claws how do you get to the other side of urskwater at the southern end therere tracks if you know where to look for them ward broke off as the door opened and miss fraser rolled herself into the room good morning constable inspector she looked as if she hadnt slept well but her spirits were high ward turning beet red almost bowed to her good morning miss i hope i didnt wake you come clumping in at this hour no i was already awake if you see her husband will you tell him that mrs cummins is showing a little improvement it will set his mind at peace and youll stay for breakfast before you go yes miss ill be happy to do both his eyes followed her as she rolled the chair around the table and began to prepare breakfast there was a doglike devotion on his face looking from ward to miss fraser rutledge noted that she was an attractive woman her hair so pale it was almost silvery and her eyes very blue the color of a deep sea under sunlight there was scandinavian blood he thought here in the north but hers wasnt a westmorland accent a thick porridge had been steaming on the back of the stove and as she lifted down bowls and handed them to the constable she said to rutledge pointing to a painted china pitcher on the table if you wouldthe milk is just through there a neighbor has already seen to our cow and her own he nodded and walked through the door shed indicated in the narrow stone room that kept milk and butter cool in the summer and warmer than the outside in winter a large white pitcher stood on the middle shelf miss fraser was dipping the porridge into the bowls and ward was setting spoons and cups on the table for her rutledge said i made tea when i came down it should be ready he filled the smaller vessel that was still holding down a corner of wards map and then returned the foamy milk to the pantry yes thats fine thank you she said handing him a bowl to set on the table as he came back if youre making up a tray for mrs cummins ward said diffidently id be glad to take it in for you miss would you constable ill prepare it when weve finished here rutledge added sugar and butter to his porridge and then the milk while miss fraser made toast for them there was damson preserves for it ward set to with an appetite it was excellent porridge creamy and hot they talked about the unexpected storms the scope of the search the various directions it had taken but skirted any mention of the farm where the bodies had been found or the fate of the child lost in the cold and dark when ward took the tray to mrs cummins rutledge helped miss fraser clear away the dishes if mrs cummins isnt well he began thinking it would be better to find other accommodations shedrinks elizabeth fraser told him not to put too fine a point on it she began to drink while harry was in france and couldnt stop when he came safely home the murders have upset her quite badlywell all of us come to that but any excuse i suppose would have done she grimaced i dont mean to sound coldhearted but harry needs her help to run the hotel and instead she frightens people away if they dont make any money in the summer what are the cumminses to do the rest of the year she began to dip the dishes into hot soapy water it would be a kindness if you stayed inspector then i shall ward returned shes got a little appetite this morning she says thats good news elizabeth answered bracingly as soon as i finish here ill look in on her and let you confer in peace you mustnt leave on our account miss and you know a good bit about this valley ward told her it would be just as well if mr rutledge here had someone who could keep him abreast of which parties send messages he bent over the map again continuing to point out landmarks sometimes sketching in the rough lanes that led to various farms correcting the lines on the map rutledge made an effort to commit the constables points of reference to memory the truth was he would much have preferred going out on his own starting at the elcott farm surely there would be something there to tell him which way josh robinson had fled but greeley was right it was treacherous on unfamiliar mountainous terrain where weather could be unpredictable landmarks were half hidden in snow and daylight was short there was no guarantee he would be any more successful than the local people and he could well become another problem for the already exhausted search parties hamish retorted as yon lassie last night discovered to her misfortune will you show me the follet farm rutledge asked ward remembering janet ashton ward glanced at him know them do you sir as ward located the square on the map that represented the farm rutledge briefly explained there was a carriage accident near there last night wards pencil stopped moving and he asked quickly not our murderer by any chance a woman i left her with the follets bruised ribs ah maryll see to her then his pencil began to move again a good sheep man jim follet ward went on echoing follets comment about gerald elcott and in fact thats how the doctor can pinpoint the time of death sir gerald elcott brought his animals in before the storm but he hadnt fed the cow or horses after that he was either dead or in no case to see to them rutledge calculated four days dead now at the outside the elcotts i understand they were shot revolver large caliber whoever it was just stood there and cut them down one at a time paul elcott who discovered the carnage didnt look for the boy but inspector greeley did and sergeant miller no sign of him in the house or the outbuildings we cant be sure how long the lad has been out in the weatherwhether he managed to hide until he saw it was safe to move or took off straightaway he paused and glanced up at rutledge my guess is the boy wasnt at home he came back and ran straight into the murderer he didnt stand a chance sir and the body hidden likely enough to keep us searching while that devil made good his escape id like to see the farm straightaway rutledge commented but ward shook his head mr greeley wishes to take you there himself sir and rutledge was bound by courtesy not to argue what about enemies anyone who might have wanted the elcotts dead ive tried not to consider that sir wards voice had turned cold its not pleasant searching through ones acquaintance to see who might be guilty of a monstrous cruelty all the same weve got to address the possibility that hes local there cant have been many outsiders in urskdale not this time of year true enough still whos to say one wasnt keen on being noticed but he hadnt counted on the storm had he ward answered stubbornly has london looked to see if a lunatic escaped from an asylum or a prison what were the elcotts to him if he was desperate and needed sanctuary for a bit somewhere to stay until the weather had passed hamish reminded rutledge that the farmer follet had made a similar comment or perhaps he used the storm to his own advantage ward met his eyes squarely shall i leave the map sir i shant need it myself it might be more useful to you inspector greeley said i should ask leave it if you can spare it and ward was gone brusquely thanking miss fraser for his breakfast and pulling on the heavy boots hed left by the yard door chapter eight after a moment rutledge opened the outside door again and walked out into the snow the small back garden was pretty in a pale light that filtered through the clouds the humps and arcs of last years vegetables were etched in white now a magical landscape in miniature this was not agricultural country the season was brief the ground stony root crops did poorly but a few hardy varieties such as cabbages and whatever else could be coaxed into growing in the shelter provided by the house survived long enough to be harvested the well and then a stable led the eye to the barn that stood at the end of the yard a stone feeding trough ran along one side of a large pen a shed next to it an outbuilding provided cover for a farm cart and a carriage beyond a patch of raspberries and gooseberries barebranched now a track made its way out into an open field looking up rutledge could see the faint outline of the fell behind the inn a long slope that climbed to a ridge and ran humpbacked in both directions shadows carved rocky defiles and boulders tricked the eye with deceptive smoothness where loose scree or crevices lay waiting for the unsuspecting foot and then changed shape again as the clouds thinned presenting a different face entirely except for the wind there was only silence now that he could see the open sky rutledge found the mountains less oppressive than they had been last night but there was still that uncomfortable sense of being shut off a sense of claustrophobia theyre treacherous the fells miss fraser said at his back startling him thats probably their attraction and wordsworth of course with his belief that pristine nature holds secrets civilized people have lost i dont think he tried to make a living herehe never saw how hard life can be for those who do its harsh country demanding and it seldom offers a second chance i wonder sometimes if their roots didnt run so deep here holding them back whether people in these valleys wouldnt rather live in kent or somerset or essex if there was any choice at all her voice was sad he turned to see her in her chair shawl over her hair against the cold air looking out at the long run of fell faintly outlined against the gray sky when he said nothing she went on that child must have been terrified i cant help but agree with constable ward that the killer had better luck finding him and disposing of him that awful night thats why the search parties have come up emptyhanded how can a tenyearold boy outrun a grown man i want to hopeand dare not it would be too cruel to have hope dashed is there any other way out of the valley from the elcott farm theres a track farther to the south that runs over the mountains and is said to meet a road coming up from the coast sheep were driven to market that way a long time ago or so some of the older men claim i doubt if many people outside urskdale know how to find it she looked up at him her blue eyes troubled do you suppose hewhoever he isescaped that way its possible im sure inspector greeley sent a party in that direction to look for traces of him but what would bring a man over such rough terrain to kill and then vanish again there would be easier opportunities along the coast a lunatic youll never find him if he got out of urskdale and that brings up the question of whether or not hellcome back whether hes finishedsatisfiedor still has other business here well find him he told her it may take time but we will you neednt worry but hamish was not as certain rutledge could feel the resistance in his mind a comforting lie they could hear a raven high on the ridge the deep call echoing elizabeth fraser tilted her head to listen as if following up on an earlier thought she said this is such an isolated valley sometimes i find it very lonely just now i find it very frightening why do you stay he asked and then wished he could bite back the words for all he knew she was dependent on the cumminses for her keep a companionhousekeeper of sorts to a drunken woman but she smiled i like the stillnesses and the wind i like the wildness everything is pared down to the bone in a place like this its a wonderful antidote for selfpity im as bad as the summer walkers arent i they come only for splendid vistas and noble panoramas i should be telling you that i admire the hardiness of the people or the bracing climate something unselfish and fine she watched him pace restlessly his mind on the search parties you arent used to waiting are you she asked no im afraid it shows hamish still agitating in the back of his mind was keeping him on edge and the wait for greeley was beginning to get on his nerves there must be people he could speak to evidence he could begin to pull together but most of the men of urskdale were out there on the fells beyond his reach and the killer could very well be among them had greeley taken that into account a gust of wind came round the corner of the house and brought with it a shower of snow from the roof over their heads reluctantly miss fraser turned her chair and went back inside after a moment rutledge followed her closing the door and latching it you know these people do you he asked here in urskdale you mean do i know any of them well enough to point my finger at one and call him a murderer she drew her chair to the window where a rare patch of pale early sun was reaching through the clouds she turned her face up to it yes i suppose i do he crossed the room and found a chair near the table taking up one of the napkins there and folding it into triangles and then squares it soothed his restlessness a contrast to her peacefulness how had she learned to accept her disability so tranquilly or was it a hardwon lesson a victory he knew nothing about it may be that there was no outsider i hope i dont know anyone who could kill like that she began pensively a grudge simmers doesnt it it grates and warps a man until he cant bear it any longer short wordsangry looks behind someones backglares in the butcher shop or at the smithy something hes feeling seeps out surely but i cant remember ever seeing anyone show that kind of animosity towards gerald elcott i dont recall anyone telling me that theyd overheard a quarrel or seen indications of bitterness or envy i dont want to think that someone could conceal such anger so well it smacks of madness doesnt it even madmen have reasons for what they do rutledge remembered arthur marlton the prisoner in the dock in preston look at it another way why the elcotts they seemed to have lived a rather ordinary life not very different from a dozen other families surely then suddenly someone sweeps down on them in a fury and destroys them where did this fury come from was it directed at them or were they merely the closest target the elcott family has deep roots here and its true old resentments are nursed kept alive for years her back was still to him ive told you this is a hard land and the people on it are hard as well they dont have much to give except perhaps trust and when thats betrayed they do know how to hate she was interrupted as the kitchen door opened and a man came in his boots in his hand morning miss he said to the woman in the chair before turning to the man at the table youre inspector rutledge then his eyes scanned rutledge from head to foot as if expecting to find a londoner wanting in the sheer physical ability to cope with the demands of the north what he saw seemed to satisfy him and he held out his free hand he was tall and gangling heavily dressed for weather his face burned a deep red from the wind but his gray eyes were clear enough my names henderson ive come from the group thats been searchinghe caught sight of the map on the table and walked over to stab a finger at a locationjust here weve seen nothing spoke to this housethis onethisthis and this theyve not seen nor heard anything suspicious no strangers about and theyre all able to account for their time two days ago three now four and do you believe them its hard not to the whole family tells the same story all the while looking straight at us im a shopkeeper not a policeman and uncomfortable risking my livelihood pushing those who frequent my shop too hard stillid say they were telling the truth he glanced at miss fraser and back again surely what was done leaves scars youd have to read something in a mans eyes if he was guilty of such a crime and what woman would want to lie for him knowing hed slaughtered the children as well which was rutledge thought a perceptive comment and very much what a policeman would be looking for asking questions of potential suspects the eyes were sometimes unable to mask emotions that the muscles of the face could conceal with greater ease youd have to read something in a mans eyes if he was guilty of such a crime but not all killers had a conscience he had learned that too in cornwall h enderson stayed only for a cup of tea and then was off again to be followed within the next hour by three more messengers from the search parties each hovering over the map filled in another area of countryside giving the details of what they had seen and where they had searched and how theyd found the isolated inhabitants in their path rutledge noted each mans information in pencil one of them said wearily its not that we arent doing our best its just that theres too much ground to cover and no certainty whether the boy was there before us or will come there after weve passed the place by we keep an eye to the skyline as we go and to the slopes we find ourselves wondering if the murderer is watching us from behind a boulder or in a fold of the land even at night when we know he must be out there somewhere maybe wanting young josh as much as we do and hoping well lead him to the lad we feel uneasy nobody falls behind in the search party even the stragglers keep up anyone missing rutledge always asked unaccounted for but the answer was always the same not that we can discover so far another man reporting in said people are locking their doors for the first time in years barring them as well out of fear you can be sure we make noise coming into a yardknowing were being watched no one wants a shotgun going off in his face hamish said they ken the terrain they ken the name of every male in the district if hes no a stranger then the killer has to be one of the searchers if no one is missing rutledge followed the various parties along the tracks jotting names beside each square that marked a farm sketching in the sheep folds and ruins mentioned in the reports noting the contours and shape of the valley information hamish reminded him that was useless to a man in a kitchen by the warmth of a stove it was a challenge and rutledge resisted it elizabeth fraser put it best when the men had gone again you arent in london you cant bring london experience to bear up here i know but hamish stirred by rutledges own tension was goading him theres a child somewhere in the cold s ome time later he came to a barrier and his numbed mind tried to identify what his hands and his feet could feel hard icy stones blocking his path beyond them he could see the snow moving like an ocean of heavy flakes but it wasnt the sea it couldnt be a walled pen then for the sheep who wintered on the fells he could smell them now the heavy odor of wet wool the bellwether often took the flock to shelter when weather came down or the owner and his dog would drive them here where huddled together their own warmth would see them through it was easier to find and care for them when they werent scattered about the hillsides nearly invisible humps in the snow with a last spurt of effort he clambered up and over the rough stone wall and slipped in among them snowcovered himself he could crouch here and be safe for a little while until he got his wind back and the snow slacked off if anyone came the sheep would know it before he did the shapes closest to him sneezed in alarm as they caught his scent but they were accustomed to men and when he made no move to drive them out into the wind they accepted his presence sidling back towards him seeking the shelter of the wall on their own account they surrounded him and eventually included him as one of their own unthreatening and in need in this storm their warmth as they pressed around him in the lee of the wall saved his life t he house creaked with the cold wind the rooms were chill and damp rutledge wandered into the little parlor reserved for guests and considered lighting the fire laid ready on the hearth but the kitchen was warmer elizabeth fraser seemed comfortable enough in his company and the men sent to report came by habit to the kitchen door their heavy boots and rough clothes unsuitable for the parlor he stepped into the cold street leaving the front door ajar and looked out at the lake it lay perhaps a quarter of a mile away ice and snow rimmed the edges and the water seemed dark and secretive in the uncertain light from the elcott farm it would be impossible for the boy to reach urskwater but it was a place where a small body could be carried weighted with whatever the killer had to hand how long would it take for a child to float back to the surface where was josh robinson was he a red herring already long dead his body hidden while the killer slipped back into the ordinary life of urskdale or had his murderer disappeared over the fells and into safe havens where no one would think to look what could the boy tell the police if he were found alive an eyewitness or had he come on the scene long after his family had been shot and simply lost his way in the snow trying to find help it was easy to make assumptions but there would be no answers until josh robinson was found terrible questions remained would there be other killings what had set a man on the road to such destruction what had been done to him real or imagined that lighted the dormant fuse of such anger and would he turn on another neighbor next when some small slight or uncertainty began to haunt him again or was he simply a man with a secret to be protected at any cost had gerald elcott stumbled onto something too vile to be overlooked the storm might have given even a reluctant killer the perfect excuse to be absentthe perfect timing for murder ill just go and have a look at the sheep before its any worse out there but that would mean someone reasonably close by within reach of the elcott farm it might even be someone who had no need to explain his absences orsomeone who lived alone and was accountable to no one rutledge remembered what elizabeth fraser had told him about the people of urskdale only a few hours before they dont have much to give except perhaps trust and when thats betrayed they do know how to hate whose trust had gerald elcott betrayed what had he done that would drive a man to kill grace elcott and her children as well until he saw that farmhouse kitchen for himself his experience and intuition had nothing to work with except the reactions of others and secondhand knowledge was never to be trusted what was keeping greeley why was he avoiding the yard man he had so urgently sent for in the beginning chapter nine elizabeth fraser had gone to make the beds in the silence of the kitchen rutledge stood over the map hands spread on either side studying what hed been told by the men reporting to him there appeared to be no farms close enough to the elcotts to offer the child safe haven even if josh robinson could have found his way to one of them in heavy snow and darkness and the boy hadnt been born here bred to the tracks and landmarks that his stepfather would have known by heart but that might also mean that the killer wouldnt have stumbled across them either if he had found the elcotts only by chance the first priority of greeleys search parties would have been to reach these farms and make certain all was well all right then where could josh robinson have gone if he was still alive rutledge ran a finger across the face of the map in fact urskdale itself was closer if one came over the shoulder of the ridge so why hadnt the boy tried to reach the village his uncle paul elcott was here no that wasnt quite true elcott wasnt an uncle by blood if josh robinson didnt know elcott well enough then why not the rector or his schoolmaster even inspector greeley or constable ward or the sergeantwhat was his name miller or had the child been cut off from the village and forced to strike out into the darkness without knowing where he was heading there was another possibility rutledge turned to stare out the window josh might have been terrified of coming to the village afraid he would run into the murderer here it would mean that someone hamish objected it doesna signify he didna have the time yes in spite of all their hopes the boy must be dead rutledge bent over the map again perhaps the question now was where a body could be concealed but why hide it why not leave it in plain sight to show that the killer had wiped the slate clean lost in thought he didnt hear the door from the passage open the womans voice startled him good morning her hair was crimped and straggling and her clothes seemed to have been made for another woman thinner and younger she cast a glance around the room with an air of vague confusion as if uncertain if this was where she ought to be he straightened looking up into drained eyes a pale blue that seemed to be painted in place under paler lashes good morning ermrs cummins im inspector rutledge thank you for putting me up while im here in urskdale it was kind of you it was my husband decided that she replied but im glad youre here it isnt safe for two women to be in a house alone i told my husband as much before he left i told him if he didnt worry about me he should worry about elizabeth shes helpless after a moment she added in a whisper he killed the babies too you know this murderer im afraid its true he began but let his voice trail away for she appeared to have forgotten him unable to settle she walked to the sideboard her hands busy folding a pile of freshly ironed serviettes lying there when shed finished she stood staring at them as if unable to think where they ought to go now hamish remarked it isna any wonder she needs a minder the lass in the invalid chair canna have an easy time of it rutledge had seen other women like her driven to despair by fear and long months of uncertainty they had taken comfort in the bottle and more than one man had come to him to beg for compassionate leave when a wife or fiancee had been taken up as a common drunk unaware that she was the subject of this silent exchange mrs cummins smiled distractedly at him is there anything you need inspector would you like some tea her attention was drawn back to the serviettes she picked them up put them in a drawer and then took them out again finally she simply smoothed them once or twice and forgot them ive been well taken care of mrs cummins thank you you might bring in more coal she said walking unsteadily across to the window thats difficult for elizabeth ill be happy to see to it he promised he cursed himself for not thinking of offering my room is never warm there must be something wrong with the chimneys flue it cant be drawing well she fretted clutching her shawl across her body as if needing something to hold to this used to be a fine hotel before the war i dont know whats to become of it now or us im sure rutledge said gently that the climbers and walkers will return next summer i grew up in london but my grandfather could find his way blindfolded over most of cumberland and half of westmorland he told me more than once he could tell by the smell of the ground where he was like the sheep he said if he ever lost his sight he could find his way about without it we had an old dog who was just the same you could set her down anywhere and shed know her way home a gift rutledge agreed they say sheep are stupid but they arent the silence between them lengthened any word of the child she asked finally her voice trembling on the last word have they found the little robinson boy yet no im afraid not but several of the search parties have yet to report she continued to stand by the window as if the wintry scene drew her i pray for him every night thats kind rutledge began her eyes flicked back to him does anyone hear prayers do you think really hear them im sure someone does he answered ohi can see the long backour ridge she exclaimed suddenly the clouds have lifted and then with agitation she begged lookthere do you think that dark spot up thereover to the left by the knobdo you think that might be him rutledge came to stand behind her picking up the faint smell of whisky lavishly overlaid with rose water there was nothing where she was pointing except for a shallow depression that the sun had not found yet shadows play tricks rutledge told her moving on to the pump for a glass of water the boy cant have traveled this far no probably not she turned losing her animation and walked to the passage doorway you wont forget about the coal will you no but she was gone a ghost in her own house flitting between awareness and stupor a pity hamish was saying and then the soft voice floated down the passage as the door swung closed what if hes hunting for the child too what if he finds him first i cant sleep for thinking about it i t was barely ten minutes later that inspector greeley came striding into the kitchen from the front of the house his voice carrying answering elizabeth fraser somewhere behind him there were dark shadows under his eyes and his chin was patchy with missed beard as if hed shaved quickly without a mirror lines of strain bracketed his mouth aging him im sorry he said extending his hand as he introduced himself that i wasnt here earlier i snatched a few hours rest this morning you look as if you could use more rutledge answered sympathetically a number of your men reported in when they could ive noted the names and the areas theyve searched no luck im afraid with a nod greeley walked to the map and glanced down at it yes thats what id expected more or less but we had to try you see hard as hell to find your way out there much less hunt for a veritable needle in a haystack i dont know how to handle this any differently he added ive never had to deal with anything like it he pulled out a chair and sat down heavily i see youve more or less set up your headquarters here just as well the chimney at the station hasnt been drawing worth a damn smoked me out again just last week but i should think the parlor would be more comfortable men coming and going here are less likely to disturb mrs cummins in her room and to be honest its the only truly warm part of the house rutledge took the chair across from greeley youve done what id have done he went on the most important task was to locate the boy and to make certain there were no other victims after that to hunt down the killer a boy of ten couldnt survive this long surely greeley rubbed his face with his fingers massaging stiff muscles its hopeless it would depend on his resourcefulness and his knowledge of the land he could have taken shelter somewhere we dont even know how he was dressed greeley said or which direction he took by the time we got to the farm any tracks had been well covered by several inches of snow his and the murderers his eyes veered away from rutledges i suppose you want to see the elcott house the reluctance in his voice was only half concealed i shall have to yes id as soon never set foot in it again i cant close my eyes without seeing them lying there shocking thats the only word to describe it he heaved himself to his feet all right lets get it over with is that your motorcar in the yard well take that its faster the roads are wretched but we can manage let me tell miss fraser that ill be leaving rutledge went down the passage and quietly called her name she was sitting in the small chilly parlor a book in her lap and the door open i heard inspector greeley arrive she told him closing the book i thought perhaps youd like a little privacy heserwere going to be away for a time rutledge said trying to spare her feelings i dont know if ill be here for dinner but dont worry about that ill manage well enough thank you for telling me inspector she smiled and he noticed again how it lighted her face from within from somewhere the thought came olivia marlowe might have looked like this woman elizabeth fraser was saying is there any message youd like for me to give to anyone who needs you just that ill be back as soon as possible and you might note on the map whatever information theyve brought if its urgent inspector greeley can be found at the elcott farm her expression stilled yes ill do that inspector i t was a silent drive rutledge was nearly certain that greeley had nodded off his head down on his chest his hat shadowing his eyes but he could have been lost in thought or preparing himself for what was to come following the map in his head rutledge was able to find the rough road on which the farm stood but after that asked greeley for directions they drove up a muddy lane and into the back of a tall whitewashed stone farmhouse with nothing to set it apart from dozens of its neighbors except for the traffic that had passed in and out of the yard over the past several days churning the snow into black muck hamish said a stalker couldna find the lads tracks in that he was referring to the highland gillies who could follow the red deer over bare rock or so it was said they had hunted snipers in france with equal skill and cunning greeley got out stiffly and stretched his back more rutledge thought to postpone the inevitable than to ease his tired spine then he turned to scan the horizon almost a reflex action looking for any sign of movement or activity but there were no flares no line of men on the heights this way he said finally and rutledge preceded him into the tiny stone entry that led into the kitchen it wasnt he found himself thinking so very different from the one where he had spent most of the morning large square with windows looking out on two sides and a great black cooker in one corner it had been pretty once rosepatterned curtains hung at the windows chintz cushions in a matching style covered the chairs and the cloth on the table had roses embroidered in the center great cabbage roses in cream and pink in stark contrast blood marred everythingthe floor the walls the furnishingsas if flung there by a mad painter no longer a bright red but an ugly black the bodies had been removed but the tracks of men who had carried them out had of necessity marked the splatters of blood with heelprints in different sizes hamish said with feeling it brings back the war rutledge thought the refugees we found in that cellar there were plates of food on the table and covered pots on the stove one glass overturned a stained fork lying on the floor a chair on its side the unexpectedness of the attack witnessed by such insignificant things greeley was explaining as if by rote gerald elcott was there by the cooker from what jarvis told me it took him nearly a minute to die the little girlhazelwas lying by the doorshe died quickly thank god and the twins were close by the table beside their mother she was half draped over them as if to shield them jarvis thinks she saw them shot before she herself died it was ruthlessvenomous rutledge could picture the scramble as the family realized what was about to happen the father too far from the outer door to stop the killingthe little girl racing to reach safety in another room the mother flinging herself towards the infants shouts and screamsthe deafening sound of the revolverand then silence and josh where was josh how many shots were fired as far as we can tell at this stage there were six one in each of the dead and one there in the wall it must have missed the boy as he ran out the door we havent found the revolver weve searched the house top to bottom and the outbuildings our man is still armed wherever he is and the killer stood where here where we are it would give him command of the room an open field of fire no one had disturbed the scene the murderer made no effort to find out if all of them were dead he didnt care paul elcott never approached the victims either i dont think he could bear it greeley broke off and then blurted you know the worst of it i helped sergeant miller carry them out and i think if id had their murderer within reach id have killed him myself he cleared his throat in embarrassment before going on in a steadier voice it seems to me that he came in from the yard and caught them all off guard there was no way to tell if there was any exchange before he began shooting but it must have happened very quickly gerald elcottthe fatherwas shot first before he could put up a fight to save his family that would make sense and it would have been less than two minutes before the killer turned to go after the boy not much of a head start really taking a deep breath he added i have to ask myself if the parents knew why this was happening or if it was as senseless to them whoever it was if he came into the kitchen as we did he must have known the family thats possible but here in the north the kitchen is always the warmest room in winter and we generally go round to the yard door rather than the front of the house i dont think it signifies and a stranger would have come to where the lamp was lit still gerald elcott was standing by the stove that means the son opened the outside door and must have known the killer at least well enough to allow him to step inside otherwise elcott would have been here where we are in the murderers way think about it greeley sighed yes i agree not a stranger then but not necessarily someone you may know rutledge pointed out he recognized the propensity of local police to prefer outsiders not their own brightening greeley said yes thats possible how many members of the family live close enough to call in without notice only geralds brother paul lives here in urskdale grace has a sister who sometimes visits in the summer ive never known her to come in winter we havent been able to reach her but the wires were down for a day and a half and theres the father of the two older children robinson he lives in london any close friends then greeley shrugged anyone from urskdale might stop in and be welcomed he turned away and stumbled out into the air i cant stand the smell in here hamish said its no the smell rutledge barely heard him he stood there in the doorway for a moment longer even without the presence of the victims the force of helplessness and terror lingered like a miasma as heavy as the acrid taint of blood he could sense it and with it something else surely it hadnt been done without an attempt at justification the killing there would have been no satisfaction in that surely only a massacre with a last look at the kitchen he followed greeley out into the cold afternoon t hey walked around to the front of the house where the snow was beaten down by foot traffic it was smooth as glass when we got here greeley was saying and this door was tight shut he opened it and they stepped into a small hall where wet muddy tracks marred the smooth floor rutledge thought grace elcott wouldnt care to have strangers see her floor in this condition the style of the furnishings in the parlor was victorian but the polished wood was a measurement of pride and the small touches a plant on a stand by the window the coal scuttle filled matches upright in a narrow blue vase beside it a collection of picture frames with yellowing photographs of at least two generations and the spotlessly clean chimneys of the lamps indicated that grace elcott was a good wife but what else was she they climbed the stairs to find that the twins shared a room while the boy and girl had their own each was neat as a pin with a wooden chest for the collection of toys and games in the boys room and a small shelf for dolls in the girls clothes were tidily folded in drawers or hung in the wardrobes there was a photograph by hazels bed and judging by the victorian style of dress it had been taken around a young girl stood squarely facing the camera almost as one would face an enemy straight on dressed in a plain white gown her hair pulled back with a ribbon she seemed to resent the photographers intrusion as if she had other things shed rather be doing at her feet lay a tennis racket as if thrown there in anger the little dog half hidden in her skirts looked up at her in adoration unmindful of her mood but rutledge holding the frame could read the stormy face very well grace elcott as a girl the master bedroom boasted a great carved bedstead early victorian with a matching washstand and chest on that was a set of silverplated brushes with glr on the backs mrs elcotts from her first marriage if so it might indicate that her present husband was a tolerant man or that they were too expensive to be replaced easily hamish said he accepted the children of the first marriage perhaps the initials didnt matter or the brushes were kept for the daughter on the dressing table was another photograph rutledge found himself looking down into the faces of the dead a man of middle height fairhaired and exceptionally handsome beside him a woman who smiled with noticeable joy her face tilted her eyes alight there was something about her that suited her namegrace slim and leaning a little towards her husband she appeared to be deeply in love in her arms she held the twins swathed in blankets hardly more than tiny features blinking at the sun barely a month old when the photograph was taken rutledge judged grace elcott had grown from a sulky child into a confident wife and mother a shy girl stood between gerald and grace elcott and geralds hand was on her shoulder as if in reassurance hazel her eyes were looking up into his face next to the woman stood a boy all legs and arms scowling at the camera his chin tucked into his chest as if in protest josh robinson in the background was a church door greeley said to rutledge taken by the rector after the christening mrs elcott was that happy that day my wife remarked on it how happy she was he shrugged his shoulders deeper into his heavy coat as if to shut out the cold and only months later grace elcotts happiness had ended abruptly in a whirlwind of destruction the kitchen was still all too fresh in rutledges mind here in the bedroom graces bedroom the house no longer warmed by fire or laughter or the ordinarily sounds of a familys life he could feel the emptiness and the pervasive silence that would never be filled again it was in a sense far more horrible because in his hand he held the faces of the living family did you know why you became a victim or had his imagination run away with him hamish said there had to be hatred behind such murders rutledge set the photograph down and without comment turned to finish his search the contents of the wardrobe were what hed expected to findmostly daily wear with dark coats for market day and for church one of the hats on the shelf had been worn by mrs elcott the day of the christening with frivolous silk roses still pinned on the brim his sister frances had told him once that a womans choice of hat revealed her mood hamish reminded him of elizabeth frasers words we see each other at market or at christenings and weddings more often at funerals and the same clothes served for each occasion but the hats could define the moment as if mirroring his thoughts greeley said the elcotts were no richer than the rest of us theres never money for frills here in the north still were grateful for what we have and through the war we managed we were used to making do nobody went hungry it was a comment rutledge had heard often enough we managed the hardships of war and the ensuing peace had left many families struggling to survive few of them complained making an effort to cope and rebuild their shattered hopes but there were those who had prospered and for whom there was no looking back hamish said its no money then thats at the back of this killing rutledge before he could stop himself answered aloud theres the land greeley nodded as if the comment had been directed at him we found gerald elcotts will heres how it stood the farm has been in the family for generations theres no one left to inherit now save his brother gerald was generally the one who worked with his father and so henry passed the land to him paul was set up in business as part owner of the licensed house in urskdale of course when gerald was away in france paul came back here to run the sheep the rams head had all but gone under anyway with no one coming of a summer to keep it afloat what does paul elcott do now greeley went back to the head of the stairs saying over his shoulder hes trying to reopen the rams head on his own frankly its an uphill struggle the inspector was eager to get away from the house and it showed rutledge followed greeley back to the motorcar a watery sun was strengthening and the snow was beginning to melt it was slushy underfoot the first sign of thaw as they came around the corner of the house hamish said why did yon brother come out to the farm on tuesday rutledge asked greeley as he cranked the motorcar i expect to see if they needed anything i looked in on two other families myself one an elderly couple and the other with very young children the storm came through in a hurry and there wasnt much warning no time to come into the village for lamp oil or staples there was barely time to bring in the stock greeley stepped into the passengers seat has it occurred to you that paul elcott could have killed his brother and his brothers family shocked greeley simply looked at rutledge as he drove out of the yard paul elcott would inherit the farm rutledge pointed out theres your motive and he must have visited the house often enough any signs of his presence at the murder scene could easily be explained by that fact thats foolishness you didnt see him after hed found them he was sick as a dog in the barn he broke off his eyes on the road a horse and carriage was coming swiftly towards them moving far faster than conditions on the road warranted greeley said his voice rising with excitement there must be news by god they must have found the boy chapter ten rutledge pulled on the brake drawing the motorcar to the side of the rutted verge out of the path of the horse galloping straight at them no thats the doctors carriage greeley declared squinting at the oncoming vehicle gentle god you dont suppose theres been another slaughter he leaned out of the window to shout whats happened the carriage was near enough now to see the man holding the reins he wore a heavy gray coat and his face was half hidden by a hat pulled down tightly against the wind greeley swore thats not jarvis or one of my men its hugh robinson grace elcotts first husband the horse thundered to a stop ten feet short of the motorcar eyes rolling as a slender man with a strained haunted face drew rein my god he began and his voice choked he shook his head wordlessly it must be true as the lathered horse sidled in such close proximity to the vehicle rutledge switched off the motor he and greeley opened their doors and stepped out into the lane mr robinson greeley began i came as soon as i heard robinson was saying as the horse steadied why in gods name didnt anyone contact me in london the blame is mine greeley said with a tiredness in his voice that spoke of something else besides exhaustion weve been out looking for your son all our energies have gone into searching for him id hoped to have i should have been here i should have been out with the searchers robinsons thin face contorted in grief mr robinson greeley began and then found nothing to say rutledge said if youll come with us back to the hotel no i want to go to the house i need to see i dont think its a very good idea rutledge began but robinson stared at him with angry eyes its my family not yours he took up the whip and lashed at the horse sending it flying down the lane greeley flinched as if hed been struck instead and ran after him leaving rutledge to turn the crank and then catch them up robinson was already in the kitchen when greeley reached him leaning against the open door as if poleaxed rutledge was in time to hear robinson mumbling over and over again dear goddear goddear god and then he was outside and bending down by the cellar stairs vomiting as if all the contents of his stomach were being forced out by the horrors hed just seen greeley looked across at rutledge pleading for understanding hamish was saying i wouldna be in his shoes rutledge said with some authority mr robinson im from scotland yard robinson fumbled for a handkerchief to wipe his mouth he stopped to stare up at the man from london his eyes dazed when did they summon you robinson asked i was already in the north rutledge replied im sorry to hear that inspector greeley failed to contact you straightaway but we were already two days late hunting for josh and time was against us robinson leaned back against the side of the house looking up at the sun i was bringing gifts for the holidaysi was coming to bring gifts greeley said to rutledge he did come about this time last year i had forgotten rutledge said how did you get here by rail as i always do and then i borrowed a mount from the smith to ride the rest of the way dr jarvis overtook me outside urskdale he wanted me to come to his housebut i couldnt waitand he gave me the loan of his carriage my horse was not as fresh as his he straightened wheres josh why havent you found my son weve done all we canall thats humanly possible im afraid prospects arent the best greeley dug the toe of his heavy boot into the trampled snow by the back door the searchers havent given up robinson began to pace in his agitation i want to know who did this i want to know now do you understand me were no less eager than you are to apprehend the bastard greeley told him stung inspector rutledge intervened if youll take the doctors carriage back to him ill drive mr robinson to the hotel i want to see them robinson said steadfastly i want to see grace and my daughter and in the end there was nothing to be done but to let him have his way w hile inspector greeley took robinson to the makeshift mortuary to inspect the bodies of his dead rutledge drove back to urskdale with only hamish for company hamish was saying its no very wise to view the corpses no but then i dont know him well enough to judge whats best for some men for some men it could harden their resolve to mete out their own justice w hen he reached the inn rutledge reported to miss fraser that there would be another guest i dont know how he can bear such a loss she said with compassion i wish we had better news for him but the search parties im to tell you have found no one theyre to try again tomorrow at first light but they need to rest mr cummins is so weary hes staying with his men over at the ederby farm that was far down the valley just before the lake turned and you hamish reminded rutledge as miss fraser wheeled herself down the passage havena wet your shoes out on the fells rutledge went into the kitchen to stand by the window watching the early darkness rise up the face of the ridge like a curtain it would be a miracle to find a lone child in such an expanse of empty landscape the valley small as it was was still a vast area to comb and time had surely run out for josh robinson even if every farmer scoured his own acres it would take days to cover them properly there wasnt even a certainty that the boy would turn up in the spring his small bones would be carried off by ravens and foxes leaving nothing to mark how or where he died yet it was not something any man found easy to do to walk away from a child in need greeley would have to make the decision to halt the search and rutledge didnt envy him hamish said it doesna sit well in the aftermath of a shelling or in the carnage of an attack men went missing dead lying wounded in no mans land or captured rutledge had always done his best to bring back his wounded young scots not so many years older than the missing boy and yet already men it had felt like a betrayal to post them as lost as if he could have done more should have he shook off the darkness that came creeping out of the past to waylay him this was not his battle it was hugh robinsons elizabeth fraser had wheeled into the room behind him and as he looked up he realized from the odors wafting to him from the cooker that dinner was already well under way turning to her he smiled ruefully im sorry i promised to bring in coal you still may if you will one of the searchers helped me earlier and he followed her directions as to where to find the scuttles needing filling and then took them out into the yard where the cellar door led down into the bowels of the house shoveling coal from the bin into each he found the physical effort released some of the tension that had built up at the elcott farm on his last trip the stars were pushing their way through thinning clouds and he looked up at them his breath coming in white puffs hamish said jarring him yere reduced to carrying coal like a dustman ignoring him rutledge walked past the barn and into the field beyond then began to climb the slope of the fell that rose in the darkness like a hunched figure out of some wild mythology the snow giving light back to the stars seemed more sinister in the darkness as if holding secrets within its white mantle and there was nothing to show him a path to follow although in summer when he had come to the lake country with his father there had always been tracks clear on the ground where thousands of feetman and beasthad preceded him worn ground giving up its secrets easily in some places holding to them tightly in others but the snow obliterated even the clearest signs offering silence and mystery instead and it was no use trying to read what the snow shrouded it would be too easy to find oneself in a place where retreat was as dangerous as going on but he had always believed in knowing his enemy and these fells were his in more ways than one professionally they foiled him hiding what he needed to know personally they threatened him as if intent on sending him out of the valley before his work was done he climbed another fifty feet and then fifty more looking back at the winding street of houses and the lights in the inn the plain stone church at the far end of the village and at the head of urskwater the great bulge of the claws black against the sky rutledge could see the paper map come to life where a light faintly twinkled he could name the farm traveling in his minds eye the track that led there he scanned the heights for a telltale bobbing line of lanterns traversing a slope but there was nothing either too great a distance lay between them or the searchers were asleep in a house or barn dead to everything but the needs of their weary bodies like it or not it was time to call a halt to the search if josh robinson had survived this long without shelter it would be a miracle exposure would quickly finish what exhaustion had begun if the murderer had also failed to find him then the boy missing would be in as great a danger as the boy found and in the custody of the police and what would he do then this killer of children it would be ironic if the weather that had doomed the boy had also doomed his murderer two bodies to find in the spring but all the reports claimed that no one else was missing where had the killer gone to ground or had he come here by chance below him a carriage was turning into the inns yard he could see the side lamps gleaming in the darkness and then the light from the kitchen door as someone opened it rutledge began to walk quickly back the way he had come his feet slipping once or twice as his boots pressed into the icy crust pausing only to pick up the last coal scuttle he turned towards the kitchen door and instead of opening it he looked through the window at the lighted scene inside a middleaged man was there speaking to elizabeth fraser and at his side was a whitefaced hugh robinson his hands gripping a chairs back as if desperate for its support then the men followed elizabeth through the door to the passage and disappeared rutledge stepped into the empty kitchen setting the scuttle by the stove and stood there warming his cold hands listening to the sounds of the house faint voices doors opening and closing steps coming this way the middleaged man returned and looked up at rutledge with some surprise shall i fetch miss fraser or mrs cummins rutledge introduced himself and the other man said in his turn jarvis local doctor he shook his head i tried to persuade robinson not to viewbut hes a stubborn man in the end i think he regretted it i had to give him some of my hoarded whiskey before he fell on his face the doctor was clearly irritated his hands moving restlessly around the brim of his black hat i shouldnt think it was easy for either of you rutledge commented no jarvis pulled the chair out and sat i gather the searchers have come up emptyhanded he indicated the map and turned it towards him so far reports havent been promising i cant think where the boy could have got to jarvis sighed as he leaned over the map and with one finger traced several routes from the death scene out into the hilly ground that surrounded it theres nothing in any direction for miles a sheep pen here rutledge said leaning across the table and what appears to be a ruin here yes thats the old braithewaite farmhouse long since fallen into ruin my wifes grandfather knew the family but they had all died by her fathers time you should have seen the stonework on that house a marvel of construction a lost art my fatherinlaw took me there to point it out couldnt have been comfortable to live in up at that elevation but they were hardy norse stock and never seemed to mind either the isolation or the cold the old grandmother could weave blankets thick as your finger doublesided they were my wifes mother had one of them as i remember a wedding gift you know the people around here better than i do rutledge said any thoughts on who might have killed the elcotts or why i heal people when i can i dont judge them jarvis said bluntly why should it be someone local its a place to begin rutledge responded mildly i was under the impression that gerald elcott was shot where he stood by the stove he wasnt afraid of the intruder in his wifes kitchen or he would have been at the door between his family and the unexpected danger jarviss face changed i hadnt considered that i knew gerald he could handle himself even before he went into the army youre absolutely right hed have fought i understood he was invalided out of the army yes a kidney shot up doctors removed it but he got on well enough afterward and hed have protected his family at any cost to himself tell me about paul elcott theres not much to tell hed broken his left leg when he was younga severe compound fracture that left the bone weakand the army wouldnt take him he spent the war years working with local farms trying to increase crop yield and he ran the elcott place as well by the time gerald was invalided home paul had lost thirty pounds the man was a walking skeleton and robinson did he bear a grudge against elcott for taking away his wife for one thing gerald hardly took away hugh robinsons wife the army declared the man missing then dead a year before gerald met grace and when he came home robinson himself believed that it was for the best to bow out he hadnt seen his wife in years and she was carrying geralds twins by that time i hardly think that twelve months later he would slaughter all of them in some sudden craving for revenge certainly the man i saw an hour ago looking at his little daughters body was distraught the door opened and elizabeth entered i think he might be able to sleep a little mr robinson if not i told him he could find us here jarvis rising nodded god knows the powder i gave him ought to do the trick but after the whiskey i was afraid to try anything stronger he tells me inspector greeley never sent him word she began i think greeley had hoped to offer him a little good news that his son was safe jarvis sighed it was an unfortunate oversight i wonder if the inspector has remembered graces sister she went on jarvis stared at her i expect he hasnt ill find him and remind him the roads are better someone should be able to reach keswick rutledge said taking out his watch and glancing at the time if shes in keswick ill bring her here myself it will be faster i think hes speaking of reaching the telephone there elizabeth fraser replied as i remember miss ashton lives in carlisle now chapter eleven rutledge stood rooted to the floor his mind flying janet ashton he asked already knowing the answer yes thats right elizabeth replied and picking up a nuance in his voice added quickly what is it shes not in carlisle now or she wasnt last night shes here at the follet farm i wasnt aware that she knew them the follets elizabeth said she hasnt been to urskdale all that often she didnt know them at least not before last night rutledge turned to jarvis i think you ought to come with me doctor miss ashton met with an accident on the road i need your opinion as to whether or not shes fit to travel my bag is in the carriage but i should think tomorrow morning rutledge was already pulling on his coat i made it through last night i can find my way back he answered its a police decision and ive already made it you can sleep in the motorcar if you wish they were gone in the next five minutes heading out of urskdale and taking in reverse the route rutledge had followed coming in the verges were even harder to see now than in the snow churned and rutted as the unmade road was hamish was already reliving the accident but rutledge was too busy keeping his eyes on the swath of his headlamps to satisfy jarviss curiosity about janet ashton except to say she was on the road when the storm caught her the carriage went off at a steep incline and turned over killing the horse and leaving her stranded what in gods name was she doing out in such a storm i doubt weve seen its match since before the century turned id like very much to know the answer myself rutledge told him grimly what about your family is there someone i can contact they must be worried about you shed shaken her head notheres no one no we assumed follet and i he went on as he passed under the claws no more than a looming shape far above him that she was what she appeared to bea traveler injured and in need of help the fingerposts had been blown about by the wind it was hard to follow the road she might have been heading for buttermere and missed her turn she wouldna be lost if shes been to urskdale before hamish pointed out fingerpost or no jarvis said if she was found close by the follet house she had a long way to go before reaching her sisters farm it might have saved her life dont you see that her trip was held up by the storm if shed been there sunday shed have been killed along with the others hamish said if elcott was expecting his sisterinlaw hed no ha thought twice when a carriage turned into his yard it would explain why josh had opened the door after a moment rutledge asked the doctor if the boy had survived the shooting that sunday night he was out in the worst of the storm could you be wrong about the timing of the murders could they have happened on monday night when he might have had a better chance im not wrong about the timing id take my oath on that as for his chances people dont often walk off cliffs when the weather comes down here unexpectedly but thats not to say there arent placesnasty oneswhere a fall results in serious injury even broken bones he could have hurt himself badly enough that he died of exposure where he lay my wife thinks he made it to the village and is hiding out in someones barn or cellar but weve searched too thoroughly for that to be true a patient told me today that we ought to drag urskwaterthat the killer drowned josh to conceal the body on the other hand there are old shielings about that could offer some shelter from the cold the question then becomes how did josh know where to find them why didnt the search parties see signs that hed been there and if he did manage to survive why hasnt he shown himself to one of the search parties what sort of boy is he troublesome not surprising he knew damn all about sheep and i expect his lack of enthusiasm for them tested geralds patience more than once grace had her hands full with the house and the twins and her only help was little hazel grace might not have been sympathetic with him if he failed to do his share about the place jarvis grimaced as the tires hit a rut and the motorcar bounced heavily children learn their duty early on few of my patients see a great age life is inherently hard here and they begin as soon as they can walk doing what theyre told from feeding the chickens to minding the baby or the bedridden old granny but josh came from london and a different life look ive been up for nearly forty hours straight and ive answered your questions now im making the most of this opportunity to sleep without feeling guilty jarvis buried his chin deeper into the collar of his coat and was soon snoring lightly rutledge drove steadily covering ground that tonight was not as slick nor as dangerous as it had been only twentyfour hours ago the snow softer the visibility better but it was not any easier and as the temperatures fell with darkness the slush on the road would refreeze the sooner there the sooner safely back at urskdale jarvis rousing unexpectedly asked did the follets know about the murders yes a search party had come through that morning theyd put their dog in the barn a first line of defense i damned near lost my foot to it jarvis chuckled follet is a careful man the sheepdogs i can tell you are good workers faithful and dependable and possessed of amazing endurance his face sobered one or two will turn rogue and kill sheep its like a madness setting in on them without warning i daresay very like our murderer m aggie ingerson struggled through the snow in the wake of her dog it turned its head several times to be certain she was still following once she called out damn it sybil ive only got two legs to your four and one of thems half dead already but sybil went bounding on ahead intent on her destination maggie her breath coming in ragged gasps shouted at the dog again i cant make it i tell you dead sheep or no dead sheep all the same she did make it reaching the pen some thirty minutes later her face flushed with exertion her graying fair hair straggling out of the mans hat she wore sybil was already standing there with tongue lolling and tail beating a tattoo in the air as if in welcome the sheep pen was no more than a rough stone wall built up on three sides the fourth open to allow the animals to go and come at will as her mistress leaned heavily against the nearest bit of snowencrusted wall chest heaving as she fought to catch her breath sybil dived into the banked flock of sheep sending them flying in every direction maggie swore with masculine proficiency but the sheep were circling now and where they had been clustered was something that was distinctly unsheeplike sybil stood over it the dogs face all but exclaimed her excitement at finding her treasure still in place she sniffed at it looking for enough bare skin to lick maggie stared finally driven by curiosity she turned and moved into the pen talking softly to the sheep as she made her way through them their sneezes marked her progress by the far wall where the sheep had huddled against the wind lay the curled figure of a human being a child it was wearing a heavy coat that was quickly turning white as snow blew in on it and it looked to be dead maggie knelt beside it her face intent unsure whether or not to touch it and then her gloved hands clumsily moving inside the coat she felt the steady rise and ebb of the thin chest the child appeared to have fallen into the deep sleep of sheer exhaustion satisfied she got to her feet with some difficulty as if the cold air where the warmth of the sheep had been roused the boy he moaned a little in his sleep maggie stared down at him it was no use trying to wake him ill have to go back for the bloody sled she said aloud to sybil why in gods name didnt you tell me i needed the bloody sled sybil grinning from ear to ear faced her mistress and waited the main task had been accomplished as far as she was concerned any further details were of no interest maggie making her way back through the sheep shooed them towards the wall again and then at the entrance to the pen stopped stock still and looked around her there was only fell and cloudy sky and snow nothing that would explain the way the hair had suddenly risen on the back of her neck the dog seemed oblivious to danger and the sheep were already settling themselves again but maggie felt an inexplicable urgency she turned swifly in haste to reach the small farmyard and the shed where her sled was stored m ore than an hour later maggie made it back pushing the sheep aside and staring down again at the unwanted bundle of clothes that had been deposited in her sheep pen as far as she could tell it hadnt stirred with a string of curses to mark the effort it took she rolled the child onto the sled and began to strap it down then she pulled the rope taut and started for the gate of the pen sybil nosing the sleeping bundle gave up and trotted beside her mistress her head looking up for the usual well done that came with carrying out a task but maggie her back into the rope paid no heed the silent lump on the wooden deck was heavier than it had any right to be and the damned sled with a mind of its own wanted to go faster than she herself could manage she thought if i were still young enough id get on it and ride it down but that was foolishness and she knew it the fell were not a sledding hill and the hidden rocks that scarred its face would damage runners in short order tumbling both rescued and rescuer into the snow no doubt breaking her bad leg all over again with increasing exhaustion dogging her steps maggie worked at bringing the sled down and as the familiar outline of the farm rose up out of the darkness taking the shape of roof and lighted windows and barn almost under her feet she was nearly at the end of her strength once she sat in the snow and wept from tiredness and the dog licked her face chilling her hot cheeks as the air cooled the wetness her knee throbbed from so much effort but in the end she got herself and the boy to the yard door of the house it wasnt until she was beginning to untie the knotted ropes that had held the boy in place on the journey down to the farm that he woke up and began to scream the highpitched cries of a trapped and terrified animal chapter twelve rutledge found the follets dog in no kinder mood than it had been on his previous visit and blew the motorcars horn to raise the inhabitants of the house the doctor stretching himself said are they deaf then no just careful clouds were banking over the fells closing him in as surely as shutting a gate he shook off the feeling and spoke to the dog jarvis nodded follet always was a careful man follet eventually came to the door lantern in hand called off the dog and greeted rutledge guardedly then with considerable warmth he added dr jarvis now youre a welcomed sight mary was just saying she wished you was here to have a look at miss ashtons ribs how is the patient the doctor got stiffly out of his seat and shielded his eyes from the glare of the lantern follet lowered it well enough according to mary he led his visitors inside and called to his wife from the kitchen she came down the passage after a moment smiling at dr jarvis with a dip of her headpupil to masterand shyly asked how one of his other patients was they exchanged news while follet said in a subdued voice to rutledge i was unprepared for the damage to miss ashtons carriage my guess is it rolled several times after leaving the road the incline just there is steep enough to do serious harm yes i was of the same opinion rutledge paused made certain that the two practitioners were still busy and added i couldnt even be sure which direction it was traveling in follet answered id not like to place my hand on a bible myself and then he broke off as if aware that the reference to sworn testimony was not perhaps the proper comparison to make in jest to a policeman any news of the boy or the killer none i regret to say the search parties are still out there mary turned to greet rutledge and then she led them down the passage to the small sitting room where janet ashton sat by the fire swathed in blankets cushions and pillows she winced as she tried to turn her head to see who her visitors were miss ashton im glad to see youre feeling a little better rutledge said though privately he thought she looked tired and still in considerable pain ive had a very fine nurse she told him smiling up at her hostess yes indeed youve had that how are you managing today my dear jarvis asked setting down his bag and coming to take her hand im sorry to find you in such straits very bruised she told him wryly and quite tender her glance slid on to rutledge as if half expecting him to argue with her it was kind of the inspector to bring you to me yes he explained thered been a nasty accident whatever took you out in such a storm foolishness id call it now lets have a look at you and see what mary has done for those ribs follet and rutledge left the patient with her nurse and the doctor and returned to the kitchen follet offered rutledge a chair and sat down himself asking about the condition of roads beyond the farm rutledge gave him a brief account and then asked you found the valise i thought i had seen one when i drove back to the scene but i didnt relish going after it on my own and in the dark wiser not to as it was i had to use tackle to keep myself from going arse over teakettle and her purse was there as well follet reached across the table and set the salt and pepper in a line then looked up at rutledge with uneasiness in his face there was a revolver under the seat he went on after a moment i didnt know what to make of it where is it now have you returned it to miss ashton lord no ive set it in the barn in the tackle box nor has she asked for it i saw no harm in bringing in the valise and purse and she was grateful to have them a woman traveling alone rutledge suggested would be glad of some protection at a guess its a service revolver follet continued not one of them german weapons theyre a nasty piece of work german pistols were much sought after as souvenirs yes id heard that said but ive never seen one wicked like their makers in my book i never held with the germans the farmer leaned back in his chair truth is ive been unsettled since the search party brought the news of what happened at the elcott farm it might have been any one of ussenseless killings such as thatand they say lunatics look no different from the rest of us how is a man to tell whats outside his door did you know when i brought her to your house that this woman was grace elcotts sister lord god of course we didnt i doubt id ever heard her called anything but mrs elcotts sister she came to visit from time to time mainly in the summer but i never met her faceto face mary passed her once coming out of the tea shop on market day and was told later who she was and mrs follet didnt remember her face follet grinned only the hat she was wearing it was new and london made and the fact that she was dark what does gossip have to say about her i was asking mary that same question last night after wed gone up to bed she said shed heard that the sister stood up with grace elcott when first she married geraldthat was in hampshirebut not the second time there was some talk about that of course but the ceremony was private and the sister was still living in london she came later for the lyingin does miss ashton know what happened to her family rutledge phrased the question carefully she was saying to mary as we were helping her up the stairs to her room that she wished there was some way she could send word to her sister graceshe didnt want her to be worrying grace who i asked thinking she was speaking of the satterthwaites over to bell farmtheir eldest is marrying a girl from carlisle and for all i knew thats who miss ashton was speaking of being from carlisle now herself when she said her sister was grace elcott the hair stood straight up on the back of my neck it was as if wed been dragged into the midst of something fearful and how was i to go about breaking such news and yet to rutledge she had denied having any family at all go on meanwhile my mary was telling her not to fret saying that with the storm theyd have expected her to take shelter where she could he glanced over his shoulder as if afraid of being overheard i asked mary later why shed held her tongue she said she was afraid that if miss ashton was told shed want to go straight to the elcott farm and how was we to do that i ask you in that weather with a murderer stalking about and if nothing could be done it seemed kinder to leave miss ashton in the dark so to speak until she could be got to urskdale he seemed embarrassed by his decision but prepared to stand by it what was we to do he asked actually id rather you went on saying nothing until dr jarvis tells me shes fit to travel follet looked relieved not that ive seen nor heard anything against the sister you understand but we dont know why the elcotts died do we and id not be drawn into whatever it is if i can help it i cant blame you rutledge agreed and then after a moment at hamishs prodding questioned theres something else i think that you havent told me follet tugged at his earlobe were all at sixes and sevens you start reading omens in the milk pail after a time still when i got up at my usual hour that next morning i tried to be quiet as i went past miss ashtons door so as not to wake her i had my shoes in my hand and was bent on where i put my feet when i heard weeping on the other side of her door and then her voice saying over and over again why oh god why it was as if she knew something was wrong his eyes were worried there was the accident the wrecked carriage and the dead horse you dont weep like that over a dead horse follet said scornfully or a broken carriage wheel even if both belonged to someone else something was keeping her awake that hurt her far more than those cracked ribs the only time i ever heard mary cry like that was when our youngest died inconsolable beyond any help or comfort d r jarvis came into the kitchen at that moment and told rutledge id prefer to leave miss ashton here a day or two longer shes badly bruised but nothing appears to be broken im happy to say is she fit for travel rutledge asked will it do her any harm i doubt it will harm her jarvis answered but continued rest will do those ribs a world of good and in my opinion she needs a little time to grieve as well he saw the expression on rutledges face and added i was surprised that no one had told her about her sister when she commented that she wouldnt be much use to grace and the twins for the rest of the week i felt i was obligated to say something you cant have intended to keep it from her i would have preferred to choose my own time and place rutledge returned curtly what did she say she wept rutledge stood up already on his way to the sitting room jarvis called after him something about mary follet being the best person to comfort her but rutledge ignored him the sitting room door was open and he found mrs follet kneeling on the carpet her arms around the sobbing woman in the chair the farmers wife looked up as he came in and got stiffly to her feet the doctor told her mrs follet said yes miss ashton after a moment janet ashton lifted a red and tearstreaked face to him he walked into the room pulled a chair closer to hers and said gently this isnt the time to ask you questions i understand that but time is what neither of us have to spare we must find your nephew josh may have seen the murderer something flared in her eyes a flame of emotion that galvanized her josh is dead paul would see to that he wouldnt leave the work half finished pauls your killer i swear to you he is jealous selfcentered cruel he did it r utledge stared at the tearravaged face janet ashton was a very attractive woman but the twisted anger in her voice and the savagery with which she denounced paul elcott made him flinch mary just at his shoulder gasped in horror i dont understand rutledge began no no one ever did i tried to warn geraldi told him over and over again her hands over her eyes she broke down completely unable to speak rutledge glanced at mary follet had she said anything about this before i came into the room no oh no i cant believe her voice faded and she reached out a hand in comfort there there my dear looking back at rutledge she explained its the shock she cant mean what shes saying it was several minutes before rutledge could stem the flow of tears and make miss ashton face him again he said gently youve just made very serious accusations i was bringing a weapon to my sister she cried she was the only one who believed me and its too late im too late you must explain what youre talking about rutledge said why did you think paul elcott might want to harm his family why were you bringing a weapon the farm she said fiercely it was all about that horrid farm paul was the heir dont you see if anything happened to gerald grace wouldnt be able to run sheep on her own she wasnt bred to it josh couldnt inherit even if hed wanted to he isnt an elcott gerald never adopted himgrace wanted him to keep his fathers name it was always understood that paul then the twins were born and circumstances changed janet ashton shook her head they were his dont you see geralds own flesh and blood and paul was beside himself hamish was reminding him he was the first to find the bodies after no one came to the house for two days and therefore any clues that might point his way would be explainedit was an old ploy one that sometimes succeeded rutledge leaned back in his chair janet ashton as far as he could tell believed what she was saying and there was the revolver to back up her account or to explain it away hamish countered how did you come by the weapon he asked janet ashton mary follet glanced at him in surprise he thought her husband hasnt told her a friend of mine in the war hed been gassed and gave it to me just before he died can you prove that why should i have to do any such thing ive just told you the police are thorough he said quietly we have to be ill need the name of the friend and the date of his death she turned away from him id like to be alone please ive still noti cant really believe taking a fresh handkerchief from mary follet she buried her face in it as if hiding from his questions rutledge rose nodding to mrs follet he found himself thinking that janet ashton had come a long way to hear tragic news and sometimes at that first emotional blow people said things they later wished they hadnt would this woman feel the same way tomorrow or truth can come tumbling out hamish reminded him as rutledge walked back to the kitchen he agreed murder brought to the surface odd antagonisms and old scores wanting settling jarvis said hearing his footstep in the passage how is she quite upset as you might imagine he went to the window and looked out the dog was lying in the barn door watchful as ever how well do you know her dr jarvis she was there for graces lyingin i found her to be efficient and levelheaded which is what i needed at the time the twins were small and required good care and there were the other children to think about i could see that grace was fond of her and indeed gerald depended on her the children got on well with her then the little girl hazel was miss ashtons goddaughter and kept a photograph by her bed ive seen it while treating her for frequent sore throats miss ashton was younger when the photograph was taken hardly more than hazels age it wasnt a flattering likeness i wondered a time or two why it hadnt been replaced hazel told me it was a favorite because of the dog bones seems miss ashton made up stories about him at bedtime rutledge himself had seen that photographand hadnt made the connection with janet ashton jarvis was right the sulky child was nothing at all like the grown woman and josh he was at an age where womens apron strings had begun to pall before he could go on follet interjected how is elcott taking the news cant be easy for him paul the doctor asked i had to sedate him he wasnt in any shape to join the searchers more of a hindrance than a help in my book rutledge turned from the window is miss ashton well enough to accompany us back to urskdale in my opinion the cold and the rough ride will not do her any good on the other hand it shouldnt do her any harm if her ribs are sound thats true but rutledge nodded to follet i think well relieve you of your unexpected guest if youll escort me to the barn i have some business there dr jarvis if youd be kind enough to ask mrs follet to prepare miss ashton for the journey id rather not take the responsibility nor would i doctor but we need to be expeditious if were to find our murderer he picked up hat and gloves from the table and prepared to leave shut off from the wind the cavernous barn was not as cold as rutledge had expected bieder sniffed his heels suspiciously as he followed follet into the dim interior sizeable and sturdily built the structure was at least as old as follet himself and probably well into a generation before that looking up rutledge said you had a fine builder that was my father and his we have to build solidly up here the barn before this was probably well over a hundred years old he led the way to the tack room where harness and tackle were kept and opened a wooden box that stood under a shelf digging inside he brought up a revolver and held it out gingerly to rutledge he found that the weapon was fully loaded and he emptied it dropping the cartridges in one pocket and sniffing the pistol before adding it to the other pocket id not mention this to your wife after weve gone he told follet it would upset her i think to know that it had been here im not likely to do that follet agreed im just glad to be rid of it he didnt add that he could be just as happy to see the back of its owner in the yard dr jarvis was already setting miss ashtons valise in the boot and mrs follet had nearly filled the back of the motorcar with pillows and blankets rutledge shivered thinking of hamish on the long drive back to urskdale it would be crowded and neither hamish nor rutledge himself took pleasure from that they managed to get miss ashton into the vehicle without causing undue pain mrs follet fussing around them rutledge retrieved his own rug and added it to the array of blankets a warmed stone was wrapped in towels and set at miss ashtons feet and within half an hour of the time hed made the decision to carry her with him rutledge set out on the road she hadnt been willing at first to come with him you cant ask me to walk into that house she had said in rising panic no i wont go with you you cant force meill stay here or go back to carlisle if someone will drive me she turned to mrs follet im sorry if im such a burden my dear of course youre not a burden mary follet cast a pleading glance at her husband jim tell her ill be happy to ask my wife dr jarvis was saying but even rutledge could hear the doubt in his voice i intend for miss ashton to stay at the hotel rutledge had said cutting across their voices dr jarvis can treat her there and she can help me with my inquiries miss ashton stared at him the hotel she said yes thats all right then but something in her expression made him wonder what had really changed her mind a fleeting moment of speculationa conscious awareness of opportunity it was there and then gone so quickly he couldnt decipher it now she sat in the back of the motorcar in what appeared to be grieving silence it made conversation between the two men stiff and uneasy after a time jarvis drifted into sleep again and from the rear of the motorcar an almost disembodied voice husky and muffled by blankets asked will you arrest elcott tonight no so far i have only your word that he was a threat to his brothers family ill have to look into that and see if i can find evidence that bears it out and whenifwe find the boy hell be my chief witness if he was there she said the words drifting away on the wind t he boy slept for hours sybil curled beside the bed kept watch and maggie herself fell asleep by the kitchen fire dozing heavily in the chair that had been her fathers she woke once with a start thinking shed heard something outside in the snow then was satisfied when the dog didnt bark her eyes closed again she had set the redhandled ax by her chair where she could put her hand to it quickly it could take a chickens head off in one blow and chop through wood thick as her wrist perfectly weighted it was all she needed in the way of protection her father had taught her to use it and had once said lightly your norse ancestors could cleave a mans skull with an ax right through the helmet its a fearsome weapon respect it and she always had a s rutledge neared the inn he began to wonder if he had overstepped his own welcome by bringing another guest for miss fraser to cope with certainly mrs cummins was not up to caring for and catering to a house full of people now besides himself there were robinson and janet ashton where he could make do with whatever meals were set before him he doubted that they would hamish reminded him it isna a weekend in the country but miss fraser took her new guest in stride and said ive a room thats quiet and i think miss ashton will prefer it just give me a few minutes to see that all is as it should be dr jarvis after asking if there had been any summons during his absence helped bring miss ashton in from the motorcar and settle her in her room as soon as he could politely excuse himself he disappeared in the direction of his own house miss fraser said to his departing back his wife will be glad to see him she never bargained for murder disrupting their quiet life where is robinson rutledge asked in his room he slept a little i think and missed his tea ive a ham in the pot and if you could bring in some cabbages from the cold cellar and the small bag of potatoes ill have dinner in an hour rutledge not only brought in cabbages and potatoes but helped scrub and prepare them it was a surprisingly companionable domestic scene miss fraser busy about her tasks while he shirtsleeves rolled to the elbows followed her instructions as he worked he asked what do you know about paul elcott a quiet man he was engaged to be married before the war but the girl ran away with a soldier she met in keswick i dont think he mourned her it was an understood thing without great passion on either side she smiled over her shoulder we dont see great passion in this part of the world most everyone has known each other since they were children life isnt easy and no one expects it to be a man provides and a wife keeps house and brings up the children and so they drift into old age considering theyve had a happy marriage use the other pan if you will for those potatoes ill need that one for steaming the apples oh i forgot to ask you to bring them up as well rutledge went out again to find them and came back with them small and shriveled by comparison with those in the south and with a stronger flavor he cored and cut them up and passed the bowl to her the passage door opened and robinson came in his hair awry from sleeping hard his eyes bleary he said i dont know what the doctor gave me but ive had better hangovers he sat down heavily at the table as if his body had run out of energy and buried his head in his hands christ rutledge said feeling his way its been a rough day robinson nodded i thought many times during the war that i was going to die i never expected my family would die instead have you heard any word about josh the search parties are sleeping elizabeth fraser answered him theyll start out again at first light from wherever they are now greeley wouldnt let me join one of them he turned to rutledge as if he were to blame i dont understand why i cant search for my own son youre needed here rutledge answered finishing the last of the apples when josh is found the news will be brought directly to the hotel i cant just sit here and wait there must be something i can do even peeling apples for gods sake elizabeth fraser glanced at rutledge and then said you could bring in more coal if you dont mind with two extra bedrooms to heat it would be nice not to have to worry about running out he turned and said staring at her chair what happened it was asked simply as if acknowledging that something had rutledge began to object but she set aside the knife she was using to slice the potatoes and answered calmly it was an injury just before the war i tripped on my skirts actually and nearly went headlong under a train theres nothing wrong with my spine i just cant manage to walk with a smile she added ive quite grown used to it but hamish said shes verra young to accept yon patiently and she doesna say where she fell she doesna have a northern accent it was true she didnt even though she spoke of the fell country as if she had known it all her life and was happy to live here rutledge said shifting the subject we brought mrs elcotts sister to the hotel an hour ago shed made it as far as she could in the storm and stopped with a family some miles from here janet robinson asked as if she hadnt crossed his mind good goddoes she know i mean i suppose youve told her dr jarvis did shes sleeping now shell be sick with grief she and grace were close shes living in carlisle now she says did you know that lord no i thoughtbut i havent kept up with her i suppose i should have he made a face there are many things i should have done i should have seen more of my son and my daughter your relationship with elcott was comfortable robinson looked away i dont know that it was comfortable he was married to my wife but that wasnt his fault it was the bloody armys with an apologetic glance at miss fraser he added sorry but i cant blame grace or gerald we got on well enough for me to visit the children from time to time and try to close the gap of being away so long theyd believed i was dead and it was something of a shock to find i wasnt hazel had no idea who i was when i came in the door grace handled it well but hazel and josh areweretoo young yet to travel to london on their own to visit me he shook his head remembering they wont come at all not now i hadnt gotten around to thinking that far ahead when you came back to england how did you know where to find them rutledge asked curious how did you learn they were living here in urskdale i made straight for the house where wed lived there was another family there i thought id made some mistake but the woman had corresponded with grace over some problem with the drains and so she had her direction i didnt know what to think then what to write to her i finally got up the nerve to come north it was as much of a shock to grace as it had been to me iwe managed to settle it amicably there were twins on the way that had to be faced and it was clear she didnt feel the same way about what had beenour marriage and all that i couldnt hold her to the past i wasnt sure i wanted that myself not anymore he broke off and then without realizing it repeated himself we managed to settle it amicably abruptly getting up from the table he walked quickly out of the room leaving silence behind miss fraser said poor man if only they can find his sonthat will be such a comfort to him but the fells and the precipices and the long cold nights were unforgiving chapter thirteen i n the event only miss fraser and rutledge dined together that night robinson asked for a tray in his room mrs cummins got one out of habit and janet ashton sent word that she didnt feel like eating at all the meal was well cooked miss fraser said to rutledge as she served their plates its odd to know the house is fulland to have no one here but she seemed tired as if she was glad she didnt have to make an effort at polite conversation she had offered to lay a fire in the dining room and make it a proper meal and he had refused to let her go to so much trouble do you do all the heavy work here rutledge asked carving the ham elizabeth fraser smiled heavens no youve met constable ward i think his sister shirley usually cooks and cleans for mrs cummins im merely filling in wards daughterinlaw is expecting her first child this week and shirley is staying with her until she delivers the smile deepened harry cummins suggested that shirley bring her charge here while the men were searching for josh for safety but shirley told him roundly that any murderer who shows his face at greys farm will regret the day he was born she sounds formidable and yet shes the kindest person she gestured towards the hot pad in the center of the table and he set the platter of ham slices there thank you thats everything i think hamish a low murmur in the back of rutledges mind was accusing him of letting down his guard he tried to ignore the voice tell me about london she said as she drew up her chair across from him is it more cheerful now are the shops carrying more goods ive been away so long it was the first time she had indicated where she was from rutledge told her what he could trying to make the city seem better than it was for her sake the war was finished but the peace was gloomy defeated and exhausted i used to go to plays she said before the war and to concerts it was always so exciting waiting for the moment when the music began or the curtain lifted jewels glittering satins and silks and feathers catching the dim light with a flash here or a gleam there the men so handsome in black but the war changed all that everyone in uniform colors more sober and suitable to the long lists of heavy casualties styles gone with the wind of change and even the players and the musicians seemed daunted by it all one of my favorite actors died early in the war and a violinist from the symphony lost an arm and never played again so sad but there was more to the war than that and she smiled as if acknowledging his unspoken thought i know but when change comes you tend to feel the small sacrifices most because theyre more easily borne the great sacrifices you try to shove out of your mind until theres a better time to grieve as if there ever will be in the trenches we wanted to believe that nothing had changedthat what we were fighting for was still there just as wed left it but men would come back from leave and tell us the truth and wed try to absorb it without accepting it i expect we didnt want to as they finished their meal she said tell me honestly if you will who do you think could have done this terrible thing will it turn out to be someone we know someone weve met on the street or dined with or spoken to on the church steps i have thought about it you see and i dont know anyone who could have killed children most particularly not those babies who couldnt tell anyone what theyd witnessed its so senselessso cruel rutledge wasnt ready to tell her about janet ashtons accusations against paul elcott instead he said im the stranger here trying to find pieces of information to fit together trying to look for evidence you must tell me she stared at him in surprise but youre a policeman rutledge smiled that doesnt make me omniscient still we ought to begin by considering people closest to the family could paul elcott have shot his brother shocked she exclaimed of course he couldnt do such a thing and in heavens name why would he even wish to he didnt answer that what about robinson he came home to find his wife and family gone part of another mans life now hardly a good reason to kill them she retorted in distress to win them backthats understandable from what grace said there was very little left of the marriage anyway otherwise she couldnt have fallen in love with gerald which was he thought an innocent view of love and marriage how did they meet grace and gerald he was convalescing in the village outside london where she was living and he seemed to get on with the children long before he met her making little things for them to play with invalids are encouraged to find ways of passing the time and it helps i expect to keep ones hands busy she frowned as if remembering her own recovery after her accident at any rate as i heard the story he was one of a group of soldiers sitting under the trees on the clinics lawn and hed carved a lovely little boat to float in a pail of water which josh adored grace came to see if it was proper for josh to accept such a gift and soon found herself reading to the men every afternoon i gather it wasnt a hasty thoughtless courtship they appeared to be so happy together as if their feelings ran rather deep and would last she lifted her hand as if to make light of her words did she tell you she was happy grace it was something you read in her face whenever gerald stepped into the room the way she turned to greet himthe smile she always had for him i must say i was more than a little envious she gave him a wry smile every young girl dreams of that kind of love grace seemed to have found it all right then lets consider janet ashton was she happy with her sisters decision to remarry and move north grace never discussed her sister with me inspector and you must rememberwhen miss ashton came to visit she went directly to the farm and stayed there we dont have dinner parties and afternoon fetes here in urskdale if she was in a shop with grace of course id make a point of speaking to both of them but these were chance encounters hardly an opportunity for anything more than idle conversation i understand miss ashton wasnt here for her sisters second marriage she slid her serviette back into its ring it isnt pleasant what you do is it asking questions prying into peoples lives better than letting a murderer go free she looked at him i suppose thats true but something in her face made him wonder if she believed it l ate in the night rutledge awoke with a headache and reaching for his dressing gown went to the kitchen for cold water to bathe his face silent on stockinged feet he moved along the passages wondering if his fellow guests were awake or had finally found sleep however fitful the house was quiet around him and he felt at ease in the darkness you canna see through the doors hamish reminded him grief can make a long night the front part of the house was drafty cold air sweeping around his feet rutledge glanced at the front door as he passed but it was firmly latched as he stepped into the passage that led to the kitchen the cold was like a sudden surge ware hamish warned the door into the kitchen was standing ajar and rutledge stopped uncertain whether someone else was there the room was dark but the cold was more intense who had come in without disturbing the household a man making a report would have pounded on the door behind him the short passage seemed alive with an electric tension was there a murderer even now making his way through the house searching for a victim or had he comeand gone rutledge moved forward quietly until he could peer through the narrow crack there was no light at allthe curtains pulled the stove bankedand yet the chair backs were curved silhouettes he shifted his position trying for a better view of the room he could just see the strip of harsh light where the door to the yard stood open to the night nothing moved there was no sound at all but as he watched someone rose to fill the doorway a slim figure standing straight no more than a shimmering silhouette against the snow breath like a wraith blowing into the room with the cold blast of air it was miss fraser standing in the doorway staring up at the fell that rose beyond the yard a great white mass that had no beginning and no end from where rutledge watched the sky blotted out by its shape she took one step and then another clutching at the door frame and then after a long moment she moved back as if defeated slowly subsiding into her chair again with a last look into the snowy shadows of the fell she wheeled herself back far enough to allow the door to be closed rutledge heard the bolt slide home he didnt stay to be found there watching keeping close to the passage wall where he couldnt be seen if miss fraser turned he reached the hall and then without a sound was walking swiftly down the corridor to his room hamish said she isna as crippled as yon chair siggests rutledge answered slowly i dont know was it wishful thinking or the torment of wanting what isnt there aye hamish said its no much of a life for a lassie b reakfast was nearly ready when rutledge came down to the kitchen again but it was mrs cummins standing by the stove busy with a pan of eggs she looked up at her london guest good morning inspector im afraid ive burned the toastbut only a little the teakettle was whistling noisily and he offered to pour hot water into the pot for her relieved she said would you i seem to be all thumbs he made the tea found butter in the pantry off the kitchen brought in the cream and was setting the table when inspector greeley arrived surprised to see mrs cummins he said good morning vera inspector rutledge said any news depends greeley said watching mrs cummins the searchers have been to every farmhouse combed the ruins they knew of looked anywhere a child could hide theyre ready to admit defeat three days and nothing whats your feeling about it the boy is dead he has to be either frozen in the snow or tracked down by the killer it was what we feared from the start mrs cummins set the pan of eggs off the stove humming a little to herself as if greeley had been exchanging views on the weather i hate to quit ive never been one to quit he said pulling out the chair that tea fit to drink just steeped rutledge poured him a cup greeley drank it thirstily come and talk to the men see if you can give them new hope he said after a moment ive run out of words they know the land far better than i do but ill try lets go then well take your motorcar its warming up this morning enough to melt the worst of the ice we can make better time if you drive t he two policemen found the roads either slushy enough to mire the tires or hard enough to make speed dicey greeley swore as they nearly got bogged down in the first drive they turned into but they found a cluster of men in the yard behind the house drinking mugs of tea and talking among themselves the farmer redfaced and weary was gesturing towards the land that rose in the watery sun like a heavy blanket of snow and stone the sky was a hazy blue the men turned at the sound of the motorcar and came to greet inspector greeley then to stare with curiosity at the stranger from london well ive brought no news greeley began raising his voice so that all could hear him but inspector rutledge here is asking us for one more effort another day at least a searching of the mind as well as the terrain trying to think where a lad like that could find sheltera place he might have discovered on his own a small space we as grown men might not think about but a lad could crawl into hamish said hes making the speech for you one of the searchers interrupted greeley weve done that and more its not our failure its the fact that hes not there his eyes were hard redrimmed from lack of sleep and exposure to the cold wind theres stock to be seen to and our own families were so tired were at risk of not seeing the next crevice that will break a leg weve done all we bloody can i know you of all people wouldnt give up tom hester if there was any chance at all but i cant help but think the lads out there and terrified so terrified he wont come out and be found for fear whats hunting him is the killer hell stay in that hole like a wounded animal and its up to us to do the finding another searcher demanded sourly wheres this hiding place then he swept his arm across the landscape weve looked and looked and theres nothing out there the killer found him before we did and it will be spring before the body comes to light if it ever does rutledge listening could sense the feeling of frustration and the exhaustion that depressed these men and he said without raising his voice i believe youve done all you could i disagree with inspector greeley i think the time has come to call off the search greeley turned in dismay the farmer listening behind the men in his yard spoke up how would you know this isnt your country ive walked here in summer rutledge began greeley was staring angry now as if feeling betrayed the farmer grunted summer is it thats as different from winter as the moon is from the sun im as aware of that as you are but if you the people who know this landscape have run out of answers then i must respect your decision there was a furious denial that they had run out of anything the first speaker tom hester said with some heat i tell you weve looked greeley answered so you have the farmer said the weathers broken the light is better well give it one more day there was agreement among those nearest the motorcar in the end they set their mugs on the steps of the farmhouse and began to move off again shoulders bent and heads down but willing after a fashion greeley watched them go damn it rutledge for a time i thought you were stabbing me in the back they had to want to go rutledge answered they couldnt be driven to go it was the cumberland and westmorland temperament greeley had to acknowledge that they turned the motorcar in the muddy yard and went on to the next place where searchers had gathered and the next only the last group refused to start again as one man said you havent been up there nothing could survive that storm much less a lad robinsons age not up there and weve searched every house every barn every sheep pen and every rock i tell you hes not there nor never was and im telling the truth as i see it in the event the man was wrong he had indeed searchedbut he had reckoned without the canny knowledge of a woman who trusted no one and nothing but her own wits chapter fourteen it was late in the morning when the frightened child came bursting out of the room where hed slept and into the kitchen where the fire was already warm enough to take away the nights chill a woman sat at the table her face red from windburn her eyes tired and sunk into their sockets skidding to a halt the child stared at her as though half expecting her to turn into an ogre before his eyes she stared back the dog wandering in to flop down by the stove heaved a sigh as if duty done hungry are you theres porridge on the stove im lame youll have to fetch it for yourself and theres ewes milk in the pitcher its all ive got the boy stood there mute my names maggie its what my father called me i never liked it whats your name he shook his head maggie shrugged as you like but the foods there if youre of a mind to eat his eyes were darting around the room still wide with fright as he backed towards the outer door theres nobody else lives here if thats what youre wondering unless you count seven sheep in the shed yonder i dont have much to say to them nor they to me keeping them alive is all i owe them my father is buried on the hill its what he wanted she went on eating her porridge not looking at him the sheep in the shed got themselves hurt one way and another silly buggers the child seemed to be breathing more regularly as if his heartbeat had settled down but his face was still pale and he was trembling thats sybil the dog she found you in the snow and took a liking to you god knows why you didnt look like much to me when she dragged me up to the hill to where you were he had reached the door and was fumbling for the latch if you want to leave thats your choice but youll eat first and put a coat on your back i told you i was lame and im damned if ill drag your frozen carcass back a second time just because sybil here wants to keep you her gruffness seemed oddly to reassure him after a long moment he sidled to the other side of the table picked up a clean bowl and then edged his way to the stove to stand on tiptoe and dip hot porridge out of the steaming kettle the pitcher of milk was on the table and he poured it without taking his eyes off the woman as if expecting her to spring across the cloth to catch him she handed him a spoon without comment and he backed across the room again to sit close to the dog before beginning to eat like a starving man on the other hand if you wanted to stay on a bit she said conversationally ive got nothing against it but youll not make work for me you hear and youll do what i cant get about to do its only fair if im feeding you he listened but said nothing she was beginning to wonder if he was mute but when he had eaten his porridge and scraped the sides of the bowl he got up and went to the sink pouring water into the bowl and scrubbing at it maggie took that as acceptance of her hospitality that done he came warily to the table and took away her dishes to scrub at them and upend them in the rack satisfied she got to her feet and limped towards a bin by the door heres what ive been feeding the sheep in the shed theres a coat belonged to my father in the room you came from the sheep get a measure each youll have to carry a pail with you with enough to feed all of them id take it as a favor if youd see to them im still done in from last night she turned to find him staring at her injured leg i broke it once its stubborn and wont heal he had the grace to blush well go on theyre as hungry as you were he found the coat shrugged into it and buttoned it snugly although it swallowed him the cuffs well over his hands the boots he found under the coat were twice his size but he laced them up when he came back to the kitchen maggie stared at him thatll never do she moved towards him expecting him to run but he stood his ground still his eyes widened anxiously as she reached out lifted his arms and roughly turned back the cuff on first one and then the other satisfied she stepped back go on then he filled the pail he found inside the bin stuffed the measure in one pocket and then with both hands gripping the handle lugged the heavy container out the door without asking for help the boots slapped at the floor like a clowns he must have found the shed without difficulty for he was back in a quarter of an hour boots caked with snow and his cheeks red from the cold he came scuttling through the door as if afraid that out on the fells in the cloudy morning there was something ominous waiting for him maggie saw him surreptitiously bolt it she had tea waiting hot and sweetened with honey he drank it eagerly and then washed up for both of them after that he went to sit by sybil his hand smoothing her rough coat ever had a dog of your own maggie asked scrubbing at potatoes for the noon meal he shook his head well sybils never had a boy of her own it was not ten minutes later when sybil growled deep in her throat rising to stare at the door the boy dove like a terrified rabbit towards the room he had slept in casting a pleading glance over his shoulder in maggies direction its a neighbor wanting to know if im alive he wont stay she answered quietly and then dragged herself painfully to the door but when she opened the door there was no one outside the yard was empty maggie stared at the tracks gave the matter some thought and then made up her mind she came inside called through the bedroom door to the cowering boy that the neighbors cat had caught herself a rat she keeps the shed free of the wretched things else id take a broom to her r utledge found his fellow guests in the kitchen when he arrived at the small hotel some hours later he had dropped greeley at the police station aware that the inspector was not happy with the lack of results the boy alive witness to murder was one thing the boy dead frozen to death left the investigation to go nowhere it was a daunting prospect and greeley let it be known as he stepped down from the motorcar that he had done what he could ill help however i can everyone will but its up to you now ive run out of opinions and ive asked enough of the people here youd have to be a wizard to settle this business all i can say is i hope you are and with that he disappeared through the station door without inviting rutledge to follow him a n air of gloom hung over the kitchen and the silence could be felt robinson was sitting with his head in his hands as if in the depths of despair janet ashton her face pale with pain and grief stared out the window at the fell behind the house miss fraser was finishing the dishes setting them to drain she looked up as rutledge came through the passage door but didnt ask the question he could read in her eyes he shook his head slightly indicating no news and she went back to the last of the pans rubbing at it industriously as if to keep herself from feeling anything she said there are sandwiches under that tea towel if youre hungry he was and nodded with gratitude hamish sensing the atmosphere said shes glad to see you its no been easy this morning as if she had heard him miss fraser went on mrs cummins has one of her headaches she wont be joining us for the midday meal janet ashton said i saw her on the stairs an hour ago shed been drinking i could smell it yes well elizabeth fraser began trying to smooth over the encounter i expect shes worried about her husband robinson lifted his head out of his hands and said to rutledge hes dead isnt he josh if youre trying to find a way to tell me id rather know straight out we havent found him rutledge answered but yes perhaps its as well to prepare yourself for the worst janet ashton bit her lip and looked down at her hands i know what its like to lie there in the cold praying help will come its a wretched way to die hugh robinson exclaimed dont rutledge sat and reached for the plate of sandwiches the men are still out searching at least theres that i wish i could have brought better news robinson said wearily thats kind of them it cant be easy he took a deep breath what about the person behind these murders have you found any evidenceanything that will help you find him janet ashton asked have you spoken with paul elcott dr jarvis says hes better today if youre going to take him into custody elcott robinson demanded staring from her to rutledge early days for that rutledge answered her but before he could answer robinson janet had turned to him and said perhaps you can persuade the inspector if i cant grace was terrified of paul did she say anything to you about robinson cut across her words his attention on rutledge nobody told me elcott was under suspicion he isnt any more so than anyone else rutledge replied curtly miss fraser turned her chair to face them no i cant believesurely tell me who else would have harmed those poor children janet ashton demanded hes the only one who had a reason to kill the twins helpless babies hardly old enough to know their mothers faceeven a madman would have pitied them spinning to accuse rutledge she said at least tell me why youre protecting him is there something you know that we havent been told robinson said i went out this morning before first light looking for anything a signi thought if josh saw me heard my voice miss fraser protested that wasnt very wise was it if youd been lost a search party would have had to hunt for you and theyre nearly at the end of their strength i couldnt sleep hugh robinson answered bluntly i lay in a warm bed and all i could see was josh frightened not knowing where to turnno one to help him its worse than a nightmare im not sure i want to live with that image for the rest of my life or can if you would only speak to paul elcott janet ashton interrupted ask him if josh was thereif he knows which direction josh took youre wasting precious time time josh cant afford dont you see that her voice was urgent forceful rutledge could see in her face now a similarity to the sulky girl in hazel robinsons framed photograph he got to his feet sandwiches untouched and immediately elizabeth fraser put out a hand to stop him youve been out all morning miss ashtons right he told her ive got to speak to the man better sooner than later can you tell me where to find him he has rooms over the licensed housethe rams headyoull see it just before the church a twostory building with a sign over the door the next one to that goes up to his rooms rutledge thanked her and left janet ashton half rose as if she intended to follow him but elizabeth fraser said quietly no its best if you dont and she sank down again in her chair the expression on her face was hard to read neither of you believe me she said but im right at the end of the day ill be proven right p aul elcott came to the door looking like a man who had spent the last three days drunk as a lord but the reek of alcohol was missing and rutledge realized it must be the sedatives that dr jarvis had given the man who are you elcott asked frowning what do you want inspector rutledge from scotland yard id like to speak to you if i may theyve got the yard here good god greeley never mentioned that nor jarvis he held the door wide and rutledge stepped in paul elcott was wearing trousers that appeared to have been slept in for days and a rumpled shirt to match his feet were bare and he hadnt shaved a dark growth of beard shadowed his features and his hair hung over his eyes im parched dry as a desert he added well step into the kitchen if you dont mind i need something to drink but the fire was out in the stove when they had climbed the stairs to the rooms over the licensed house from the temperature there rutledge suspected the fire hadnt been stoked for days elcott stared at it standing like a man lost as if he had no idea what to do about it rutledge said sit down ill see to it and he set about cleaning the ashes and laying a new fire as he worked he talked to the dazed man in the chair by the table but elcott didnt appear to hear him i cant get that room out of my mind he told rutledge finally i tried but as soon as i shut my eyesjarvis gave me something and it fairly knocked me out he shook his head as if to clear it any news is that why youve come not yet how well did josh know the countryside around the farm where could he have gone josh elcott said as if the name was new to him i expect he knew it well enough boys explore where would he choose to go which direction did he know anyone play with other children in that part of the valley would he have come here to you if he escaped i doubt hed come to me i never liked him i thought gerald was a fool to take on a wife with two children by another man and told him so to his face what did he say to that rutledge turned as he finished washing his hands and drying them on a towel by the sink the fragrance of wood starting to burn filled the room but no heat reached them yet elcott shrugged he didnt seem to be able to focus his mind have you seen the house ive been there yes god you should have been there before miller and jarvis took them away he shivered and it had nothing to do with the cold room how are you managing getting this place back on its feet its not going to happen elcott said harshly ive tried but theres precious little money and no hope of business picking up until late in the spring im worn out with the effort he had the air of a defeated man who had lost the ability to believe in himself or was it assumed will you inherit the farm now your brother and his children are dead elcott looked at him in surprise i hadnt even thought about that it gives you a motive for murder rutledge pointed out mildly he was watching elcotts eyes but they seemed more annoyed than unsettled by his words yes well im sure a hangmans noose would put an early end to that if it were true the other man answered sourly did jarvis tell you miss ashton graces sister is at the hotel if youd like to call on her do you know her well elcotts glance sharpened oh dear god i never thought to send word to her or to robinson it never occurred to me i expect ive jarvis to thank for attending to it or was it inspector greeley she was already on her way here when she had an accident on the road it was dr jarvis who broke the news to her i wonder what went through her mind when he did elcott rubbed his face with his hands she and grace were as different as two sisters could be it always struck me that if they hadnt been related by blood theyd have nothing to say to each other she told me that grace was afraid of you and she believed that you were jealous of her and her family well theres a blood lie paul replied i never liked janet and she never cared much for me the neerdowell brother who needed bucking up to make a man of him shed even told gerald that in her opinion i was malingering that the army would set me straight i never told her it was the armys doctors who turned me down janets the sort of managing woman i never cared for always wanting her own way always seeing what she wished to see but i never expected her to go this far did grace get along well with her grace was blind to her faults but then grace was sweetnatured and saw no wrong in anybody myself i dont know how gerald put up with the woman but he did probably for his wifes sake id wondered a time or two if grace realized janet had had her eye on gerry long before grace met him if anyone was jealous of grace elcott it was her loving sister surprised rutledge said i hadnt heard anything about that no she wouldnt have told you herself would she well shed got to know gerald when he was in hospital in london recovering from surgery she would come to write letters for the wounded or read to them and she fell in love with him you didnt know my brother women liked gerry he had a way with him that attracted them whether he wanted it or not ask elizabeth fraser shes had an eye for him too he did his best to discourage janet and was glad when they shifted him to the convalescent home in hampshire and there quite by accident he met the other sister how did you learn this did your brother tell youor more to the point write to you im not a fool i could see for myself and gerry did write part of the story to me when he was considering proposing to grace he was afraid it might present a problem because of janet but as she was living in london and the doctors were expecting to release him to come home to urskdale he thought it could be worked out do you still have that letter elcott paused staring at him i dont know whether i kept it or not it would be helpful if you could find it rutledge kept his voice neutral what i dont understand is why gerry ever believed that janet was moving to carlisle for her sisters sake particularly after she wouldnt stand up for grace at the second wedding ceremony it was as clear as the nose on your face that shed begin to meddle the first chance she got and shes still doing it damn her i dont know why shes pointing a finger at me she had a better reason for hating gerry than i ever did why didnt she attend the second marriage what do you think if grace was forced to go back to hugh robinson someone would have to console gerry but that wasnt how janet put it of course she said she felt it wasnt rightthat she believed it was her sisters duty to go back to her true husband did your brother tell you that he didnt have to grace was so disappointed you could see it in her expression when i carried the letter to her why else would janet stay away when her sister needed her to help put the best face on what had happened did you stand up with your brother of course i did in my view it was a godgiven excuse to change his mind dropped into his lap but he loved grace the twins were his flesh and blood and there was an end to it i wasnt about to shame him in public he turned aside pulled back into his own misery id give anything to turn back the clock and find out it was nothing but a bad dream that i could make it right again his voice was so low rutledge could barely make out the words i wish id left it to someone else to find them hamish said theres something on his conscience its no giving him any peace paul elcott wouldnt be the first man to have killed in hot blood and regretted it when the passion of the moment had passed as an excuse to linger rutledge made a pot of tea when it had steeped he left paul elcott whether hiding secrets or telling the truth had said all he was going to say chapter fifteen hamish remarked as rutledge made his way back to the inn jealousy sees what it wants to see it was true janet ashton and gerald hugh robinson and grace elcott and what the familys land if geralds twins were killed paul elcott would have clear title to the farm it would be worth his while if murder was his intent to wipe out the entire family but what did janet or hugh have to gain why kill the object of ones love and the answer to that was all too simple love spurned turned easily to hate had inspector greeleys supposition of events in the bloody shambles of the elcott kitchen been wrong had he and inspector greeley seen it backwards from what actually happened had gerald or grace been the last to die as a final punishment but gerald had done nothing to defend his family why theres no proof hamish pointed out how it happened and small chance of finding answers until or unless they managed to find josh robinson but janet ashton had had a revolver in her possession rutledge tried to picture her murdering the elcotts the slim pretty woman hed rescued from the snow didnt seem to be strong enough physically or emotionally to fire shot after shot into childrenhowever managing shed appeared to paul elcott theres the sulky girl in the framed photograph hamish reminded him and you didna ask elcott if he owned a handgun it was true the murder weapon was missing unless rutledge himself had taken charge of it in the barn at the follet farm but there was no wayyetto prove it j anet ashton was waiting in the sitting room where someone had got the fire going her ears must have been attuned to the sound of the front door opening and closing for she was in the passage to meet rutledge as he took off his coat well she demanded what did he have to say for himself he was hardly awake enough to defend himself rutledge answered the doctor had filled him full of sedatives yes well he would tell you that wouldnt he she turned to go back into the sitting room and the pain seemed to come back again as if held at bay by her hope that rutledge would take paul elcott into custody she sat in the chair by the hearth and he could see how pale shed become i wish i could do something besides sit here she said to the room at large rather than to him i wish i could go out and talk to him myself youll stay away from him rutledge ordered do you understand that its my duty to find out whos behind these murders not yours she looked up then and there were tears in her eyes youve never lost anyone have you i mean other than parentsnatural deaths you cant imagine the frustration and the grief and the anger i keep seeing them dead my only familyand its worse because i dont know she was weeping bereft and hurt hamish said to listen to the lassie shes told the truth from the start but paul elcott had just said she was clever and managing i cant tell you they didnt suffer rutledge answered sitting down across from her after the cold of the wind the fire seemed almost too hot to bear but it must have been very quick they didnt respondthey didnt try to defend themselves there was no time was that the truth or did the woman before him know better than he ever could what had taken place in that snug kitchen with the snow piling against the house and the wind whipping it down the chimneys and into drifts against the barn did you love gerald elcott he asked after a moment her face wet with tears stared across at him did paul tell you that he suggested it was possible gerald was my sisters husband what good would it do me to shoot him and if i murdered his family how do you think he would have loved me knowing what id done revenge she laughed shakily revenge makes a cold bed partner inspector rutledge if id loved him id have found a better way to rid myself of grace and then come rushing to help gerald cope josh and hazel were fond of me id have made a place for myself in that house in no time at all and its a short step dont you see from housekeeper to wife when a man needs someone to right his world paul was the only one who had a reason to kill the twins for me those babies would have been a steppingstone but hamish was pointing out that she hadnt directly answered rutledges question yet in a way hadnt she it would be easier to lay her sisters death at janet ashtons door than all five murders and a good barrister could make that part of her defense but twice gerald had chosen grace instead of her sister was that why grace had been the last in that kitchen to die to see what she had brought down on her family by not stepping aside and doing her duty to robinson young hazel and josh had kept their proper fathers name if grace hadnt remarried gerald and instead had returned to robinson the twins would not have borne elcotts name by law they would have been robinsons or been branded illegitimate if hed refused to accept them had that been in her mind when she stayed with gerald to give him heirs to high fell and the children she was carrying a rightful place in their proper world what had motivated grace robinson elcott but there was no way of guessing what had passed through her mind or how much shed known about her sister and gerald elcott all the same as hamish was saying in the reaches of his mind whatever happened at the farm grace elcott was the pivotal factor she had taken the man her sister loved by bearing the twins shed deprived paul elcott of his hopes of inheriting high fell and she had been given the chance of returning to the father of her older children and refused it which brought rutledge back to motive greed jealousy revenge the landthe loverthe wife given the savagery of the attack he would have added one other motive fear yet who had been afraid of the elcotts what did they know that could have threatened anyone r utledge roused greeley from a sound sleep much to the annoyance of his wife but hes hardly closed his eyes cant you let him have a little peace she was a tall woman her face angular and her features well defined dressed in black with a white collar at the throat she reminded rutledge of a strict schoolmistress then youd better come this way she said with a sigh when he insisted i wont have him up and dressing again she led her unwanted guest up a flight of stairs to the third door along a carpeted passage im sorry to intrude on your sleep he told the haggard man in the rumpled bed i need to find someone who can take me out on the fells if i cant manage on my own im capable of following a man who knows what hes doing give me a name or send me someone good god man you must be mad all right then give me an hour s ooner than that a roughlooking bearded man appeared at the kitchen door of the hotel and asked for rutledge elizabeth fraser said hallo drew what brings you out at this hour im to take the policeman walking his voice was gruff indeed she replied surprised i think hes in his room come in she smiled and maneuvered her chair out of drews way can i get you something he stepped into the kitchen and looked around him ill at ease his fleecelined leather coat was buckled around him by a stout belt and his heavysoled boots were crusted with snow ill have some of that tea if you dont mind she was pouring his cup when rutledge came through the door ah elizabeth said looking up at him i expect this man is the guide youve been waiting for drew inspector rutledge from scotland yard drew nodded and drank his tea noisily rutledge said im used to the fellsbut not in winter ive got warm clothes with me and boots gloves a torch a flask for tea is there anything else i need a better hat drew answered without looking up your ears will be dambe cold you can borrow one of harrys elizabeth put in quickly ill just go and fetch it she wheeled herself out of the door rutledge held open for her behind her drew was saying mind ill know best when its time to turn back yes thats fair enough rutledge nodded ive got that map he said gesturing to where it lay folded and to hand on the sideboard and ive learned what it can tell me but theres more to land than flat markings on paper i need to see the valley from a vantage point where i can understand all the difficulties faced by the search parties and the boy drew grunted in acknowledgment theres one place best for that hamish commented the hills here breed silence into a man it was the same in the glen words counted rutledge nearly answered him aloud and caught himself in time if he can take me where i want to go thats all that matters they set out without another word drew walked with long tireless strides neither hurrying nor wasting time the suns rays angled over the mountains sending stray fingers down to illuminate the far end of the lake but it was not a strong light this close to the solstice it gave the dale an almost ethereal air as if it might disappear before anyone could really grasp it the snow where it was undisturbed looked as smooth as glass and the deeper end of urskwater was a blueblack here and there outcroppings had begun to poke their heads up through the crust of white a sheep man are you rutledge asked after a quarter of an hour all my life why werent you out with the searchers ive been and come they were well outside the village now climbing the shoulder of the fell angling a little west hamish his mind on scotland began a long soliloquy comparing the fells with the highlands the difference in the colors of the soil the shape of the rocks the sense of isolation it was a background accompaniment to the crunch of boots on snow and rock and the breathing of the silent men after another hour or more they had reached a point where they could see much of urskdale above them on the skyline a rounded topknot perched almost nonchalantly a stone afterthought the knob which mrs cummins had pointed out to rutledge from the kitchen of the hotel below urskwater wound between the fells in a stretched s and the valley seemed to widen at both ends narrowing only a little at the middle the village was nearer the top end of the lake and the claws projected in a great broken ledge far above where the road began to bend to reach the other side of the water it was from there that ledge rutledge found himself thinking that the best view could be had but the approach was rough more of a climb than a walk at the far end where the valley was closed another peak rose swelling gently and then showing a precipitous wall of scree where no snow clung it was easier to breathe here on the slopes where he could look down as well as above his head as if hed reached an unexpected equality with the land his claustrophobia began a little to recede drew was pointing theres the elcott farmthe barns just visible no to the left of that boulder shaped like a chimney yes i see it now look how its situated if you were the boy which way would you go rutledge considered the setting its impossible to say theres nothing to stop him until hes well up the shoulder in any direction look at the sheep pens high up on the slopes you can see some of them there over there and there to the left of the last one some three hundred yards lower is the ruin of the old satterthwaite farm and over to your right near the top of that saddle is a small stone hut built for walkers to take shelter in bad weather drew looked around him in the spring there are wildflowers everywhere tiny things that cling to the rock like the sheep he went on identifying the landmarks laconically naming the farms one by one specks of civilization in a wilderness of rock lanes their snow cover already broken and dirty wound with the land sometimes disappearing into the distance without a sign of life it was a vast area this valley and its mountains most of it impossible to cover well on foot rutledge whose sight was very good peered into the hazy sunlight trying to identify what drew could pick out so easily sometimes only a sharpedged shadow betrayed a manmade structure the dirtywhite bodies of sheep now finding grazing where they could break through the snow were all but invisible although drew recognized them without trouble only when the animals moved could rutledge see them a needle in a haystack indeed therere tracks and footpaths everywhere if the robinson lad found one he could go some distance depending on the depth of the snow they twist and branch some of them have names some dont some of them lead to the pens some go nowhere in particular hed have to be lucky we must assume rutledge replied that the killer came up the lane blocking the way back to urskdale and so the boy would have gone in another direction the question is did josh try to circle around in the hope of reaching the village if he chose the high peaks instead why did he believe he was safer there because he couldnt be followed there or was he not thinking at all just fleeing blindly surely janet ashton couldnt have followed him out into the snow if she had murdered her sister and the children she was more likely to find herself lost than the boy and even his rudimentary knowledge of the slopes would put him at an advantage on the other hand paul elcott had lived here all his life it wouldnt matter which direction josh robinson took the older man would be able to outwit him it always came back to one central problem theyd have to find the boy before they could know the whole story rutledge scanned the land again thinking about the boy that night it was stormy the air filled with snow the ground possibly already invisible that farm therewhat did you call it he asked drew apple tree farm wed asked there and looked at all the pens and on the shoulder of the hillwhich one is that its called south farm nothing after a moment drew went on can you see the sheepfold well beyond the farm on the rising land of what we call the bones where to the south now at an angle to the elcott barn yes now i see it thats where elcott kept his sheep in winter storms just under scoat ledge we went over that bit with care walking an arms length from each other if the lad went south we never found any sign of him where were elcotts sheep either elcott or the old bellwether took most of the flock to the safety of the pen some few are scattered about the ground taking shelter where they could but there might not have been time to find them all thats not unusual itll take days to collect them again but they know the sheep how to find the flock for themselves they arent stupid whatever people say how easy it would be rutledge realized for the boy to burrow into the snow next to a ewe one more white lump among so many scattered across the landscape but if that had saved josh on that terrifying sunday night what had become of him when the danger had passed why hadnt he made his way the next morning to the police or to someone he trusted what had made him so terrified of going for help tell me about the sheep he said as he followed his guide higher his breath coming hard as he climbed in the cold air if the animals could survive it might be a lesson well worth learning whats there to tell drew was barely winded they lamb in late april or early may when the grass in the low pastures is greener and someone can keep an eye on them shearing is in july the curdogthats a cross between collie and sheepdoghelps bring them in and take them out the sheep runsare they close by each farm fell land connected by sight and footpaths to the yard where a boy even a city child could come to know them well the older man chuckled the fell that goes with a farm is where time and custom set it i walk three miles to the start of mine elcotts runs behind the house and then skips to the saddle over there a drift road runs between had the boy found the drift road rutledge watched his guide the man seemed to find his footing with ease as if he could peer through the heavy snow crust to the familiar track he knew was there he himself was not always as lucky above all the energy needed to force a way through the snow as they climbed depleted his stamina but then they were going straight up rather than following the contour and that counted for much higher still as rutledge was catching his second wind he could see a thin trail of smoke coming from what appeared to be no human habitation but then as his eyes learned to pick out details to recognize the line of shadow the difference in how sunlight touched the snow on a roof he asked whose farm is that the ingerson farm too far for a child to reach still the party searching there roused maggie they got the rough side of her tongue for their trouble ingerson rutledge could picture the map on the kitchen table hear the voice of the messenger reporting watch his hand tick off each farm yes all right i know who she is and over therethe peterson farm theres the haldnes house he went on giving life to the flat surface of the map seeing for himself how the land lifted and changed how the shape of the fells determined where men could farm or run their sheep where a boy could run if you could see the skyline see the way the great ridges ran and knew how they dipped and changed their shape with distance rutledge thought you could find your way ive done it walking in daylight on summer tracks i remembered but at night in a fierce storm drew was watching rutledges face aye you begin to see rutledge turned and looked back to urskdale the hotel was only a dot on the streaked line of the road and the church seemed squat unimpressive and the shops like toy houses lacking human definition his knees were stiff and he could feel the sweat on his body under the heavy layers of clothes the thought of walking all that way back tired him i can understand the problems of the searchers he acknowledged what id hoped to see was somethinganywherethat the boy might have known about somewhere he could have hidden himself but the shadows on the landscape were deceptive a boulder and its shadow could loom large as a house a thin dark line could mark the top of a stone wall gullies and breaks in the ground could lie smooth filled to their rims gills ran black in the snow threads of water with frosted fronds of grass or moss overhanging the icy edges nothing was what it seemed the boy could lie in one of those deep crevices and with the snow covering him he would be invisible dead or alive no one would see him hamish silent for some time said its as if the land has swallowed him up and willna give him up again all right go on rutledge said but drew shook his head as it is itll be well after dark before we reach the hotel again reluctantly rutledge heeded the warning but there was the motorcar and with that he could reach a handful of those outlying farmshe could try tomorrow himself with a last look at the broad expanse of land all around him the ranging hills and fells he said what if the boy found shelter that first night and survived what then wed have spotted his tracks he wouldnt have moved until the snow stopped youre telling me that you believe josh robinson is dead drew took a deep breath and then let it out softly aye the single word was as cold as the icy patches under rutledges boots and the chill wind that swept down from the heights keep to my tracks going down the older man cautioned as the light fades youll miss your step and rutledge did as he was told well aware of the treachery of the blown snow waiting for an unwary boot he stopped once and thrust a hand into one of those seemingly flat stretches crusted with ice after the melting during the day and his fingers disappeared up to the elbow into a fold in the rock a man he thought could dig deep and bury a handgun under a few rocks and wed never find it and then he hastily caught up with drew watching the long shadows sweep down for an early dusk and the lamps of urskdale twinkling one after another as they were lit like an untidy bright necklace along the road chapter sixteen dinner was late but all the guests came to the meal a somber gathering straining to make polite conversation and often falling silent before their own thoughts even mrs cummins was there toying with her food listening to discussions no one else heard from time to time she would interject a remark that had no bearing on anything being said once or twice she asked if anyone had seen her husband adding harry is always the first to table and elizabeth fraser would answer hell be home soon you know he has been out with the search parties but they were already making their way home each man without hope to buoy him further even the final effort had failed word had arrived by way of sergeant ward in rutledges absence the note had simply read weve come to the end it also disturbed mrs cummins that her guests were taking their meal in the kitchen and more than once she offered to light the fire in the long dining room where they could be comfortable its such a lovely room rutledge had stepped in there earlier to see for himself on the western side of the building where no sun reached it until late afternoon it had been uninvitingly cold despite the graceful stone fireplace and the ancient but beautifully polished oak chairs around the oval oak table with its lion claw feet on the sideboard a pair of staffordshire spaniels had stared forlornly back at him and the china pheasant on the lid of the huge soup tureen seemed poised for flight in the light from rutledges lamp the room hadnt been used according to elizabeth fraser in weeks not since the middle of septemberwe havent had any guests it would have taken hours of a roaring fire to defeat the winter chill in the walls tomorrow night perhaps when your husband is here rutledge replied to distract mrs cummins i wish harry had sent news she answered fretfully why do you suppose he hasnt do you think something could have happened to him i always worry that something has happened that there are more dead we dont know about and then it was as if the pentup emotions in the room couldnt be held back any longer janet ashton exclaimed impatiently surely in all this time someone has seen something a footprint a depression in the snow where he could have taken shelter even a lost glove i mean these men live here theyre supposed to know every inch of these fells in the dead of night in blinding rain ive heard the sheepmen brag how they found a lost ewe that everyone else had given up hope of finding how they located an injured walker in heavy mist that filled urskdale for days on end how they can tell where they are by the feel of the stone under their feet or the smell of the wind mrs cummins alarmed answered are you saying that my husband and the others havent done their duty but surely thats not true mr robinson do you feel that way before he could answer janet glanced across the table at hugh robinsons strained face im sorry hugh i dont mean to dash your hopes but its the waitingspirits rising every time someone comes to the doorplunging when theres no newsi cant fall asleep without jerking awake at the slightest sound you must feel it too its making all of us edgy elizabeth fraser in an effort to distract her put in yes and you must be in some pain as well would you like me to send for dr jarvis but janet had already turned to rutledge i wish i knew what youd said to paul elcott i wish id been there you dont know him inspector how sly and devious he can be gerald never listened either he felt sorry for paul and he cosseted him just as his mother had done and just look how that ended miss ashton elizabeth frasers voice was firm this doesnt do any of us any good janet stared at her for a moment and then dropped her eyes to her plate im sorry ive lost my sister i know how afraid she was and how gerald thought she was just suffering from the melancholy sometimes associated with a difficult pregnancy i just want josh to be found i want something of hers to hold and love and i want justice for her too inspector rutledge hasnt lost someone to murder has he he doesnt understand what iwefeel rutledge unwilling to be drawn into her arguments said only weve all lost people weve loved miss ashton and its natural to rail against what we cant prevent or change i will tell you this hugh robinson set down his fork as if he couldnt go on pretending to eat hes alive josh i can feel it whatever the search parties may tell me if he is it would be a miracle rutledge warned you have to prepare yourselfin the event no hes still alive his eyes met rutledges despair in them i dont see what paul elcott has to say to anything mrs cummins interjected josh was geralds son after all dear gerald he was such a nice mani miss him so terribly her face crumpled elizabeth fraser said hastily josh is hugh robinsons son confused mrs cummins looked around the table i never heard of it if he was the boy lived with gerald didnt he well then rutledge caught miss frasers eye and shook his head in an attempt to shift the subject he said to janet ashton ive been meaning to ask you didnt you believe the policemen stopping traffic in keswick when they told you that the roads were impassable going towards urskdale he thought for an instant hed read surprise in her eyes but if it was there she managed to cover it quickly im afraid i didnt believe themi thought the storm would blow over that i could make it to urskdale if i just rested the horse often and took my time hamish said she didna know they were blocking the road she came through before word went out elizabeth fraser started to say something and then thought better of it janet ashton flicked a look in the other womans direction and then went on theres something more have you considered the possibility inspector that paul elcott will worry about what i can tell the police or that grace might have written to me about her fears i dont even have a key for my door here pauls free to come and go as he pleases i could wake up one night and find him standing over my bed mrs cummins gave a little mew of terror she willna let go of it hamish said id wonder why shes pressing sae hard miss fraser said if youd like a key ill see that you have one but i hardly think you have any reason to be afraid here robinson spoke up suddenly ive met elcott i think youre wrong i cant believe hes the man were after unless theres some problem im not aware of he looked around the table of course not elizabeth fraser answered pauls very different from gerald but thats not unexpected id say you and your sister were different as well miss ashton mrs cummins put in i dont see why a problem with a weak bone in his leg should make any difference to the army he could still shoot couldnt he harry went to fight even if they sent him off to egypt instead he didnt like egypt you know but it was better than being cannon fodder in france ignoring her hostesss digression janet ashton turned to robinson im sorry she apologized for a second time i cant help it i lie awake at night struggling to find answers and paul is the only threat i knew about but if you dont agree with me if theres something i havent thought of i wish youd tell me anything to stop the ache of wondering he turned his head away unable to look at her rutledge beside him could sense the rising tension in the man the hand holding his serviette clenched and he cleared his throat as if he found it hard to breathe hugh please help me youve hardly spoken to me since i got heredid grace tell you something her voice broke on tears and then almost against his will robinson blurted god knows id rather have it be elcott than josh there was a stunned silence as everyone stared at him robinsons face was drained of feeling as if he had reached the bottom of despair what do you mean rather elcott than josh rutledge asked slowly im afraidjosh hated his stepfather i cant believe hed have touched his mother still once the shooting begani dont see how he could have stopped and i keep asking myself why he didnt die with the rest of themhow it was he got away and theres only one answer i can think of hed planned it quite carefully he killed them all and escaped under cover of the storm i cant sleep for wondering if he was trying to get to london and to me that its my fault indirectly that theyre dead because you see i wouldnt take him to live with me however much he begged god help me i felt he was better off with his mother he began to weep inconsolably janet ashton gasped hands over her mouth and for once she was speechless chapter seventeen elizabeth fraser was the first to recover for shame she exclaimed a flush of anger rising into her cheeks you cant believe such a thinghes your son no hugh thats nonsense you cant believe that grace would have told me if he was that unhappy and he wouldnt have touched his motheror hazelhe loved his sister janet ashtons words spilled over each other as she leaned forward across the table mrs cummins flushed with shock got to her feet overturning her chair no pleasei cant bear any more of this she hurried out of the kitchen almost the scurry of a timid and frightened animal robinson pressed his hands to his face as if the very bones ached if you want to know thats why i came to urskdale rather than send the gifts by express dont you see josh had been telling me all the autumn that he hated it here in the north that his mother no longer had time or patience for him that she loved the twins best because she loved their father best i thought it would help if i talked to him face to face thats why i have to find josh now to help him protect him whatever hes done he drew his hands down his eyes haunted do you think i like the idea do you think i dont want to believe in someoneanyone elsekilling them the doctor said it must have been someone they trusted please god let it be anyone but josh janet ashton said did you tell grace what youre telling us did you talk to her about it he shook his head i didnt need to she assured me hed outgrow it that he was still struggling with the fact that id come home and i told myself he was far too young to come and live with me he broke off as janet ashton got up from the table i wont hear any more of thisi was here when the twins were born i would have seen for myself that he was troubled but hugh robinson answered the thought behind what janet was saying gerald had been good to josh i dont think it was something grace wanted to discuss with anyone but me grief has turned your mind hugh janet declared you should never have gone into that house or asked to see their bodiesit was not something you should have done j anet walked quickly out of the kitchen as if afraid their voices would follow her robinson turned to look after her grace wrote me just before i was taken prisoner telling me how janet had stepped in after id been shipped to france how shed helped with hazel and josh even going to london to find work and make sure the children had everything they needed it was janets spirit that kept my family together i owe her more than i can ever repay but there are things between a husband and wife that no one else shares he folded his serviette with shaking fingers and got to his feet if youll excuse me as his footsteps faded down the passage elizabeth fraser said into the silence that followed i wish i hadnt heard any of that its too horrible even to think about theyre grieving you cant always heed what someone says in the first hours of grief rutledge had lost his appetite the rest of his meal untouched on his plate hamish stirred then you didna believe the man children dont always think about the aftermath of an action only about what they want he answered this time silently for hamishs ears only but i find it hard to believe that a child of ten could aim and fire a revolver accurately six times its no difficult in sae small a room he couldna miss at that distance if he was fashed it was true anger could have given a child the steadiness of purpose and the strength he needed it would be over with quickly surprise carrying the day for him and only then would he begin to realize the horror of death but where had he found a weapon if josh killed his family then hes better off dead on the mountainside there was the lad in preston he was only eighteen arthur marlton was driven by voicesno one has said that josh was anything but sane rutledge became aware that elizabeth fraser was speaking it must be hard to listen to such things even a policeman cant be inured to that kind of suffering she began to collect the plates but he could see that her hands were trembling he thought of all the suffering hed witnessed in the warin the course of his duties he was abruptly tired of judging of looking at the cruelty of violent death he was tired of probing into the souls of people and digging out the nasty secrets he found there this kitchen with its cozy warmth its small pleasures shouldnt be the forum for questioning the motives of murderers he found himself longing for the ordinary life that most men lived with a wifechildrena house with a small garden but what could he bring to such domestic scenes a haunted mind an overfamiliarity with death a burdened conscience hamish said you were never a man for selfpity no not selfpity loneliness rousing himself he moved to help miss fraser im sorry dinner was ruined she bit her lip why couldnt it have been a stranger it wouldnt hurt as much somehow you could hate a stranger and what hed done if it is a stranger rutledge told her then hes still out there and if it wasnt a grudge against the elcottsif it was something else madness evenhe could very well kill again dont you ever lock your doors people come in and out of this house at will and im helpless to defend myself or mrs cummins she finished for him i cant think of anyone with a grudge against us i expect the elcotts didnt know of anyone with a grudge against them he answered curtly until the door opened and their murderer stepped into the room he thought of something did the elcotts own a dog in the summer gerald had had to put down his sheepdog she was twelve and failing a beautiful animal he named her miata strange name for a dog isnt it he said hed read it somewhere and liked it i asked if it was irish and he said it wasnt i thought you didnt know the family very well she had the grace to blush i knew gerald to speak to everyone did on market day most people come in to urskdale for supplies and news and he was that sort of man open and friendly not just with me because i was confined to my chair it was a gift he had small wonder that grace fell in love with him a woman can judge a man sometimes paul elcott had said that even elizabeth fraser had been attracted to his brother then how do you judge paul miss fraser shook her head he was the younger son and not easy to know often in his brothers shadow but that doesnt make him a murderer she turned to look up at rutledge her blue eyes full of unhappiness do you think hugh robinson is rightthat josh could have done such a thing god knows rutledge answered her but robinson believes it for now and its tearing him apart t he boy was never comfortable wherever he sat his body tense as a spring seemed to be unable to rest he moved from chair to chair and then to the floor next to sybil up again and around the room only to huddle once more against the dogs warm body his eyes darted in the direction of any unexpected sound galvanizing him to run sometimes it drove her to distraction this constant prowl maggie watched him without appearing to scanning the face that seemed pared down to skin over bone the eyes looking inward at something too dark to bring out into the light of day it was she thought like sharing a house with a shadow silent no substance hardly companionable a burden rather than a gift from the snowy night but she needed him his body was young and strong and it didnt matter where his mind was he could feed the sheep he could drag bales of hay to the horse and the cow he could clamber up on the roof with a broom to push the worst of the snow off the eaves he could carry in the scuttle filled with coal and bring in kindling to lay the fire she sat in her chair nursing her leg and cursing the pain and patted sybil on the head clever girl that she was hell do she thought i wont make it through the winter without him w hen the last of the search parties had come in from the fells greeley walked to the hotel and summoned rutledge to the cold sitting room standing by the hearth he said well ive done all i can a pity it wasnt more rutledge looking out into the street replied miss ashton believes paul elcott killed his brother and his family greeleys eyebrows rose does she by god he found the bodies whats that got to say to anything the older policeman demanded irritated who else was likely to have gone out to the house after a storm like that one save paul to see if the family had managed if they needed anything he shook his head we look in on each other he added grimly and if elcott hadnt found them your miss ashton might have she ought to be grateful to him for sparing her that grief it was true enough and hamish was reminding him of the revolver in miss ashtons carriage there was only the womans word for the fact that she hadnt made it as far as the elcotts farmshe might well have been on her way back to carlisle when rutledge found her rutledge said aloud im told janet ashton helped her sister care for the children when robinson went to france she knew elcott she might know if elcott had other enemies i must ask her that oh yes enemies who come in the middle of a storm to butcher his family in front of him greeley responded scornfully unless there was something that happened in the war he served in france artillery i dont see how the killer could have anticipated such a ferocious storm still it covered his tracks as well as the boys the question then becomes how long had the murders been planned or had something happened to precipitate events greeley shook his head i dont know what to think i wish to god this hadnt happened on my patch the outside door opened and they could hear a man scraping his boots on the threshold greeley opened the sitting room door expecting to find one of his men reporting the newcomer looked up at greeley any news none unless youve brought it greeley indicated rutledge scotland yard come to help us rutledge this is harry cummins youve met his wife the owner of the hotel the egyptian sun had darkened his skin and a little gray threaded his dark hair rutledge shook his hand and thanked him for putting him up for the duration cummins staring at rutledge seemed at first not to hear and then said quickly were not exactly overflowing this time of year erwhats the yards interest in our problems the chief constable felt the local people needed help i see he seemed to shake off the mood that had distracted him with false heartiness he added yes of course i should have thought of that im sorry im still asleep on my feet there are two other guests greeley told cummins robinson grace elcotts first husband and her sister janet ashton a good thing elizabeth is here to see to them vera would never have managed there was an awkward silence then cummins indicated his snowwet coat id better be getting out of these clothes weve done our best greeley theres no sign of the boy anywhere out there i never thought he would have turned east anyway if so why not come directly into town and to you good question greeley agreed well go and change i was just finishing my conversation with rutledge here how long will you be staying cummins asked looking at the man from london until i find some answers rutledge responded hes no happy to see you hamish pointed out cummins nodded and went off up the stairs trudging heavily the slump of his shoulders spoke volumes greeley following him with his eyes sighed well where do we go from here ask your men to canvass the village we want to know about any strangers theyve seen about any trouble the elcott family may have had with their neighborsor any quarrels we also want to know what the relationship was between josh robinson and his stepfather greeleys glance swung back to rutledge and sharpened whats that in aid of robinson admitted over dinner that hes afraid his son killed the elcotts that josh was angry with his stepfatheror was jealous of the twins it might be best if i speak to joshs schoolmaster my good god greeley whistled under his breath that couldnt have been an easy admission i didnt know josh well enough to tell you if it could be true or not but ill send the schoolmaster to you tonight i give robinson credit for being honest theres still an urgent reason to find the boy while we can still be sure how he died and where silently he added and if he had a revolver with him and how do you intend to go about that greeley retorted watch for ravens collecting around the body we can begin by finding out whether or not anyone in the valley might willingly hide josh robinson protect him after all as far as anyone knows hes been orphaned and they might take pity on him a classmate a friend of geralds it might tell us which direction he tried to take theres not a soul in urskdale who wouldnt have told me as soon as they heard we were searching for him greeley protested they were told hed likely witnessed the murders and we wanted him safe no i have to say youre barking up the wrong tree with josh i t was an hour later when the schoolmaster presented himself at the hotel a tall thin man with graying hair and an air of the cleric about him he introduced himself to rutledge as rupert blackwell and said inspector greeley tells me you wish to speak to me rutledge led him into the chilly sitting room and offered him a chair its about the boy josh robinson elcotts stepson ah yes i thought as much i was with one of the search parties it was discouraging we tried hard believe me interested rutledge answered indeed where did you search i was with cummins and two other men we went to the east of the farm and then swung a little south to come full circle blackwell added dryly i was already in my bed when you sent for me the chapped skin of his face stretched in a wry smile then ill make this as brief as i can tell me about josh hes a bright childwas he paused as if unwilling to use the past tense yet quite clever with his hands eager to learn its my view he needed better schooling than we can offer here hed grown up in a very different world you see with wider horizons most of our youngsters have always been content to follow in their fathers footsteps they learn what they can and as their schoolmaster im not ungrateful of course those same horizons made josh something of an outsider his stories about living near london sounded like boasting to the other boys as a result he made few friends was he a troublemaker that implies a certain quality of leadership doesnt it the outcast is troublesome unable to understand why he isnt popular lashing out because hes hurt and lonely wanting to stop the pain he feels i saw none of that but i gave him books to readabout explorers and the like men who accomplished great things alone the sort of thing a boy with a lively imagination should have relished but there was something morei could see that it wasnt only his unhappiness at school these last few months hes been distracted and his schoolwork had begun to suffer he was more inwardlooking moreworried when i asked him outright if all was well at home he answered that he was content but you could see that he wasnt men who accomplished great things alone had that wellintended reading matter made it possible for a boy to contemplate killing his family it was a chilling thought how did he get on with his stepfather sad to say i dont know the answer to that there was a pause he missed school more than usual this term his mother would bring him to me and make excuses it was outright truancy but i welcomed him back hoping to smooth over whatever it was that was disturbing him i did wonderand i made a point to bring it up with mrs elcottif he would be happier with his father and schools in the south if he was torn you see between his duty to his mother and his love for his father how did she answer you that he was her son and she wouldnt let him go i dont think it occurred to her that it might be better for josh and in my opinionwell thats water over the dam you might say if josh survives hell go to his father after all hamish was saying something rutledge realized that he was pointing out that blackwell might have put his finger on the reason behind robinsons fears an unexpected motive an unhappy frustrated childs solution to his private demons is it possible that josh robinson was wretched enough here in urskdale to take matters into his own hands so that he could live with his father blackwell stared at rutledge good god are you suggesting no thats contemptible were talking about a child a policeman doesnt have the luxury of making exceptions i have to look at every possibility no matter how distasteful it might be rutledge answered mildly he wont be eleven until january blackwell exclaimed shocked you must be out of your mind id as easily believe harry cummins or i could have done such a thing rutledge said with a revolver theres no thoughttheres no strength required you simply point the weapon and pull the trigger and people fall dead blackwell got to his feet i shant waste breath on this question is there anyone josh might have turned toanyone he trusted enough to make his way to them you his teacher perhaps the schoolmaster stopped at the door i wish i could say he would come to me but of course he wouldnt have he shrugged deprecatingly i make it a habit never to show favoritism i never gave that child any reason to believe he could trust me particularly i never imagined there would come a time rutledge waited and blackwell added almost against his will thats my failure as a teacher inspector some men have the gift of inspiring the young i merely teach them for what thats worth and he was gone a gust of frigid air swirling into the hall in his wake r utledge discovered elizabeth fraser sitting in the kitchen reading he was surprised to find her still awake and wondered if she found it as difficult to sleep sometimes as he did and then remembered her standing in the door in the moonlight taking tentative steps as if testing her will when the house was dark and silent she looked up as he came through the passage door and said was that news it was blackwell the schoolmaster did you know that cummins has come home i heard him in the passage speaking to his wife shes notwelltonight as you saw she marked her place in the book you look tired ive put your hot water bottle there on the table were you waiting for me he asked feeling a surge of guilt at the thought no i was trying to stay warm for a few minutes longer she smiled i was born along the south coast where winters were milder we seldom saw snow and i used to dream of traveling to lapland and riding in a sleigh it sounded so excitingto be wrapped in furs and follow the reindeer herds why lapland because my mother often read to me from a little book about a child of the north her smile faded i know the men cant search forever they have farms and families and work to see to but i cant help but feel weve somehow deserted josh robinson by giving up i havent given up he reminded her were just trying new directions tomorrow ill call on several of the farms closest to the elcott house to see what theyve heard or seen to ask where we ought to look when this snow melts to keep their minds on the possible even if weve had no luck so far do you thinkis robinson right about his son he knows him best but isomehow i cant comprehend a child killing his own family ive seen josh he was a child with unruly hair and a quick smile and sometimes an imp of mischief in his face she paused there was loneliness too i must tell you that rutledge walked to the window and raised the shade to look out at the night ware what you say hamish warned him and rutledge turned away from the window angry with the cautionary voice in his head ive only begun the investigation its just as hard to imagine paul elcott shooting his own brother her face was troubled what if you dont find the killer ever therell be a cloud over pauls head and over joshs even if hes found dead you must realize that accusations have long lives sometimes it was as if she knew what she was talking about as if accusations against her had shadowed her life it could explain why she was content to stay here at mrs cummins beck and call instead of answering her he said cummins doesnt sound like a dale man no hes from london but hes lived here foreverfor twenty years or more i should think she smiled wryly hes still considered a stranger for that matter so am i he bought this hotel and has tried to make a success of it but sometimes i think he wishes hed never set eyes on it his wife was saying that hed served in egypt yes thats true he didnt like the east very much he never talks about it i dont think hes ever been happy isnt that a wretched thing to say about anyone but i cant help it hes haunted by something she stopped suddenly embarrassed i shouldnt be saying such things to a policeman harry cummins is a good man i dont mean to make him sound otherwise she glanced at the clock on the wall how late it is she set her book aside and collected her own hot water bottle good night inspector he held the door for her and watched her wheel her chair down the passage as he reached for his own hot water bottle he glanced down at the book shed left behind it was one of o a mannings slim volumes of poetry wings of fire after a time he went to his own room and lighted the lamp the room seemed to be full of ghosts crowding him and a wave of claustrophobia swept through him driving him to open the door again and step into the passage where the cold air of the unheated wing of the house seemed to swirl around him the lamp dipped in the draft and he could feel the beat of his heart like a drum that was too loud reverberating through his body hamish said you canna escape fra what you are and ha been rutledge answered him in the silence of the passage i cant live with it either chapter eighteen the next morning rutledge with the map on the seat beside him in the motorcar turned out of the hotel yard towards the bottom of urskwater he followed a rutted lane into the yard of apple tree farm dogs met him with lowered heads and suspicious growls a woman came to the yard door to stare at him uncertain who he was and why he had come inspector rutledge from london he called without leaving the motorcar my husbands in the barn mrs haldnes id like to ask you a few questions about the night that the elcott family died the uncertainty changed instantly to wariness i cant tell you anything no i understand not about the murders but i wondereddid your dogs bark that night did you find tracks in the snow where they shouldnt have been did your children appear to be worried about something a storm was coming we had work to do what were we likely to hear or to see theres no reason to think the killer came this way surely i was thinking about josh i dont wish the lad any harmmy husband searched for him with the rest but he wasnt friendly with my boys they didnt get on well together he was in dire need he might have tried to find help anywhere he could yes and wed have done what we could wouldnt we but we never saw him hamish said she wasna the sort of woman he would turn to shes cold and no very motherly ignoring the voice rutledge said youre the closest farm thats as may be but the track over the shoulder of the fell isnt the best there is he thanked her and when shed called off the dogs walked into the cold mustiness of the barn meeting with an equal reticence in her husband a sense of closing ranks but he could identify an undercurrent of superstition as wellas if speaking of the elcotts and what had happened to them might somehow bring the same fate down on this family to be ignorant was to be safe rutledge drove on to south farm and found the owner in the stable mucking out he asked mr peterson the same questionsand once more met a blank wall mrs peterson driven by curiosity came out to see what it was the stranger wanted we didnt know the lad not really of course wed seen him on market day with gerald or his mum she told rutledge but our children are grown with lives of their own and we had no reason to take special notice of josh id heard he was troublesome but he seemed quiet enough when gerald was about troublesome im only repeating what mrs haldnes told me i dont know firsthand petersons eyes slid towards the heights we did our best searching it was expected of us but the dissatisfaction of failure lurked in his voice and youre sure there were no strangers in urskdale the week before the murders rutledge asked again well if a stranger was bent on mischief he wasnt likely to call attention to himself was he mrs peterson asked reasonably not many of us look out our windows of a night to see who may be passing besides her husband put in no need to stir up the dogs if youre willing to walk wide of a farm theres a hundred tracks to choose from besides the lanes but when asked why the elcotts might have been killed the petersons like the haldneses shook their heads gerald was a good man peterson said hardly the sort to find himself mixed up in something nasty and that young wife of his was very mindful of her place people like that arent likely to find themselves in trouble are they his father henry was a good man too and of course his uncle sound stock the elcotts mrs peterson agreed then she added anxiously i dont think i ever knew anyone murdered before its not something were used to is it when rutledge brought up paul elcotts name a quick glance passed between husband and wife hes not gerald mind but sound enough peterson replied a shame the licensed house didnt fly but there you are hes young yet mrs peterson nodded he reminds me of his uncle theo and look how he turned out it was to rutledges ears faint praise hamish said a long shadow to live under for a lifetime it was an interesting observation does theo elcott live here rutledge asked no one had mentioned another relative until now oh theos been dead since mrs peterson assured him then reverting to the murders she said henry would have been horrified i just dont understand how something like this could have happened here in urskdale driving away from south farm rutledge marveled at the silence bred into these people the willingness to shut their eyes the refusal to be a brothers keeper searching was one thing it was what they knew the land they lived with if someone needed help repairing a stormdamaged roof or the loan of a team or plow or a hand feeding livestock when he was ill neighbors would come because they knew he would return the favor one day it was a matter of survival in a place where nature was against them all but whatever the elcotts had done to call the wrath of the gods down upon them their neighbors wanted no part of it t he lane leading to the last farm on his list was deep with snow his tires struggled up the incline spinning the motorcar rocking from side to side like a ship in a storm only the slightest indentation defined the lane as it wound around a knoll and then traveled a good mile over hilly ground before finally straggling upward again and into a farmyard the outbuildings were weathered tired the snow lay heavy on their slate roofs and in the gray sunlight there was a dreariness about them that struck him at once glancing down at the map rutledge read the name by this particular square it was the ingerson farm an old name surely going back to the scandinavian heritage of many families in the north he pulled into the yard and saw that seven or so sheep were penned near the house smoke rose from the chimney but the yard was empty and no dogs barked getting down from the motorcar he looked around him there was nothing to be seen in the snow but the tracks of a mans wellingtons and the prints of a dog before he could walk up the flagged approach to the kitchen door it opened and a woman stepped out to stare at him she was middleaged her hair pulled back in a knot behind her head it had been fair once but now was streaked with gray though her eyes were a startling blue she leaned on a cane as if walking was difficult and there were deep lines of pain in her face behind her a black dog stood guard growling warning him to mind his manners im inspector rutledgefrom london he began im looking into the deaths of the elcotts maggie ingerson she answered with a brief nod ive come to speak to mr ingerson if i may hes been dead for ten years my father youll have to make do with me if theres anything you want to say you live here alone rutledge asked glancing up and judging the size of her farm in the hazy light he could just see one of the sheep pens that lay high on the shoulder of the fell rising some distance behind her house a snake of stones already standing out above the banked snow it must be hard work to keep up this place on your own the man who helped me until got blown up at mons there hasnt been anyone else who could do what needs to be done ive seen to it myself it was said without rancor but something in her eyes told him that she resented the war and mourned the man dead in france ive come about the search for young robinson gerald elcotts stepson i guessed as much have they found him yet not yet no she had a stillness about her that spoke of selfsufficiency without selfpity a plainness as if her life had not left much time for frills she was wearing wellingtons a mans thick corduroy trousers and a mans heavy coat the red plaid shirt under it visible at the collar seemed her only concession to femininity as if there was no time to waste on something there was no one about to appreciate id like to ask if you heard or saw anything the night of the storm if your dog barked for no reasonif you found any tracks the morning after the storm passedanything that might help us locate the boy youre not that far from the elcott farm on paper that may be you have to take into account the elevation as well until the search party arrived i didnt know i should be listening for anything out of the ordinary and the wind was that fierce you couldnt hear yourself think the dog and i stayed by the fire and left the sheep to fend for themselves she indicated her cane there wasnt much else i could do rutledge could feel a rising thread of wind that seemed to come from the heights and gather strength as it rolled down towards them the woman seemed not to notice it as if inured to the cold she was as hamish was saying in the back of his mind of sturdier stock i understand that not far from here theres a track that leads over the mountains and down to the coast road not so much a track as an old drover road i daresay i could find it on a good day i dont know many who could its not been used in a hundred years did anyone pass that way on the night of the storm she laughed shortly its not like london inspector an army could have marched that way and i wouldnt have seen them or heard them your dog might have sybil isnt the adventurous sort i let her out she does what she has to do and she comes back in shes a working dog if whoever walked that track had two legs and didnt smell of sheep shed ignore him whatever hed done rutledge shaded his eyes to study the spectacular scenery that surrounded the farm there was a beck tumbling down a rocky defile on the far side of the farm disappearing in the direction of the lake far above a ragged shelf leaned down crookedly towards the jumble of fallen debris that had once been a part of it and higher still the rounded shoulder of the fell turned and ran towards a fold of land that looked like a high pass as if shed read his mind maggie ingerson said he didnt grow up here that boy i dont see him running too far from home in his shoes thats what id have done stayed close and bided my time it would depend rutledge answered on whether he was running fromor tosomething she shrugged i never had a child of my own i dont know the answer to that there are five people dead and i didnt kill them i liked gerald elcott well enough but i have all i can do to survive here if the boy escaped as sergeant miller says he did then hes dead too and i havent energy to spare in mourning him in my view hes better off dead i know what its like to live alone and have no one to turn to i wouldnt wish that on him now if youll forgive me i need to rest my leg standing isnt good for it do you need help would you like to see dr jarvis or to have someone bring you supplies its dr jarvis whos to blame for my leg he told me he could set it again and it would be straight but he was wrong about that and the infection afterward i manage with what ive got and the rest i do without still thank you for asking she turned and walked back through the door shutting it in his face r utledge stood there for a moment longer in the yard of the ingerson farm remembering what the woman had just said the assumption was that josh robinson had fled that house of slaughter and run for his lifeand that theory had served to galvanize urskdale sending searchers in every direction but what if it wasnt what had happened that stormy night what if he was still somewhere close by his home waiting for his father to come for him rutledge started the motorcar and drove back the way hed come w hen maggie came back into the kitchen she found him standing there rooted to the floor eyes wide with fear i wouldnt mind him she said crossing to the stove to warm her hands he was lost the child stared at her from london he said the boy began to shake as if from a fever she thought at first he was having a seizure and watched in concern waiting for his eyes to roll back in his head but he simply stood there unable to move in such a state of terror that she crossed to set her hands on his shoulders he winced at her touch what sybil finds she keeps maggie said firmly do you hear me if you want to leave theres the door open it and go if you want to stay then youll have to trust me she moved on to her chair and sat down heavily the kettles about to boil and ive been on my feet long enough if were going to have tea youll have to make it ill cut the bread and then well see about getting a little hay to the sheep on the hill the snows too deep theyll be starving before it melts i cant afford to lose them massaging her leg she said i hate being in debt to any man its not how i was brought up but youre here and i need you and thats all there is to it he walked to the stove and lifted the heavy kettle as it began to whistle it took all his concentration and he set it carefully on the mat on the table before rooting in the cupboard for tea and sugar and cups maggie watched him without seeming to do you have a name she asked ive got to call you something but he didnt answer his face turned away she let it go sybil lying by the bedroom door heaved a sigh as if something had been settled maggie hearing her said nothing w hen rutledge arrived at the elcott farm there was another vehicle there already a small cart drawn by an old horse he stopped the motorcar some distance away and went to the cart laying a hand on the animals shoulder he could feel the sweat still warm the interloper hadnt been there very long a curious neighbor or someone else he strode across the muddy yard to the kitchen door and opened it in the light of a lamp on the table paul elcott on his knees by the wall looked up with terror in his eyes and then swore as he recognized rutledge god but you gave me a start man did you ever think to knock what are you doing here elcott gestured towards the bucket of water and scrub brush someones got to clean this room and if im going to live here now one side of the room was nearly clean the rusty stains only a faint streak in the paint now i thought you lived above the licensed house the bank wont give me any more money not with gerald dead ill lose the place before the month is out theres nowhere else to go rutledge thought i dont envy him living here with the ghosts hamish said aye but if he wanted the farm enough to kill for it ye ken its timely rutledge looked again at the bloodstains at the devastation that represented the abrupt end of five lives even when he first stepped through the door here something had bothered him a sense of evil and ugliness it was hard to believe that a child could have done this elcott seemed to know what had been passing through rutledges mind i shant have anywhere else to go he said in selfdefense what am i to do did your brother own a handgun rutledge asked if josh had killed his own family where had the revolver come from he never had a hope of reaching it in time if he did with small children about hed have kept it locked up in his bedroom or out in the barn if im to finish here before dark i need to be about it something in his voice hinted at a fear of the dark in this place yes go on i have other business here elcott waited but rutledge didnt explain finally he got to his knees again and began to scrub but the stiffness across his shoulders indicated that he was all too aware of the policeman by the door r utledge walked outside going through the barn with some care looking for trapdoors looking for some sign that someone had taken refuge here after the searchers had departed but there was nothing no makeshift beds no sacks pulled into a dry corner no cache of tins or biscuits or anything else a boy might live on the same was true in the outbuildings but then the police had already done this search earlier he walked out into the yard again and scanned the slopes of the fell searching forwhat hamish said an observation post to begin with perhaps but nearly a week had passed since the murders without food with only cold snow for water and with little protection during the cold nights how could a child have survived but then this might have been a child with murder on his soul and surviving was the reason for killing it would depend hamish was reminding him on how far ahead the boy had planned or rutledge found himself thinking on how josh robinson had felt about the bloody shambles hed fled he could have carried out the murders and then overwhelmed by the horror of what hed done he might have run too far and lost himself in the unfamiliar night the unfamiliar snow and never had the strength to find his way back r utledge went back to the house this time entering through the front door climbing the stairs to the bedrooms searching more carefully than hed had a chance to do in inspector greeleys presence he went through drawers and cupboards trying to find something that defined the dead lettersmore photographs it isna a house wi secrets hamish grumbled and that was true nothing was concealed it was as if the family had never felt it had to hide anything the handful of letters he came across were innocuous hardly more than everyday accounts of events seven from janet ashton three from robinson if there had been other letters they were gone now he found a book of accounts in a desk in gerald and grace elcotts bedroom and turned through the pages recognizing that the farm was relatively prosperous another factor pointing in paul elcotts direction an album of pressed flowers on a shelf by the bed must have belonged to grace she had collected these blooms pressed them with care and identified them on the page as the guide drew had said in the short growing season there were wildflowers along the edges of the lake and in sheltered pockets if one knew where to look bog myrtle with its distinctive scent the leaves and flowers of mimulus various ferns the leaves of dwarf willow and dwarf sedge from the highest peaks they were mixed with the more familiar marigold rose petals violets and lavender grace elcott must have walked often through the countryside adding to her store he tried to picture her holding her daughter by the hand her son running ahead going out to search for something new with each season but she had worked hard as well cooking making her own bread hanging out the wash ironing the clothes cleaning the house sweeping out the kitchen and never complained transplanted from london to a harder life perhaps than shed expected he put the album back in its place and went on the toy soldiers in joshs room the dolls in hazels painted an ordinary picture of life here he found a small coral necklace that had belonged to the little girl wrapped in pretty paper and kept in a velvet box a birth gift from her parents but in joshs room there was a pair of gold cuff links broken and stuffed behind the head of the bed rutledge held them in the palm of his hand wondering what they represented a gift from his stepfather secretly rejected or merely broken by an active boy who was afraid to tell his elders what had become of them in the parlor were books peter and wendy and several volumes of explorations a bible a book of household hints a chess set and board a pipe rack with a tinlined tobacco box beside it a small sewing basket with needles and embroidery threads in gay colors a folded tea towel with an unfinished pattern along its bordera vase of violets with leaves trailing domestic life ordinary comfortable rutledge remembered the hat with its cabbage roses grace elcott had possessed a sense of style a pretty woman who had attracted two husbands had she been afraid of paul elcott because he coveted not only his brothers farm but also his brothers wife he went back up to hazels bedroom to look again at the photograph of janet ashton where did she stand in this scene of death the only revolver hed found was hers he was studying her petulant face when he heard paul elcotts voice from below inspector rutledge are you still here he went to the head of the stairs and called yes what is it its inspector greeley hes come looking for you theres been trouble at the hotel chapter nineteen inspector greeley was pacing the yard when rutledge came around the corner of the house youre a hard man to find greeley said whats happened its a ruddy nightmare robinson tried to kill himself it was all elizabeth could do to stop him shes cut too a straight razor rutledge swore all right ill meet you there he cranked the car and got in behind the wheel greeley behind him turned his carriage and prepared to follow rutledge drove fast sending a spray of snow meltwater and mud behind him as his tires bit into the road was it a bit of histrionicsor had robinson let his grief get the best of him hamish said if he cut the lass it wasna dramatics damn the man rutledge snarled it serves no purpose not here not now he should have waited until his children were buried he owes them that much but grief had many faces and here was a man who had suffered through a prisonerofwar camp after a bloody war he had come home to a family that had for whatever reasons forsaken him now they were dead and even in that there was no peace hamish grunted as if agreeing with rutledges thoughts war changed us and the simple words carried a wealth of misery t he back door stood wide rutledge could hear anxious voices from the kitchen and crossed the yard in long strides hamish his voice seeming to echo against the fell said shes come to no harm as he stepped inside he could smell the odor of fear and a heavier reek of burned toast it was bitter in his nostrils the first thing he saw was the spattered blood on the floor and shards of a broken teacup and saucer his mind flashed back to another kitchen he had seen not an hour before and a man scrubbing the stubborn stains on the walls dr jarvis was there and vera cummins her cheeks streaked with tears and elizabeth fraser pale and shaken was submitting silently to the bandaging of her hand harry cummins stood near the door to the passage worry deepening the lines of fatigue his eyes on miss fraser all looked up as rutledge came in what happened wheres robinson he asked robinson is in his bed under sedation jarvis said grimly i was coming down the passage with clean towels elizabeth fraser said her voice trembling i heard aa noise in mr robinsons room it sounded as if something heavy had fallen to the floor i knocked and then when there was no answer i went in she shivered and looked up at jarvis the doctor was just tying off the bandage a frown on his face she cleared her throat and went on he was on the floor there were pieces of china all around him and blood pouring from his wrist he was juststaring at it and when he saw me he tried to slash the other wrist i fought to stop him mr cummins heard the noise and then miss ashton came running to help as well it took all of us to subdue himit was as if he had the strength of a dozen men and all the while he kept calling for his children it was horrible i didnt think i could prevent him from if it hadnt been for harry id have failed we got him out here and used belts to tie him to a chair until the doctor could be sent for she stopped then said faintly i was frightened hed succeed rutledge turned to the doctor how is he i think hes come to his senses jarvis answered he was apologizing profusely to everyone rutledge brushed past them and walked down the passage to the guest rooms he opened robinsons door without ceremony as it banged against the wall miss ashton who had been sitting beside the bed watching her former brotherinlaw started at the sound turning to rutledge with wide startled eyes robinson looked up at rutledge blearily and with an effort lifted himself to one elbow there were bandages on his wrists and one across his chin blood stained the floor and the white cloth on the table that had held the yellow pitcher and bowl they lay on the floor in bits what in hell did you think you were doing rutledge turned back to robinson as hamish in the back of his mind urged caution hugh robinson said ii dont knowi thinki think i lost my mind it was a stupid dangerous thing to try youve hurt miss fraser youve frightened everyone in the house and youve wreaked havoc here and in the kitchenand youve gained nothing you dont know what its like robinson began tears in his eyes you dont know that child is my son all the more reason to keep your head and help him when hes found he turned to miss ashton is there a key to this door yesmiss fraser passed them out last night after dinner and the razor in the kitchen all right robinson youre locked in until i see youve got yourself back under control your meals will be brought to you he took the key ushered janet ashton out into the passage and shut the door she said hes grieving nevertheless he turned the key and dropped it into his pocket she followed him back to the kitchen still protesting hamish was saying yeve lost your temper because yeve wasted the morning it isna right to take your failure out on others they reached the kitchen the others watched him disturbed by something they read in his face is he all right mrs cummins asked hes a guest here i cant imagine what went wrong weve done all we can to make everyone comfortable but its hard you see he could smell the whiskey on her breath it was nothing you didor failed to do he told her then looking over her head to her husband he added perhaps you ought to take mrs cummins upstairs to rest cummins tore his eyes from elizabeth frasers face i should stay to see if miss fraser is all right mrs cummins caught her breath on a sob and walked quickly out of the room hurrying down the passage they could hear her footsteps flying up the stairs your place is with your wife rutledge told cummins curtly reluctantly the innkeeper left the room casting a last glance at the woman in the wheeled chair miss ashton declared im going for a walk i cant sit here and do nothing she turned and followed cummins down the passage dr jarvis was replacing instruments in his satchel wrapping them in cloth as he put them away i dont think robinson did much damage he told rutledge as he worked to himself or to elizabeth here he was distraught and overly emotional but i dont think he had the heart to finish the job miss fraser was looking down at her hand there was a rising bruise on her cheek where robinson must have struck her as they struggled rutledge swore under his breath he wanted to take robinson by the throat and shake him the force of the feeling surprised him dr jarvis considered her for a moment would you care for a sedative my dear something to soothe no i must see to the dinner ill leave something then in the event its needed later i have another patient to see to a broken collarbone fell off his roof trying to push out the snow if you need me send for me he nodded to rutledge and was gone from the yard they could hear him speaking to greeley who had just pulled in the two men left together there was silence in the kitchen then elizabeth fraser said again i was so frightened her voice was soft as if she wasnt aware she was speaking aloud for want of something constructive to do rutledge began to make tea and after a few minutes set a cup before her she drank it down her left hand shaking only slightly as she lifted it to her lips ask mrs cummins or miss ashton to help you with the meal you shouldnt disturb that bandage for twentyfour hours you sound like dr jarvis she smiled wryly but then in the war you must have seen far more terrible injuries than mine this will heal in no time he didnt answer her standing at the window looking out sorting through his emotions he had saved janet ashtons life but there was no sense of warmth between them they had become antagonists over the murders and her determination to force the issue kept her at arms length from everyone he wondered why gerald had chosen one over the other because grace was vulnerable with two fatherless children bringing out his protective nature was it in fact janet ashtons strength that had seemed unfeminine and hard to him and was that why gerald had been kind to elizabeth fraser because she was vulnerable in her own fashion yet he himself had seen another side of elizabeth fraser she possessed a gallant spirit taking her disability in stride earning her keep without complaint in this house of tensions between husband and wife he wondered why she stayed and again he came to the conclusion that need had forced her into what might become an intolerable situation because harry cummins was keenly aware of her vulnerability too i understand really i do she was saying hes half mad with grief and frustration but its such a waste theres been enough bloodshed already what goodwhat possible goodcould it do to shed more i expect he didnt think about good only about his own pain rutledge knelt and began quietly washing up the blood from the floor collecting the bits of teacup you neednt do that elizabeth fraser protested why not he asked forcing a smile its a way of dealing with my own frustrations she looked askance but didnt take it any further tipping the broken china into the dustbin he closed the door to shut out the cold clear air the odor of burned bread was gone now and the kitchen seemed chill unfriendly as if what had happened at the elcott farm had finally spread to this comfortable and unlikely place m rs cummins came down to help prepare the meal and rutledge left the women to their work he had sat for an hour with elizabeth fraser silence between them her thoughts turned inward he had offered what he could his presence without intruding hamish uneasy and withdrawn was a third party in the room just before mrs cummins had come in again miss fraser had said as if closing the door on whatever was on her own mind did you learn anything this morning you seemed so hopeful as you were leaving i could feel it not much im afraid perhaps you arent looking in the right place thats what maggie ingerson said to me miss ashton is convinced that shes right about paul elcott it would be convenient for her convenient an odd choice of words surely inspector i dont see what she might gain from blaming him but he said nothing after a moment miss fraser commented tentatively you must find out who did this horrible thingas soon as you can urskdale wont be the same even so but we have a better chance of putting events behind us if theres an end to it he couldnt tell her that he already had too many suspectsand far from enough proof against any one of them he couldnt tell her that he was stumbling in the dark looking for answers no better than inspector greeley before him and what if there was someone else out there a stranger whom no one had seen in the stormor worse someone in the dale who had killed wantonly and could possibly kill again he dared not concentrate on any one possibility to the exclusion of others it would be too dangerous this wasnt london where constables across the city could keep an eye on each suspect and report daily here there were no eyes and there was a good deal of empty landscape where people could move at will he admitted to himself that he didnt want the killer to be the child it was too monstrous a thing to have done hamish reminded him aye but ye ken the duty of a policeman is no to feel a partiality it will blind you to what must be done rutledge had done his best to be impartial in preston odd to think that if the trial had been finished only a day early he wouldnt have been sent north hed have been halfway back to london before the bodies had been discovered but if the trial had ended a day early the fate of young marlton might have been very different the long and serious debate by the jurors as they considered the evidence was all that had spared him from the hangman as for duty rutledge understood that all too well he had sent young green men into the heat of battle because it was their turn to fight he had had to close his eyes to the fact that they would surely die in the end chance had made the final choice or so he had tried to tell himself as he reported the long lists of the dead and missing the scots under him had sometimes sat with a bowl of water on a black cloth searching for a sign of what lay ahead he never knew if it had worked what would he ask of the water if he sat over a bowl right now where was the child orwho was the murderer better by far for the snow to have swallowed up josh robinson than for him to be brought in for trial chapter twenty greeley was at his office his face haggard with fatigue even handing the investigation over to rutledge had done nothing to alleviate his own involvement and he seemed to carry around with him the haunting question of responsibility had he failed in his duty by not bringing in the killer himself as rutledge walked in he got up from behind his desk and said dr jarvis tells me hes all right robinson i have a feeling it wont happen again greeley sighed i tried to persuade him not to look at the bodiesfor this very reason the loss alone was enough to drive any man mad he fished out a sheet of paper from a pile on the top of his desk this came for you a man from keswick brought it id gone by the hotel to deliver it thats how i walked into the middle of the chaos i summoned the doctor and went looking for you it was a telegram from inspector bowles in london report findings as soon as possible chief constable anxious for results rutledge read it and then shoved it into his pocket easy enough to sit in london and demand solutions where was the evidence to bring anyone to trial greeley said im told you were questioning people who have holdings closest to the elcott farm id been over that ground it was a waste of time taking the chair across from greeley rutledge answered him indirectly it was an excuse to see for myself what the obstacles were for instance none of the three farms was a likely place for josh robinson to seek shelter he didnt get on well with the haldneses sons and i dont think that even in desperation hed appeal to their mother the petersons are older and he hardly knew them which means he wasnt likely to trust them miss ingerson is gruff and keeps to herself shed probably seem more frightening than sympathetic to a child its not likely hes in hiding greeley agreed even if the killer lived in urskdale and the boy had named him a responsible adult would report to me everyone knows what happenedi could depend on that he paused this miss ashton ive spoken to her a time or two when she was in the village with grace elcott i had the feeling she looked down her nose at us that we didnt quite measure up to her london acquaintances have you spoken with her about her sister it seems odd to me that miss ashton would choose to visit this time of year dr jarvis tells me she ran off the road near the follet farm if it wasnt urgent why didnt she turn back long before keswick rather than risk life and limb she might have been killed theres an urgency there that smacks of knowledge the outsider she tells me grace elcott was afraid of her brotherinlaw paul well theres nonsense right there she must be covering up something if we cant find the child to tell us what he saw we need to find the murder weapon and trace it back to its owner can you make me a list of all the people in urskdale who own revolvers greeley said considering with a little thought i should have seen to that earlier but there was the search on my mind let me see he pulled out a sheet of paper the haldnes family and theirs is all but useless old as it is is it possible that their sons would let josh borrow it for a few days this one would probably blow up in his face they found it on a strand outside liverpool while on holiday rusted and full of sand i doubt they could even load it hamish grumbled then its no use on the list but rutledge answered well keep it in mind the elcotts themselves had one hamish said then why was the lass bringing one to her sister geralds rutledge asked on the heels of hamishs words actually the revolver belonged to geralds uncle theo elcott he worked in south africa for a number of years something to do with the railways he never trusted the boers and the story was hed shot one of them when a commando attacked his station i dont remember himhe left when i was still a boy and he died of a fever in on the boat back to england but he was quite a local hero and we all knew about the famous revolver it came back in his trunk i know because geralds father showed it to me i cant tell you whats become of it since i hadnt given it a thought for god knows how many years i dont suppose anyone else has and harry cummins mrs peterson had said something about geralds uncle rutledge interrupted greeley where is this trunk now i dont remember seeing anything like that in the house nor do i it could be paul elcotts got it is there anyone who knew the family well enough to answer a few questions before we go to elcott um i daresay it would be the ironmonger belfors he was a friend of pauls father and uncle rutledge stood then its time to ask him w hen rutledge opened the door of the ironmongers shop greeley at his heels very blue eyes examined the londoner as if weighing him up the man behind the counter was elderly with shoulders that were still broad and heavy his face was rugged pocked with scars from working hot iron and his broad hands were gnarled and twisted what can i do for you then belfors asked palms resting flat on the worn surface there was a clutter of goods everywhere barrels of nails and hinges and locks were stocked in front of ax heads shovels and spades gates for fences leaned against one wall rakes and pitchforks on either side and all manner of chains and hammers and spanners filled shelves a sharp odor of metal mixed with the scent of pipe smoke filled the air my name is rutledge aye from london thats right im told you knew gerald elcotts father his father he stared at rutledge for a moment as if this was a question hed never expected hes been dead for going on ten years but yes we were in school together henry and i belfors straightened we courted the same girl for a time a grin creased his face until she married someone else and did you know his brother theo the inspector here has no doubt already told you i did tell me about theo elcott whats this about then belfors glanced at greeley as if seeking an explanation but greeley said only answer the inspector if you will theo was railwaymad since he was a lad read everything he could find about trains that finally carried him off from here at the age of nineteen and i saw him but once after that where did this passion for railways take him rutledge asked patiently slough for a time then he was offered a position in south africa and he took it did well enough for himself out there but he died before he could return to england belfors glanced from greeley to rutledge whats this in aid of then he asked a second time you dont think theos come home to murder people do you there was a thread of sarcasm in the mans voice greeley started to speak but rutledge was already answering hardly were looking for his trunk the one holding his belongings the one that came back after he was buried at sea belfors sighed i can tell you the answer to that it was given to my sister when she went to northumberland to live and the contents what became of those how should i know clothes and shoes and hats and the like donated to the mission boxes most likely did he bring any souvenirs out of africa with him ah its the revolver you want to know about then why didnt you say so the revolver he used to shoot the boer i saw it once henry brought it in to show me he was that proud of his brother to be honest id have never thought of theo as a brave man he had his head in machinery when i knew him but i suppose he must have been brave enough when the time came rutledge held on to his patience what became of theos revolver do you know henry is the only one who can answer that and henry god rest him is in the churchyard surely one of his sons would have wanted it a token as it were of their uncles courage the bright blue eyes stared into rutledges dark ones i never thought to ask to tell you the truth i never knew and rutledge had to be satisfied with that but he had the oddest sense that belfors could have told him more that he was holding back the whole truth and palming off this stranger from london with bland halflies who was the old man protecting hamish answered the thought the only elcott thats left paul but rutledge was groping for something else something that seemed elusive and fragmentary at length he said by any chance did you offer to buy the revolver from henry when he brought it in to show you there was a flicker of change in the steady blue eyes henry never wanted to sell it why should he it was theos then who did offer to sell it to you but the shop door opened and a customer came in belfors turned away and the question hung in the air like a ghost waiting to be exorcised o utside in the street again rutledge said to greeley i want to go back to the farm and search before i speak to paul elcott for now id like to get a message to sergeant gibson in london can you see that its taken care of ill send constable ward to keswick with it he can drive the motorcar that should take less time and ask him to wait for a reply rutledge commandeered a desk and began to write he could almost feel hamish standing just behind him peering over his shoulder as he worked on a list of names for sergeant gibson t he house was quiet when rutledge returned to the hotel he walked through to the kitchen to find himself a glass of water and sat at the table where he could see the fell rising beyond the gardens and the play of light in the dips and hummocks of snow there were more ribs of stone showing now as the sun strengthened to warm the hard rock the slopes seemed less oppressive more tired as if they had been waging a battle against the blanket of white it was odd he thought how in the years hed come here to walk in season he hadnt really come to know the people or for that matter to understand them the days were spent on the fells if the weather was good and the evenings in their lodgings where he and his father or his friends had talked about the days experiences comparing views the difficulty of the tracks the plans for the next day wastwater had been one of his favorite haunts wild and beautiful always a challengehe could remember where he had walked even now but he couldnt bring back the name of a single family hed stayed with there was a light tap on the back door and it opened the man coming in was from one of the first of the search parties to report to rutledge henderson he nodded to rutledge and stood there in the doorway as if expecting to find someone else in the kitchen rutledge said standing up did you want cummins or miss fraser no ive come to speak to you henderson seemed reluctant to go on with whatever had brought him there no word of the lad he said finally sorry nothing umm and the killer are you any closer to finding out who it was were continuing our inquiries rutledge answered it was the standard reply when someone prodded the police and then with honesty he added im afraid we havent found him yet umm is there something youve come across that might help us henderson looked down at the hat in his hand i dont know but it was that strange hamish was speaking in the back of rutledges mind a voice that was a low rumble hes troubled it was clear that henderson was of two minds about what he had come to say rutledge held his tongue waiting patiently finally the man said i was bringing my youngest in to see dr jarvis last night hed fallenthere was a lump on his collarbone broken was it no but hed cried for an hour it worried my wife yes i can see that dr jarvis gave him something for the pain and let him rest half an hour before going home it was well after eleven oclock before we were on the road again your wife was with you corroborating evidence no just the boy and me i had come out of urskdale and was just past the knob and i looked up to see there was a light high up the knob was within view from where rutledge had been sitting are you sure it bobbed the way it would if a man was walking and where was it going towards urskdale or away away towards the saddle thats above the elcott property yes thats right i didnt see it for very long the light it was as if when he heard my team he shielded the lantern i looked again soon after that but there was no more sign of him whether he went on or came down i dont know its not usual to see people on the fells at night not one who hides his light he shifted from one foot to the other i wouldnt want to make trouble for a neighbor no i understand that all the same it was like someone walking over my grave i thought it was something you might want to hear yes thats very helpful mr henderson i appreciate your willingness to come forward i dont make out why it should have bothered me but it did can you guide me up there now to see if there are any tracks ive already walked up thats why i decided to come and speak to you mind i wasnt able to go up until well into the afternoon the sun had been at any footprints all i could see was that someone had passed there before me a man or a woman he shook his head there was no way to tell the sheep move about the underlying rock encourages the snow to melt prints change shape but someone had been there henderson seemed to be uncomfortable with his decision to tell what hed seen after a moment he nodded to rutledge clapped his hat back on his head and was gone out the door as it closed after him hamish said who moved about the fells at night and rutledge knew the name that hamish was expecting but he didnt answer i t was too late to go on to the farmhouse either the revolver was still thereor it had already been taken away josh robinson must have heard the story of his stepfathers uncle but who had inherited the famous revolver had the boy looked for it when his mother was occupied with the twins or his stepfather was out in the barn or up on the fell pastures and had the timing of the killings been set when he found that revolver for fear that his sisters prying or his mothers quick eye might prevent him from using it it was a chilling thought hamish was saying you didna fancy the valleys coming back to them in the dark what if the lad felt the same away from all that was familiar in london youre no the only one who doesna care to be shut in by the mountains what was there about this valley that had disturbed the boy even if hed been unhappy at home even if hed had trouble making friends in a closed community he hadnt grown up in even if he had wanted to go and live with his natural father it didnt explain murder was it geralds fault what had he done to the boy punished him too harshly what might have turned the tide in a childs mind and made murder something he could contemplate rutledge shook himself he couldnt put himself into joshs shoes their experiences had been too different but thinking back to something the schoolmaster had said about grace that she refused to consider letting her son go to his father he wondered just how long she herself would have been happy here had she seen her sons suffering and ignored it for fear it would feed her own had the happy family facade been on the verge of collapse and no one had realized it there hasna been another killing hamish was pointing out nor is there likely to be if it was the boy then who had been walking across the heights late at night with a lantern j anet ashton came in intending to warm her hands at the banked fires in the stove startled to see rutledge sitting there with the lamps unlit she stopped and drew in her breath as if she would have avoided him if she had not come so far into the kitchen ive walked until im cold to the bone it didnt help she said after a moment all ive done is make my ribs ache if youd like a cup of tea no that isthank you but no she went to the window and stood looking up at the fell where the westering sun was painting faint colors across the snow i hate this place she said fiercely almost to herself i hate what it did to my sisterand what it does to me what did it do to your sister it was too hard a life for grace she was city bred with shops and neighbors across the back fence wed always lived where there was some semblance of culture some semblance of comfort here they heat the rooms they use and the rest of the house is cold and there were no servants to help her if youd married gerald it would have been the same caught off guard she answered tartly if id married gerald hed have stayed in the south he owns land here hed have wanted to come back and run his sheep you couldnt have kept him away forever but then i wasnt in love with him was i she countered i dont know she turned to stare at him then took a deep breath but whatever she was on the point of saying she stopped herself why do you live in carlisle if you hate the north he went on i told you i was worried about grace i came up here to keep an eye on her its the only thing that could possibly have brought me here i expect rutledge said that if it came to a choice the local people would prefer to see you charged with the murders of your sister and her family youd be taken away and hanged rather than paul elcott and life could go on here as it had before a very tidy ending is that why you havent told inspector greeley whatever it is you suspect i dont know what i suspect he told her honestly thats probably true you prefer to sit here in the comfort of this kitchen with the soft sweet voice of elizabeth fraser in your ear angry he stood quickly and said you have no reason its my sister who is dead my niece and nephew as well and what have you done since you came here nothing she was suddenly angry too it wasnt poor josh who killed them you know that as well as i do but you wont take the killer into custody if you do youll have to leave urskdale your work will be done and sofor nowpaul elcott goes free what are you afraid of your own judgment whats wrong with you the war were you wounded is that what makes you doubt yourself when he didnt answer she said my sister grace was very much like elizabeth fraser dont you care about her or a little girl who had all her life ahead of her hazel was only seven he had himself under control again he said youre the only one with a revolverso far i cant prove that josh robinson had access to one if he did it makes a lie of your story that you came here in that storm to bring one to your sister and the same is true of paul elcott if hes the murderer wheres the weapon somewhere out there in the snow youll never find ithe didnt expect you to find it and if you wait for the weapon youll wait until spring summer she shook her head josh is dead all of them are dead i close my eyes at night and i hear them crying out to me i want someone to pay for their pain and my grief i want someone to remember that they were avenged justice isnt vengeance rutledge replied she looked him in the eye as far as im concerned its the same chapter twentyone m iss fraser sat at the table cradling her injured hand as she gave mrs cummins instructions on preparing the meal it would be a little late she wryly told rutledge as he brought in the last of the coal scuttles no matter harry cummins put his head in the kitchen doorway mr rutledge id like to speak to you rutledge set the scuttle by the parlor hearth and turned to shut the door as cummins stood by the cold hearth the man was uneasy his eyes moving around the room as if hed never seen it before i just heard youd asked london for information about a list of people living in urskdale news passed quickly damn ward yes thats true rutledge dusted his hands and added its not an unusual request routine in fact but the constable was out of line if he told you the names but people may have secrets that arentin any way connected to murder i have to be the judge of that rutledge replied what do you do with the information collected for you do you make it common knowledgedo you for instance tell inspector greeley or anyone else rutledges attention sharpened whats worrying you cummins iim not worried it isnt that curiosity its just curiosity hamish said he wouldna ask if it wasna something that mattered well cummins went on summoning a smile i daresay dinner will be a little late i apologize theres no need im not much of a hand in the kitchen it isnt something his voice trailed off ill just see if theres anything i can do thank you for bringing in the coalill see to it myself from now on and he was gone leaving the parlor door wide currents of cold damp air made the flame in the lamp on the table flicker and dip rutledge said aloud to hamish as well as to the shadows i wonder how well he knew the elcotts t he potatoes were not thoroughly cooked and the meat was tough but the people around the table said nothing about that as they ate their meal in silence a grayfaced hugh robinson had been allowed to join them and he kept his eyes on his plate as if ashamed of his earlier emotional outbreak it was rutledge who turned to elizabeth fraser and cut the roast mutton for her and buttered her bread she thanked him with her eyes but said nothing her bandaged hand was paining herhe could tell from the way she held it close to her body cushioning it mrs cummins was chattering about the food begging everyone to let her know whether it was to their liking cummins toyed with his meal and hugh robinson ate mechanically janet ashton answered mrs cummins at first and then fell silent the ticking of the kitchen clock and the shifting of the coals in the stove filled the room and the sound of the rising wind hamish stirred into life by the uncomfortable atmosphere said it wouldna be sae cheerful at a wake the wind was moaning around the eaves as they finished their flans mrs cummins began to clear away the dishes her husband rose to help her his sudden cheerfulness forced and uncomfortable as he took them from her and stacked them by the sink a fire had been lit in the small parlor and he promised the tea tray there in a few minutes janet ashton was the first to leave the kitchen and after a moment rutledge followed her as she went into the parlor she said out of the blue when will we be allowed to bury our dead it would be a kindness if youd tell hugh ill speak to inspector greeley tonight rutledge replied theres no reason why you shouldnt make arrangements for a service hugh robinson was on her heels but appeared not to have heard the question he sat in his chair like a lump speaking only when spoken to rutledge added you understand that you wont be allowed to leave even if the roads are passable i didnt expect we could janet ashton answered tartly e veryone had gone to bed and the house was quiet when rutledge brought himself up out of deep sleep he had learned that trick over the months and years in the trenches where it was too dangerous to light a match to see the time an internal clock worked nearly as well allowing him to snatch sleep where he could and still wake up for a change in the watch or the next attack he got up dressed and then walked silently down the passage towards the kitchen the fire had been banked and the air was already chilly he pulled on his boots then buttoned his coat letting himself out the kitchen door he kept to the shadows as far as a small shed and there leaned his back against the rough wall facing the knob he had borrowed field glasses from elizabeth fraser glasses kept for summer guests and he warmed them under his coat as he waited and for the next five hours he kept watch on the heights a little after four in the morning he gave up hamish had been telling him for an hour that no one would walk this way but he was reluctant to leave too soon by that time his feet were icy in his boots and his face where the scarf didnt cover it was stinging with the cold why had someone been out there on the heights last night and not tonight a lost sheepa shortcut home then why had it disturbed a plain man like henderson to see a shielded light just here because hamish said in the darkness it was too close to the elcott farm rutledge made his way back to the house and shook the snow off his boots before stepping inside elizabeth fraser was there in her chair her hand raised in alarm as if expecting him to attack her hamish had already hissed a warning and rutledge recovered first what on earth are you doing here at this hour he demanded taking off his hat so that she could see his face more clearly oh my god you frightened me she was saying catching her breath on the words where have you been whats happened nothing has happened icouldnt sleep no thats not true she challenged him her voice still trembling there was someone out there he wheeled to look over his shoulder then turned back to her i didnt see anyone i was walking back from the shed passing the barn she shook her head not by the barnit looked like a dogand someone following it hunched over staring at the ground if thats true he said unable to keep doubt out of his voice you shouldnt have been here you put yourself at risk if someone had seen you she heard his doubt i cant believe i dreamed it it was real i dont understand how he could have slipped past me but he wasnt sure that that was true standing there cold and tired his attention had wandered in the last half hour he looked back at the night the silent fell rising above him the looming shapes of outbuildings the stark patterns of white snow and dark shadows a dozen men could be hidden there and yet his sixth sense which had made a difference between life and death for four years of war told him there was no one in the yard when he turned again she was looking up at him her face a white oval in the pale light of the snow its happened again she said in a whisper another murder he asked quickly no she spun her chair maneuvering it around the table where the light couldnt reach her out of the darkness she answered him isee things sometimes what are you telling me imagination dreams i dont know he thought she was crying its a curse i cant be sure what it is sometimes my eyes play tricks or my brain i dont know she said again i wish i did but it was so real i couldnt move i couldnt do anything but watch but rutledge thought he understood she had been walking in her sleep it was perhaps what he had seen before on his first night at the hotel her restless mind driving her sent her out of bed and on missions of its own and this time inadvertently he had awakened her by coming in the door i wouldnt worry about it if i were you he assured her youre safe now and there was nothing out there but shadows moving with the clouds would you like a cup of tea something warm to send you back to sleep again you dont believe me she said forlornly my dear girl i do believe you ive known men at the front who saw whole armies coming towards them across no mans land straining their eyes to see how far away they were and giving the alarm when there was nothing there its caused by anxiety when you know the enemy is forming up to attack and the wait seems to tear at your nerve endings until youd rather face it now than later i have no enemy waiting to attack we all do rutledge told her sometimes its just a fear of ourselves she was silent for a time then she said what is your enemy he almost told her there in the dark where he couldnt see her face and she couldnt see his but he was afraid to put his fears into words and have to live with them tomorrow in the light of day the war he said finally and living when so many died yes i understand that he could hear her turn her chair towards the passage door will you latch the outer door for me mr rutledge yes good night good night her voice came softly to him from the passage he stood there in the kitchen feeling alone and terrifyingly empty t he next morning before anyone else had walked in the yard rutledge went out to look for prints but the rain had begun at first light and any that had been made in the dark were washed away even his own n ecessity in the north was the main consideration in all matters and the rector who came every other sunday to the little stone church to preach to the handful of villagers collected there in the cold sanctuary was called on to bury the dead while he was here mr slater was a middleaged man who appeared to have a dour outlook on life his eyes pouched and his eyebrows sprouting dark wiry hairs above the rims of his spectacles he went off to dine with dr jarvis and at two oclock was prepared to conduct the funeral of the five victims of urskdales unknown killer there were a number of people presentnot as many as rutledge had anticipated but inspector greeley standing with him in the back of the unadorned plain stone nave tried to explain stock need tending to but if the elcott family was well liked id have expected half the village to be here stock or no stock the line of coffins before the altar was heartbreaking the twins would be buried with their mother who had died trying to protect them hazel had her own small casket and someone had found a bouquet of white silk roses to place on the top the empty space where her brother might have been seemed to stand out with a cold clarity as if pointing out the failure of the men of urskdale to find his body the rector spoke of fate and the need to be prepared to meet death since no one knew when and how it might reach out to pluck its next victim rutledge listening considered it a macabre funeral oration raising the specter of a murderer roaming the dale in search of new prey even inspector greeley seemed to shiver at the images the thin voice carried to every cranny of the church and then with surprising compassion the rector addressed each of the family members in turn painting a warm portrait of each of the five victims that may or may not have been true rutledge observing the mourners with a policemans eye read nothing in their features except sympathy as they sat patiently through the service for the most part they appeared to agree with mr slaters words and once or twice he saw women resorting to their handkerchiefs as the rector touched a chord of memory children restless beside their elders stared at the rafters and the single stainedglass window and sometimes at the coffins there were a number of boys close in age to josh robinson rutledge noted them and saw nothing in their behavior to indicate they kept any secrets about their missing classmate mrs haldnes sat upright as if in judgment with her own sons around her mrs peterson had not come the hendersons were there with a young child who fidgeted in pain henderson put his arm around the boy and drew him closer as if afraid of losing him it was a somber party who gathered under dripping umbrellas in the churchyard beyond the yews someone had scraped away the snow and the sexton had managed to dig three graves in the soggy earth with no flowers and the sun hidden behind heavy clouds the rain an uncompromising drizzle now and the rector reading the last words of hope and resurrection as if they were a curse the depression of the mourners only deepened it was a bleak service the wind howling around their shoulders the ground gaping cold and hard the rector was hoarse his voice barely audible and half buried in his black muffler paul elcott stood as if alone head bowed face scourged with grief nothing in the slump of his shoulders and the tight grip of his hands on the bone handle of the umbrella indicated that he was comforted by the service beside him was hugh robinson face unreadable his emotions locked too far away to be touched his eyes werent on the coffins but on the heights as if saying goodbye to his son as well as his daughter farther away closer to the yews janet ashton also stood alone the veil borrowed from mrs cummins shielding her rutledge couldnt read her thoughts behind the dark folds of silk but her blackgloved hands held her body as if her ribs were aching and she felt the cold deeply elizabeth fraser was there in her chair she bit her lip once during the final words of interment and ran a gloved finger over the raindrops that glistened on the black robe across her knees once she looked up and caught his eyes on her and seemed disconcerted for a moment harry cummins had attended but his wife hadnt come to the graveside pleading dizziness he frowned as he watched the coffins sink into the wet earth and something made him glance towards elizabeth fraser as if he could sense what she was thinking belfors the ironmonger was there with his wife she was a fair woman with gray eyes tall and slender and carrying her years well they had brought paul elcott in their carriage friends and neighbors formed a ring around the raw earth their faces a blend of sadness and uneasiness hamish said as the rain pattered down gently on rutledges umbrella its no verra comforting id ha had a piper for my funeral rutledge winced thinking that hamish must be close enough to stand under the spread of black silk with him no pipers here he said under his breath but the mountains ringing the valley and the wide expanse of black water in the lake would have echoed the chilling skirl and sent it back again a dozen times chapter twentytwo t he funerals baked meats were sandwiches and cups of tea provided by harry cummins for those mourners who chose to accompany the survivors of gerald elcotts family to the hotel comforting words were quietly offered to robinson miss ashton and elcott but no one mentioned the house at the farm where bloodstains were still visible in spite of repeated scrubbings and no one in rutledges hearing referred to the way five people had died but both would as hamish noted be discussed in hushed voices on the way home some had said their farewells at the church unwilling to be caught on the road by decembers early dusk jim and mary follet had come to the hotel out of respect but soon took their leave follet shrugging into his coat in the front hall commented to rutledge that it was a sad day for urskdaleand would be sadder still when everyone learned who was to blame a few villagers lingered most of them friends of paul elcotts exchanging reminiscences with him mr and mrs belfors who carried elcott off with the last of the mourners ignored rutledge in their farewells janet ashton and hugh robinson sat together awkwardly talking for several minutes longer and then janet went to her room saying she wouldnt be dining that night hugh soon followed since his attempt at suicide hed kept to himself inspector greeley saw them all off and then departed with dr jarvis following on his heels harry cummins excused himself and went to see to his wife she had made a brief appearance in the dining room and then wandered away as if distracted by her thoughts rutledge standing by the dining room windows wasnt aware that he was being watched his eyes were on the dark line of urskwater finally elizabeth frasers voice broke into the tangle of his thoughts youre tired how do you expect to see clearly when you drive yourself like this he turned staring at her you know the right things to say dont you he asked with surprise old bowels his superior in london would have wasted no time in pointing out rutledges failure hamish knew his shortcomings for years hed grown used to judging himself harshly as well elizabeth fraser smiled faintly its common sense thats all and to be truthful because youre the stranger you may well see us for what we are no matter how hard we try to hide ourselves behind masks thats what inspector greeley cant do dont you see hes lived here too long to step aside youre to be his scapegoat and after youve gone hell blame you and scotland yard for any resentment it was an astute comment im used to that rutledge answered making an effort to smile and yet as hamish was reminding him their murderer had to be one of a handful of possibilities josh robinson janet ashton paul elcott even if the murder weapon never turned up even if the motive for murder proved to be elusive there would be something somewhere to point him towards the killer was it because hed saved janet ashtons life that he didnt want it to be her what was it the arabs of the desert believed save a persons life and that person was indebted forever he belonged to his savior as surely as if he were enslaved not in the physical sense of enslaved but in the emotional ties that lay between two people but he didnt want janet ashton to belong to him perhaps as hamish was telling him he just wanted to believe that her life had been worth saving for better things than the hangman r estless rutledge retrieved his damp coat and hat and went to walk down the streets of urskdale the rain had stopped but he tugged his coat collar up against the raw wind that continued to blow down from the fells bringing the bite of snow with it the houses huddled along the road with a grim determination the stone they were built of hardly distinguishable from the saddle looming behind them here and there a plum or apple tree grew in the gardens behind the homes but for the most part no trees broke the stark line of the roofs there was a bleak beauty here but in winter with snow piled high against stone walls and slate tiles there werent many people on the streets and those who were out seemed to hurry heads down nodding briefly to others as they passed many of the shops had been boarded up closed while the storm raged and left as they were while the men were out searching the fells it was rutledge found himself thinking hard to keep shelves stocked when goods lorries and wagons couldnt get through on the other hand short of the drive to keswick these had little competition he couldnt help but remember what janet ashton had told him about her sister that grace had grown up in very different surroundings how happy had she been here in urskdale had the isolation and the loneliness made her regret her choice hamish reminded him that shed had the opportunity to leave when her first husband returned from the dead but she was pregnant again by that time with twins beyond the church where the road curved to run along the top of the lake he could see the bare earth where the bodies of the elcotts had been buried you would think rutledge told himself that in such a tiny community everyone would have known everyone elses business and gossip might have pointed to some troublesome questions about the elcott familytheir enemiestheir problems hamish answered him there hasna been time for gossip no wi the storm and then the business of finding the laddie which was true but even when the gossip began he would be the last to hear it dr jarvis came out of a house door and seemed startled to find rutledge in his path has there been news the doctor asked quickly are you looking for me i wasnt rutledge answered pleasantly but id like to speak to you now that weve met its as cold as hell out here jarvis said but my surgery is just over there i expect ive missed my tea but i have some medicinal sherry thats warming he led rutledge to a house that was larger than most with a small surgery attached in what had once been the carriageway to the yard unlocking the door he stepped inside and lit a lamp rutledge looked around with interest a tiny waiting room and two doors on the inner wall one to the examining room and the other to an office where comfort appeared to matter more than professional status there were no windows as the office abutted the house but large paintings on the wall added brightness catching rutledges eye on them jarvis said we had a local artist in my wifes fathers day more energetic than accurate but they are appreciated by my patients the scenes were rustic renderings of the valley views that added the garish colors of sunset or sunrise to a view from the claws with a walker poised on the ledge to look down at the lake another was of the knob in a storm a third showed a line of walkers traversing the long back a smaller painting was of a deep and narrow defile where sheep were being herded by dusty men the artist had caught the light and shadow to better effect than he had the sunset whats this rutledge gestured to the work as jarvis handed him a sherry one of the old drover roads out of the valley drift roads theyre called closed by a rock slide two or three generations ago i can tell you thats a fanciful view looks more like cheddar gorge than the reality what did you wish to see me about not my paintings ill be bound rutledge said taking the chair across the desk from him you delivered mrs elcotts twins yes thats true what was her mood through the pregnancy was she happy looking forward to a larger family and the children josh and his sister how did they see this change in their lives jarvis thought for a moment grace was happy enough looking forward to giving her husband children of his own hazel was excited to have a sister she was a sweet child very motherly helping prepare the cribs after we discovered grace was carrying twins gerald was solicitous worried about his wife fussing over her and josh josh was olderuncertain i think whether he would lose his mothers attention shed leaned on him until gerald came along the boy was only just learning to share her now there were to be other children i think it worried him he asked me every time i came out to the farm if his mother was going to be all right jealous was he jarvis stared at him just where are you going with such questions the schoolmaster blackwell believed josh was unhappy and would gladly have gone to london to live with his natural father but his mother wasnt willing to let him go young as he was reluctantly jarvis replied i cant answer that directly i can tell you two things it was difficult for josh when his father returned out of the blue he scarcely knew this stranger whod been dropped back into his life it was confusing for him emotionally hazel of course had only the faintest memories of robinson and seemed most comfortable with him but grace herself was troubled by her dilemma which must have baffled her son its possible he didnt understand why with his father home again they shouldnt be a family now i dont know im speculating i will tell you this it was gerald who was the rock from the beginning willing to let her choose and the second thing young josh ran away from home the week before his mother delivered id been summoned because she was experiencing false labor with twins it was important that i should be there after id finished my examination hazel told me that josh was missing had been for more than a day gerald had gone searching for him but i was the one who found him the same place in fact that paul used to hide when he was a boy it was a ruined sheep pen up by fox scar and the rocks had tumbled in such a way as to form a shallow cave josh was there sulking so the boy knew enough about his surroundings to hide from his stepfather did he explain himself to you i didnt give him a chance he was cold and miserable when i found him i sat on the stone wall and told him that hed worried his poor mother sick and she mustnt be upset like that so close to her time that it was dangerous i told him i wanted to hear no more of such nonsense or id write to his father in london and tell him how unhelpful josh was being the boy promised to behave himself and i took him down to his mother and that was the end of it jarvis sighed the night grace delivered i came to the farm just after dinner to attend her josh was ill hed eaten something that disagreed with him retching and vomiting outside like a sick dog he asked me something as i gave him medication for it he said will i die and i told him roundly he would not was he relieved rutledge asked to hear that he would survive i didnt have time to waste on josh the twins were large and i feared a breech birth i was busy trying to save them hamish said the boy was crying for help so he resented the arrival of the twins you think resented i wouldve said he feared them if that didnt seem so farfetched and yet after they were born he was fiercely protective of them as if to make up for any earlier hostility how did gerald elcott treat josh after the twins were born was the boy made to feel a part of this new family i never saw any difference in their relationship gerald told me once that hed liked the boy from the start and was willing to be patient it might have worked out quite well but then the natural father turned up after everyone had thought him dead it must have been impossible for young josh to decide exactly where his allegiance lay jarvis finished his sherry and offered rutledge a second but rutledge shook his head in my experience the doctor said boys that age are nearly inarticulate they can hurt inside and hide it very well even if they want to confide in someone they often dont know where to find the words he took rutledges empty glass and set it on the tray by the bookcase i dont know whats behind these questions theyve disturbed me i shant rest until we get to the bottom of this wretched business j anet ashton was at the kitchen table staring moodily out the window at the snow gleaming in the last of the light rutledge walked into the room before he saw her there for the lamps hadnt been lit there was no unobtrusive way to back out and so he came in and sat across from her after a moment he asked if she were feeling better and she nodded absently as if her injuries werent important compared to whatever was on her mind tell me about josh he said then she turned to look at him scorn in her face no dont tell me about paul elcott and i asked you to tell me about the childnot defend him rutledge said equably she flushed so you did an ordinary boy troublesome at times and wild at others how did he get along with his stepfather well enough josh wasnt bred to sheep farming its cold and wet and dirty work the lanolin in the sheeps wool irritated his hands made them blister and crack but he understood that sheep put the food on his table and he tried to do what he could to help his stepfather they seemed to respect each other after a fashion and after the twins were born he wasnt excited about the twins before they arrived grace wrote to say that he was restless and unhappy and she put it down to the pregnancy shed had a difficult one this timei expect that bothered the boy she was very sick in the morning for five months and then after that her feet and hands were bloated but the delivery went smoothly enough and she recovered quickly amazingly so she would laugh and say i was eating for three janet it was horrid i felt like a house tell me about elcott what did you know about him she got up to stand at the window her back to him actually i introduced gerald to grace i knew him before she did the words were reluctant as if the admission was painful where did you know him i lived just down the street from grace in ellingham hampshire i went to londonit was the first year of the warfor six months trying to help my firm overcome the shortage of men i was a typist and i became a clerk and then actually drove the delivery lorry for a time when grace wrote that hugh had been killed i went back to ellingham it was gerald who gave me a lift he was on his way to see a friend in hospital there i rather liked him and he came to see me a number of times before he was sent back to the front it was chance that brought him together with grace after he was wounded and had gone through surgery in london they sent him to ellingham of all places to convalesce as it happened i was too busy to go down to visit him i was trying to earn a living for my sister and myself when i did get there all gerald could talk about was grace i realized hed fallen in love with her i told him it wouldnt do she was only recently widowed six or seven months before but he wasnt listening she turned and smiled at rutledge id fallen in love with gerald worst luck and it wasnt me he loved i was the wrong sister when he said nothing she added i had a reason to kill grace if you like jealousy but i would never have harmed gerald he was no good to me dead a t ten oclock that night rutledges motorcar returned from keswick constable ward getting down stiffly said ive only half what you wanted sergeant gibson will be sending on the rest in a day or two he held out a sealed envelope rutledge opened it as he walked back into the parlor in the lamplight he read the contents refolded the sheet of paper and stood there deep in thought constable ward broke the silence if you dont need me yes rutledge said turning its fine go home ill have a reply in the morning when the constable had gone rutledge read the sheet of paper again one paragraph stood out i spoke with gerald elcotts commanding officer he tells me elcott was the chief witness against a private soldier who was found guilty of shooting and severely wounding his sergeant under cover of a german attack elcotts view was that the shooting was deliberate because the sergeant had had words with private bertram taylor some hours before over a woman after sentencing private taylor called elcott a liar and threatened him that was three years ago a fortnight ago taylor was being transferred to hospital for what appeared to be a heart seizure he managed to overpower his guard and escape he hasnt been seen since no one thought it necessary to warn lieutenant elcott a brief description of the escaped prisoner followed it may be hamish said in the back of rutledges mind that inspector greeley has finally got his stranger chapter twentythree i n the night maggie heard the boy crying she got out of bed her feet chilled by the cold floor and walked quietly to the door of his room the crying stopped she walked on got herself a glass of water and let sybil out into the dark yard the dog growled deep in her throat but it was a fox trotting by his long brush visible in the moonlight she could hear the sheep in the pen stirring but they were more than a match for a fox it was a wolf that worried maggie not fourlegged but two hunting her lamb the ax stood by the door ready to hand but sybil came back soon after that and maggie closed and barred the door when she crawled back into her cold bed she listened for a moment the room next to hers was quiet either hed cried himself to sleep or he had heard her stirring and buried his head in the bedclothes after about five minutes she heard sybil scratch lightly on the door of the boys room the door opened quietly and she heard the click of sybils nails as she crossed the room and then nothing as the dog jumped up on the bed that had been maggies fathers satisfied she pulled her blankets higher and settled herself for sleep w hen rutledge brought him londons information the following morning inspector greeley ordered copies made of the description given of private taylor and asked sergeant miller to make certain these were distributed to everyone in urskdale ill see to it he added that word also reaches the farms but they were questioned about strangers earlier none was reported a needle in a haystack finding any trace of taylor if he had any sense hes made for the london stews where he can lose himself rutledge recalled what mrs peterson had said at south farm if he was bent on mischief he wasnt likely to call attention to himself was he its an off chance rutledge agreed still i like taylor a damned sight better than the suspects we have in hand it makes no sense to me that that child killed his family it makes no sense that paul should have done it hes not a man with backbone if you follow me i dont know what to think about miss ashton shes a dark horse but its hard to imagine a woman shooting children what else did your sergeant come up with janet ashton gave up a very good position in the city to move to carlisle her reason for leaving was her sisters ill health id never heard that grace elcott was ill other than the pregnancy that is go on theres very little information about hugh robinson he was a prisoner of war came home to be treated for a stubborn infection in his back and when he was dismissed he took up his old position as a bookkeeper at a firm in hampshire that tallies greeley leaned back in his chair nothing on paul elcott not surprising hes lived all his life here in westmorland there was one other name on rutledges list but he said nothing about it to greeley w ord of taylor had already preceded rutledge to the hotel when he arrived janet ashton demanded to know if there was any truth in the story that they had found their murderer because i dont believe a word of it gerald never said anything to me about this man youre looking for and grace would have told me if he had said anything to her apparently during the leave when you met him elcott was testifying in the courtmartial there was insufficient evidence for taylor to hang but he was convicted on lesser charges the man was in prison rutledge told her and in spite of his threats he was in no position to carry them out i daresay it was an experience elcott preferred not to talk about she shook her head you didnt know gerald he wasnt the sort to ignore danger the authorities didnt send word to him that taylor had escaped elcott had no warning so youre satisfied that the case is solved were free to go and if the police ever find this man taylor theyll charge him with my sisters murder and youll be in derbyshire or wherever the yard decides to send you next and it wont matter another feather in your cap for closing the case you arent free to go anywhere until i tell you that you can leave rutledge answered harshly on the point of losing his temper as for taylor its possible hes guilty but until im satisfied on that score this investigation is not closed he turned on his heel and stalked down the passage to the kitchen elizabeth fraser was there and she looked up at his angry face after a moment she said is there anything i can do im going to be out for a time he told her if anyone asks for me ill be back as soon as possible he was cranking the motorcar when cummins came around the side of the house as the motor caught and he was opening the drivers door cummins called inspector i need to speak with you rutledge shifted the motorcar into reverse if it can wait until i come back i dont know cummins said flustered i want to ask about the information you got from london then it can wait he put the motorcar into gear and turned towards the road the snow was melting enough now to splash as he drove through the ruts and it took him no time at all to reach the farm of maggie ingerson but the lane was still high with unplowed snow and he swore as the wheels bit and slipped up the long incline to the yard she came out before he could stop the motor and get down to knock she said nothing waiting for him to speak to her i need your help he told her you told me the last time i came that you were one of the few people who could find the track that led over the fells to the coast road i told you i could find it on a good day she answered him warily it may already be too late but i want to see for myself if anyone has taken that track out of the valley and how am i to do that with this leg id hardly make it to yon sheep pen and id be exhausted and in pain youd be no better off than you are now and id be worse its possible someone came into urskdale by that track it hasnt been used in years how was he to know it was there in the first place and how did he manage to find it in a storm like that one hamish said the woman is right it isna possible rutledge answered him anything is possible but he wasnt aware until the words were out of his mouth that hed spoken them aloud youre no thinking clearly but maggie had taken the comment in stride thats right men can fly now cant they but its not likely i ever will and its not likely this late in the day that youd manage to see any footprints even if you found the old drift road the snows melted all week the rain took a good bit of it off the heights its a wildgoose chase is there anyone else who could take me where i want to go gerald elcott might have known where to look drew taylor might taylor rutledge asked quickly is that his last name thats right you know him then he took me up the fell that rises behind the hotel for a better look at urskdale you might ask him then but im no use to you and my soups on the boil and will be all over the floor if i dont go in and see to it she turned and went back into her house closing the door firmly behind her rutledge swore taylors no uncommon a name it was true he turned the motorcar gingerly then paused to look at the prints of wellingtons in the snow around the sheep pen beyond the shed surely on virgin snow tracks might still be visible he drove down the farm lane faster than was safe in a hurry to get back to urskdale d rew taylor lived in one of the houses that straggled out of the village just beyond the church it was stone low to the ground and seemed to belong to a generation long gone rutledge had got taylors direction from elizabeth fraser asking her if taylor had had any sons in the war she shook her head he never married hes not the sortif you wanted the perfect lighthouse keeper it would be drew he prefers his own company knocking at the door now rutledge looked at the garden that lay to one side of the house it was well kept the autumns debris cut and taken away the roses set in the one sunny corner heavily mulched far up their stems behind the house he could see barns sheds and higher up the long shoulder of the hill grazing sheep after a time drew came to the door opening it to stare at rutledge ive come for information the policeman said taylor waited ive just spoken with maggie ingerson she tells me you might know how to find the old drift road that led over the mountains to the coast it was closed by a rock fall in my fathers fathers time he said to sheep perhaps what about one man could he find the way in and make it over the slide whats this in aid of its important to be certain no one came intoor went out of the valleythat way where no one could see him drew grunted late in the day to be looking for signs of that snowd covered any prints long before we got up there to the rock fall just as it had the boys besides a stranger would have to know where the beginning or the end of the track was wouldnt he to find his way he wouldnt be likely to stumble across the old road and just like that know what it was or where it led not this time of year but it could be done if you were set on reaching the valley by the back door and someone had told you how its possible drew grudgingly answered him unwittingly using maggie ingersons words but not likely then show me if you will what were talking about the man shrugged well then ill just get my coat he shut the door in rutledges face and was gone for some five minutes when he came back he was wearing heavier shoes a scarf and his thick coat rutledge had expected to be directed back to maggie ingersons farm but drew taylor sent him instead to the elcotts they arrived to find paul elcotts carriage there but drew told rutledge to drive on for some two hundred yards beyond the house a broad track led to a pen where the sheep were brought in for shearing and stopped just beyond they got out there drew led the way past the pen and began his steady climb up a track that was apparently clear to him but invisible to rutledge other boots had packed the snow to an icy crust indicating that a party of searchers had started from here but after an hour or more taylor struck out in a different direction at one point when they had stopped on the high shoulder rutledge asked did you have relatives who served in the war drew taylor looked at him im the last of my name here why gerald elcott knew a private soldier by the name of taylor they served together for a time or so ive just been told gerald asked me the same question when he came back to the dale he turned and began to climb again common enough name in another hour they had reached the long ridge and made their way along it another rank of mountains lower but just as rough forked off to the south and east towards the coast on a clear day you can see the sea from here drew taylor told rutledge the drift road you want cuts in over there see how the ridge dips and flattens you can run sheep up and over it and horsemen could follow if they started up from the ingerson farm and cut over still that was chancey mostly it was the sheep the curdogs and drovers on foot i have in mind a man determined and alone and ive told you before its hit or miss in a storm and at night he shook his head id not attempt it myself they bring charabancs up to wastwater dont they filled with sightseers but thats an easier route youd never get one into urskdale save by way of buttermere and theres nothing at urskdale to make it worthwhile whats that hut there the one where the roof has fallen in a shieling a shepherds hut my fathers father told me that william wordsworth walked there once and called it a tolerable view but whether its true or not i cant say and the rock fall we can reach it from here he described the route to take rutledge followed his pointing finger another hour or more at the least and more to the point without landmarks how would anyone find his way from there to one of the nearby farms the elcotts at high fell apple tree south farm the ingerson holding by guess and by god if at all he could feel the stiffness in his knees from the climb in snow it would have been far more difficult and the risk of getting lost would be high but what if the interloper had come during the daylight hours and stopped at the hut where wordsworth had admired the view got his bearings there and then waited for dark who was to see him but a passing raven the storm catching him up would have persuaded him that he was safe from detection and afterward after the murders he had only to wait on the other side of the rock fall until the worst of the snow had abated hamish said a man would have to be intent on revenge to attempt it the sun was moving faster than they were walking but rutledge told taylor i want to see the fall did any of the search parties look on the far side of that to what end its not likely the lad could get across it he moved on breaking through the crust of snow with the surefootedness of one of his sheep after a time he pointed to where the ravens had been at the torn body of a seagull blown inland in one of the storms the fate of the lad hamish said if he got this far trying to stave off discouragement rutledge kept on taylor seemed tireless his legs moving with precision over the stones and folds and loose scree that rutledge couldnt see after a time they came to the rock fall that had turned this road into a footnote in the history of urskdale as far as rutledge could tell the spread was a good fifty feet wide jagged edges protruded through the snow and when he reached out to test their stability rutledge could feel the unsteadiness of the larger stones on top already many of them had tumbled down to form small hillocks and traps for the unwary foot with good light and steady nerves it would be possible to clamber over the fall just and sheep were not stupid as someone had pointed out to him earlier no bellwether or dog would risk seeing the flock trapped here and it would take blasting and long weeks of digging to make even a single track through the debris rutledge looked at it and then began to fight his way up the shambles of rock and loose scree here drew taylor began and then fell silent rutledge struggled upward slipped and banged a knee found his footing again and moved on he was young and agile but the snow was heavy making handholds hard to pick out and then without warning he began to fall as a single rock moved under his boot and dislodged its neighbors as well with nothing but his fingers to break his descent he bumped down the hidden obstacles and landed hard on his back for an instant he lay there winded drew came hurrying across to him but rutledge waved him away there was a scrape on his cheek his shins had been bruised in five or six places and an elbow ached but nothing was broken and gathering his feet under him again he stood that was foolish his guide scolded him break a leg and whos to drag you out of here with darkness coming on rutledge clapped his hands to dust the snow off his gloves and then brushed down his coat and his trousers his hat had gone rolling and he picked it up the palm of his right hand was stinging and he took off his glove to look at it there were bloody punctures in a halfmoon crescent what the hell he began reaching for his handkerchief to wipe away the blood it was an odd wound for a rock to make and it looked like nothing he could identify turning back to where he had fallen he considered the ascent hed tried to make by instinct hed taken the line of least resistance closest to the walland the lowest point the most logical place after a moment he began to dig in the snow where hed landed drew squatted on his haunches to watch it took several minutes to find what his hand had come down on hard enough to break the skin in five places he held it up for drew to see a heel from a boot with the nails still embedded in the leather he turned it over and matched it to the wounds on his palm someone has climbed over this slide or tried the question is when last summer id say we had a number of cambridge lads here not much money and not overmuch sense we brought one of them down with a broken ankle from the knob in my book he was lucky he didnt break his neck b y the time rutledge had reached the hotel again the moon had risen casting a cold silver light over the fells etching them against the sky it was very late every bone in his body ached all he wanted was his bed and a nights sleep his hand stung where the nails had gone in two of them deeper than the others as his weight had come down there first it had been difficult to crank the car when they reached the elcott farm but drew taylor had been eager for them to be on their way as if he expected the ghosts of the dead to come out of the kitchen door in their bloody shrouds paul elcotts carriage was gone and the house was dark moonlight touching the upper windows gave them an eerie brightness almost as if someone had lit the lamps in the bedchambers up on the fell something was moving a line of sheep slowly made their way to a place flat enough for them to settle for the night and then drew taylor said into the silent darkness he must have stood about here where we are that night the killer he could have seen that the lamps were still lit in the kitchen and known where to find the family or he might have waited in the barn until he could be sure they were all there what went through his mind do you think it was an unexpected question from a man who ordinarily had little to say and he waited as if wanting an answer rutledge looked at the yard the shapes of the outbuildings the peak of the house roof the shadow of the fell behind anticipation he couldnt know how it would turn out no i think it must have been hunger a wanting so deep he could taste it and drew taylor climbed into the motorcar without looking at rutledge chapter twentyfour r utledge woke to hamishs voice the heel of a shoe isna evidence of anything the voice seemed to be there with him in the room and he kept his eyes tightly closed against it it proves someone was there at the rock fall aye i grant you that but a heel canna tell you when it was lost or fra whose shoe or if the wearer walked sae far out of curiosity or murderous intent yon rock fall is in plain view its the old drovers road that climbed to it and passed on beyond it thats been lost rutledge had left the motorcar idling long enough to put a message under the knocker on greeleys door last night asking him to contact the police along the coast tell them to question hotels and shopkeepers about any holidaymaker who had shown an unusual interest in an old drift road coming down from urskdaleor who was curious about other ways to reach the dale its a wildgoose chase its a beginning rutledge retorted if we dont get to the bottom of this a clever barrister for the defense will hamish made no answer after a time rutledge opened his eyes to an empty room i t had slipped his mind that harry cummins was eager to speak to him it was brought home again when cummins waylaid him in the passage as rutledge was on his way to the kitchen for tea and a late breakfast cummins was pressing and took him into the empty dining room where rutledge could see that hed been waiting for some time a dish of halfsmoked cigarettes sat by the one chair pulled out from the table without preamble the innkeeper said its about the names of people to investigate that you sent to the yard yes rutledge answered warily thinking of a name he had not given to greeley or anyone else to his surprise cummins asked directly am i on that list why should you be rutledge countered because youve had your suspicions ive read them in your face not all the answers have come back rutledge replied evenly is there anything you want to tell me before they do ii just need to know if my name is there i havent done anythingnot to the elcotts but im used toitssomething personalid rather not have it talked about not here where everyone knows ones business before the day is out it might be best then to tell me what youre hiding im not hidingat least nothing to do with murder its a very private matter you dont understand what its like sometimes surely youve done something youre not especially proud of the expression on rutledges face tightened and harry stepped back his hand on the chair behind him i didnt mean look forget i said anything its just that everyones nerves are on edge you can feel it even elizabeth isnt herself she snapped at me this morning and shes never done that never if she can be unsettled by all this it isntsurprisingthat others should be he turned away towards the window if only you could take into custody whoever it was killed the elcotts we could be at peace again how long have you known miss fraser rutledge asked he turned so quickly he nearly knocked over the chair elizabeth for about four years at a guess why how did she come to urskdale ii offered her a position here to be company for my wife while i was away fighting elizabeth had just recovered from her accident she wanted to get away from pity she wanted a quiet place where no one cared how or why she was bound to that chair he gestured around him as if the cold dining room was sanctuary it suited us both tell me about her accident truthfully i dont know what happened i was in green park in london early one morning walking off too much whiskey the night before and she was sitting there in her chair crying i went over to her and asked if there was anything i could do she said talk to me until ive got myself together again and i did fifteen minutes later she thanked me and there was an end to it go on i met her on the street a day or so afterward and she said i remember how lonely the urskdale mountains are and how the afternoon light glints on the lake im afraid i dont remember your name i took her to a shop for tea and we talked for a bit i think i told her how unhappy my wife was it had been worrying me and there was nothing i could do you cant very well tell the army to go hang i dont know if i suggested she come here to be with vera or she did it didnt matter i was grateful a fortnight after that i put her on the train and said goodbye i sailed three days later but she wrote to me while i was away vera couldnt shed begun drinking you see she was certain id be killed so many were and you knew nothing about elizabeth fraser before sending her north that was damned trusting i was desperate she seemed gentle and kind my wifes family hadnt spoken to her since we were married vera needed someone my god what else was i to do g reeley arrived as rutledge was preparing to leave the hotel whats this about the old drift road its another way into the valley rutledge told him yes but not a likely way it wasnt likely that josh robinson survived but you searched for him i intend to be thorough in this matter as well ill send someone to inquire although its time wasted even the summer walkers dont venture that far its rough going in good weather and the views are no better than others easier reached not when youve got wastwater or buttermere to choose from rutledge reached into his pocket for the heel what do you make of this i found it on the urskdale side of the fall hardly evidence of murder god knows how long it has been there what do you know about drew taylor drew hes lived here all his life his mother was eightyseven when she died and was rumored to be something of a terror little wonder he never married i doubt theres a woman in six counties mrs taylor would have thought fit for her son you arent suspecting him next curiosity elcott served with a man called taylor there was ill feeling between them i wondered if there could be a connection elcott never had much to say about his war and taylors got no family indeed rutledge got up to set his plate and cup on the sink i want to talk to belfors again are you coming with me b elfors was just opening his shop he nodded to the two policemen and led them inside i expect it isnt a new spade youre after the ironmonger said the revolver that theo elcott brought home from africa he didnt bring it home he died on the ship of a fever where is it now i dont know henrygeralds fathershowed it me he didnt tell me what hed done with it was that the only time youd seen it belforss eyes flicked away and he ran a cloth over the counter as if a speck of dust had caught his attention i cant remember to tell you the truth rutledge nodded to greeley ill have this man taken into custody if you please inspector on what charge greeley demanded caught off guard hes concealing evidence rutledge turned on his heel and walked out the door behind him he heard belfors call here but he kept going at the tiny police station he went into greeleys office without a word to sergeant miller and shut the door behind him it wasnt long before he could hear greeley coming through the outer door belfors loudly complaining of injustice and threatening to take up this vile behavior with rutledges superiors sergeant miller added his voice to the fray demanding to know what belfors had done rutledge could hear him surely hes not our murderer sir mr belfors hamish scolded it wasna necessary rutledge didnt answer him after a time greeley opened the door to his office and said as he came in are you satisfied this is irregular behavior irregular perhaps but i dont like being lied to in half an hour well see if mr belfors has decided to cooperate i n the event belfors was still seething when rutledge went back to the single holding cell to speak with him ill have a word with the chief constable about this see if i dont when youre charged with being an accessory to murder he may take a different view the words sobered him instantly ive killed no one perhaps not id prefer to let the courts decide rutledge started for the door belfors said look youve got it wrong i havent seen that weapon in years and im not about to cause trouble for other people on the basis of some boyhood prank rutledge paused at the door mr belfors i only wanted to know under what circumstances youd last seen that revolver if you feel your conscience wont let you answer my questions i have no choice but to let a judge ask them damn you henry elcott was my friend his sons were my friends curiosity killed the cat mr belfors you asked henry elcott to show you his brothers revolver did you stand there at the counter in your shop and hold it in your hands did you sight down the barrel and rest your finger on the trigger its what most men would do vicariously reliving someone elses exploit no one else from urskdale had killed a boer it was exciting you could picture the man striding into theo elcotts railway station to shoot him before he could use the telegraph to warn of the commandos whereabouts or perhaps he was plotting to take over the station and use it to ambush a train it was a favorite boer tactic to disrupt british lines of communication and theo elcott who was train mad and not the sort to shoot anyone had done what neither you nor henry nor any other man from urskdale had had the chance to do he paused and thats why you knew the weapon when you saw it again belfors stared at him who was it i tell you i wont betray him was it josh robinson who had brought that gun in to sell to you knowing you might like to have it because youd known theo better than most it wasnt the boy rutledge remembered belfors and his wife standing beside paul elcott as the bodies of his brother and his brothers children were lowered into the earth it was paul wasnt it he reminds you of theo quiet not the sort to dazzle the world as gerald had done youre fond of paul and youve kept an eye on him since his father henry died belfors stood there saying nothing youre a bastard did you know that he finally snarled its not going to help either of us if i run out of patience mr belfors i think it might be wise for you to tell me the rest of the story now silence at last belfors answered grudgingly he was only fifteen he knew id liked theo he brought me the revolver and told me his father wanted to sell it but not to a stranger did i want to buy it i suppose he thought id believe him but i went to henry and asked if it was true if they were selling the revolver and henry told me it wasnt true why did paul want to sell the handgun hed had an argument with his father paul was angry and hurt and i expect he was selling the one thing of value his family had in order to run away was the argument over who was to inherit the farm he never said i dont know henry was furious about the weapon and took paul out behind the barn i felt responsible for getting the boy in trouble and i kept the revolver for a time but paul didnt hold what had happened against me he realized id have had to ask henry before i bought the handgun gerald came in one day and asked for the box it was kept in he had a proper message from henry and i gave theos revolver to him and what was pauls reaction to that reluctantly belfors answered him he saidhe said he would take it back one day with everything else that was due him it was no more than a boys rash threat paul wasnt vengeful and he was facing his fathers death sooner rather than later a boy of fifteen isnt able to handle his emotions well you cant take that as proof he shot his brother but as hamish was pointing out it meant that paul elcott had known where to find a revolver if he had wanted to use one rutledge said ill go and speak to elcottbefore i order you released and he left the fuming belfors there in the cell e lcott was at the farmhouse the kitchen was nearly clean and a pail of fresh paint was being applied to the walls a cheerful and sunny pale yellow the tablecloth with the roses the chintz covers to the chairs the hangings at the window had been taken away a bolt of fabric stood in a corner a cream background with blue cornflowers in bunches scattered across the cloth he glanced up as rutledge knocked and then entered the house rutledge said it looks better i can still smell the blood i dont know if i can ever live here theres a shed out back that i could turn into a reasonable place i dont know he stared at the walls as if he could see through them to the stains hed been at such pains to hide who is looking after your brothers sheep ive been doing that with help from neighbors theyve been kind most of the stock seem to have survived the storm thank god for small mercies he set down his brush you didnt drive all the way out here to ask after the sheep no ive come to look for your uncle theos revolver a range of emotions swept across elcotts face i was wondering how long it would be before someone remembered that you should have told me from the start rutledge came into the room and set his coat and hat on the back of a chair if you had nothing to hide i didnt think about it not at first you dont my god what i saw in this room wiped everything else out of my head what became of it theos revolver it went to gerry and gerry was set on passing it on to his sons theres only your word for that of course wheres the revolver now i would guess it was upstairs where gerry kept it i havent looked i feeluncomfortablegoing through his belongings its as if hes still here watching me then show me where it should be ill do the searching paul elcott washed his hands and dried them on a rag he used while painting come with me hamish commented he sounds like a man on his way to his hanging they went through the door to the kitchen passage and to the chilly main rooms of the house paul elcott led the way up the stairs to the bedroom where his brother and his wife grace had slept rutledge made no comment as he watched paul open a chest that stood against the far wall it was made of oak carved and polished and the feet that held it up from the floor were round knobs of the same wood it held blankets linens and an assortment of bedclothes elcott stood aside and let rutledge lift them out and set them on the bed at the bottom of the chest was a rectangular box of dark wood the initials tae burned into the lid and under them a relief of mountains one of them long and flat on the top table mountain in cape town hamish warned it will be there cleaned and oiled hes had time to see to it under cover of the painting rutledge took the box out and passed it to paul elcott when the lid was opened rutledge saw that the box was a small traveling desk a square of wood was covered in green velvet held by strips of tooled leather and one end could be raised on brass struts to form a gentle slope making writing easier when sitting on the ground or in a chair elcott pulled out a hidden knob and took out the board underneath was a tray for pens along one side and compartments for a square jar with a cork stopper for ink and for stamps along the other the larger space in the center held stationery and envelopes it was large enough and deep enough to conceal a revolver as well but there was no revolver inside elcott slowly raised his eyes to rutledges face i sweari never touched it he said in a strained voice then where is it now god knowsyour guess is as good as mine with children in the house gerry may have taken it out and hidden it in the barn or somewhere thinking they wouldnt find it he never told mehe wouldnt have ii was foolish once i did something i dont know why it isnt here motive opportunity means paul elcott could have taken the revolver at any time while the twins were being christened while his brother was out on the slopes with the sheep while grace was in the village doing her marketing on sunday morning when the family went to worship in the church hamish was saying in the back of his mind gerald elcott couldna reach it in time if it was there but josh robinson might have known where it was children were often more aware of what was happening around them than adults recognized gerald might even have shown him the revolver hoping to give his stepson a sense of pride in his new family little dreaming that one day the child would take it out and use it to murder his family are you going to take me into custody paul elcott demanded his hands automatically shutting the little desk i didnt do it i swear before god there was a long moment of silence in the room elcotts face locked in fear and uncertainty waited then he bent to set the box again in the bottom of the chest set the rest of the contents on top and closed the lid rutledge said im not taking you into custody now there isnt enough evidence yet but i warn you against leaving urskdale paul elcott straightened up and said with desolation in his voice i dont have anywhere else to go chapter twentyfive r utledge gave greeley the order to release belfors and then went back to the hotel where was the missing revolver had elcott taken it had the boy was it lying somewhere in the snow even now or had gerald hidden it so well that no one had found it yet you canna take elcott into custody until you know hamish warned him there was no way of judging who had pulled the trigger he walked into the hotel kitchen his face grim elizabeth fraser looked up from the potatoes she was peeling and set the knife aside as she saw his expression whats happened god knowsnothing as soon as i find one bit of evidence its ambiguousi dont know how to weigh it you shouldnt be doing that not with your hand yours doesnt look much better she told him pointing to the holes in his palm how on earth did you hurt yourself he looked down at his hand iwas clambering over rocks and i must have cut it you didnt do that sort of damage on a stone here let me see no its all right he took off his coat why did you come here for harry cummins whats between the two of you she laughed nothing but gratitude i needed sanctuary and his wife needed acompanion we served each others purposes he loves her you know but she wont let him she holds him at arms length and it drives him mad sometimes he was fond of grace she was young and pretty and lively what he had once loved in his wife the contrast was painful he longed for his wife to be herself again are you telling me cummins fell in love with grace elcott of course not she was a reminder of what hed lost thats all it was like holding up a mirror to the past he said to me once that he had asked too much of his wife and he bore the guilt for that but he wanted more than anything for her tocome back as it were he told me that her family had turned away from her because shed married him yes one of the tragedies that have driven a wedge where there shouldnt be any why did they turn against her what had he done i cant tell youthis is a personal secret it has nothing to do with murder then ill go directly to cummins noyou mustnt he isnt aware that i know and he mustnt learn how i discovered the truth it will hurt him she made a deprecating gesture it was in a bout of drunken selfpity that vera told me she asked me afterward if shed said anything out of line betrayed any family secrets was the way she put it and of course i had to tell her she hadnt it would have sent her directly to the bottle again if shed realized she looked up at him her eyes pleading i respect harry i respect how much hes suffered dont ask him then you must tell me and let me decide for myself whether its important information or not her face judged him and he could feel himself flush under her scrutiny i understand that we have five unsolved murders she said quietly six for all we know but it doesnt give you the right to hurt people that makes you no better than the killer he found himself wanting to plead with her for understanding as if her good opinion mattered to him what was it about this woman bound to a wheeled chair that made a man feel the need to stand tall in her eyes before he could say anything she went on in the same quiet voice it wasnt what hed done its what he was they were furious with her for marrying a jew even though hed changed his name and didnt practice no one else knowsexcept me edward the eighth had a number of jewish friends but even as he said it rutledge knew that that had done little to change the stigma for ordinary people they were rich itmade a difference and so the cumminses moved here where he could pass as a gentile and build a respectable life until the war when no one had the money for holidays nor the spirit the hotellike urskdale as a wholecounted on walkers when they didnt come life was hard for everyone here what brought you north he asked again if it wasnt harry cummins a broken heart she answered but thats none of your business inspector m rs cummins was sitting in the small parlor forlornly leafing through an album of photographs a fire was blazing on the hearth and the room for once felt reasonably warm she looked up as rutledge came in im so sorry i shouldnt be in herethis room is always reserved for our guests but its so much easier to heat than anywhere else why not enjoy it rutledge asked he sat down in the chair on the far side of the hearth from her youre our hostess he paused and then said have you always lived in urskdale hamish broke in repressively its no right to take advantage of her but there were things rutledge needed to know and he could see that vera cummins was especially vulnerable just now as if sitting in her own parlor had reminded her of what had beenor ought to be oh no i came from london kensington she told him do you know it yes indeed does your family still live there a frown shadowed her face i dont know they havent told me we arentclose did miss fraser know them no i asked her that when she first came here but she didnt elizabeths family lived in chelsea near the hospital in one of those lovely old houses i should have liked to live there after we were married but of course harry wasnthappy in london and so you came here actually we went to warwick first but it didnt work out we had no friends to speak of it was very lonely she smiled wryly i didnt know the meaning of that word lonely until we came here why we werent born here my grandfather was from buttermere but hes been dead for years oh people were nice enough but they kept us at arms length harry needs people more than i do and i could feel that weighing on him but he thought she too had missed being a part of what social life there was here is any of his family still living oh no thats why hecould do what he did walk away so to speak there was no one to hurt but it hurt him inside i know it did i thought perhaps he blamed me he could see watching her face the toll life had taken on her were you grateful for miss frasers help while harry was away in the war at first i was suspicious i thought hed sent her here to kill me kill you rutledge asked in astonishment why on earth because shed already killed someone didnt you know i thought a policeman would e lizabeth was quite frank about it when she came mrs cummins went on she said it wasnt fair if i didnt know shed told harry too harrys always collected lost sheep i saw him a time or two talking with josh robinson for all i know he thought i was one of his lost souls no thats not true not at first we loved each other very much she raised a hand to her forehead as if to clear her mind i sometimes forget that did you mind that he was a jew rutledge asked gently how did you know she asked in astonishment is it so obvious he smiled while hamish called him traitor to his promise im a policeman after all yes of course but you seem too nice to be a policeman elizabeth tells me youre such a gentleman shes quite fond of you harry he reminded her embarrassed no i didnt care if he was a hottentot my father cared though he told me he would never speak to me again if i married beneath methats how he saw itand of course i didnt believe him tears came to her eyes i didnt even have a trousseau i wasnt allowed to take anything from the house except the clothes i stood up in that was cruel of him was it ive wondered if i was the one who was cruelto disobey him shifting the conversation rutledge asked did you get along well with miss fraser after she came here everyone loves elizabeth i envy her that even harry loves her after a fashion she sighed i think more than anything egypt changed harry i think being so close to palestine made him realize what hed lost he wrote long letters to me about how much he wanted to go to jerusalem and i couldnt answer them i was so terrified that palestine would take him from me she set the book aside and stood up i could fight another woman for him but i couldnt fight his heritage i kept hoping that that man lawrence the one in all the newspapers would see to it that the arabs got all of palestine and the jews were thrown out it was the only way id ever win the battle for harrys soul chapter twentysix r utledge got to his feet as mrs cummins walked from the room he couldnt be sure how much of what shed told him he could believe or whether years of drinking heavily had warped her memories hamish said shes to be pitied people who make great sacrifices for love often live to regret it rutledge was thinking of jean but it was hamish who brought up the name of fiona macdonald she didna regret loving me rutledge stared into the fire he was tired of the grief and pain of others he hadnt healed sufficiently himself to take on more suffering how do i find this killer he asked into the silence i cant seem to put a finger on the truth i cant seem to sort out the people and see them clearly i cant seem to find the thread that will lead me to the answer the scots voice seemed to fill the room first you must look at the key w hen maggie had latched the door on rutledge she stood for a moment resting her leg her back to the cold wooden panels its a bloody picadilly circus she said under her breath her eyes fell on the wellingtons by the door then she looked up at the frightened boy waiting tensely across the room well were rid of him but with so much coming and going id recommend feeding the sheep after dark from now on theres no use calling attention to ourselves unless we need to taking off her coat she hung it from the hook beside her sinking into her chair with relief she put her head back and considered the ceiling if i knew what it was you were afraid of id do better by you but he said nothing she pointed to the table theres pen and paper there i can go on talking to myself if thats what pleases you but my father god rest him always told me that facing the monsters under the bed gave you power over them he didnt seem to understand what she was saying heaving herself out of her chair she crossed to the table found a clean sheet in the assortment of papers she kept there taking up a pencil she concentrated on drawing for several minutes the boy stole closer for a better look and she shifted in her chair so that he couldnt see what it was she was doing then satisfied she leaned back set the pencil down and got to her feet thats what terrified me at your age now im going to rest for a little this leg aches like the very devil there must be a change coming in the weather she walked to her room closed the door and sat down on the bed the boy crept to the table to see what she had drawn and stood there fascinated a blackness against greater blackness shaped like a hulking human figure its broad shoulders crowding out everything else it loomed above a childs narrow bed menacing in the extreme the image was crudely drawn but the power of it was immense the pencil strokes bold and vigorous as if the memory was real and fresh underneath maggie had scrawled the man of the mountain he had listened to mr blackwells classroom account of the man who had lived in one of the shielings on the mountains and crept down at night into the village hungry for human flesh it was an old norse legend carried to england by early settlers in the region and with the passage of time had come into local folklore as a threat for naughty children if you dont mind your mother the man of the mountain will come for you wait and see if youre not back by dark if you fail to say your prayers mr blackwell had called it superstitious nonsense but there were those in the classroom who had surreptitiously crossed their fingers against invoking the man he had more reality than the devil and was closer to home the schoolmaster had also told his students that the man owed much to beowulf but the boy hadnt recognized the name someone living in another valley he thought to the boy an outsider over whom the power of the legend held no sway it was no more than a delicious tale meant to send a shiver down the spine he smiled a little as he looked at maggies work and then turning the sheet over he studied the blank paper for a time then he picked up the pencil and with shaking fingers made his own drawing before hiding it deep in the pile on the table after the boy had gone to bed maggie looked for and finally found the sheet she was chilled to see a stark outline of a gallows with a dangling empty noose a swift foray into the kitchen was unsuccessful but rutledge found what he was looking for in the barn the cow which the neighbor had been caring for while harry cummins was away lifted her head from the manger where hay had been strewn for her and stared at him with dark soft eyes he spoke to her as he went out and she went on placidly chewing rutledge left the hotel to drive back to the elcott farm pauls carriage was there but he didnt go to the kitchen to find the man instead he got out of the motorcar and walked around to the front door moving quietly he went up the stairs to josh robinsons bedchamber he went carefully through the boys belongings again frowning as he worked clothes shoes stockings beltsa cricket bat and ball and then he remembered the set of broken cuff links taking them he put everything else back where hed found it outside again he climbed the slope behind the house the going was still difficult but he took his time and watched where he set his boots far up on the shoulder where the scree began was the elcott sheep pen a pregnant ewe had taken shelter there scraping at the snow cover in search of grass she sneezed as rutledge came towards her and then edged nervously away he kept walking heading for the ruin of a hut higher up the roof had fallen in snow had banked high against the walls and there were heavy tracks all around the hut it was here that paul elcott had once retreated and here that josh had retreated the day his mother had gone into false labor the search party had been thorough poking their staffs into the drifts and trying to probe the narrow opening under a part of the collapsed roof that formed a tiny shelter if there was anything to be found they would have seen it but even they in the first aftermath of the storm might have missed something that the rain and sun had brought to the surface like old bones rutledge knelt and looked inside this was the likeliest place for a child to take shelter jarvis had been right and although the search party hadnt found him here small traces might have been buried deep in the snow impossible to see in the light of a lamp or torch what he was about to do would be accepted as truth reaching into his pocket he took out one of the cuff links and dropped it into a crevice between stones in the corner nearest what had been the door satisfied he squatted there and looked at what hed done the cuff link was completely out of sight he got to his feet and dusted off his gloves paul elcott had stepped out into the yard shielding his eyes as he looked up the fell towards rutledge rutledge lifted a hand as if hed just realized elcott was there and began to descend the slope hamish arguing with him every step of the way by the time he reached the yard elcott had closed the kitchen door and stored his painting gear in the barn he stood there by his carriage as rutledge slipped and skidded down the last hundred yards what possessed you to go up there its been searched that hut rutledge breathless shook his head im sure it was the report said nothing was found but the snow has melted considerably i was luckier i came across these in the palm of his hand he held out a stub of candle and a burnt match someone was there either the night it happened or afterward i expect it was josh but it might have been the killer elcott stared at the candle you cant be sure no of course i cant i didnt have any tools with me ill come back tomorrow and look again it doesnt make sense i mean if he was thereif he had a candlewhy didnt he come out when the searchers were calling his name you may be right rutledge said with reluctance but this candle hasnt been out in the weather long who else has been up there if not the boy gerry might have been i cant see gerald taking a candle and hunkering down in the hut but ill come back tomorrow and take my time he cranked the motor and stepped into the drivers seat did you ever go up there as a child and hide is it a likely place iyes i could see the yard and come down when my father was in a better temper he admitted reluctantly but i doubt josh ever did that i wouldnt say anything about this in urskdale until i can be sure what the candle means no of course not iill be working out here again tomorrow youll let me know yes ill be sure to do that a t the hotel rutledge found mrs cummins in the kitchen boiling carrots for dinner he took out the candle stub and held it out i found this above the elcott farmin a hut thats beyond the sheep pen does it look as if this candle is one that could be bought here in urskdale she studied it harry has a box just like it that he bought in one of the shops he keeps them in the barn whats it doing up in a hut thats an unlikely place to store candles i cant be sure what it means im going back tomorrow to search again there was no time to do morei didnt have a spade or a torch with me mrs cummins said you ought to ask sergeant miller to go with you hes a good man with a spade you should see the garden behind his house thank you ill do that i t was janet ashton who made a comment at the dinner table about the candle i cant see that its important that candle you found i mean josh had probably played up there a hundred times he liked walking about on his own i dont know that it matters rutledge agreed but ill have a look tomorrow i could have missed something today its silly she said doubtfully but you know your own business best what troubles me rutledge said is that the boy may be alive somewhere im considering sending out search parties again who else could have been using a candle in that hut what was he waiting for was he looking for you robinson or afraid to come to the authorities and if it wasnt the boy someone was waiting possibly watching the farm you can see the yard quite clearly from there its an ideal observation post for what harry cummins asked opportunity rutledge answered him he might not have been certain whose farm hed come across or how many people lived there what the best time for attack might be in short reconnaissance what youre telling us is that it was a coldblooded attack well planned and scouted robinson retorted no one living in urskdale would need to do that josh wouldnt have to conceal himself and spy and i refuse to believe he acted with such chilling premeditation thats why im going back the candle and match prove nothing but if the searchers missed this what else did they overlook elizabeth fraser said its a frightful thought that someone could sit and watch like a monstrous animal in search of prey but even animals have a reason for what they do why should someone stalk and kill the elcotts mrs cummins said oh dont i dont want to know that someone could be out there right now watching us my dear its supposition you neednt be afraid not with this many people about youre safe harry cummins assured his wife and then deliberately turned the subject and that reminds me mr rutledge if youre intending to send your motorcar back to keswick id like to ride with the constablewere in need of supplies there was an apple pudding for dessert as he finished his rutledge said im sorryi havent had a chance to speak to inspector greeley if youll excuse me ill do that now and turn in early he rose from his seat at the table and went to his room to get his coat and hat passing the dining room five minutes later he could hear the discussion going on and elizabeth fraser was saying i really think it was unwise to tell us what hed found or for us to speculate this way but janet ashton was furious i dont care how many candles he found or where he might have found them its not proof that will stand up in a court of law and for all we know it has nothing to do with our killer its a waste of time and i for one think we ought to tell the chief constable as much inspector rutledge saved my life and im grateful but i am tired of sitting here waiting for him to get to the bottom of this wretched business hugh robinsons deeper voice cut across something that harry cummins was about to say what if josh came back waiting for me he might have taken shelter in that hut thinking id be sent for and would come looking for him its possible for gods sake were dealing with a tenyearold elizabeth is right cummins intervened its not proper to be talking about this my dear shall i bring in the tea tray or will you r utledge found sergeant miller at the police station thumbing through a catalog of gardening supplies he looked up at rutledge and said something i can do for you then sir i need your help will you drive me now to the elcott farm and then bring the motorcar back here and leave it in the yard of the hotel miller frowned i dont understand sir take you out there and leave you whats that in aid of lets call it an experiment shall we as far as anyone knows im at the hotel asleep and youll say nothing to the contrary tomorrow morning at first light you can come and fetch me again you think youre on to something then millers face was alert intrigued possibly yes will you do it as if indulging a superiors whim miller answered ill just get my coat sir and well be off w hen miller had left him at the farm rutledge looked up at the still silent house and felt a chill he was not superstitious and yet the horror of what had happened here had left its mark the odor of fresh paint met him as he let himself into the dark kitchen and he flicked on the torch he was carrying to make his way across the floor hamish had been arguing incessantly with him for hours and rutledge found himself on the brink of a headache he climbed the stairs up to the small room where hazel robinson had slept it looked out across the yard and up the fell he walked to the window pulled up the only chair in the room and settled down to watch as his eyes adjusted to the darkness rutledge began to pick out details the path hed taken earlier the sheep pen the hut and looming over them was the fell massive and dark and somehow sinister around him the house creaked and stirred in the cold night air he could imagine people walking about downstairs the way the floorboards groaned in the dark or someone on the roof above his head moving stealthily war had inured him to the stirring of the dead he sat there and waited the hours seemed to drag by watching the stars he could see that time was passing he had scanned them in the night at the front when all was quiet the silence before an attack when it wasnt safe to light a match for a last cigarette and faceless men coughed or stamped their feet their nerves taut as they pretended to sleep the unrelieved tension had been telling hamish was reminding him of the sniper who had crept forward invisible deadly eyes sweeping the english lines for any indication of where a careless man might be standing where the tension might drive a soldier to peer across no mans land and think anxiously about tomorrow there will be no sniper here rutledge answered him aloud startling himself as his voice filled the small room it was well after two when he thought he heard the trot of a horse coming down the lane his eyes told him nothing was there that the night was still empty hamish was intent behind him in the darkness rutledge could feel it how many nights had they stood shoulder to shoulder in the trenches patient alert and yet drowsing as only a soldier can yes it was a horse he could see it now moving up the lane a stark outline against the whiteness of the snow the figure on its back was an uneven bundle of dark clothing head and shoulders hunched together against the cold man or woman there was no way of knowing he waited and the horse slowed as it approached the house reined in and guided to the shadows cast by the barn it stood there for a time not moving except for the swish of its tail and the occasional nod of its head as it chewed at the bit there was no saddle rutledge could see that now after a time the figure stirred and dismounted holding the reins it stared up at the house and rutledge almost had the feeling that whoever it was could see him back from the window though he was he kept very still finally as if convinced there was no one about the intruder began to climb the track that led up from the yard easily seen silhouetted against the snow even without the torch that was flicked on to guide feet through the ruts that rutledge and drew and the searchers had made it was not difficult to follow in time it reached the sheep pen and then moved on to the hut rutledge with only hamish for company waited the light seemed to lose itself in the huts thick walls he could see that whoever had come in the night to search was being thorough and it was a long time before the figure turned and made its way down the long treacherous slope rutledge had already slipped out of the house and was standing in the deep shadow cast by the shed where sheep were brought down to be bred or birthed he could hear the crunch of snow even before he saw the beam of the torch tired footsteps making no effort to hide their approach came nearer with every breath and then as the torchs light grew brighter in the churned snow rutledge stepped out of the shadows dark and half seen against the house a cry of alarm was cut off as the intruder realized that a man not a ghost stood in its way then it turned and tried to run back the way it had come rutledge faster was at its heels and as it missed its step on the stony track he caught up to it and brought it down the bundled figure writhed in his grasp crying out in pain nomy ribs he rolled off janet ashton and swore what the hell are you doing out here at this hour of the night she answered i could ask you the same thing god but you frightened me she was shaking come on up with you he gave her his hand and helped her to her feet back to the house he ordered where i can light a lamp and see you but she pulled away from him in a fierce effort to free herself no i wont go in there youll have to carry me fighting all the way her voice rose as she struggled the barn then he said roughly catching her arm and dragging her with him the barn was marginally warmer with the stock taken away to be cared for elsewhere there was none of the comforting security of animals in their stalls he took her into the depths of the cavernous darkness and shone his torch into her face tears streaked her cheeks but she stared defiantly back at him what brought you here he asked i was afraid whatever it was you thought youd discovered here would distract you josh lived on this farm he might have used a candle up there in the hut any time you dont understand him the way he worried about his mother the way the twins changed his life i can imagine him slipping out of bed and running away for an hour or two to get his head together again but thats no proof hes a murderer i dont care what hugh says i knew josh just as wellbetter probablyand he isnt a murderer it was a foolish thing to do to come herealoneat night yes but i found something up therelook he expected her to show him the cuff link hed concealed hours earlier but in the palm of her gloved hand was something entirely different he turned the torch to see it clearly it was the black button from a mans coat hamish mocked shes as clever as you chapter twentyseven j anet ashton closed her fingers over her find all you have to do is look for a coat with a missing button i dont believe you found it there why not because you overlooked the button earlier its sheer folly for me to play that game oh i know you think i was as likely to have killed them as paulor josh but you cant have three murderers in a family can you if you have to choose who will it be she broke off as the horse gently blew as if it had picked up a scent it didnt like shhh rutledge said turning off his torch and stepping swiftly to the barn door there was someone above the shed on the hill rutledge slipped to the shed and laid his hand across the horses nose to keep it quiet all the time talking to it in a low voice as he urged it out of sight janet ashton was beside him who is it she demanded in a fierce whisper he could feel her shaking as her hand came to rest on his arm i could have run into him shhh he said again here hold on to the horse dont let him make a sound and he was gone out of the shed and into the starlit yard above him he could see movement but the line of sight here wasnt as good as it had been in the upper floor of the house but the figure didnt seem to be moving towards the hut instead he seemed to be looking at the house from the fell searching for a better angle what was it he wanted a man surelynot a boy hamish said softly in his ear taylor the escaped prisoner was it rutledge waited silently urging whoever was there to come down the hill and into his line of sight but he stayed high watchful as an animal his attention was focused on the house still and rutledge realized that he would be hard to see from hazel robinsons bedchamber the line on which he seemed to be moving was bare rock brought to the surface by the rain and the suns warmth a shadow on a shadow he thought like a fish in a pool and then finally he was coming down rutledge ducked out of sight and said to janet ashton stay here with the horse whatever happens if hes armed he might fire at anything that moves dont leave me here she begged i dont want him to find me he wont youre safest here he was back at the shed door listening the crunch of boots could be heard indistinctly all at once the sound stopped and then turned away moving fast rutledge swore under his breath a good soldier could sense danger could sense the shift in the silence that told him someone else was there concealed and menacing whatever alerted the man on the slope he was taking no chances by the time rutledge started up the track the man was lost in the darkness he could crouch down and stay unseen like a rabbit outwaiting the fox it would be impossible to spot him until one was nearly on top of him nevertheless rutledge thought ive got to find him but it was useless after an hour of trying rutledge was forced to give up when he came back to the shed he discovered that janet ashton was gone but who was the other shadow up there on the hill where had he been heading the house or the hut before something had alerted him to his own danger what would he have done left to his own devices i t was just before dawn when the sound of the motorcar roused rutledge from an uneasy sleep sergeant miller square and sensible behind the wheel said i hope it was worth missing sleep over this wild scheme of yours it was a quiet night rutledge answered him miller grunted thats as may be sir you were lucky anything could have happened out here and you had no way of summoning help w hen he got to the hotel rutledge stepped into the barn and looked at harry cumminss mare she was standing in her stall asleep when he touched her neck he could tell shed been ridden the sweat still stiff there in the hairs that explained how janet ashton had come to and returned from the farmbareback because with her sore ribs she couldnt have tossed a saddle over a mounts back then how did the other night stalker get there and what had brought him if not the lure of the candle purportedly found in the hut w hen rutledge came down to the kitchen for hot water to use to shave janet ashton was sitting in the predawn darkness holding a cup of tea i suppose you intend to arrest me now returning to the scene of my crime you could just as easily have run into the murderer as you did me and he could well have circled back while i was out there on the fell she inadvertently shivered that never occurred to me or id have stayed here are you going back today to look for tracks that wont do much good the search party made it impossible to tell who was coming or going and so now you cant decide whether to take me into custody or trust your judgment that the other idiot out there in the night was the man you want im prepared to arrest both you and elcott and then let the courts make sense of it she caught the edge in his voice you havent thought have you that paul and i might be in this together he took the candle stub from his pocket and the cuff link he had kept the boy broke this either by accident or in a fit of temper do you know who gave them to him she didnt need to look at it hugh gave them to josh on his birthday grace let him keep them in his own room it was a mistake i can see that now why would he want to destroy them i expect he felt hugh had deserted him by not coming here and taking him back to london perhaps hugh is right josh was unhappy and vengeful but that doesnt make the child a killer r utledges loud knock at the door woke up paul elcott well before eight oclock he came to the door of the licensed house with his hair tossled and his pajamas shoved into his trousers rutledge looked down his feet were bare what is it whats wrong i want to have a look at your boots boots good god man are you mad its barely morning nevertheless elcott led the way up to his quarters and opened the door to the wardrobe there they are the other pair is by the bed in the close quarters of the room rutledge could smell the gin it permeated the bedclothes and elcott himself he lifted each shoe and examined it dry clean except for paint smears on one pair and not newly polished are these all that you have im not a rich man elcott said defensively thats the lot id like to look at the coat you were wearing at the funeral search the wardrobe and be damned rutledge found the dark cloth coat and ran his hands down the side where the buttons belonged one was missing how had the coat fit at the church he tried to bring back the image of elcott standing there beside belfors and his wife could the button have been missing then in the rain streaking coats and hats with long dark shafts of wet such things would have been difficult to note but he made no issue of it putting the coat back where hed found it when did you start drinking he asked instead if its any of your business it was after i had my dinner such as it was i dont have the heart to cook these days and precious little appetite after working in that cursed kitchen id sell high fell if i thought my father wouldnt come back from his grave and devour me instead ill have to learn to live there call it dutch courage the gin its left over from last summers stock rutledge stood in the middle of the room noticing that it was warmer than usual have you had your breakfast elcott swore i got up about six and made myself a cup of tea theres no law against that the last time i looked but a stove would dry boots very efficiently was that when elcott had begun drinking to cover his nights activities elcott went on i thought youd be at the farm by this time spade and torch in hand looking for whatever it is you expect to find there how did you get on with josh well enough i told you i thought gerry was a fool to take on a readymade family and i didnt like the boy but thats not to say id harm him but the robinson children were no threat to you were they they couldnt inherit from their stepfather i asked gerry about that how things stood i mean its one thing if the children are elcotts by blood quite another if they have no ties to the land or to urskdale he told me the farm wouldnt be left away from our line did you believe him there wasnt much choice was there but yes i think he was telling the truth he was bred to that land more than i ever was josh was ten he had no ties here except his mother and sister it might have been different if the boy was a babe in arms he stopped realizing what hed all but said have you finished what you came for inspector id like to see the kitchen if you dont mind i do mind but thats beside the point you know the way rutledge examined the small kitchen any rags that might have been used to clean shoes would have gone into the fire hamish was complaining for all your fine lies youve got nowhere there was a bit of mud under the table where elcott might have sat in the chair drawn up to it but there was no way of telling whether it had come from walking in from the stable or from climbing the fell rutledge thanked elcott and left h is next call was on hugh robinson the man was already dressed and having breakfast in the kitchen rutledge quietly went to his room and looked at his boots nothing he went back to robinson and said did you go to the farm last night the farm god no if i never see it again it will be soon enough i thought perhaps you might have wondered if your son was there hiding and went to look for him ill admit i thought about it he broke off as elizabeth fraser wheeled herself into the room harry isnt feeling well this morning i knocked and he told me he thought he felt a migraine was coming on youll no see his boots this morning her bandages had been changed and were thinner but she couldnt lift the heavy teapot and rutledge poured a cup for her she thanked him robinson went on i dont know whether to mourn my sonor hold on to a slim thread of hope what do they do to children that age if theres been murder done i cant sleep for thinking about that surely they dont hang themand prisons are no place for a boy what do they do rutledge found himself thinking of the young man who had just been committed to an asylum as an alternative it offered little hope to a grieving father yet it had seemed to be a kinder choice to that mans parents it will be left to the judge to decide whats best he answered watching elizabeth frasers face thats his duty mine is to sift out the truth from the evidence where is miss ashton still asleep i expect i saw her as she let herself in after a long walk she says she finds it hard to lie down with her ribs still aching and shes grieving for her sister i saw her in the churchyard when i was doing my marketing yesterday mrs cummins opened the door and then stopped on the threshold as if uncertain of her welcome she was more than a little tipsy her eyes wide and not very focused her hand trembling on the knob i had the most awful dream last night she said to the room at large i was here in the kitchen and something came in that door from the yard i could see it but i didnt know what it was the room was dark and i was so afraid ii could see blood everywhere and i didnt want to die her voice broke on the last word and elizabeth went swiftly to her to comfort her it was only a dream she told the other woman gently there was no one here no one had come to hurt you stillit was so vivid elizabeth took her trembling hands you dont have anything to fear vera inspector rutledge is herehell protect us from any harm but he wasnt here i went to his room and he wasnt here i wish i knew where harry had put his revolver id sleep with it under my pillow r utledge went back to the ruined hut as soon as he could climbing with hamishs voice in his ears nearly masking the crunch of snow he could feel the mantle of fatigue settling over him you canna hope to gain anything with such tricks it was foolish if id caught whoever walked here last night but you caught the lass instead and ye believe her i dont believe her aye but ye looked for a missing button on yon coat elcott has been out here painting day after day she could have gone into the rams head at any time and twisted one of the buttons off he wore heavy sweaters painting not his one good coat do you ken youre always making excuses for the lass im not making excuses for anyone aye and yeve no arrested anyone they had reached the hut and rutledge dug deep between the stones where he had hidden the broken cuff link his fingers searched diligently working at their task with care but where the cuff link had been hidden there was nothing the question was what had been done with it and who had taken it janet ashton paul elcott or a player who was not even on the board yet hamish said considering the implications it wasna taken to condemn the boy and a stranger wouldna ken where to look it might well have been hugh robinson he may be regretting his rash confession about his son and decided to conceal evidence sparing the boys memory it would be a kindness m aggie had found it hard to wake the boy in the middle of the night but she got him out of bed and into the wellingtons as he grumbled half asleep still we must see to the sheep and its better with people lurking about all the day long to do that after dark i told you but he held back whats wrong are you afraid of the dark then theres nothing out there to hurt you and sybil will be with you shes worth an army look at that tail wagging do you think shed let you go into danger the boys hand went to the thick soft fur at the dogs throat behind the collar his fingers smoothed and kneaded the fur and then he took the pail from maggie and went out into the cold night maggie stood outside the door to keep watch half afraid he might run away if given the chance half afraid something would pounce out of the darkness at him which is the most ridiculous thing she scolded herself but she couldnt bring herself to go inside until she saw him coming back lugging the pail with sybil at his heels once the dog stopped to sniff at a patch of snow and the boy turned to it with his back to her maggie couldnt tell whether hed spoken to the dog or simply touched her head she trotted along beside him then seemingly undisturbed by the fact that he was mute sybils love was uncritical and unconditional maggie sighed with relief when they were safely in the yard once more what will sybil do when hes gone she asked herself as she held the door wide and what will i do was the thought that followed on the heels of the first she brushed it away angry with herself the boy was going nowhere she and her ax would see to that chapter twentyeight g reeley had sent a message to the hotel enclosing a telegram for rutledge the bakers boy the message read brought this with the morning post and ive also had reports from the police along the coast the latest known query about the old road to urskdale was last summer it closes the door on the man taylor hamish pointed out not necessarily rutledge answered as he opened the telegram he stood stockstill staring at the printed words chief constable unhappy with progress you are relieved mickelson will be in north next train it was signed bowles aye and id warned you hamish told him bluntly relieved it had never happened before though bowles had sometimes blustered and threatened as panic overcame reason mickelson was one of his cronies what would the man do with bowles breathing down his neck mickelson would wrap the inquiry up quickly smoothly ruffling as few feathers as possible in the course of his duty josh robinson would be pronounced the killer there would be a brief sensation in the press and bowles would make sad pronouncements on the state of young people since the war so many men killed women left to enforce standards it would read well and there would be further comments at speaking engagements pointing to the role of the yard in bringing swift justice to those who broke the sixth commandment one of bowless favorite texts nothing would be said about breaking the ninth commandment with regard to bearing false witness elizabeth fraser who had handed him the message asked softly its bad news isnt it im so sorry youll be making an arrest then he was still lost in thought but he heard her last words the yard will yes he answered folding the telegram he shoved it in his pocket then said briskly i have work to do in his room he sat down at the small writing table under the windows and began to make a list of what he knewand what he didnt on balance the facts were evenly spread out before him the spur towards murder was weighted evenly under each name janet ashton jealousy when her sister had refused to go back to her first husband and leave gerald free to marry again had the plot to kill been set in motion paul elcott greed hed had no problem with his brothers marriage to a widow with children of her own but when the twins were conceived there was the impediment to his inheritance of high fell when they were delivered safely and thrived he must have been desperate as the rams head fell apart around him josh robinson revenge the twins had tied his mother more closely to gerald elcott and josh had run away once missed school often and from what the schoolmaster had said was unhappy in the north with few friends to make life bearable and when hed been told he was too young to live with his father had he decided that the only way to be free was to murder his family there was bertram taylor as well who had carried a grudge against gerald elcott and hugh robinson who had been forced to give up his own family through no fault of his own and even harry cummins who had been attracted to grace but if that were true why kill her or had her happiness embittered him sending him there in the snow to wipe out a family he envied hamish said hav ye no thought of the wife jealous of the woman who had caught her own mans eye farfetched though it might be rutledge added vera cummins to the list for frail as she seemed there was a tenacity and a force under her drunkenness she loved harry doubted him was troubled by himand failed to live up to what he had wanted from her he looked in his papers for the reply received from sergeant gibson on his earlier query an unexpected answer but vera cummins had confirmed it elizabeth fraser had been tried and found not guilty of murder the charge was killing the man she was engaged to marry a barebones report from sergeant gibson with none of the flesh that lent humanity to a case the victim ronald herring had been a conscientious objector the kc had pointed out that perhaps herring was a moral coward and the accused had been ashamed of his convictions when he refused to release her from her engagement she had taken matters into her own hands or in sergeant gibsons words rid herself of a man who didnt have the backbone to step aside tried and found not guilty but perhaps the jury had been sympathetic conscientious objectors and cowards even men who had suffered from shell shock were despised by people who had watched sons and fathers and brothers mown down in france women had been particularly hard on those they felt were malingering many had handed out white feathers to any man not in uniform and a special uniform had been designed for those given medical discharges to protect them from harassment he had hoped that it wouldnt be necessary to ask for the details of the case elizabeth fraser was bound to her chair she couldnt possibly have reached the elcott farm in the snow yet he had seen her standing and she herself had told him that the doctors had found no physical reason for her disability mickelson would probe into the case he had to forestall that rutledge put aside his papers and went to the kitchen hoping to find her alone he could hear the voices of cummins and robinson from the small parlor and walked quietly past mrs cummins was in the kitchen trying to find something in one of the drawers of the dresser she looked up as rutledge came into the room and said fretfully i cant seem to find my scissorsi was sure they were here just this morning let me search in the drawer for them he went through the detritus of twenty years a magpies nest of things that had no other home a broken spoon stubs of pencils a bit of torn lace part of a steel hat pin and lengths of colored thread in the bottom tangled in string was a small pair of embroidery scissors she took them as if hed handed her the grail holding them to her breast he happened to look up at her face just then and saw something in her eyes that chilled him he nearly reached out to take the scissors back again it struck rutledge that she had played a role for years the drunken needy wife who clung to her husband and bound him to her with pity terrified he wouldnt come home to her terrified he might have sent his mistress to live with her for the duration of the war terrified that his sacrifice for her might have been greater than his love for her vera cummins had become someone harry couldnt leave because he believed hed been responsible for who and what she had become the tyranny rutledge thought of the weak she glanced away as if fearful that shed somehow betrayed herself i dont know what wed do here without you she said bleakly you dont know how frightened i am sometimes its so lonely here so much empty space beyond my windows her voice trailed off as she started for the door mrs cummins yes inspector she was poised to hurry on id like to speak to miss fraser if youd ask her to come to the kitchen she tensed is there anything wrong it was i who burned the toast again this morning he smiled no itsmy hand i hurt it and id like her opinion about seeing dr jarvis unless youd care to look at it oh no ill just call elizabeth she went hastily out of the room and he crossed to stand by the window trying to force his mind to blankness to seal off what he was feeling and thinking by the time elizabeth fraser wheeled her chair into the room he was in control of his emotions vera tells me your hand is hurting you that was only an excuse i know its cold in the dining room but we can be more private there would you mind she searched his face whats wrong will you come with me wheeling her chair towards the dining room door she replied i think i know what it is you want to ask he held the door for her and watched her roll the chair to one side of the hearth i told you once that it must be difficult to pry into the secrets of people you suspect i told you too i thought it was rather horrid yes it was all he could say tell me first why you think i could be capable of killing gerald and his family i dont suspect you you suspect all of us i can see it in your eyes watchful and giving away very little she studied his face it troubles you doesnt it to hunt people down i did enough of it in the war all right what do you want to know about your trial i was acquitted you cant try me twice for the same offense i never suggested no look the yard is sending someone else to take over this inquiry he wont be askind id rather end the investigation before he arrives i need to know why you were tried someone else was that the bad news after a moment she went on with such sadness in her face that he wanted to stop her and tell her he was wrong he didnt need to know ronald was a man of the utmost integrity i respected and admired him wed known each other for two years when he finally asked me to marry him but then the war came along and he refused to serve he said that killingfor any reasonwas wrong that it was a last resort that governments chose to avoid working out a settlement in which they might lose something it was horriblethe way he was treated he got the white feather over and over again until he was afraid to go out without a uniform on but he stood by what he believed and i honored him for that she took a shaky breath his parents supported his decision at first but then something rather odd happened have you heard of the angel of mons he stared at her yes some of the men fighting in mons in the first days of the war swore theyd seen an angel one night they were being forced back the angel seemed to cover their retreat it meant different things to different men many of them refused to talk about it yes well ronalds brother died at mons and his parents turned against ronald then telling him that god was surely on our side that ronald was going against the will of god it was nonsense they were grieving im not sure they realized what their constant barrage of criticism did to him he took it to heart and i watched him suffer as he tried to come to terms with what they wanted and then she faltered her voice refusing to go on rutledge waited his back to her until she could speak again finally she said i stopped at his flat after a friends birthday party sometime in the evening hed turned the gas on and killed himself id seen him at tea and hed tried to be cheerful for my sake he hadnt expected me to be the one to find him but id been given a book i thought he might enjoy id hoped it would pick up his spirits as it had mine her voice changed i was so angry angry with myself for not seeing his desperation angry with his father for being so heartless and refusing to understand angry at his mother for her stupid comparisons with his brother all i could think of was protecting ronald from this last indignity a coward to the end his father would have said couldnt face the hun the way our willie did a disgrace to willies memory and so i took the blame what do you mean he had turned from the window a dark silhouette against the light her knuckles were white on the arms of the chair her face drained of expression i wrote a note in it i said that id watched ronald suffer the indignities of others and i couldnt go on and so id ended it for both of us but i was afraid if we died together it would appear to be a double suicide i went out shut the door and let myself be struck by a lorry coming down the road my god he said quietly melodramatic wasnt it foolishness in the extreme but i couldnt think of anything but the fact that he was dead and i wanted to die too instead i woke up in hospital with the police by my bed she sighed my friends at the birthday partyit didnt occur to me that they might be askedcould prove that ronald was alive earlier when they met me at the flat the woman who owns the building had seen him on the stairs half an hour after id gone hed put the cat in the back garden she swore she hadnt smelled gas then but of course she wasnt happy with a murder in her house the suicide of a coward gave her some standing on the street and sohis parents learned the truth after all they were in the gallery at the trial i could almost see them gloat and i couldnt walk they felt god had punished me sufficiently too did you kill him he asked her bluntly she lifted her face to look at the candlesticks about the hearth ornate victorian silver with twining ivy running up the shaft to form the cup for the candle i loved him so dearly i could have done it i think but i didnt she took a deep breath and when harry asked me to come here away from london and the gossip where no one knewi thought i could forget but you dont do you the past stays with you like a shadow and gerald ah yes gerald he wasnt at all like ronald and yet if i watched sometimes id catch a glimpse of ronald in him his fairness the way he walked that sparkle in his eyes when he was excited about something i took such pleasure in that even sometimes geralds laughter would catch me unprepared i would hear it in a shop and turn quickly have you never lost someone and then looked for them in other people hed lost jean even though hed come back alive from france she had been terrified of him sitting irrational and suicidal in hospital and hed seen her only once afterward in london just before her marriage to someone else had he looked for jean in other women or found in other women the traits that he had missed in her in auroreor olivia marlowe even fiona i dont know he answered simply i expect i havent loved as deeply as you did elizabeth fraser smiled but it was more with sadness than humor i never want to love anyone again it hurts too much am i free to go now yes but when the door closed behind her hamish said did you believe her then rutledge found he couldnt answer the voice in his head t he screams brought maggie up out of a deep sleep for a moment she lay stockstill disoriented and uncertain then she found her shawl and threw it around her shoulders hurrying to her fathers room without stopping to light the lamp he was sitting up in bed on his knees his eyes wide but unseeing she stood there for an instant then awkwardly put her arm around the boys heaving shoulders but her touch was shocking to him and he whimpered as he curled himself into a ball in among the bedclothes his screams rising in pitch as if afraid of what she would do to him yet she thought he didnt recognize her in the middle of whatever nightmare held him in its grip sybil she called to the dog but it was already on the floor by the bed hunched and whining she could hear words now incoherent but terrified what is it she asked him her own voice shaking tell me whats wrong he lifted his face out of the coverlet and stared at her and she thought this time he was wide awake no longer in the throes of his dream i killed them he whispered i watched them die there was so much noise and then i ran i didnt want to hang he pointed his finger as if he held a gun bang bangbang bang bang bang she had to reach out and shake him to stop the sound recognizing it for hysteria afterward he just sat there and cried sybil jumped on the bed then and tried to comfort him s itting at the kitchen table in the dark staring at nothing maggie could feel the cold settling in the stove had been banked for the night and she didnt have the energy to make herself a cup of tea what am i going to do she asked the shadows papa what am i going to do but her father was dead and buried on the hill after a while when her feet felt half frozen and her head had begun to ache along with her leg she heard a voice saying aloud nothing has changed i dont see that anything has changed she was startled to realize that it was her own voice soon after that she got up and went to her bed but it was hours before she finally fell asleep again t he next morning he didnt seem to remember anything about his outburst in the night and when he was washing up the dishes she surreptitiously took out the gallows drawing hed made and burned it in the stove chapter twentynine t hat night rutledge drove down the urskdale road towards south farm where the petersons lived leaving his motorcar on the road he walked partway up the lane and found a bare patch of rock where he could stand and watch the long outline of the ridge that rose to the knob and then leveled off as it fell to the long back and dwindled towards the south it was cold wind whipping down the lake and scudding clouds sailing overhead obscuring the stars from here he was invisible to anyone on high ground and he could still reach the village faster in the motorcar than anyone on foot the question was would this be another nightwatch that failed to bring him any answers turning to look across the mere he could just see the ragged outline of the fells blotting out the sky somewhere in the distance to his right the clank of a bell told him where sheep were on the move he could hear his own breathing and then a rock dislodged by a careless hoof rolled and bounced for what seemed to be twenty feet or so if i cough he thought it will be heard for miles the feeling of claustrophobia settled around him again pinned where he was by the fells isolated and lonely he was one man in a wilderness of stone that seemed to press in on every side he couldnt push it aside and escape he couldnt choose his way out not without wings shaking off his bleak mood he pulled his collar up against the wind and shivered in his heavy coat after a time he had to stamp his feet to keep them warm and the stars swung across the sky with silent precision that measured the minutes he kept time by them instead of his watch as the hours crept by and then faintly across the saddle he could see the pinprick of light as a lantern bobbed slowly across the ground there was no way to intersect the path the walker had taken but rutledge was this time perfectly positioned to track the small glow as it moved for a long time it seemed to follow an erratic course and with the map in his mind rutledge could tell when it veered off to stop at the sheep pens the deeper crevices and the old ruins searching for what a revolver a child or perhaps some other bit of evidence that the police were not aware of but rutledge wanted to find out hamish standing watch with him in his mind kept up a running commentary reminding him that time was short and that mickelson could arrive the next morning or in the afternoon better to finish what needs to be done before the wrong person is hanged im doing my best you havena used your eyes theyre too blinded by the woman i tell you theres no key aye but there is think man youre no this puir a policeman all right then tell me what ive missed go back to the woman shes not a suspect she was acquitted aye and youre too blind to see what im saying the disembodied lantern had come some distance from town now rutledge swiftly retraced his own steps to the motorcar and cranked it getting in he heard hamish say the headlamps but rutledge hadnt turned them on driving blind in the darkness praying not to plow into a ewe on the roadside he pushed his speed as much as he dared for a moment urskwater shimmered in a white sheet before the moon raced under another bank of clouds he could understand he thought why the norse and the danes had woven nature into their stories giving it a sinister life of its own hed been told on one of his visits to the region with his father about the old man who haunted the fells of urskdale and he wondered how many people like mrs haldnes kept their shades lowered at night and never looked out if henderson hadnt been driving his son to the doctors surgery the village loomed ahead dark and quiet long before he reached the hotel he stopped the motorcar and left it standing striding quickly the rest of the way once he stumbled in a rut left by a cart and cursed under his breath he made his way around to the back of the hotel letting himself in the kitchen door as hed come out elizabeth fraser was there in the darkness dear god he said startled i heard you go out she said softly i thought youd like something warm to drink when you came in theresbusiness i must attend to first but thank you he went past her chair into the passage when he reached hugh robinsons room he stopped to listen to the low roll of snores inside opening the door silently he looked into the room robinson was sleeping on his side his face turned away towards the only window but there was no mistaking him rutledge went on to janet ashtons door he couldnt hear anything beyond the panels and gently opened it half an inch she lay with her face turned to a long streak of moonlight coming through the window as he watched the light faded and there was only the slim shape under the blanket and a pale oval framed in dark hair he shut the door again and made his way silently out of the house to where hed left the motorcar he drove it into the hotel yard and left it there then he walked down through the town there was a lamp lit in the doctors surgery as a nightlight but the rest of the house was dark shops were shuttered and the streets were empty the ghostly shape of the church tower was lost against the bulk of the mountain behind it across urskwater a dog barked and the sound traveled to him clearly another answered closer to the village he might have been the only man left alive in this alien world he thought but try as he would to walk softly his boots crunched on the ridges of dirty snow and icy mud under his feet and anyone lying awake could hear the sound of his footsteps echoing in the night the last thing he wanted were lights coming on as curious heads lifted shades to see who was about the rams head was dark but he tried the door locked in urskdale until the murders almost no one locked his door either paul elcott was cautious or hed made certain no one would be able to find him gone his bed empty rutledge crossed the street to where a bakers shop offered some shelter against the wind he pressed into the frame of the door making himself all but invisible it was a long wait from time to time the creaking of the sign over the rams head could be heard and he thought rusty and uncared for it was in a way a description of paul elcotts view of himself and life stiff from the cold and from standing so still he shifted his position finally and nearly betrayed himself when his heel struck the lower part of the door with a resounding thud a light came on in the floor above his head shining out into the street the window sash went up a voice angry and hard called whos there what do you want rutledge stood stockstill it was impossible for the man in the window to see him where he was after a time he heard the voice saying to someone inside its the blasted wind nothing more i can hear it rattling the door the window shut with a bang and the street was once more quiet a cat walked by carrying a mouse in its mouth the moonlight fitful at best played tricks with shadows and rutledge thought of the nights in the trenches when tired eyes could read movement in the wire when there was none hamish said whist rutledge listened a crunch of steps he thought it must be nearly five oclock time enough for whoever had been out on the heights to reach urskdale againbefore an early rising farmer saw the silhouette of an intruder in his pasture or sheep run and came out with his shotgun the lonely figure walking down the street kept to the center as if fearful of ambush it moved wearily as if burdened by its thoughts as well as lack of sleep rutledge stood where he was waiting the figure was perhaps five shops away and still coming towards him even though he knew for a certainty that he couldnt be seen rutledge kept his breathing light and shallow if it was paul elcott he would soon turn towards the rams head two shops away now and then the unknown night walker was even with the licensed house that stood as a monument to elcotts failure in life but to rutledges surprise he didnt go in he kept on walking after a time he was lost in the shadows of the churchyard yews rutledge could hear the church door open the heavy wood dragging on its iron hinges who the hell rutledge cut short the thought and strained to listen yell lose him if you wait here ill lose him if i walk to the church i cant open the door without making noise he may no come back this way and after ten minutes it appeared that hamish was right rutledge stepped out of the bakers shop doorway and keeping to the shadows moved on to the church he walked softly watching his way and still no one came out of the building when he reached the door he hesitated but this was a small church with only the one entrance there was no other way inor out for another ten minutes he waited on the church porch and in the end did his best to open the door silently only wide enough to allow him to pass through inside he let his eyes adjust to the deeper gloom for the stained glass window let in very little light no one stirred he began to wonder if his hearing had betrayed him and the church was empty or had it been a trick all along and the walker had only opened and closed that door before vanishing in the direction of drew taylors house taking out his torch he swung it from side to side slowly and quietly making his way down the aisle he had to be certain it wasnt until he had reached the front of the church and the altar rail that he found his quarry paul elcott lay on the floor where he had fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion as he prayedor waited in vain for peace r utledge took elcott by the shoulder and the man all but leaped to his feet shocked and terrified lashing out as if to drive away a ghost its rutledge wake up this place is cold as the tomb come back to the rams head i want to know what you were doing out there on the fell tonight i swear you nearly gave me an apoplexy he was still breathing hard good god and then what the bloody hell are you doing here at this hour i might ask the same of you i must have fallen asleep i didnt hear you come in i didnt think anyone would be in the churchwhere were you hiding and why are you spying on me hardly spying i saw you come back into the village where have you been out walking he retrieved his shuttered lantern and fumbled to light it shadows raced around the stone walls as his hands shook beyond south farm hardly an evenings constitutional rutledge switched on his torch if you must know ive been looking for the boy if hes dead theres no one to speak up and tell what happened that night at the farm hes my salvation that boy whether i like him or not whether he killed them or not my lifes in his hands he set the lantern on the seat of a chair and looked up at the altar i cant sleep i work all day and then i walk at night its taking its toll i began hallucinating tonight i could see the boy but i couldnt tell where he was i went stumbling after him and then i realized it wasnt a child after all only a ewe he faced rutledge again if i can find out what happened at the farm i could sleep again instead i shut my eyes and see them lying there i didnt even realize the boy wasnt among them it was sogrisly id never seen anything like it there was a ring of truth in his voice but rutledge wasnt convinced elcott must have read his reaction on his face i dont understand why you wont take janet into custody is it because shes a woman pretty and persuasive or do you know something i dont why have i been left to my own devices to defend myself no one cares what becomes of me except perhaps the belforses a note of selfpity had crawled into his voice theres no money for a fine barrister from london or even preston ill hang if you put these murders off on me and you claim youve been out looking for the boy yes hell you just missed me the other night id heard from robinson that youd found some candles or something up in the old ruin i went to see if there was anything else i know this land better than you if hed been living rough i thought i could find out where it is hes hiding track him i told myself hed come to me out of desperation if nothing else his father hadnt searched for him after all i thought he might be glad of me you think robinson could have found him if hed gone to the farm called his namemade some effort to lure him out who could say what a terrified child might do and its hard to blame robinson for not trying overmuch hes afraid hed only be delivering his son to the police and the hangman better for him to be dead quickly painlessly of exposure you can tell its eating the man alive this waiting for answers you might just as easily have put paid to the boy yourself if youd come across him i tell you hes my salvation why in hell would i want to kill him he stirred uneasily all right youve found out it was me walking about in the night god knows how but you did now go home to bed and leave me alone if you cant take me into custody then have the decency to leave me alone a s rutledge walked back to the hotel hamish said he makes his case verra well if hes not guilty then he has if he is guilty then hes built himself a very fine defense tomorrow morningthis morningill have greeley take him into custody because yere satisfied no because among other things i want an excuse to search his rooms e lizabeth fraser had gone to her room when rutledge returned to the hotel but there was a warm bottle for his bed ready on the table as he closed his door he realized how tired he was he took off his coat and hat and set them in the armoire for the last time twentyfour hours he told himself it was not long enough to finish what had to be done as he fell into a deep sleep rutledge heard hamishs voice you havena found the key it seemed to echo around the room g reeley was thunderstruck you cant believe paul elcott killed his brother i know youve considered him from the start on the spiteful word of miss ashton but i never dreamt it would come to this no then perhaps youve got a better solution to these murders miss ashton ive never been completely satisfied why she was on the road to urskdale in such a storm for my money she was on her way back to carlisle when you found her in a ditch but you refuse to consider that i havent refused ive slowly come to the conclusion that shes been lying from the start for according to the farmer jim follet janet ashton had been crying inconsolably even before shed been told that her sister was dead but had she reached the elcott house if she hadnt what was it that frightened her away aloud he said only but we cant prove that at the moment speaking of proof wheres theos revolver if thats what paul was supposed to have used truthfully i dont know out in the snow somewhere flung there by the killer or dropped there by the child or still hidden in the barn to keep it out of the hands of an inquisitive boy elcott may well have taken it off to war with him for all we know well then you have precious little reason to take paul elcott into custody greeley got up from his desk and began to pace the small office studying the thin tired face of the man seated in his extra chair i tell you i dont understand you its all very well to come here from london and give assistance i grant you i needed your help to see beyond this crime but to judge a man on so little evidenceit smacks of desperation is there something youve been keeping from me just do as i ask if you will greeleys mouth tightened then youre grasping at straws its true but if i dont have better answers for you in twentyfour hours you have my permission to release elcott and with that greeley had to be satisfied news swept through urskdale with the speed of wildfire belfors was one of the first to storm into the police station and engage in a shouting match with greeley janet ashton on the other hand was irritatingly quiet when rutledge told her the news he had expected her to be smug im glad its over with was all she said grace and the children can rest in peace and gerald gerald she said the name with sadness i did love him you know i never understood why he couldnt have loved me as well it broke my heart and i was very foolish to think i could change his mind he said it could be that you were too strong for him grace was vulnerable he may have found that attractive many men do yes ive watched you fall under the spell of elizabeth fraser shes stronger than you think the difference is she knows how to conceal it it was a bitter admission he tried to disregard her accusation what was your first thought when you saw they were all dead that paul had killed them stunned she stared at him when i saw what are you saying i think you knew what had happened before jarvis told you be damned to you she got up swiftly and swept from the room slamming the door behind her p aul elcotts rooms were an indication of his condition a man on the brink of failure with nothing to show for years of hard work while his brother was in the war nothing to show for his attempt to strike out on his own rutledge went through his possessions with distaste how envious had elcott been of his brother he wondered as he searched hamish said its in the nature of a child to be envious had henry elcott the father of the two boys always found paul lacking and had his mother always made excuses for him protecting him the incident with theo elcotts revolver when a young and rebellious paul had tried to sell it was a reflection of the knotted relationships and the fact that paul hid on the fellside when he was unhappy at home told its own story he should have been sympathetic to josh another lonely boy thorough as he was rutledge could find no boots without heels they might already have gone to the rubbish heap there was no hidden revolver although rutledge searched the bar and the saloon and the kitchen as well as the rooms upstairs only a coat with a missing buttonbut there was only janets word that shed found the button in the hut above high fell farm above the hearth on a corner of the mantel was a pretty vase out of place in such dreary lodgings the sort of thing a woman might buy for the sake of the roses that clambered up to the neck pink roses like those in the kitchen and on grace elcotts frivolous hat rutledge had seen it there before but hadnt given it more than a passing thought it was something grace might have given elcott or that he might have planned to give her he looked at it and then lifted it down from its place of honor something inside rattled with hamish already alive in his mind rutledge turned the vase upside down and spilled the contents out into his hand a black button rolled into the palm of his hand a black button like the one that janet ashton had claimed shed found in the ruined hut but there was no sign of the broken cuff link that had once belonged to josh robinson r utledge went to the cell where elcott sat morosely staring at the floor unshaven wearing the same clothes hed had on climbing the fell in the night he looked both pitiable and exasperating a man without spirit who seemed to prefer to wallow in his defeat than strive to overcome it the gray walls the cot to one side and the slop jar in one corner seemed to reflect the stale colorless atmosphere of prison holding out the vase with the clambering roses rutledge asked can you tell me where this came from paul glanced at it and resumed his study of the floor grace gave it me she thought it would brighten my rooms she liked roses flowers of any kind tilting it rutledge let the black button slide into his palm is this from your coat its missing a button i wondered where that had got to he frowned sticking out a finger to touch the button almost as if to see whether or not it had reality that button was loose at the funeral i was going to sew it back on and never got around to doing so what was it doing in the vase and this reaching into his pocket rutledge held out the cuff link it was the second of the pair retained for interrogation purposes that belongs to josh a birthday gift from his father gerald no hugh of course its broken elcott turned it in his fingers a pity its gold grace would have been angry if she knew josh had been so careless did you find it up there in the hut i never found it anywhere it was too dark and then you came at me before i could light my lantern are you now reduced to manufacturing evidence against me it was hard to tell if he was lying or telling the truth rutledge let it go ive a feeling janet ashton reached high fell the night it snowed and something made her turn around and go back the way shed come do you know what it was ask her ive told you until im tired of telling i never killed them but there was undeniable wariness in his voice if you know anything about her movements then youd be better off answering my question elcott sat there stonyfaced and silent did she reach urskdale at the beginning of the storm did you see her or her carriage ask her hamish said it may be he doesna want to gie away too much rutledge left taking the vase with him and setting it on greeleys desk with its contents but he kept the cuff link in his pocket chapter thirty h e cornered janet ashton in the kitchen she looked up in alarm when he strode in closed the door at his back and leaned against it enjoyed your walks have you rutledge asked the tone of his voice was pleasant enough but his eyes were hard she opened her mouth to say something and then shut it firmly theyve been very useful he went on everyone was sympathetic you were injured grieving the waiting was too much for you and so you did what you could to keep your spirits up elizabeth even saw you at the churchyard paying your respects to the dead they are my dead she told him flatly and the churchyard is close enough to the rams head that you could see when paul elcott left for the farm it was easy enough to put the broken cuff link in the vase on the mantel he seldom locks his doors i dont know what youre talking about she retorted youre saying i think that ive tried to make paul elcott look guilty its true but i took back the button id twisted off his coat after the funeral it was hanging on the coatrack in the hall while everyone was in the dining room i thought i could use the button afterward i felt ashamed of myself grief does strange things sometimes and i was so angry that youd done nothing and the cuff link he took it out and showed it to her as if hed found that in the rosetwined vase as well no you cant blame that on me as well she snapped indignantly where did you run into paul elcott the night you arrived at high fell in the early hours of the storm the switch in subjects caught her off balance i never saw him but you did thats why youre so certain hes guilty you saw him leave the farmyoud heard him arguing with gerald there in the barn or in the yard where you could see them and not be seen by them but you heard something didnt you loud voices words both of them must have wished later that they could take back it was a shot in the dark but she was staring at him as if hed just produced a crystal ball a small change in the line of her jaw a sudden tension around the eyes told him he was on the right track paul saw you or the tracks of your carriage you might as well tell me the truth it might go a long way towards proving he was there and angry enough to kill a witness since we dont have josh to tell us what happened afterward the temptation was there he could feel it but she was wary thinking through what could condemn her and what would surely put the noose around paul elcotts neck he will use it to convince his lawyers that you should be in the dock in his place and in turn theyll use what he knows to cast doubt on his guilt a reasonable doubt thats all the jury is required to feel hell go free and theres no possibility of trying him a second time he had to admire her for having the courage to stand there and resist him he remembered how little shed cried out as hed pulled her from the overturned carriage in spite of the pain on the other hand he carried on therere a good many pieces of evidence against you he began to tick them off the fingers of his left hand james follet will testify that you possessed a revolver the police at the barrier in keswick can testify that you never passed themgoing in either direction when i asked if you wanted us to contact any family you might have in the vicinity to let them know you were safe you told me you had none if you hadnt killed your sister how could you know she was dead fourththe button you took but she stopped him before he could finish i didnt know i came here to talk to grace not to kill her i wanted her to go back to hugh now that the twins were born and shed finished her duty to gerald my leave was nearly up i had to make a decision either stay in carlisle or return to london i couldnt put it off any longer if you were only expecting to talk to her why bring a revolver she turned away i have told you gerald had a weapon grace could have used that if shed needed it your story doesnt hold she said nothing then tell me what happened at the farm the tension in the room was so great that hamish seemed to be there just behind him and yet his back was touching the door then before he could stop himself he stepped away from the door so that he was no longer crowding the voice that was always there she must have thought he had given up and was leaving it had just begun to snow when i got there her voice was muffled they were still alive and youre right gerald was just outside the barn and he was talking to paul i left the carriage in the lane and walked towards them i could hear gerald very clearly i could see his face he was absolutely furious he was saying get out of here get off my farm and never come back i dont want to see you here again do you understand me and then paul said something i couldnt hear but gerald answered blood ties be damned that can never excuse what youve done be clear on this i love my wife i love my children and ill guard them if i have to you stand in far greater danger from me than we do from you so theres an end to it before you do something youll always regret at that stage i went hurrying back to my carriage for fear paul would turn to go and on his way find me there eavesdropping and gerald was not in any state for me to come riding up unexpectedly i turned the carriage and drove to the church pulling the horse around to the back where no one could see me and i sat inside for a good hour before venturing back to the farm she put her hand to her face he couldnt tell if she was crying or not but she managed to continue the church was dark quiet peaceful i went back to the farm then hoping gerald might still be in the barn the snow was worsening and hed stock to bring in i looked but he wasnt anywhere to be seen and i assumed hed gone to look for his sheep so i went inside grace was nursing the twins i dont know where josh and hazel werei was just glad not to find them with her she looked so happy holding the babies her voice broke on the last words was she surprised to see you oh yes she hadnt expected me before boxing day i asked her if there was any way that both of us could be happy i asked if she felt anything at all for hugh after all he was the father of two of her children she must have cared once i reminded her that in the eyes of the church she was still married to him and all she said was youre living in a dream janet it has nothing to do with hugh dont you see i told you when you wouldnt come for the wedding i dont think id go back to him even for the childrens sakeeven if anything happened to gerald we fell out of love before the war i know that now were strangers and then gerald came in and i asked him to his face if he could ever love me her shoulders began to shake i went back to the church the snow was heavier and i left the carriage in the lee where the horse was protected from the wind i wanted to freeze to death there in the church and have them find my body i wanted my death to be on geralds soul i wanted everyone to know hed killed me it was a cruel thing to do she whirled not as cruel as his rejection of me it was unbearable and yes at that time i wanted him dead and so with your revolver you went back no i was a coward i raged and cried until i was exhausted and then i set out for carlisle i got to keswick and the horse couldnt go any farther so i stopped in keswick at a small hotel i knew there i must have come to my senses at some point finally two days later against all advice i started back to urskdale when the poor horse went off the road and i couldnt move for the pain i thought i cant die without making amends i must make it up with grace somehow and then when id given up hope you came shes concocted a verra pretty story hamish objected but shes lied before we can find out if you really stayed in keswick rutledge warned her then youll learn im telling the truth she flung at him why in gods name would i have come back to see them all dead even i cant hate that much if shed stayed at keswick he told himself it would explain why she hadnt seen the police barricades in the road more to the point why the police hadnt seen her and when you heard what had happened you believed it was paul who had killed your sister and her family oh yes if you hadnt found my revolver and taken it i think i would have shot him myself dont you see shegracedied not knowing id had a change of heart and all thats left now is to be sure whoever killed herthem hangs chapter thirtyone r utledge said into the sound of her weeping you are certain it was paul elcott you saw standing in front of the barn talking to gerald id take my oath on it she found a handkerchief and dried her tears angrily fighting for control in a court of law then why didnt you tell me this in the beginning why play games with coat buttons because i was there and because youre right paul would just as happily see me hang instead otherwise he wouldnt inherit that bloody farm which is why he killed them in the first place ive seen inspector greeley looking at me ive read what was in his mind im the outsider i have no place here and it wont disturb his precious valley if im taken off to trial im expendable r utledge let her go then it was hamishs voice he could hear as he walked out into the yard and looked up at the fell you canna believe both shes willing to swear he was there as hell no doubt swear she was in the end they may well cancel out the testimony on either side she had a revolver hamish reminded him it was a sticking point in the evidence against janet ashton and a stumbling block in the evidence against paul elcott and if elcott was searching the heights it could mean he hadnt found the boy the night of the murders indeed had reason to suspect josh hadnt died straightaway hamish urged times short you canna leave the choice between them to mickelson rutledge said aloud theres something about her account that doesnt feelright his intuition and his knowledge of people had always been his strengths as a policeman what when all else failed he could rely on to take him through the tangle of halftruths and lies and misdirections to find the guilty party and now when he needed them most they seemed to elude him i shouldnt be questioning anyone ive been relieved hamish repeated you canna leave it to yon flunky from london he had lived with these people for over a week and gotten nowhere was it possible mickelson would see more clearly how the scant evidence stood or muddle it further in his driving need to please chief superintendent bowles mickelson was ambitious he was quick and if he made mistakes he could live with them where rutledge couldnt if rutledge didnt get there before him it was possible that the wrong person would hang and time seemed to be melting away like the snow w alking back into the house he made his way to hugh robinsons room and knocked lightly on the door come robinson was sitting by the window an unopened book in his lap staring out at urskwater id rather think josh died of cold than that someone drowned him he said to rutledge as he stepped into the room he wouldnt have suffered i dont think drowning is likely rutledge told him if the killer found him then the revolver was quickest if he got away the weather took him with a sigh robinson turned ive heard you arrested elcott yes and thats why i need to speak to you now you knew janet ashton for a number of years you said she did everything possible to help your family through the war yes its true i have a good deal of respect for her it couldnt have been easy two women struggling to keep a home going for two small children who had no idea what was happening around them he smoothed the crease in his trousers grace told me shed tried to explain to josh that id gone missing and was very likely dead but id been away for two years by that time he didnt really understand the difference janet told me josh believed id stopped loving him that hurt but might explain the broken cuff links do you think it could have been your sisterinlaw who killed grace and her children robinson considered him why did you send elcott to jail if you arent sure in your own mind its more a matter of leaving no stone unturned then ill tell you what i think janet was probably in love with elcott although ive never asked her outright about that it would explain why she moved north even though she had an excellent position in london thats her business and not mine do i believe that after all shed done for grace she was hurt and angry that grace had taken away the man she thought she loved yes thats probably the case i just cant picture her walking into that house and shooting living people and elcott i dont know him well janet claims he wanted to inherit high fell it could be true would he kill to get the farm i cant answer that what youre telling me is that you still believe your son is themurderer robinson winced at the word i dont know anymore im beyond thinking if you want to know the truth im beyond caring theyre dead i cant bring them back and i just want to walk away and never think about any of it again his eyes begged for understanding i thought the war was hellish enough i expected to dream about it for the rest of my life but when i close my eyes its not the trenches i see not now hazels little facejosh falling asleep alone and unprotected in the snow the blood in that kitchen and i dont know how long that will go on rutledge had no answer to give him he had not learned how to face his own nightmares will you testify at the inquest it will be held in keswick once the roads are better in another three days mickelson would press forward on that i dont know what i can tell them i at this stage im reluctant to blacken my sons name but if you think he stopped shaking his head uncertain let your conscience guide you dont let an innocent man go to the gallows if you think you can stop an injustice rutledge left the room and his last view of robinsons face was daunting he was looking down at his hands an expression of despair twisting his features into a mask of pain h arry cummins found rutledge sitting alone in the dining room going through his policemans notebook im told that paul elcott has been taken into custody yes rutledges answer was curt im glad there is resolution i just didnt expect it to be someone i knew it often is someone you know in a murder case there arent that many wandering madmen to choose from the bitterness in rutledges voice was apparent id heard that gerald had enemiesthe war london came up with a name bertram taylor the man hasnt been seen in days not since his escape from prison i doubt we can consider him a real possibility yes well ive known paul for some years he never gave me the impression of a man ridden by greed envy perhaps but miss ashton must be right its what drove him to do this ive just not come to terms with it yet he paused studying the palm of his hand will you and miss ashton and mr robinson be leaving soon now that theres someone in custody you could see hamish was saying that he was concerned about losing his paying guests with the long winter months stretching out ahead ill be leaving tomorrow their situation will depend on other factors a mr mickelson will be arriving shortly hes the man to ask cummins no fool looked at him sharply youve been replaced i will be yes the play of emotions across the innkeepers face was revealing look about what i said earlier it isnt importanti hope there wont be any need to pass on mymy personal concern rutledge said i see no reason to cause trouble for anyone cummins smiled relieved but at the door he said its been difficult sinking roots into the hard stony soil here for my wifes sake im glad theres been nothing to shame her it was a sad remark to make when rutledge didnt answer he said well i must look to the fires please let us know if theres anything we can do for paul m aggie watched the boy feeding the dog coaxing sybil to eat but the dog was too busy licking the boys pale face i dont think she cares much for toast put some of the drippings on it shell like it better he got up and went to the bowl maggie kept by the sink sybil knowing what he was about to do went with him drooling with anticipation her tail wagged furiously how could sybil be wrong about him or had he killed in a moment of madness long since carried away by the cold and the snow she refused to believe what shed heard with her own ears but that chilling bang bangbang bang echoed in her brain he had been there when the killing was done that much was certain the searchers had all but said he could be a witness what they hadnt said was that hed done this terrible deed but perhaps they hadnt known in the first rush to find the only survivor perhaps that came later she cursed her bad leg she darent go into urskdale village to listen to the gossip the journey there and back would put her in bed for a week longer the london policeman had come three times suspicious wanting to know about the old drift road that went over the saddle and through the narrow cut that led south a child could never have made that journey not in summer even what was it about the old road that intrigued the policeman that one man could pass there without being seen in the village closed to sheep it might be but her father had made his way over the rocks when he was sixteen and found the way to the coast his father had given him a lashing with the leather belt for frightening his mother by disappearing for several days but hed had pocket change with him and bought a small pillow slip with morecambe bay embroidered on it to beg forgiveness saying that hed not realized it was so far to walk it was the only time her father had ever left the dale hed told her once that the sea wasnt much to look at and hed decided that roaming didnt suit him after all she went to the cupboard where her father had kept his belongings the boy idle now watched her as she rummaged through the shelves frustrated she leaned against the wall for a time until she could muster the energy to begin again and then she had a better idea and went out to the barn dragging her foot after her as she searched for the clothes that had belonged to the sheep man who had died at mons a flat cap leather like some of the londoners wore or so hed said jauntily clapping it on his head and laughing at her shed told him he looked a fool but he had laughed again and said the girls in shops dont think so she called him cheeky and had turned away hiding her smile but she had understood why the girls in the london shops found him dazzling sentimental she was not though he had been a wonder with the sheep a blessing after her fathers death she took the hat out of the suitcase it had lived in for the duration of the war and carried it back to the kitchen the boy was curious but she didnt tell him what she was planning an hour with an old cloth and saddle soap made the hat look better and she turned it this way and that studying it it would do she took it back outside and tossed it into the snow that had drifted higher against the shed when the londoner came back she was ready for him chapter thirtytwo e lizabeth fraser found rutledge still in the dining room she had brought with her a pot of tea and some sandwiches a cup and saucer and the sugar bowl and creamer everything looks better on a full stomach she said edging her way through the door the tray balanced on her lap he hurried to help her taking the tray from her and setting it on the tea cart by the hearth tea the english panacea for everything short of the end of the world she looked up from spooning sugar into his cup youre trying to be clever arresting paul is it working yes no who really killed gerald and his family she handed him his cup or do you even know theres something ive seen then its all right you dont understand he bit into the sandwich of roasted pork and realized that he was hungry whats the most common thing to be found in urskdale sheep she answered readily and he smiled in spite of himself yes all right the next most common thing rock of all kinds slate basalt volcanic and it doesnt show tracks and even if it did the snow would have obliterated them thats true but he took the broken heel out of his pocket the ring of nails gleamed dully so thats what cut your hand she exclaimed staring at it indeed someone lost this and you cant walk on rock with a damaged shoe after a time it takes its toll on the foot and the ankle if youd come all the way from the coast and had to walk out again what would you need straightaway a shoemaker barring that a new boot but youd have to send to keswick for it yet ive looked and no one had a damaged boot and there wasnt time to replace it exactly she tucked the tea cozy over the pot and thought about it if youre saying that this damaged shoe belonged to the killer i know where he could find a new boot if they were of a size geralds rutledge smiled hamish was right hed said something about asking the woman she was perplexed hamish never mind im going to be out for a while say nothing about the heel will you h e drove to the elcott farm without paul there to paint the house had taken on a forlorn air as if it had been abandoned rutledge walked into the kitchen by way of the yard door the smell of paint was still heavy in the air and without heat the room had a chill that was permeating as he pulled off his gloves he tried to picture it as hed first seen it with bloodstains marking where five people had died no one had stepped in the blood no one had stopped to make certain that each of the victims in this room had died it was the last thing a child would attempt to do an adult would be aware of the blood on the floor and avoid it especially with a torn heel there was a rectangular wooden box by the yard door which held an assortment of shoes wellingtons in various sizes heavier boots for walking across the fells and a pair of pattens for gardening he went through them one by one matching them up into pairs and all the pairs were there each had heels worn in some cases fairly new in others and a few caked with mud rutledge stood looking at them for a moment as hamish said he wouldna be sich a fool as to tak only one then where is his castoff pair the one with the missing heel and its mate am i on the wrong track hamish didnt answer the barn then aye but what if the heel was lost as he left the dale well cross that bridge when we come to it rutledge carefully piled the shoes back into the wooden box and went out shutting the door behind him the barn took a long time to search he worked methodically his mind busy with all the possible hiding places dust rose from the corners as he dug out old spades and tools a yoke for a team chains of various lengths the broken wheel of a barrow and an assortment of oddments that had sat idle and unused for generations he raked out the stalls searched the mangers went through the tack room and then found the ladder to the loft it was in a far corner buried under damp and rotted straw that he finally found what he was looking for a heavy walking shoe without a heel and its mate h amish said on the drive back to urskdale ye ken this still doesna prove much when he had tried to fit the heel onto the shoe the match had been good and he looked at the size of the shoe it would fit most men he thought well enough to make walking comfortable over a long distance he himself could wear them but hamish was right that the wearer was still in doubtthe time of losing the heel still in doubt what if it had been gerald himself out searching for one of his sheep who had worn these or his father for that matter rutledge had gone back to the house and measured the sole of the boot against the larger wellingtons and leather shoes in the box close enough they could indeed be geralds once in town he went straight to the police station and asked to see paul elcott would you try on these shoes for me rutledge asked as he opened the door he stared at them what on earth for they arent mine just try them if you please elcott unlaced his own boots and put his feet into the pair rutledge had brought then stood up they fit well enough theyre yours then elcott laughed they couldnt be mine theyre london made at a guess ive never been able to afford boots like these geralds then he bought clothes for himself in london before he came home again afraid what he owned wouldnt fit any more then hed have no reason to hide them rutledge said and was gone he asked harry cummins and hugh robinson to try the fit next robinsons feet were nearer to the size of the boot than elcotts but on cummins they were nearly a perfect match cummins looked down at them a shame theyve lost a heel i could do with a new pair m aggie ingerson came to the door at the sound of rutledges motorcar pulling into the yard at dusk you again she said i want to ask you about that old drift road over the fells ive told you what i know youll have to be satisfied with that unless you can speak to the dead my father claimed he took it once but that was before i was born so i cant be sure whether or not it was the truth or bragging why did he take it rutledge watched clouds slide down over the long back for a lark i expect that was the way he was how long do you think it would take to reach the coast i cant answer that in daylight and good weather the better part of two days its not so far as the crow flies but theres the elevation to consider in heavy snow longer than that youre not thinking that boy could have got out by the road no i doubt he had the strength to walk that far then someone coming in yes she pointed towards the sheds up the rise from the barn then you might want to go look at what sybil brought me last night i left it there by the shed when i fed the sheep he switched off the motor and got down to walk up the hillside towards the shed the prints of a dozen wellingtons went up and down ahead of him mucking up the snow it was hard to separate them now overlapping in the slush and mud when he had reached the shed he turned and looked back at her thats right just there maybe a little to your left he looked around at the snow by the shed and saw that something had been dropped in one place pulling it out he could see that it was a leather cap hamish said yeve got the boots and now the cap thats how he came and went rutledge slapped the snow off the hat and examined it he would have sworn it was made before the war when leather was better quality taylor hed been in prison he wouldnt have had access to newer clothes he walked back to the woman standing there leaning on her cane watching him the dog brought it from where how am i to know i sent her to bring in some sheep that were straying towards the petersons that was two nights ago she came back with this in her mouth if it belongs to peterson youll oblige me by taking it back to him im not well enough to get there and back youre certain that the dog went in that direction sybils been running sheep for seven years she does what shes told and theres an end to it thank you miss ingerson ill speak to the petersons she watched him drive back down the lane well satisfied when she went back inside the boy was standing there with the ax in his hands r utledge stopped to speak to mr peterson finding him sweeping tracked snow out of his barn he greeted rutledge warily and waited for him to explain his business when rutledge showed him the cap he answered forthrightly it didnt belong to him but thats not to say the haldnes boys werent making free with my property theyre a rowdy lot and up to any manner of mischief and so he called next at the apple tree farm and showed the cap to mrs haldnes she was trimming a pie to set in the oven for dinner and wiped her floured hands on her apron before taking the cap she examined it as closely as if she were a prospective buyer and when shed finished she handed it back to rutledge never saw that before that i know of not the sort of things my lads wear where did you say youd found it but he hadnt said and didnt answer her a second time much to her chagrin a pair of boots a cap but not the man who had worn them a pity rutledge thought as he turned into the hotel yard and switched off the motor that neither of them would clear paul elcott aye paltry matters until you find their owners owner rutledge corrected hamish out of habit his mind was on other things he fully expected to walk into the hotel and find mickelson there before him but as it happened hed been given one more day of grace chapter thirtythree r utledge took the cap and the torn heel to his room they would have to be handed over to mickelson when he got there along with any other information that he felt was pertinent he stared at the cap his mind elsewhere and then slowly began to actually look at it what was it hamish had said not ten minutes ago owners hed grown up with dogs they had been in his house and in his life for as long as he could remember why would a dog sent out to manage the sheep bring back the cap of a man whose scent she didnt know the curdogs as drew taylor had called them were working animals bred to it and trained to be an extension of their owners in scotland with his godfather hed seen a young border collie round up geese so strong was the instinct the fast run the sudden drop the eyes that registered everything and anticipated just the right move necessary to bring a herd together hold it or cut out part of it some animals worked on whistled signals some on hand signs and some were so well trained to certain tasks that they could be sent out on their own but he was not the expert and he knew someone who was he dropped the cap into his suitcase and went back out to the motorcar it was dark by the time he reached jim follets house a good sheep man f ollet and his wife were just finishing their dinner and invited him to have pudding and tea with them bieder no longer on guard duty in the barn lay stretched out on a woven rag rug head on his paws his eyes looked up acknowledging a stranger in the house and then went back to whatever drowsy contemplation hed been enjoying rutledge could see the curiosity behind the smiles of his host and hostess but he had told them the truth when he had walked into their kitchen im here to learn something about your dog my dogor any dog trained to sheep any dog and then mary follet was asking for news of miss ashton and follet himself wanted to know what had possessed rutledge to take paul elcott into custody i cant for the life of me see him committing such a horrendous crime early days rutledge told him theres still much work to be done before were certain of anything follet didnt appear to be mollified by the time they had finished at the table and follet had carried him off to the parlor rutledge had given them all the news he had of urskdale even to reporting on the henderson child with the bruised collarbone and thanked mrs follet for the pudding mrs follet had commented at length on the funeral service and how sad it was to see a family buried together but it was good of them to put the babies with their mother rather than in separate little coffins a kindness he agreed follet said as they shut the parlor door and sat i daresay its not my wifes cooking thats brought you here again if youve put paul elcott in jail then youve been satisfied that miss ashton is in the clear i never knew what to think about her out in the storm im not satisfied with anything rutledge answered frankly and i shall have to speak to someone in keswick before i can be sure shes in the clear what i need at the moment is your skill with sheepdogs how theyre trained how you work them what they doand wont do while minding the sheep follet complied describing how he could tell when the litter was no more than ten days old which had the instinct to be a good working dog and which didnt but thats my years of experience speaking you understand something about how alert they are how they play amongst themselves and im seldom wrong he smiled and turned to the subject of training which is little more than building on what the dog already has in him or her and how a younger dog could be taken into the field with a more mature animal to learn the best pair i ever had were mother and daughter he finished ill never see their like again cassandra and zoe they were called my daughters choice of names that year i taught them and they taught me it was a rare sight to watch them work sheep id take them down to the dog trials sometimes for the pleasure of seeing them show up every other animal there rutledge said when a dog is sent to carry out a certain taskto workcan he or she be easily distracted not unless the flock is in danger weve had rogue dogs a time or two killing where they could but its not something you see all that often if your dog was working and came acrosssay a glove youd droppedwould he bring it back to you no still i had a bitch who carried about any gloves she could find youd have a care about where you set yours down shed be on to them that fast but not while she was with the sheep she was singleminded then rutledge got to his feet youve been very helpful i appreciate that id like to know what its in aid of with the matter closed someone told me shed sent her dog to move the sheep and it brought back an article of clothing that could have belonged to the killer thats possible of course but id be doubtful he may have stopped and sniffed at it if hed known the owner and recognized the scent out of curiosity but not while working can you be reasonably certain about that id take an oath on it rutledge took his leave shortly thereafter and in the motorcar on the way back to urskdale he said aloud to hamish maggie ingerson lied to me the question is why and what did she expect to gain from it a t dinner rutledge announced that he was being relieved of duty as soon as the new man arrived this was met with no more than curiosity until he told them that the new man would require their presence until he was satisfied that the case was closed and hell be satisfied that paul killed my sister janet ashton demanded i dont see the need for another inspector to come here if theres been an arrest there was alarm in her face and it quickly spread around the table as rutledge went on ive ordered elcott released tonight theres insufficient evidence on which to continue holding him consternation reigned everyone talking at once it was a trick miss ashton exclaimed nothing more than a trick hugh robinson said are you telling me that you believe josh harry cummins looked quickly at his wife and then his voice rose over the others weve just been able to sleep of nights but it was mrs cummins who put the cap on the discussion i never thought it was paul she said i never thought hed harm a fly but i expect i do know who killed them i never liked george standish over at hill farm hes always putting on airs i wouldnt put it past him to kill anybody there was a smugness in her face as her eyes ran around the table you cant mean that her husband exclaimed you hardly know him ive said i never liked him cumminss eyes met rutledges over her head pleading in them yes thank you mrs cummins rutledge said hastily ill look into that myself she subsided her attention returning to her plate cumminss fingers were shaking as he set down his knife and fork he said quietly standish is probably he began taking in paying guests at the farm last summer it rather cut into our own business my wife wasunderstandably unsettled by it elizabeth fraser sitting beside rutledge at the table added under her breath hes seventy rutledge said how well did the ingersons know the elcotts cummins threw a grateful glance in rutledges direction i expect they knew them as well as any of us did i dont think there was a particular friendship miss ingersons father died some years agohe was henry elcotts generation maggie has always been ratherreclusive perhaps thats the best word there was no son she took over the farm herself and proved soon enough that she ran it as well as her father had before her but it drained all the life out of her when the man who helped her with the sheep died in the war she did what everyone else had done made do as best she could that was the opinion id formed rutledge answered shes forthright and apparently unflappable if she hadnt had a problem with her leg she might have been out with the searchers mrs cummins said its dr jarviss fault that he didnt have the sense to leave well enough alone there is no hope of her finding a husband crippled as she is elizabeth fraser flinched but mrs cummins had turned to look at her husband i expect she knows all about the old road over the fells to the coast she showed harry where it was and how it ran but that was years ago wasnt it my dear when she was much much prettier r estless in the night rutledge got up and dressed then made his way out of the house the walls seemed to close in on him and hamish was busily reminding him that inspector mickelson would arrive the next day it wouldna be politic to stay on after hes reported to you but rutledge ignored him he had never dealt with a case where so many people were intent on misdirecting the course of the inquiryeach for his or her own ends lies obstruction muddled evidence fingerpointing as if mourning were not enough elcott and miss ashton had argued with the victims even robinson was so intent on his own troubled role in the familys past that he wouldnt or couldnt look elsewhere the ironmonger belfors was protecting paul elcott out of habit and because the information he could give the police was proof that elcott knew where a revolver was to be had greeley wanted to live in peace with his neighbors long after rutledge had moved on harry cummins was intent on protecting his own secret and his wife was not trustworthy as she pursued her own nightmares of them all elizabeth fraser had the least to win or lose but she too had a past that made her vulnerable would mickelson look at that and hear the whispers that she had cared for gerald elcott more than she should and decide to point his finger in her direction he clenched his teeth and swore there was nothing he could do about that now he had had his chance to come to a suitable conclusion he could see all the twists and turns of the interviews hed conducted he could see where each of the people involved had something to hide except for maggie ingerson why should she offer up a cap that had nothing to do with the south road unless she like belfors saw in paul elcott the local man being sent to the gallows by outsiders who were glad to let him take the blame all of themcummins and his wife miss fraser miss ashton and hugh robinsonwere not native to urskdale they would have had no defenders if the tables had been turned even follet had put in a word for elcott and expressed his doubts about janet ashton an independentminded woman like maggie ingerson might just do her bit to set him free butwho could have told her that hed been taken into custody rutledge looked out at the snow that still lay deep in corners against northern walls and wherever traffic hadnt trampled it into mud the storm had once covered every footprint but even in this light he could squat on his heels and see fresh tracks the hobnails of drew taylors boots the worn pattern of cumminss wellingtons his own shoes miss ashtons smaller soles beyond them the prints made by the search parties climbing the fell if the snowfall had been lighter greeley might have caught his man simply by tracking him case closed rutledge turned to the house and his hand was already on the latch to the yard door hamish was saying something and he stopped to listen but under the voice was something else a memory he tried to bring it back and lost it in hamishs last words yeve got til teatime tomorrow ye canna afford to sleep r utledge lay awake another hour reviewing all hed seen and done here in urskdale raking through his actions and his unconscious observations by four in the morning he had drifted into an uneasy sleep drained by his failure and when dreams came they were mixed and morbid as if in punishment he could see the boy running dragging his feet and the elcotts lying dead in the snow scattered like soldiers after an attack limbs bent and bodies trampled by sheep overhead an artillery barrage lighted the sky and he could hear hamish calling the boys name pointing to the mud where rutledge could see his footprints clearly in bloody snow the artillery barrage was louder the shells exploding in his face and he came out of deep sleep with a start his heart pounding in time with the pounding on his door chapter thirtyfour w hen rutledge opened his door the thin balding man standing there rocked back on his heels and said in a high clear tenor it was the very devil of a journey and im going to my bed youve been relieved it was mickelson behind his back his men called him cassius for his lean and hungry look the name fit for he was notorious for his ingratiating manner towards his superiors while behind their backs he ruthlessly promoted himself a greengrocers son he had climbed high and expected to go higher rutledge was left standing there while mickelson strode to the door of the room harry cummins had assigned him cummins cast an apologetic glance in rutledges direction as he asked his latest guest if all was to his liking rutledge shut his door again and stood there he felt empty he had fought for six monthssevento rebuild his career and it had come down to this hamish said you canna be certain hell do any better but that didnt take away the stigma of being relieved of being seen as failing in his duty bowles would take pleasure in seeing that word got around and he would never let rutledge live it down hes no so clever only ambitious hamish pointed out softly rutledge took a deep breath for his own sake he must somehow find the answer that had eluded him from the startthat had eluded all of them for his own selfrespect standing there he remembered his dream there had been something he tried to recapture the swiftly fading memory of it artillery and bloody snow but the artillery had just been mickelson pounding on his door regardless of his sleeping neighbors and then he had it not the blood not the dead lying about what he had seen were the boys footprints in the snow for he had seen them those same dragging prints in life not a child fleeing in terror but a child shuffling in shoes too large his heels leaving not a crisp mark like a mans but a blurred smudge r utledge went back to his bed and slept for two more hours after packing his belongings he made his way quietly to the kitchen where elizabeth fraser had already put the kettle on to boil will you help me he asked her nothing quite as dangerous as putting your head into the lions mouth but all the same yes of course i heard that inspector mickelson is here is it a message for him no for inspector greeley i asked him last night to let paul elcott go home would you tell him for me that ive left for london and as you were cleaning my room you found a shirt that id forgotten that youd like to send it on to me she stared at him but where will you be dont ask me to tell you but as a favor let inspector mickelson sleep as long as he can a smile spread across her face have you found the boy i always believed that somehow you would his face betrayed nothing as far as anyone is concerned ive left urskdale nodding at him she turned to the kettle i understand now her mind was busy jumping ahead of his theres meat left from dinner last night i can put up some sandwiches do you have a thermos thats thoughtful of you ill take my case out to the motorcar and fetch it when he had cranked the motorcar and come back into the kitchen she handed him a packet of sandwiches and then filled his thermos im sorry to see you go she said simply but godspeed she held out her hand and he took it held it for a moment and then turned away r utledge drove to the elcott farm and beyond it to the shearing pens where he had stopped once before with drew taylor the shed was open on one side and he drove the motorcar into it he knew mickelson the site of the murders had been cleaned and painted over the victims had been buried if he came here at all he would listen to greeley explain where and how the bodies had been discovered and then he would go back to urskdale and begin to question the people closest to the crime paul elcott was not likely to go far afield even if he found the courage to go on working at the house and unless the weather came down again the elcott sheep would be left to their own resources the motorcar wouldnt be found for a day or two at best he took the packet of food with him and the thermos and set out on foot there would be a vantage point somewhere where he could watch the ingerson farm in his pocket were the field glasses hed used before at the hotel and in his mind was the map with the comments that drew taylor had made when they surveyed the terrain together it would be uncomfortable and cold where he was going but in france he had suffered much worse conditions what had driven him then was a desire to die what was driving him now was the feeling that he must vindicate himself or lose all hed achieved in the long fearsome struggle to heal he thought fleetingly of elizabeth fraser but that was far far down the road hamish demanded and if you find the lad then what rutledge couldnt answer him m aggie walked into the kitchen and said to the boy im grateful for your willingness to defend me if you could but that ax is sharp and if you get hurt whos to help me then he lowered the ax and sheepishly put it back where hed found it by the door she went about her work in the kitchen and ignored him for a time then she sat down and began to talk to him about the animals he was caring for sheep fall into different lots can you tell a ewe from a gimmer shearling or a tup from a hogg a wedder from a wedder shearling she could read the scorn in his face of course you can she answered her own question still it never hurts to learn the skills of the man youre taking on to work for you she asked him a question or two about the wool clip and saw that he understood her finally as if it were of no importance maggie said i dont think hell be back ive seen to it the man from london who keeps coming here but well give it a night or two before we take any chances with bad luck the relief in the drawn little face touched her heart but later in the evening after the fire had burned low and she was sitting at ease in her chair her leg for once comfortable she remembered another expression on his face as he held the heavy ax in both hands and she found herself wondering what he would have done with it youre a fool maggie ingerson she scolded herself but a twinge of pain in her leg reminded her that beggars couldnt be choosers w hen night fell rutledge moved again taking up a position in a sheep pen the grazing animals moved silently along the slopes hooves scraping away the snow for whatever nourishment they could find a ewe stared at him briefly and sneezed before moving on finally they settled for the night lumps of dirty white were hardly different from the snow around them one was near enough that he could hear it breathing and he found the sound comforting there were stars overhead great sweeps of them and he picked out the winter constellations one by one his feet were nearly numb now the icy crust under them offering no warmth and the wind picked up an hour later the soft whistle of it coming over the western fells promising a deeper cold by morning it was nearly three he thought when the square of lamplight brightened the yard door of the ingerson farm he brought up his field glasses and thought he could just define maggies bulk in her old coat standing against the light she seemed to be sniffing the air almost like a cornered animal searching for danger and then she moved away from the door the dog leaped out into the yard and scrambled towards the pen by the shed where rutledge had seen some dozen or so animals kept safely while they healed or regained their strength behind the dog stepping out the door came an oddly shaped figure that seemed to be half gnome half monster a superstitious man rutledge thought would have a wild tale to tell about what was living in maggie ingersons house the norwegians had their share of small monsters and the irish too but rutledge didnt need hamish to tell him what was walking up to the pen bundled in a mans coat that was as long as he was tall wellingtons that were too large scuffing through the snow a pail of some sort in both hands it was a boy and unless maggie had more secrets than hed guessed already the boy was josh robinson r utledge spent a very uncomfortable night in the shearing shed once hed reached it again he thought about the feather bed hed left behind at the hotel with a warm bottle at his feet and a dying fire in the kitchen that wrapped its heat around cold shoulders and frozen ears but the elation he felt kept him from sleeping tomorrow he would brave the ogre in the farmhouse and ask maggie ingerson what she thought she was about it was hamish who kept bringing up the question of what would become of josh robinson once the fact that somehow hed survived was known what do you do if a child has killed and what could he tell the world about what had happened that sunday evening when the snow was thick and the door had opened on death b y morning the house was hushed smoke coiled from the chimney but there was nothing else to indicate whether the people inside were asleep or awake rutledge made his way down the slippery icy rocks towards the farm he was stiff with cold and in no mood to brook obstruction by the time he had reached the house he was sweating under his heavy coat but he knocked with firmness on the door rather than pounding after a time it opened and maggie stepped out to confront him almost close enough to him there in the little space between her and the shutting door to touch him i know the boy is here im cold tired and i need to come in and warm up it would be better if you didnt make a fuss she stared at him her face hard revealing nothing i dont know what youre talking about and i know my rights you cant come in without a warrant to search im here as a private citizen not a policeman open the door miss ingerson you can conceal the boy but not his tracks he pointed to the scuffed prints that crisscrossed the yard then he handed her the flat black cap you shouldnt have shown me this before he could stop her shed caught his arm in a grip as strong as that of any man he knew she pulled him after her away from the door determined and menacing step through that door and youll step into an ax she told him he felt colder than he had on the hillside in the night then its true he replied feeling depression sweep through him it was the answer hed least wanted to hear josh robinson was a killer i dont know whats true and whats not she said angrily but that lad is in no condition for a rough policeman to badger him hell do you an injury and ill be held to blame if hes dangerous why have you harbored him all this time miss ingersonhis father is waiting for him in urskdale village his aunt is there they will do all thats possible for him you dont understand hes not speaking he lives in terror of being found and hes come to trust me leave him alone you know i cant do that you have no right to him he was half dead when the dog found him hed have been dead in another hour by rights hes mine and i wont let you touch him he remembered what he had once thought concerning janet ashton that in many cultures when a man saved the life of another man he was owed that life miss ingerson no go away and leave us in peace i wont let you have him she dropped her hand from his arm and turned towards the door her mind on the ax praying the boy hadnt moved it she wasnt afraid of this man and she could put an end to it even the hard cold soil could be scratched away enough to leave his body where it would never be seen again she was not going to be deterred and if the boy had been her own flesh and blood she wouldnt have fought any more fiercely for him but rutledge had turned as swiftly as she had his hand on her shoulder let me talk to him otherwise paul elcott will be blamed for what happened let me at least ask him she stopped so short that he bumped into her whats paul elcott to me wheres he when the sheep need to be brought in or feed dragged up to the high pens wheres he when the pasture grass isnt green in april for the lambing and i have to take the cart and hunt for fodder to keep them alive hell outlive me this boy and see to what i cant hes got no one else to care about him and neither do i he has to go to schoolhe has to live with his fatherhe cant be enslaved to fetch and carry for you or anyone else you cant keep him like a lost dog you found in the snow i havent enslaved him ive given him a bed and food and sybil to hold on to when the nights are dark and he cries out ive given him work to take his mind off what hes seen all you want him for is to hang him or lock him away in an asylum where hes got nothing tell me thats better rutledge dropped his hand it isnt i grant you but there are five dead and we cant walk away from them the dead feel no pain they dont hurt when they drag their leg into bed at night and they cant give him human comfort we need each other he and i and theres an end to it let me talk to him let me see if i can find out what happened that night let me do the right thing bugger the right thing she retorted but she was close to tears and she used the rough sleeve of her coat to wipe brusquely across her eyes i wish you were dead i wish youd never come here thats why i gave you that cap so youd go look south of here along the coast and leave us to go on as we are it was never in the cards he said wearily you know it and so do i they stood there staring at each other faces tense eyes blazing after a time she said if i dont let you see him youll bring more policemen here and scare the boy into fits and then she turned towards the house hes not going to take you away she called out i swear it but ive got to bring him in there was no response and then the door opened and josh robinson stood there with the doublebladed ax in his hand defiant and ominously silent beside him sybil stood guard her ruff raised and stiff and growls sounding deep in her throat chapter thirtyfive w hat does a man say to a child who may be a killer what could mitigate the nightmare that must be locked in his mind ye willna have a second chance hamish warned quietly josh my name is rutledge you may call me ian if you like ive come from london to find you rutledge stayed where he was and kept his voice level as if there was no danger in the confrontation between them feeling his way the defiant face drained of color and the boy began to shake but the ax was still clenched in his hands ware hamish cautioned rutledge quickly revised what he was about to say i was a soldier like your father ive been through some rough patches in the war he went on but nothing like youve been through if you will let me come in and talk hes mute maggie said just behind him fair enough ill ask you a few questions josh and you can nod your head or shake it to let me know if im right or wrong im not here to harm maggie ingerson shes a very brave woman and i have a high regard for her ask him if hell go away again and leave us as we are she told josh then youll know where he stands the boys eyes switched anxiously from rutledges face to hers and back again she knows i cant go away the policeman answered honestly for days now weve been afraid that you were dead we were worried we searched everywhere well into the night sometimes your aunt janet is in urskdale at the hotel more than anything she wants to know youre safe shes grieved for you fearful that youd lost your way in the snow or were hurt unable to call for help and your father has come from hampshire a shriek of anguish was ripped from the child and he slammed the door so hard it seemed to bounce on its hinges and rutledge moving swiftly towards it heard the fever pitch of his anger from inside youre lyingyoure lying he shrilled over and over again and they could hear the ax striking the floor in rhythm with the words t hey stood in the cold side by side but without speaking until the thuds stopped and the screams became broken sobs it seemed rutledge thought like hours before silence fell and he looked at maggie go in and comfort him he doesnt like to be touched all the sameand leave the door wide she finally did as he asked opening the door with some trepidation and a wave of warm air thick with the smell of cooked porridge washed over them the boy lay on the floor his arms around the dog the ax forgotten but in the floor were raw gouges where he had pounded the edge into the wood sybil has done more than i ever could maggie said a forlorn note in her voice she stooped to brush the tearwet hair out of the childs face and he flinched rutledge stepped in behind her and managed to shut the door the heat of the room was stiffling after his long night in the cold he pulled off his coat and set it with his hat on a pail by the door maggie had gingerly retrieved the ax and held it now as if she was debating using it rutledge knelt on the floor i could do with a bowl of that porridge he said and a cup of tea you wont need that he nodded to the ax she looked down at the blade of the ax and then set it aside but she didnt move i wont hurt him go on make his breakfast and ill share it i need to reach him and that may be the best way reluctantly she went to the dresser and found three bowls rutledge looked at the curledup figure of the boy and then gently picked him up in his arms it was as if josh had burrowed so deep into himself that he wasnt aware of what was happening for he put up no resistance rutledge carried the child to the chair where maggie usually satwhere her father before her had sat although rutledge wasnt aware of thatand settled down still holding the boy by the time maggie had the porridge on the table josh was asleep it was two oclock in the afternoon before the boy woke up maggie had spent most of that time trying to persuade rutledge to leave him where he was he opened redrimmed eyes puffy from crying and sleep and stared at rutledge without emotion for hours rutledge talked to him about sybil about the sheep about maggie about westmorland and london whatever he could think of that had nothing to do with murder or policemen it was long after midnight before rutledge nearly hoarse by that time got a response josh looked up at him and said will you hang me now r utledge said you cant be hanged youre too young and i dont know what youve done to deserve such punishment i wasnt there maggie stirred unwilling to force the child to relive what had happened that night in the snow i was josh said simply i killed them all of them murderers always hang its what he told me my father f or several seconds rutledge sat without moving and then he said gerald was the last to die then maggie got to her feet and went to the sink where she leaned on her hands and stared out the window the boy shook his head no he was the first and thenthen hazel after that mama and the babies he let me go then told me theyd come and find all the bodies and id be hunted down like a mad dog and hanged i ran he had the revolver against his head by that time and i heard the shot before id gone very far but his voice came after me over and over no matter how hard i ran telling me it was my fault all my fault for not wanting to come and live with him but mama understood and wouldnt make me do it i was so scared shed die when the babies came and they would send me to london after all mr blackwell had told her thats where i belonged and paul he said none of us belonged here that we werent elcotts at all even though mama had married gerald and gerald called me his boy and greggie haldnes told me i ought to go back to london and stop putting on airs at his school he went on spilling out a litany of small indignities and mistreatment and insults that had made him tragically vulnerable did you tell these things to your mother he shook his head dr jarvis said i mustnt worry her that having twins was dangerous and i wouldnt want to be responsible for what happened then rutledge nearly swore biting off the words are you sure it was your father in the kitchen that night are you sure you didnt just imagine him because you wanted him so much josh shook his head again vigorously and rolled up the sleeve of his heavy shirt maggie caught her breath in shock deep bruises only just turning green and yellow ringed his thin arm in the shape of a mans fingers gripping hard he made me watch he held on to me and made me watch b y the time rutledge had stemmed the tide of confession and helped maggie feed josh robinson and put him to bed in her fathers room he was hardly able to keep his own eyes open he could see in his head the horror that the boy had carried for more than a week the images raw and frightful but the last hours had taken their toll when he came back to the warmth of the kitchen and sat down in maggies chair he said to her ill rest for half an hour and then ill go and do what has to be done yes its for the best you look like i feel ill just lie down a bit myself she lowered the flame on the lamp banked the stove and then went into her room shutting the door the silence in the room the ticking of a clock somewhere else in the house and the warmth finally overwhelmed rutledge and he slept it was nearly three quarters of an hour later when he woke and couldnt remember where he was the room was dark the lamp blown out as his eyes adjusted to his surroundings he got up and held a match to the wick cupping his hand around the flame until it had caught settling the chimney in place again he stood where he was and looked around the room all was as it should be maggie ingersons door was shut as was the boys sybil lay by the yard door head on her paws but her eyes gleaming in the glow of the lamp he glanced at his watch too late to wake mickelson or greeley hed have to fetch his car soon and bring it around his eyes swung back to the yard door the ax was gone he crossed the room in four strides and flung open maggies door blankets were piled on her bed in the shape of her body the coverlet drawn over them in the dark it seemed she was sleeping but a shaft of lamplight spilled across her pillow from the kitchen and she wasnt there chapter thirtysix r utledge threw on his coat and headed for the door sybil refused to let him pass growling and baring her teeth at him swearing he turned and saw a door to another part of the house shut off cold and dark but he went down the passage until he came to the front hall and the main door he let himself out and trudged through the snow there to the lane that led to the main road he was a man longer strides younger healthier by far but she had already made it to the urskdale road dragging the ax behind her when he caught up to her maggie swung it around in a circle keeping him off let me go he deserves to die that bloody bastard its certain they wont hang him on the boys word theyll put the boy into an institution instead and treat him as if hes mad none of this would have happened if youd left us alone miss ingersonmaggielisten to me youll never reach urskdale you cant make it that far and if you did theyd hang you for what youre intending to do she still held him at bay what good am i with this leg sometimes i think dying is all thats left and im not afraid of it at least ill do one deed worthy of the name before im done maggie i can see that robinson hangs ill give you my word ill swear on anything you ask come back to the farm before the boy wakes up and finds you gone he needs you now and he will need you in the days to come dont do this she stood there in the starlight staring at him he never knew what decided her she swung the ax in a wide circle the sharp blade shimmering in the ambient light he thought for an instant that she was going to attack and kill him and then she let the blade go whirling and singing and gleaming until it finally buried itself in the snow thirty feet away and as it flew she howled like a trapped animal or a viking warrior a sound that sent the hairs on the back of his neck standing stiff and wild as if hed stumbled onto something pagan lost in the mists of time h e got her to the house and then went back to retrieve the ax and store it in the barn it had been a long and painful journey for her the cold and the strain of going so far telling on her but she walked with her back upright and her head high although he could see the streaks of tears down her face he said nothing about them and when exhausted she finally let him take her arm he gave her the support he would have offered a comrade on the battlefield i t was after four when he made the long journey back up the hill towards the sheep pen and then over the saddle to the shed where he had left his motorcar it was cold and at first refused to crank but after the third try he got it started and climbed in there was something he needed to do before he reached the hotel or spoke to inspector greeley t he door to the rooms paul elcott used on the second floor of the licensed house was unlocked and rutledge went in confident he would find elcott asleep he took the dark stairs two at a time and opened the door to elcotts bedroom saying its rutledge theres something you need to know there was no light only a shadow across the window moving in an erratic pattern tired as he was he stood there for an instant trying to make sense of that curious motion as it came towards him and then retreated hamish exclaimed too late rutledge dug his torch out of his pocket and turned it on the brilliant burst of light blinded him but behind the flash he could see paul elcott hanging from the ceiling where a lamp had once been i t took him no more than a matter of seconds to kick the upended chair out of the way and shove a table under the dangling feet and then he was on top of the table his pocketknife sawing at the rope above elcotts head as the last strands parted elcotts body jackknifed and hit rutledge hard knocking both of them to the floor winded rutledge lay there fighting for breath and then he rolled to his knees the torch arcing in a halfcircle threw the room into bright relief and then shadow elcott was gagging badly rutledge loosened the rope around his throat and turned him over pushing air into his lungs as if he were a drowned swimmer elcott was still struggling to breathe and in the glow of the torch kicked under the bed now his face seemed suffused with blood rutledge left him there ran down the stairs and up the street he began pounding on dr jarviss door calling to the house to wake up jarvis testily put his head out of an upper window what now its elcottget over there now rutledge i thought youd gone back to london man hurry or hell be dead before you reach him he turned and raced back the way hed come hamish was loud in his mind reminding him that he hadnt searched the rams head elcott was breathing the sound of each rasping inhalation carrying down the stairs as rutledge came up them he lay as hed been left on the floor and his eyes were open as rutledge found a lamp and lit it he blinked and then began to struggle as if fearful of whoever was behind the light its rutledge what the hell were you trying to do man some of the tension seeped out of elcott and he lay still concentrating on trying to breathe jarvis was pounding up the stairs shouting rutledges name hed put a coat over his pajamas and shoved his bare feet into his shoes he stopped short in the doorway staring first at elcott and then his eyes traveled up to the dangling rope overhead my good god was all he said hurrying to his patient after a time he rocked back on his heels it was a nearrun thing but the bone heregesturing to the front of the throathasnt been broken and he was lucky his neck didnt snap he turned back to elcott whatever possessed you to do such a thing man the inspector here had ordered you released without prejudice it was over he stopped and got slowly to his feet his eyes sought rutledges or was this a confession of sorts it was meant to be as the doctor had worked rutledge had retrieved a single sheet of crumpled paper stuck through by a pin to elcotts pillow he held it out now there were four words on the sheet printed by a man under great stressor duress i did do it jarvis said again my good god and then you shouldnt have stopped him it will all have to be done again he didnt hang himself rutledge said did you elcott the dazed man on the floor shook his head vehemently and struggled to sit his limbs seemed to have a mind of their own arms folding as if no longer able to hold his weight he tried to speak but his throat closed over the words rutledge said them for him it was hugh robinson tidying up before mickelson could dig into the past as i had done it might not have worked twice his act of grieving he couldnt pretend to a second suicide attempt elcott elcotts eyes were on rutledges face he nodded vigorously a sound like a growl coming from his damaged throat jarvis picked up the overturned chair and sat in it his mouth open lets get elcott to the bed rutledge told the stunned doctor but it was a moment or two before jarvis could comply elcott sank into the pillows and tried again to find his voice when it came it was no more than a harsh raw whisper hardly audible as words smothsmothered mepillow then leftdanglingtoes on chair back couldcouldntrise uploosen noose lost my balance trying fell off it was a hard way to die choking slowly to death jarvis wiped the palm of his hand over his mouth robinson you say robinson carefully planned and executed from the start rutledge told him he killed them all but why why in gods namethey were his own children revenge he stood by the bed and you were to be the scapegoat he said to elcott id failed but he was afraid the new man would be luckier jarvis got to his feet and went to the kitchen rummaging in the dresser and the pantry he came back with three glasses and a bottle of whiskey without a word he poured a finger for each of them but had to hold elcott as he sipped the raw spirits sent him into a gasping fit rutledge was saying jarvis i want you to stay here with him ill find constable ward and send him to keep you company dont leave until ive come back again do you understand me yes yes youll find ward sleeping in the back of the police station greeley has had someone there since theermurders the doctor was right ward had prepared himself a cot in the cell the door open his shoes on the floor within easy reach the constables snores could be heard from the outer office he listened groggily as rutledge briefly explained what he wanted done with respect sir ive been told youre relieved he rubbed his eyes with his fists then stretched to ease his shoulders if you want to leave jarvis and his patient to the mercy of the killer coming back to see the results of his handiwork rutledge told him curtly by all means follow the rules meanwhile im going to speak to greeley ward was already shoving his feet into his shoes and reaching for his tunic then ill be on my way sir mr greeley did leave orders to be called if there was any new developments r utledge sat in the prim greeley parlor for half an hour speaking rapidly and carefully to his counterpart greeley half asleep when he began was wide awake by the end ive never heard the like he said grimly but what put you on to him along the coast they swore no one had asked directions about the old road he didnt have to ask he must have heard about it and spent some time during his summer holiday searching it out for himself it was useful and even though he was caught in the storm hed have made some sort of provision even for that hes not a man to leave much to chance and the bastard made me take him to see his dead to count them more than likely it was a good excuse for his staying in his room much of the time waiting for his sons body to be found should we summon inspector mickelson and tell him whats happened greeley asked as hes in charge if we go to wake mickelson now robinson will hear us his room is just across from the inspectors hell think weve found elcott and he may come out into the passage to ask if theres news better to wait until everyone has come to the kitchen for breakfast and you say wards with dr jarvis and elcott rutledge confirmed it and greeley went on well just step around to sergeant millers house and put him in the picture well not take a man like robinson without trouble greeley started for the door then he stopped wheres the murder weapon then but rutledge was ready for the question it was theos revolver i daresay robinson disposed of it somewhere between urskdale and the coast there had to be a weapon that josh could have used otherwise no one would believe the boy had killed them all id like to be there when the bastard hangs greeley said vehemently and hurried away to fetch his coat chapter thirtyseven a gray overcast day greeted them as rutledge with greeley and sergeant miller at his heels walked down the street towards the hotel well have to tell inspector mickelson greeley was fretting else it wont be done properly one look at your face if he sees you in the passage and robinson will know whats afoot well send sergeant miller around to the back ill try to find cummins and have him make sure his wife and miss fraser are safely locked in their rooms you must go as quietly as you can to miss ashtons room and tell her theres been a message for her from carlisle and shes to see constable ward at the station straightaway shes in the same passage with mickelson and robinson its essential to get her out of there and miss fraser whos to see to her miller asked if shes already in the kitchen thats your duty sergeant step into the kitchen and tell her theres been an accident at the neighboring house ask her if you can wheel her next door while you go for dr jarvis but what about mickelson greeley asked again anxious for the official stamp to his actions first we must see to it that everyone is safely out of harms way rutledge repeated impatiently we cant trust robinson hes killed five people in cold blood and left a child to die of exposure hes tried to hang elcott we dont know if hes armedwe dont know if hell try to take hostages mickelson would give you the same order avoid any more bloodshed makes sense sir sergeant miller put in we ought to do as he says they had reached the hotel miller strode purposefully to the back rutledge and greeley entered quietly and rutledge made his way up the stairs to find cummins and his wife he tapped lightly and then turned the latch mrs cummins was just putting the cap back on a bottle of gin and she stared at him angrily as he came through the door what are you doing in my bedroom she demanded leave at once or ill scream the house down im sorry to disturb you but theres been an emergency im looking for your husband hes downstairs helping elizabeth with the cooker theres something wrong with it she says he swore silently then may i ask you to stay here in safety until weve finished youve come to arrest harry is that it she stared at him is it because hes a jew you cant seriously believe mrs cummins i am merely asking for your husbands help in a search for someone stalking the streets he improvised swiftly if you stay here and lock your door youll be safe enough he backed out of the room and she hastened to take the key from him on the point of locking herself in but from below there were loud voices and the sound of footsteps running down the passage rutledge passed her the key and was gone down the stairs greeley was just coming out of the passage disheveled a bruise rising on his jaw miss ashton was already in the kitchen so i woke inspector mickelsonrobinson heard me and knocked me down mickelson is after him rutledge didnt wait he was racing down the passage with hamish at his heels the presence so real it sounded as if the scot was just behind him there was a loud and angry exchange from the kitchen mickelsons voice and then robinsons mrs cummins was halfway down the stairs crying her husbands name rutledge ordered greeley to stop her but she ducked under his arm and ran on as rutledge opened the kitchen door vera cummins darted in ahead of him running to cling to her husband cummins was standing beside elizabeth fraser staring in bewilderment as mickelson tried take robinson into custody janet ashton was just reaching across the table to take up the sharp knife lying there she was quickwitted already caught up in what was happening her eyes were on robinsons face and rutledge heard her say hugh is this man telling the truth was it you or paul i saw that night in the snow hugh rutledge halted on the threshold unwilling to press robinson harder while the women were within his reach but greeley plowed into him pushing him into the room robinson turned at bay his face was furious and all the while mickelsons piercing tenor challenged him to stop where he was and give himself up rutledge seeing the knife flash in miss ashtons hand said janet mickelson wheeled on greeley and demanded whats rutledge doing here robinson as the inspectors back turned to him flung out his hand and lifted the flatiron from the shelf along the wall he swung it hard mickelson went down blood bubbling out of the cut on his cheekbone where the edge of the iron had caught him greeley shouted here and barely had time to duck as robinson hurled the iron at him it struck the dresser sending chips of wood flying in every direction vera cummins had begun to scream in terror but janet ashton was already advancing on robinson with the knife her face twisted in murderous fury sergeant miller came through the door and stopped short rutledge called to janet ashton to stop where she was and miller seeing the knife lunged forward to pin her arms to her side robinson seeing the sergeant between himself and escape reached under his coat and drew a revolver he swung the barrel from rutledge to miller and all movement stopped abruptly if you want to die ill oblige he told the room at large and then the barrel steadied pointing directly at elizabeth fraser then his eyes on her he demanded wheres your motorcar rutledge speak up i dont have much to lose by shooting her rutledge said with far more selfpossession than he felt its by the church take it and go i wont stop you and ill see to it that no one else does youll have reached the road to london before we can get word out theres petrol in the tank and money in my luggage in the boot you can go anywhere you please and disappear he watched the barrel of the revolver greeley said you cant let him go its your duty ive given my word step out of his way greeley if sergeant miller will open the door and let the ladies leave robinson ill even offer myself as hostage for the good behavior of the rest of them i wont give you any trouble robinson said wheres the boy im not leaving without the boy hes dead rutledge lied theres nothing more you can do to him you couldnt have known i was there unless youd talked to him we dont need his evidence elcott survived you see he told us what youd done theres only one reason youd try to hang him thats impossiblehe couldnt have lived oh but he did you left him teetering on a chair back a note on the bed after half smothering him with a pillow i walked in just in time robinson swore all right then the motorcar greeley get out of my way faster man im impatient greeley backed against the wall keeping his hands in plain sight robinson glanced around the room one more time then he made to step over mickelson who was groaning as he began to regain his senses for a split second robinson took his eyes off rutledge to glance at the man on the floor making certain he wouldnt be tripped up but the revolver was still pointing steadily at elizabeth fraser and then she spoke for the first time hugh she called to him standing up from her chair and taking a step in his direction i hope you never close your eyes in peace again robinson had never seen her on her feet before his attention was riveted on her she had given rutledge his only chance to act but before he could move mickelson rolled on the floor in a desperate attempt to catch at robinsons leg robinson was too swift for him he sidestepped the clutching hands and fired the shot was deafening in the room and elizabeth fraser gasped and spun as the bullet caught her with a roar of rage rutledge launched himself at robinson pulling him down with the strength of two men and miller was leaping over the table crashing into both of them greeley stooped to retrieve the flatiron his eyes on the struggling men but before he could use the iron the revolver went off a second time and then rutledge had wrenched it out of robinsons grip and flung it across the room where it skidded to a stop almost at vera cumminss feet rutledge had his adversary pinned to the floor and he was battering robinsons face with his fists mickelson was pinning his legs miller in the name of god fetch jarvis rutledge shouted janet ashton had run to elizabeth and was cradling her head as cummins began stuffing serviettes into the bleeding wound frantically calling her name vera cummins stood like a ghost against the wall frozen there her eyes on the blood and then robinson wasnt moving dazed rutledge got to his feet and lunged to elizabeth frasers side clasping her hands telling her that shed been damned foolish begging her to hold on she opened her eyes and smiled up at him couldntlose him she said boys dead truly no quite safe my dear girl shut up and stay still she coughed and a delicate pink froth spread over her lip janet was smoothing her hair as she shut her eyes and sighed a little m ickelson and greeley hauled a bloody and defiant hugh robinson to the police station with sergeant miller behind them with theo elcotts revolver in one large steady hand jarvis bending over elizabeth fraser and working steadily as he gave orders to janet ashton said over his shoulder to rutledge get the rest of them out of here but a shaken cummins was already leading his wife to the door rutledge could hear janet asking is it true or a lie to comfort her is josh alive hes safe for the moment his attention was concentrated on the woman on the floor hamish was saying you canna stay leave the doctor to his work but rutledge was unable to move dont let her die he prayed dont let her die janet demanded i have to knowtell me what happened that night jarvis said herepay attention hamish said it was for you she got in his way to give you time damn mickelson and greeley both to hell rutledge said between his teeth but he knew the blame was his he should never have trusted either of them to act outside the bounds of express duty and he cursed himself for not acting alone as he so often did you couldna ha been sure you would tak him on your own it was true but it no longer mattered if she dies ill resign he silently promised god ive seen enough death and killed enough people jarvis turned rutledge lift her and carry her to her bed i cant work here i need more linens a list of things from my surgery miss ashton can see to that he began to give her instructions rutledge came to kneel on the floor gently putting his hands under elizabeth frasers body she seemed so fragile and he cradled her close to his chest as he carried her out of the kitchen and down the passage to her room he could feel her blood warm on his hands jarvis opened the door and pointed to the bed put her down and find me pillows as many as you can and then hot water the teakettlea basin rutledge went to do his bidding moving in a nightmare he came back with pillows scavenged from the other rooms and helped the doctor lift elizabeth so that she could breathe more comfortably then he brought the kettle and a basin the doctor grunted as he took them and said testily where the devil is miss ashton i need those powders but she was coming down the passage mrs jarvis at her heels with a basket of tins and jars and bandages now get out jarvis said to rutledge is she going to live he asked not moving from the bedside no thanks to you its going to be nip and tuck greeley told me in the streetif youd moved sooner this would never have happened greeley hamish snorted was busily covering his rear rutledge backed out of the room and stared for a time at his bloody hands if she dies he told himself ill have both of them on my soul h e looked in on mickelson whom sergeant miller had brought back to his room after safely delivering robinson to gaol his cheek was still bleeding and his face was bruising quickly rutledge thought it must hurt like the devil and was glad if you hadnt moved id have tripped him up he said testily as rutledge walked into the room i hope to hell your evidence is better than your timing rutledge left without answering he retrieved the motorcar and went back to the ingerson farm maggie was sitting where he had left her her face haggard her leg stretched out in front of her on its accustomed stool the boy was there sitting hunched over the dog as if it was the only comfort he knew maggie looked up and saw the blood whats happened then she asked rutledge hell stand trial the boy may not need to testify robinson tried to kill elcott and nearly succeeded and the aunt will want the boy i dont know ill bring her later shes needed now how do i tell him hes sure his fathers dead there with the others that he turned the gun on himself i cant make him listen dont try its better if he starts to forget he went to the boy and sat down on the drafty floor beside him josh i knew another young man who heard voices in his head they were wrong and so are yours after a while theyll begin to fade youll go with your aunt janet to london and back to the school you remember its finished i dont want to go to london i want to stay here with sybil and the sheep my stepfather told me once i had the makings of a good sheep man i dont like aunt janet she made mama cry well see what can be done then the man from london promised and then he rose i must get back to the hotel youre asleep on your feet it doesnt matter it will if you drive into urskwater miss fraser is badly wounded i have to be there ifshe doesnt live and he was gone back down the road again the rain beginning to pelt down on the bonnet and dance over the windscreen they wouldnt let him into her room but cummins told him she was sleeping comfortably nicked the lung and two ribs but thats all it was a brave thing she did he ended admiringly it was indeed rutledge felt as if his knees were ready to buckle under him and his eyes seemed to be blurring with exhaustion wheres mickelson i turned him out cummins said it with infinite pleasure as soon as he could walk hes gone to stay with greeley mrs greeley wont like that but then ive never cared for mrs greeley meanwhile her husband has sent constable ward to send a telegram to london and to speak to the chief constable theyll blacken your name between them greeley and mickelson ive no doubt of that but its to be expected yes rutledge agreed ive grown used to it it wont stick i spoke to constable ward before he left hes always been rather fond of miss fraser i explained to him how it came about that she was wounded and whos to blame hes a man of few words is ward but hes no fool the chief constable will be on the phone to london before the telegram arrives and that strutting little gamecock mickelson will have to mend a few fences now go to your bed or well have another patient on our hands but rutledge refused to consider it until cummins opened the door to elizabeth frasers room and let him see for himself that she was resting and not in pain janet ashton was sitting by the bed and she tiptoed out of the room to say to rutledge you must tell me about josh he said only will you want him in london with you that took her by surprise london ii havent thought that far ahead but hughs not here is he i dont have much choice oh dear if you dont want him hes found a dog he loves and a woman who loves him id not meddle there if i were you not for a while not until hes healed and he left her there closing the door to his room and finding the bed with some difficulty at length he slept but not before he had answered the question that hamish had been drumming in his head for the last few hours i shant stay to see how she feels it wouldnt be fair not yet theres the invitation from my godfather to spend christmas in scotland i must make my peace with him then theres dr fleming but hamish said into the darkness and silence ill still be here dr fleming or no about the author charles todd is the author of the murder stone a fearsome doubt watchers of time legacy of the dead a test
