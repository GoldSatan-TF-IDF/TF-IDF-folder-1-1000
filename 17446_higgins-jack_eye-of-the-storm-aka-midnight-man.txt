jack higgins eye of the storm aka midnight man the first book in the sean dillon series in memory of my grandfather robert bell mm gallant soldier the winds of heaven are blowing implement all that is on the table may god be with you coded message iraqradio baghdad january the mortar attack on number ten downing street when the war cabinet was meeting at am on thursday february is now a matter of history it has never been satisfactorily explained perhaps it went something like this one it was just before dark as dillon emerged from the alley and paused on the corner rain drifted across the seine in a flurry of snow sleet mixed with it and it was cold even for january in paris he wore a reefer coat peaked cap jeans and boots just another sailor off one of the barges working the river which he very definitely was not he lit a cigarette in cupped hands and stayed there for a moment in the shadows looking across the cobbled square at the lights of the small café on the other side after a while he dropped the cigarette thrust his hands deep in his pockets and started across in the darkness of the entrance two men waited watching his progress one of them whispered that must be him he made a move the other held him back no wait till hes inside dillon his senses sharpened by years of entirely the wrong kind of living was aware of them but gave no sign he paused at the entrance slipped his left hand under the reefer coat to check that the walther ppk was securely tucked into the waistband of his jeans against the small of his back then he opened the door and went in it was typical of the sort of place to be found on that part of the river half a dozen tables with chairs a zinctopped bar bottles lined against a cracked mirror behind it the entrance to the rear was masked by a bead curtain the barman a very old man with a gray moustache wore an alpaca coat the sleeves frayed at the cuffs and there was no collar to his shirt he put down the magazine he was reading and got up from the stool monsieur dillon unbuttoned his reefer coat and put his cap on the bar a small man no more than five feet five with fair hair and eyes that seemed to the barman to be of no particular color at all except for the fact that they were the coldest the old man had ever looked into he shivered unaccountably afraid and then dillon smiled the change was astonishing suddenly nothing but warmth there and immense charm his french when he spoke was perfect would there be such a thing as half a bottle of champagne in the house the old man stared at him in astonishment champagne you must be joking monsieur i have two kinds of wine only one is red and the other white he placed a bottle of each on the bar it was stuff of such poor quality that the bottles had screw tops instead of corks all right dillon said the white it is give me a glass he put his cap back on went and sat at a table against the wall from where he could see both the entrance and the curtained doorway he got the bottle open poured some of the wine into the glass and tried it he said to the barman and what vintage would this be last weeks monsieur the old man looked bewildered never mind dillon lit another cigarette sat back and waited the man who stood closest to the curtain peering through was in his midfifties of medium height with a slightly decadent look to his face the fur collar of his dark overcoat turned up against the cold he looked like a prosperous businessman right down to the gold rolex on his left wrist which in a way he was as a senior commercial attaché at the soviet embassy in paris he was also a colonel in the kgb one josef makeev the younger darkhaired man in the expensive vicuña overcoat who peered over his shoulder was called michael aroun he whispered in french this is ridiculous he cant be our man he looks like nothing a serious mistake many people have made michael makeev said now wait and see the bell tinkled as the outer door swung open rain blowing in and the two men entered who had been waiting in the doorway as dillon crossed the square one of them was over six feet tall bearded an ugly scar running into the right eye the other was much smaller and they were dressed in reefer coats and denims they looked exactly what they were trouble they stood at the bar and the old man looked worried no trouble the younger one said we only want a drink the big man turned and looked at dillon it seems as if weve got one right here he crossed to the table picked up dillons glass and drank from it our friend doesnt mind do you without getting out of his chair dillon raised his left foot and stamped downwards against the bearded mans kneecap the man went down with a choked cry grabbing at the table and dillon stood the bearded man tried to pull himself up and sank into one of the chairs his friend took a hand from his pocket springing the blade of a gutting knife and dillons left hand came up holding the walther ppk on the bar christ you never learn people like you do you now get this piece of dung on his feet and out of here while im still in a good mood youll need the casualty department of the nearest hospital by the way i seem to have dislodged his kneecap the small man went to his friend and struggled to get him on his feet they stood there for a moment the bearded mans face twisted in agony dillon went and opened the door the rain pouring relentlessly down outside as they lurched past him he said have a good night and closed the door still holding the walther in his left hand he lit a cigarette using a match from the stand on the bar and smiled at the old barman who looked terrified dont worry dad not your problem then he leaned against the bar and called in english all right makeev i know youre there so lets be having you the curtain parted and makeev and aroun stepped through my dear sean its good to see you again and arent you the wonder of the world dillon said just the trace of an ulster accent in his voice one minute trying to stitch me up the next all sweetness and light it was necessary sean makeev said i needed to make a point to my friend here let me introduce you no need dillon told him ive seen his picture often enough if its not on the financial pages its usually in the society magazines michael aroun isnt it the man with all the money in the world not quite all mr dillon aroun put a hand out dillon ignored it well skip the courtesies my old son while you tell whoever is standing on the other side of that curtain to come out rashid do as he says aroun called and said to dillon its only my aide the young man who stepped through had a dark watchful face and wore a leather car coat the collar turned up his hands thrust deep in the pockets dillon knew a professional when he saw one plain view he motioned with the walther rashid actually smiled and took his hands from his pockets good dillon said ill be on my way then he turned and got the door open makeev said sean be reasonable we only want to talk a job sean sorry makeev but i dont like the way you do business not even for a million mr dillon michael aroun said dillon paused and turned to look at him calmly then smiled again with enormous charm would that be in pounds or dollars mr aroun he asked and walked out into the rain as the door banged aroun said weve lost him not at all makeev said a strange one this believe me he turned to rashid you have your portable phone yes colonel good get after him stick to him like glue when he settles phone me well be at avenue victor hugo rashid didnt say a word simply went aroun took out his wallet and extracted a thousandfranc note which he placed on the bar he said to the barman who was looking totally bewildered were very grateful then turned and followed makeev out as he slid behind the wheel of the black mercedes saloon he said to the russian he never even hesitated back there a remarkable man sean dillon makeev said as they drove away he first picked up a gun for the ira in nineteen seventyone twenty years michael twenty years and he hasnt seen the inside of a cell once he was involved in the mountbatten business then he became too hot for his own people to handle so he moved to europe as i told you hes worked for everyone the plo the red brigade in germany in the old days the basque national movement the eta he killed a spanish general for them and the kgb but of course hes worked for us on many occasions we always use the best and sean dillon is exactly that he speaks english and irish not that that bothers you fluent french and german reasonable arabic italian and russian and no one has ever caught him in twenty years how could anyone be that lucky because he has the most extraordinary gift for acting my friend a genius you might say as a young boy his father took him from belfast to london to live where he was awarded a scholarship to the royal academy of dramatic art he even worked for the national theatre when he was nineteen or twenty i have never known anyone who can change personality and appearance so much just by body language makeup seldom enters into it although i admit that it helps when he wants hes a legend that the security services of most countries keep quiet about because they cant put a face to him so they dont know what theyre looking for what about the british after all they must be the experts where the ira are concerned no not even the british as i said hes never been arrested not once and unlike many of his ira friends he never courted media publicity i doubt if theres a photo of him anywhere except for the odd boyhood snap what about when he was an actor perhaps but that was twenty years ago michael and you think he might undertake this business if i offer him enough money no money alone has never been enough for this man it always has to be the job itself where dillon is concerned how can i put it how interesting it is this is a man to whom acting was everything what we are offering him is a new part the theatre of the street perhaps but still acting he smiled as the mercedes joined the traffic moving around the arc de triomphe lets wait and see wait until we hear from rashid at that moment captain ali rashid was by the seine at the end of a small pier jutting out into the river the rain was falling very heavily still plenty of sleet in it the floodlights were on at notre dame and the effect was of something seen partially through a net curtain he watched dillon turn along the narrow pier to the building on stilts at the far end waited until he went in and followed him the place was quite old and built of wood barges and boats of various kinds moored all around the sign over the door said le chat noir he peered through the window cautiously there was a bar and several tables just like the other place the only difference was that people were eating there was even a man sitting on a stool against the wall playing an accordion all very parisian dillon was standing at the bar speaking to a young woman rashid moved back walked to the end of the pier paused by the rail in the shelter of a small terrace and dialed the number of arouns house in the avenue victor hugo on his portable phone there was a slight click as the walther was cocked and dillon rammed the muzzle rather painfully into rashids right ear now then son a few answers he demanded who are you my name is rashid the young man said ali rashid what are you then plo no mr dillon im a captain in the iraqi army assigned to protect mr aroun and makeev and the kgb lets just say hes on our side the way things are going in the gulf you need somebody on your side my old son there was the faint sound of a voice from the portable phone go on answer him makeev said rashid where is he right here outside a café on the river near notre dame rashid told him with the muzzle of his walther well into my ear put him on makeev ordered rashid handed the phone to dillon who said now then you old sod a million sean pounds if you prefer that currency and what would i have to be doing for all that money the job of a lifetime let rashid bring you round here and well discuss it i dont think so dillon said i think what id really like is for you to get your arse into gear and come and pick us up yourself of course makeev said where are you the left bank opposite notre dame a little pub on a pier called le chat noir well be waiting he slipped the walther into his pocket and handed the phone to rashid who said hes coming then of course he is dillon smiled now lets you and me go inside and have ourselves a drink in comfort in the sitting room on the first floor of the house in avenue victor hugo overlooking the bois de boulogne josef makeev put down the phone and moved to the couch where his overcoat was was that rashid aroun demanded yes hes with dillon now at a place on the river im going to get them ill come with you makeev pulled on his coat no need michael you hold the fort we wont be long he went out aroun took a cigarette from a silver box and lit it then he turned on the television he was halfway into the news there was direct coverage from baghdad tornado fighter bombers of the british royal air force attacking at low level it made him bitterly angry he switched off poured himself a brandy and went and sat by the window michael aroun was forty years of age and a remarkable man by any standards born in baghdad of a french mother and an iraqi father who was an army officer hed had a maternal grandmother who was american through her his mother had inherited ten million dollars and a number of oil leases in texas she had died the year aroun had graduated from harvard law school leaving everything to her son because his father retired as a general from the iraqi army was happy to spend his later years at the old family house in baghdad with his books like most great businessmen aroun had no academic training in the field he knew nothing of financial planning or business administration his favorite saying one much quoted was when i need a new accountant i buy a new accountant his friendship with saddam hussein had been a natural development from the fact that the iraqi president had been greatly supported in his early days in politics by arouns father who was also an important member of the baath party it had placed aroun in a privileged position as regards the development of his countrys oilfields brought him riches beyond calculation after the first billion you stopped counting another favorite saying and now he was faced with disaster not only the promised riches of the kuwait oilfields snatched from him but that portion of his wealth which stemmed from iraq dried up finished as a result of the coalitions massive airstrikes that had devastated his country since the seventeenth of january he was no fool he knew that the game was over should probably have never started and that saddam husseins dream was already finished as a businessman he played the percentages and that didnt offer iraq too much of a chance in the ground war that must eventually come he was far from ruined in personal terms he had oil interests still in the usa and the fact that he was a french as well as an iraqi citizen gave washington a problem then there was his shipping empire and vast quantities of real estate in various capital cities around the world but that wasnt the point he was angry when he switched on the television and saw what was happening in baghdad each night for surprising in one so selfcentered he was a patriot there was also the fact infinitely more important that his father had been killed in a bombing raid on the third night of the air war and there was a great secret in his life for in august shortly after the invasion of kuwait by iraqi forces aroun had been sent for by saddam hussein himself sitting here by the french window a glass of brandy in one hand rain slanting across the terrace he gazed out across the bois de boulogne in the evening light and remembered that meeting there was an airraid practice in progress as he was driven in an army landrover through the streets of baghdad darkness everywhere the driver was a young intelligence captain named rashid whom he had met before one of the new breed trained by the british at sandhurst aroun gave him an english cigarette and took one himself what do you think will they make some sort of move the americans and brits rashid was being careful who knows theyre certainly reacting president bush seems to be taking a hard line no youre mistaken aroun said ive met the man facetoface twice now at white house functions hes what our american friends call a nice guy theres no steel there at all rashid shrugged im a simple man mr aroun a soldier and perhaps i see things simply here is a man a navy combat pilot at twenty who saw a great deal of active service who was shot down over the sea of japan and survived to be awarded the distinguished flying cross i would not underestimate such a man aroun frowned come on my friend the americans arent going to come halfway round the world with an army to protect one little arab state isnt that exactly what the british did in the falklands war rashid reminded him they never expected such a reaction in argentina of course they had thatchers determination behind them the brits i mean damned woman aroun said and leaned back as they went in through the gate of the presidential palace feeling suddenly depressed he followed rashid along corridors of marble splendor the young officer leading the way a torch in one hand it was a strange rather eerie experience following that small pool of light on the floor their footfalls echoing there was a sentry on each side of the ornate door they finally halted before rashid opened it and they went in saddam hussein was alone sitting in uniform at a large desk the only light a shaded lamp he was writing slowly and carefully looked up and smiled putting down his pen michael he came round the desk and embraced aroun like a brother your father he is well in excellent health my president give him my respects you look well michael paris suits you he smiled again smoke if you want i know you like to the doctors have unfortunately had to tell me to cut it out or else he sat down behind the desk again and aroun sat opposite aware of rashid against the wall in the darkness paris was fine but my place is here now in these difficult times saddam hussein shook his head not true michael i have soldiers in plenty but few men such as you you are rich famous accepted at the highest levels of society and government anywhere in the world more than that because of your beloved mother of blessed memory you are not just an iraqi but also a french citizen no michael i want you in paris but why my president aroun asked because one day i may require you to do a service for me and for your country that only you could perform aroun said you can rely on me totally you know that saddam hussein got up and paced to the nearest window opened the shutters and stepped on to the terrace the allclear sounded mournfully across the city and lights began to appear here and there i still hope our friends in america and britain stay in their own backyard but if not he shrugged then we may have to fight them in their own backyard remember michael as the prophet instructs us in the koran there is more truth in one sword than ten thousand words he paused and then carried on still looking out across the city one sniper in the darkness michael british sas or israeli it doesnt really matter but what a coupthe death of saddam hussein god forbid it michael aroun said saddam turned to him as god wills michael in all things but you see my point the same would apply to bush or the thatcher woman the proof that my arm reaches everywhere the ultimate coup he turned would you be capable of arranging such a thing if necessary aroun had never felt so excited in his life i think so my president all things are possible especially when sufficient money is involved it would be my gift to you good saddam nodded you will return to paris immediately captain rashid will accompany you he will have details of certain codes we will be using in radio broadcasts that sort of thing the day may never come michael but if it does he shrugged we have friends in the right places he turned to rashid that kgb colonel at the soviet embassy in paris colonel josef makeev my president yes saddam hussein said to aroun like many of his kind not happy with the changes now taking place in moscow he will assist in any way he can hes already expressed his willingness he embraced aroun again like a brother now go i have work to do the lights had still not come on in the palace and aroun had stumbled out into the darkness of the corridor following the beam of rashids torch since his return to paris he had got to know makeev well keeping their acquaintance by design purely on a social level meeting mainly at various embassy functions and saddam hussein had been right the russian was very definitely on their side only too willing to do anything that would cause problems for the united states or great britain the news from home of course had been bad the buildup of such a gigantic army who could have expected it and then in the early hours of the seventeenth of january the air war had begun one bad thing after another and the ground attack still to come he poured himself another brandy remembering his despairing rage at the news of his fathers death hed never been religious by inclination but hed found a mosque in a paris side street to pray in not that it had done any good the feeling of impotence was like a living thing inside him and then came the morning when ali rashid had rushed into the great ornate sitting room a notepad in one hand his face pale and excited its come mr aroun the signal weve been waiting for i just heard it on the radio transmitter from baghdad the winds of heaven are blowing implement all that is on the table may god be with you aroun had gazed at it in wonder his hand trembling as he held the notepad and his voice was hoarse when he said the president was right the day has come exactly rashid said implement all that is on the table were in business ill get in touch with makeev and arrange a meeting as soon as possible dillon stood at the french windows and peered out across the avenue victor hugo to the bois de boulogne he was whistling softly to himself a strange eerie little tune now this must be what the house agents call a favored location may i offer you a drink mr dillon a glass of champagne wouldnt come amiss have you a preference aroun asked ah the man who has everything dillon said all right krug would be fine but nonvintage i prefer the grape mix a man of taste i see aroun nodded to rashid who opened a side door and went out dillon unbuttoning his reefer coat took out a cigarette and lit it so you need my services this old fox tells me he nodded at makeev who lounged against the fireplace warming himself the job of a lifetime he said and for a million pounds now what would i have to do for all that rashid entered quickly with the krug in a bucket three glasses on a tray he put them on the table and started to open the bottle aroun said im not sure but it would have to be something very special something to show the world that saddam hussein can strike anywhere he needs something the poor old sod dillon said cheerfully things arent going too well as rashid finished filling three glasses the irishman added and whats your trouble son arent you joining us rashid smiled and aroun said in spite of winchester and sandhurst mr dillon captain rashid remains a very muslim he does not touch alcohol well heres to you dillon raised his glass i respect a man with principles this would need to be big sean no point in anything small were not talking about blowing up five british army paratroopers in belfast makeev said oh its bush you want is it dillon smiled the president of the united states flat on his back with a bullet in him would that be so crazy aroun demanded it would be this time son dillon told him george bush has not just taken on saddam hussein hes taken on the arabs as a people oh thats total rubbish of course but its the way a lot of arab fanatics see it groups like hizbollah the plo or the wild cards like the wrath of allah people the sort who would happily strap a bomb to their waist and detonate it while the president reached out to shake just another hand in the crowd i know these people i know how their minds tick ive helped train hizbollah people in beirut ive worked for the plo what you are saying is nobody can get near bush at the moment read your papers anybody who looks even slightly arab is keeping off the streets these days in new york and washington but you mr dillon do not look arab to the slightest degree aroun said for one thing you have fair hair so did lawrence of arabia and he used to pass himself off as an arab dillon shook his head president bush has the finest security in the world believe me a ring of steel and in present circumstances hes going to stay home while this whole gulf thing works through mark my words what about their secretary of state james baker aroun said hes been indulging in shuttle diplomacy throughout europe yes but knowing when thats the problem youll know hes been in london or paris when hes already left and they show him on television no you can forget the americans on this one there was silence and aroun looked glum makeev was the first to speak give me then the benefit of your professional expertise sean where does one find the weakest security as regards national leaders dillon laughed out loud oh i think your man here can answer that winchester and sandhurst rashid smiled hes right the british are probably the best in the world at covert operations the success of their special air service regiment speaks for itself but in other areas he shook his head their first problem is bureaucracy dillon told them the british security service operates in two main sections what most people still call m and m m or d to be pedantic specializes in counterespionage in great britain the other lot operates abroad then you have special branch at scotland yard who have to be brought into the act to make any actual arrests the yard also has an antiterrorist squad then theres army intelligence units galore all life is there and theyre all at each others throats and that gentlemen is when mistakes begin to creep in rashid poured some more champagne into his glass and you are saying that makes for bad security with their leaders the queen for example come on dillon said its not all that many years ago that the queen woke up in buckingham palace and found an intruder sitting on the bed how long ago six years since the ira almost got margaret thatcher and the entire british cabinet at a brighton hotel during the tory party conference he put down his glass and lit another cigarette the brits are very oldfashioned they like a policeman to wear a uniform so they know who he is and they dont like being told what to do and that applies to cabinet ministers who think nothing of strolling through the streets from their houses in westminster to parliament fortunate for the rest of us makeev said exactly dillon said they even have to go softlysoftly on terroristsup to a degree anyway not like french intelligence jesus if the lads in action service got their hands on me theyd have me spread out and my bollocks wired up for electricity before i knew what was happening mind you even they are prone to the occasional error what do you mean makeev demanded have you got a copy of the evening paper handy certainly ive been reading it aroun said ali on my desk rashid returned with a copy of paris soir dillon said page two read it out youll find it interesting he helped himself to more champagne while rashid read the item aloud mrs margaret thatcher until recently prime minister of britain is staying overnight at choisy as a guest of president mitterrand they are to have further talks in the morning she leaves at two oclock for an airforce emergency field at valenton where an raf plane returns her to england incredible isnt it that they could have allowed such a press release but i guarantee the main london newspapers will carry that story also there was a heavy silence and then aroun said youre not suggesting dillon said to rashid you must have some road maps handy get them rashid went out quickly makeev said good god sean not even you why not dillon asked calmly and turned to aroun i mean you want something big a major coup would margaret thatcher do or are we just playing games here before aroun could reply rashid came back with two or three road maps he opened one out on the table and they looked at it all except makeev who stayed by the fire there we are choisy rashid said thirty miles from paris and here is the airforce field at valenton only seven miles away have you got a map of larger scale yes rashid unfolded one of the others good dillon said its perfectly clear that only one country road links choisy to valenton and here about three miles before the airfield theres a railway crossing perfect for what aroun demanded an ambush look i know how these things operate therell be one car two at the most and an escort maybe half a dozen crs police on motorbikes my god aroun whispered yes well hes got very little to do with it it could work fast very simple what the brits call a piece of cake aroun turned in appeal to makeev who shrugged he means it michael you said this was what you wanted so make up your mind aroun took a deep breath and turned back to dillon all right good dillon said calmly he reached for a pad and pencil on the table and wrote on it quickly those are the details of my numbered bank account in zurich youll transfer one million pounds to it first thing in the morning in advance rashid said isnt that expecting rather a lot no my old son its you people who are expecting rather a lot and the rules have changed on successful completion ill expect a further million now look here rashid started but aroun held up a hand fine mr dillon and cheap at the price now what can we do for you i need operating money i presume a man like you keeps large supplies of the filthy stuff around the house very large aroun smiled how much can you manage dollars say twenty thousand of course aroun nodded to rashid who went to the far end of the room swung a large oil painting to one side disclosing a wall safe which he started to open makeev said and what can i do the old warehouse in rue de helier the one weve used before youve still got a key of course good ive got most things i need stored there but for this job id like a light machine gun a tripod job a heckler amp koch or an m anything like that will do he looked at his watch eight oclock id like it there by ten all right of course makeev said again rashid came back with a small briefcase twenty thousand hundred dollar bills im afraid is there any way they could be traced dillon asked impossible aroun told him good and ill take the maps he walked to the door opened it and started down the curving staircase to the hall aroun rashid and makeev followed him but is this all mr dillon aroun said is there nothing more we can do for you wont you need help when i do it comes from the criminal classes dillon said honest crooks who do things for cash are usually more reliable than politically motivated zealots not always but most of the time dont worry youll hear from me one way or another ill be on my way then rashid got the door open rain and sleet drifted in and dillon pulled on his cap a dirty old night for it one thing mr dillon rashid said what happens if things go wrong i mean youll have your million in advance and well have nothing dont give it a thought me old son ill provide an alternative target theres always the new british prime minister this john major i presume his head on a plate would serve your boss back in baghdad just as well he smiled once then stepped out into the rain and pulled the door shut behind him two dillon paused outside le chat noir on the end of the small pier for the second time that night it was almost deserted a young man and woman at a corner table holding hands a bottle of wine between them the accordion was playing softly and the musician talked to the man behind the bar at the same time they were the jobert brothers gangsters of the second rank in the paris underworld their activities had been severely curtailed since pierre the one behind the bar had lost his left leg in a car crash after an armed robbery three years previously as the door opened and dillon entered the other brother gaston stopped playing ah monsieur rocard back already gaston dillon shook hands and turned to the barman pierre see i still remember that little tune of yours the irish one gaston played a few notes on the accordion good dillon said a true artist behind them the young couple got up and left pierre produced half a bottle of champagne from the bar fridge champagne as usual i presume my friend nothing special but we are poor men here youll have me crying all over the bar dillon said and what may we do for you pierre enquired oh i just want to put a little business your way dillon nodded at the door it might be an idea if you closed gaston put his accordion on the bar went and bolted the door and pulled down the blind he returned and sat on his stool well my friend this could be a big payday for you boys dillon opened the briefcase took out one of the road maps and disclosed the stacks of hundred dollar bills twenty thousand american ten now and ten on successful completion my god gaston said in awe but pierre looked grim and what would be expected for all this money dillon had always found it paid to stick as close to the truth as possible and he spread the road map out across the bar ive been hired by the union corse he said naming the most feared criminal organization in france to take care of a little problem a matter of what you might term business rivalry ah i see pierre said and you are to eliminate the problem exactly the men concerned will be passing along this road here toward valenton shortly after two oclock tomorrow i intend to take them out here at the railway crossing and how will this be accomplished gaston asked a very simple ambush you two are still in the transport business arent you stolen cars trucks you should know youve bought from us on enough occasions pierre told him a couple of vans thats not too much to expect is it and then what well take a drive down to this place tonight he glanced at his watch eleven oclock from here itll only take an hour pierre shook his head look this could be heavy im getting too old for gunplay wonderful dillon said how many did you kill when you were with the oas i was younger then well it comes to us all i suppose no gunplay you two will be in and out so quickly you wont know whats happening a piece of cake he took several stacks of hundred dollar bills from the briefcase and put them on the bar counter ten thousand do we deal and greed as usual won the day as pierre ran his hands over the money yes my friend i think we do good ill be back at eleven then dillon closed his briefcase gaston went and unlocked the door for him and the irishman left gaston closed the door and turned what do you think pierre poured two cognacs i think our friend rocard is a very big liar but also a very dangerous man gaston said so what do we do wait and see pierre raised his glass salut dillon walked all the way to the warehouse in rue de helier twisting from one street to another melting into the darkness occasionally to check that he wasnt being followed he had learned a long time ago that the problem with all revolutionary political groups was that they were riddled with factions and informers a great truth where the ira was concerned because of that as he had indicated to aroun he preferred to use professional criminals whenever possible when help was needed honest crooks who do things for cash that was the phrase hed used unfortunately it didnt always hold true and there had been something in big pierres manner there was a small judas gate set in the larger double doors of the warehouse he unlocked it and stepped inside there were two cars a renault saloon and a ford escort and a police bmw motorcycle covered with a sheet he checked that it was all right then moved up the wooden stairs to the flat in the loft above it was not his only home he also had a barge on the river but it was useful on occasions on the table in the small living room there was a canvas holdall with a note on top that simply said as ordered he smiled and unzipped it inside was a kalashnikov pk machine gun the latest model its tripod was folded the barrel off for easy handling and there was a large box of belt cartridges a similar box beside it he opened a drawer in the sideboard took out a folded sheet and put it in the holdall he zipped it up again checked the walther in his waistband and went down the stairs the holdall in one hand he locked the judas and went along the street excitement taking control as it always did it was the best feeling in the world when the game was in play he turned into the main street and a few minutes later hailed a cab and told the driver to take him to le chat noir they drove out of paris in renault vans exactly the same except for the fact that one was black and the other white gaston led the way dillon beside him in the passenger seat and pierre followed it was very cold snow mixed with the rain although it wasnt sticking they talked very little dillon lying back in the seat eyes closed so that the frenchman thought he was asleep not far from choisy the van skidded and gaston said christ almighty and wrestled with the wheel dillon said easy the wrong time to go in a ditch where are we just past the turning to choisy not long now dillon sat up the snow was covering the hedgerows but not the road gaston said its a pig of a night just look at it think of all those lovely dollar bills dillon told him that should get you through it stopped snowing the sky cleared showing a halfmoon and below them at the bottom of the hill was the red light of the railway crossing there was an old disused building of some sort at one side its windows boarded up a stretch of cobbles in front of it lightly powdered with snow pull in here dillon said gaston did as he was told and braked to a halt switching off the motor pierre came up in the white renault got down from behind the wheel awkwardly because of the false leg and joined them dillon stood looking at the crossing a few yards away and nodded perfect give me the keys gaston did as he was told the irishman unlocked the rear door disclosing the holdall he unzipped it as they watched took out the kalashnikov put the barrel in place expertly then positioned it so that it pointed to the rear he filled the ammunition box threading the cartridge belt in place that looks a real bastard pierre said sevenpointtwomillimeter cartridges mixed with tracer and armor piercing dillon said its a killer all right kalashnikov ive seen one of these take a landrover full of british paratroopers to pieces really pierre said and as gaston was about to speak he put a warning hand on his arm whats in the other box more ammunition dillon took out the sheet from the holdall covered the machine gun then locked the door he got behind the driving wheel started the engine and moved the van a few yards positioned it so that the tail pointed on an angle toward the crossing he got out and locked the door and clouds scudded across the moon and the rain started again more snow in it now so you leave this here pierre said what if someone checks it what if they do dillon knelt down at the offside rear tire took a knife from his pocket sprang the blade and poked at the rim of the wheel there was a hiss of air and the tire went down rapidly gaston nodded clever anyone gets curious theyll just think a breakdown but what about us pierre demanded what do you expect simple gaston turns up with the white renault just after two this afternoon you block the road at the crossing not the railway track just the road get out lock the door and leave it then get the hell out of there he turned to pierre you follow in a car pick him up and straight back to paris but what about you the big man demanded ill be already here waiting in the van ill make my own way back to paris now you can drop me at le chat noir and thats an end of it you wont see me again and the rest of the money pierre demanded as he got behind the renaults wheel and gaston and dillon joined him youll get it dont worry dillon said i always keep my word just as i expect others to keep theirs a matter of honor my friend now lets get moving he closed his eyes again leaned back pierre glanced at his brother switched on the engine and drove away it was just on half past one when they reached le chat noir there was a lockup garage opposite the pub gaston opened the doors and pierre drove in ill be off then dillon said youre not coming in the big man asked then gaston can run you home dillon smiled no ones ever taken me home in my life he walked away turning into a side street and pierre said to his brother after him and dont lose him but why gaston demanded because i want to know where hes staying thats why it stinks this thing gaston like bad fish stinks so get moving dillon moved rapidly from street to street following his usual pattern but gaston a thief since childhood and an expert in such matters managed to stay on his trail never too close dillon had intended returning to the warehouse in rue de helier but pausing on the corner of an alley to light a cigarette he glanced back and could have sworn he saw a movement he was right for it was gaston ducking into a doorway out of sight for dillon even the suspicion was enough hed had a feeling about pierre all night a bad feeling he turned left worked his way back to the river and walked along the pavement and past a row of trucks their windshields covered with snow he came to a small hotel the cheapest sort of place the kind used by prostitutes or truckers stopping overnight and went in the desk clerk was very old and wore an overcoat and scarf against the cold his eyes were wet he put down his book and rubbed them monsieur i brought a load in from dijon a couple of hours ago intended to drive back tonight but the damn trucks giving trouble i need a bed thirty francs monsieur youre kidding dillon said ill be out of here at the crack of dawn the old man shrugged all right you can have number eighteen on the second landing for twenty but the bed hasnt been changed when does that happen once a month dillon took the key gave him his twenty francs and went upstairs the room was as disgusting as he expected even in the diffused light from the landing he closed the door moved carefully through the darkness and looked out cautiously there was a movement under a tree on the river side of the road gaston jobert stepped out and hurried away along the pavement oh dear dillon whispered then lit a cigarette and went and lay on the bed and thought about it staring up at the ceiling pierre sitting at the bar of le chat noir waiting for his brothers return was leafing through paris soir for want of something better to do when he noticed the item on margaret thatchers meeting with mitterrand his stomach churned and he read the item again with horror it was at that moment the door opened and gaston hurried in what a night im frozen to the bone give me a cognac here pierre poured some into a glass and you can read this interesting tidbit in paris soir while youre drinking gaston did as he was told and suddenly choked on the cognac my god shes staying at choisy and leaves from that old airforce field at valenton leaves choisy at two oclock how long to get to that railway crossing ten minutes oh god no gaston said were done for this is out of our league pierre if this takes place well have every cop in france on the streets but it isnt going to i knew that bastard was bad news always something funny about him you managed to follow him yes he doubled around the streets for a while then ended up at that fleapit old françois runs just along the river i saw him through the window booking in he shivered but what are we going to do he was almost sobbing this is the end pierre theyll lock us up and throw away the key no they wont pierre told him not if we stop him they wont theyll be too grateful who knows there might even be a reward in it now whats inspector savarys home number hell be in bed of course he will you idiot nicely tucked up with his old lady where all good detectives should be well just have to wake him up inspector jules savary came awake cursing as the phone rang at his bedside he was on his own for his wife was spending a week in lyons at her mothers hed had a long night two armed robberies and a sexual assault on a woman hed only just managed to get to sleep he picked up the phone savary here its me inspector pierre jobert savary glanced at the bedside clock for christs sake jobert its twothirty in the morning i know inspector but ive got something special for you you always have so it can wait till the morning i dont think so inspector im offering to make you the most famous cop in france the pinch of a lifetime pull the other one savary said margaret thatcher shes staying at choisy tonight leaves for valenton at two i can tell you all about the man whos going to see she never gets there jules savary had never come awake so fast where are you le chat noir yes jobert told him half an hour savary slammed down the phone leapt out of bed and started to dress it was at exactly the same moment that dillon decided to move on the fact that gaston had followed him didnt necessarily mean anything more than the fact that the brothers were anxious to know more about him on the other hand he left locking the door found the back stairs and descended cautiously there was a door at the bottom that opened easily enough and gave access to a yard at the rear an alley brought him to the main road he crossed walked along a line of parked trucks chose one about fifty yards from the hotel but giving him a good view he got his knife out worked away at the top of the passenger window after a while it gave so that he could get his fingers in and exert pressure a minute later he was inside better not to smoke so he sat back collar up hands in pockets and waited it was half past three when the four unmarked cars eased up to the hotel eight men got out none in uniform which was interesting action service or i miss my guess dillon said softly gaston jobert got out of the rear car and stood talking to them for a moment then they all moved into the hotel dillon wasnt angry just pleased that hed got it right he left the truck crossed the road to the shelter of the nearest alley and started to walk to the warehouse in rue de helier the french secret service notorious for years as the sdece has had its name changed to direction générale de la sécurité extérieure dgse under the mitterrand government in an attempt to improve the image of a shady and ruthless organization with a reputation for stopping at nothing having said that measured by results few intelligence organizations in the world are so efficient the service as in the old days was still divided into five sections and many departments the most famous or infamous depending on your point of view being section more commonly known as action service the department responsible for the smashing of the oas colonel max hernu had been involved in all that had hunted the oas down as ruthlessly as anyone in spite of having served as a paratrooper in both indochina and algeria he was sixtyone years of age an elegant whitehaired man who now sat at his desk in the office on the first floor of dgses headquarters on the boulevard mortier it was just before five oclock and hernu wearing hornrimmed reading glasses studied the report in front of him he had been staying the night at his country cottage forty miles out of paris and had only just arrived inspector savary watched respectfully hernu removed his glasses i loathe this time of the morning takes me back to dien bien phu and the waiting for the end pour me another coffee will you savary took his cup went to the electric pot on the stand and poured the coffee strong and black what do you think sir these jobert brothers you believe theyre telling us everything absolutely sir ive known them for years big pierre was oas which he thinks gives him class but theyre secondrate hoods really they do well in stolen cars so this would be out of their league very definitely theyve admitted to me that theyve sold this man rocard cars in the past of the hot variety yes sir of course they are telling the truth the ten thousand dollars speak for them there but this man rocard youre an experienced copper inspector how many years on the street fifteen sir give me your opinion his physical description is interesting because according to the jobert boys there isnt one hes small no more than one sixtyfive no discernible color to the eyes fair hair gaston says the first time they met him he thought he was a nothing and then he apparently halfkilled some guy twice his size in the bar in about five seconds flat go on hernu lit a cigarette pierre says his french is too perfect what does he mean by that he doesnt know its just that he always felt that there was something wrong that he wasnt french exactly two facts of interest there hes always whistling a funny little tune gaston picked it up because he plays accordion he says rocard told him once that it was irish now that is interesting a further point when he was assembling the machine gun in the back of the renault at valenton he told the boys it was a kalashnikov not just bullets tracer armor piercing the lot he said hed seen one take out a landrover full of british paratroopers pierre didnt like to ask him where so you smell ira here inspector and what have you done about it got your people to get the picture books out colonel the joberts are looking through them right now excellent hernu got up and this time refilled his coffee cup himself what do you make of the hotel business do you think hes been alerted perhaps but not necessarily savary said i mean what have we got here sir a real pro out to make the hit of a lifetime maybe he was just being extra careful just to make sure he wasnt followed to his real destination i mean i wouldnt trust the joberts an inch so why should he he shrugged and max hernu said shrewdly theres more spit it out i got a bad feeling about this guy colonel i think hes special i think he may have used the hotel thing because he suspected that gaston might follow him but then hed want to know why was it the joberts just being curious or was there more to it so you think he could have been up the street watching our people arrive very possibly on the other hand maybe he didnt know gaston was tailing him maybe the hotel thing was a usual precaution an old resistance trick from the war hernu nodded right lets see if theyve finished have them in savary went out and returned with the jobert brothers they stood there looking worried and hernu said well no luck colonel he wasnt in any of the books all right hernu said wait downstairs youll be taken home well collect you again later but what for colonel pierre asked so that your brother can go to valenton in the renault and you can follow in the car just like rocard told you now get out they hurriedly left and hernu said to savary well see mrs thatcher is spirited to safety by another route but a pity to disappoint our friend rocard if he turns up colonel you never know he just might youve done well inspector i think ill have to requisition you for section five would you mind would he mind savary almost choked with emotion an honor sir good go and get a shower then and some breakfast ill see you later and you colonel me inspector hernu laughed and looked at his watch fivefifteen im going to ring british intelligence in london disturb the sleep of a very old friend of mine if anyone can help us with our mystery man it should be he the directorate general of the british security service occupies a large white and red brick building not far from the hilton hotel in park lane although many of its departments are housed in various locations throughout london the special number that max hernu rang was of a section known as group four located on the third floor of the ministry of defence it had been set up in to handle matters concerning terrorism and subversion in the british isles it was responsible only to the prime minister it had been administered by only one man since its inception brigadier charles ferguson he was asleep in his flat in cavendish square when the telephone beside his bed awakened him ferguson he said immediately wide awake knowing it had to be important paris brigadier an anonymous voice said priority one colonel hernu put him through and scramble ferguson sat up a large untidy man of sixtyfive with rumpled gray hair and a double chin charles hernu said in english my dear max what brings you on the line at such a disgusting hour youre lucky im still on the phone the powers that be are trying to make me redundant along with group four what nonsense i know but the director general was never happy with my freebooter status all these years what can i do for you mrs thatcher is overnighting at choisy weve details of a plot to hit her on the way to the airfield at valenton tomorrow good god all taken care of the lady will now take a different route home were still hoping the man concerned will show up though i doubt it well be waiting though this afternoon who is it anyone we know from what our informants say we suspect hes irish though his french is good enough to pass as a native the thing is the people involved have looked through all our ira pictures with no success have you a description hernu gave it to him not much to go on im afraid ill have a computer check done and get back to you tell me the story which hernu did when he was finished ferguson said youve lost him old chap ill bet you dinner on it at the savoy grill next time youre over ive a feeling about this one i think hes special hernu said and yet not on your books and we always keep you up to date i know hernu said and youre the expert on the ira so what do we do youre wrong there ferguson said the greatest expert on the ira is right there in paris martin brosnan our irishamerican friend after all he carried a gun for them till nineteen seventyfive i heard he was a professor of political philosophy at the sorbonne youre right hernu said id forgotten about him very respectable these days writes books and lives rather well on all that money his mother left him when she died in boston five years ago if youve a mystery on your hands he might be the man to solve it thanks for the suggestion hernu said but first well see what happens at valenton ill be in touch ferguson put down the phone pressed a button on the wall and got out of bed a moment later the door opened and his manservant an exgurkha came in putting a dressing gown over his pyjamas emergency kim ill ring captain tanner and tell her to get round here then ill have a bath breakfast when she arrives the gurkha withdrew ferguson picked up the phone and dialed a number mary ferguson here something big i want you at cavendish square within the hour oh better wear your uniform weve got that thing at the ministry of defence at eleven you always impress them in full war paint he put the phone down and went into the bathroom feeling wideawake and extremely cheerful it was sixthirty when the taxi picked up mary tanner on the steps of her lowndes square flat the driver was impressed but then most people were she wore the uniform of a captain in the womens royal army corps the wings of an army air corps pilot on her left breast below them were the ribbon of the george medal a gallantry award of considerable distinction and campaign ribbons for ireland and for service with the united nations peacekeeping force in cyprus she was a small girl black hair cropped short twentynine years of age and a lot of service under the belt a doctors daughter whod taken an english degree at london university tried teaching and hated it after that came the army a great deal of her service had been with the military police cyprus for a while but three tours of duty in ulster it had been the affair in derry that had earned her the george medal and left her with the scar on her left cheek which had brought her to fergusons attention shed been his aide for two years now she paid off the taxi hurried up the stairs to the flat on the first floor and let herself in with her own key ferguson was sitting on the sofa beside the fireplace in the elegant drawing room a napkin under his chin while kim served his poached eggs just in time he said what would you like tea please earl grey kim and toast and honey got to watch our figure rather early in the day for sexist cracks even for you brigadier now what have we got he told her while he ate and kim brought her tea and toast and she sat opposite listening when he finished she said this brosnan ive never heard of him before your time my love he must be about fortyfive now youll find a file on him in my study he was born in boston one of those filthy rich american families very high society his mother was a dubliner he did all the right things went to princeton took his degree then went and spoiled it all by volunteering for vietnam and as an enlisted man i believe that was nineteen sixtysix airborne rangers he was discharged a sergeant and heavily decorated so what makes him so special he could have avoided vietnam by staying at university but he didnt he also enlisted in the ranks quite something for someone with his social standing youre just an old snob what happened to him after that he went to trinity college dublin to work on a doctorate hes a protestant by the way but his mother was a devout catholic in august sixtynine he was visiting an uncle on his mothers side a priest in belfast remember what happened how it all started orange mobs burning catholics out she said and the police not doing too much about it the mob burned down brosnans uncles church and started on the falls road a handful of old ira hands with a few rifles and handguns held them off and when one of them was shot brosnan picked up his rifle instinctive i suppose i mean vietnam and all that and from then on he was committed very much so youve got to remember that in those early days there were plenty of men like him in the movement believers in irish freedom and all that sort of thing sorry sir ive seen too much blood on the streets of derry to go for that one yes well im not trying to whitewash him hes killed a few in his time but always up front ill say that for him he became quite famous there was a french war photographer called annemarie audin he saved her life in vietnam after a helicopter crash quite a romantic story she turned up in belfast and brosnan took her underground for a week she got a series out of it for life magazine the gallant irish struggle you know the sort of thing what happened after that in nineteen seventyfive he went to france to negotiate an arms deal as it turned out it was a setup and the police were waiting unfortunately he shot one of them dead they gave him life he escaped from prison in seventynine at my instigation i might add but why someone else before your time a terrorist called frank barry started off in ulster with a splinter group called the sons of erin then joined the european terrorist circuit an evil genius if ever there was one tried to get lord carrington on a trip to france when he was foreign secretary the french hushed it up but the prime minister was furious gave me direct orders to hunt barry down whatever the cost oh i see now you needed brosnan to do that set a thief to catch a thief and so forth and he got him for us and afterwards he went back to ireland and took that doctorate and this annemarie audin did they marry not to my knowledge but she did him a bigger favor than that her family is one of the oldest in france and enormously powerful politically and he had been awarded the legion of honour for saving her in vietnam anyway her pressure behind the scenes bore fruit five years ago president mitterrand granted him a pardon wiped the slate clean which is how hes at the sorbonne now he must be the only professor theyve had who shot a policeman dead actually one or two after the war had done just that when serving with the resistance does the leopard ever change its spots she asked o ye of little faith as i say youll find his file in the study if you want to know more he passed her a piece of paper thats the description of the mystery man not much to go on but run it through the computer anyway she went out kim entered with a copy of the times ferguson read the headlines briefly then turned to page two where his attention was immediately caught by the same item concerning mrs thatchers visit to france that had appeared in paris soir well max he said softly i wish you luck and he poured himself another cup of coffee three it was much warmer in paris later that morning most of the snow clearing by lunchtime it was clear in the countryside too only a bit here and there on the hedgerows as dillon moved toward valenton keeping to the back roads he was riding the bmw motorcycle from the garage and was dressed as a crs policeman helmet goggles a mat machine gun slung across the front of the dark uniform raincoat madness to have come of course but he couldnt resist the free show he pulled off a narrow country lane by a farm gate after consulting his map followed a track through a small wood on foot and came to a low stonewall on a hill way below some two hundred yards on was the railway crossing the black renault still parked where he had left it there wasnt a soul about perhaps fifteen minutes later a train passed through he checked his watch twofifteen he focused his zeiss glasses on the scene below again and then the white renault came down the road halfturning to block the crossing there was a peugeot behind it pierre at the wheel and he was already reversing turning the car as gaston ran toward him it was an old model painted scarlet and cream very pretty dillon said softly as the peugeot disappeared up the road now for the cavalry he said and lit a cigarette it was perhaps ten minutes later that a large truck came down the road and braked to a halt unable to progress farther it had high canvas sides on which was emblazoned steiner electronics electronics my arse dillon said a heavy machine gun opened up from inside the truck firing through the side raking the renault as the firing stopped dillon took a black plastic electronic detonator from his pocket switched it on and pulled out the aerial a dozen men in black overalls and riot helmets all clutching machine carbines jumped out as they approached the renault dillon pressed the detonator the selfdestruct charge in the second black box the one he had told pierre contained extra ammunition exploded instantly the vehicle disintegrating parts of the paneling lifting into the air in slow motion there were several men on the ground others running for cover there you are chew on that gentlemen dillon said he walked back through the wood pushed the bmw off its stand swung a leg over and drove away he opened the door of the warehouse on rue de helier got back on the bmw rode inside and parked it as he turned to close the door makeev called from above it went wrong i presume dillon took off his helmet im afraid so the jobert brothers turned me in as he went up the stairs makeev said the disguise i like that a policeman is just a policeman to people nothing to describe exactly i worked for a great irishman called frank barry for a while years ago ever heard of him certainly a veritable carlos he was better than carlos got knocked off in seventynine i dont know who by he used the crs copper on a motorcycle a lot postmen are good too no one ever notices a postman he followed the russian into the sitting room tell me makeev said dillon brought him up to date it was a chance using those two and it went wrong thats all there is to it now what as i said last night ill provide an alternative target i mean all that lovely money ive got to think of my old age nonsense sean you dont give a damn about your old age its the game that excites you you could be right dillon lit a cigarette i know one thing i dont like to be beaten ill think of something for you and ill pay my debts the joberts are they worth it oh yes dillon said a matter of honor josef makeev sighed ill go and see aroun give him the bad news ill be in touch here or at the barge dillon smiled dont worry josef ive never failed yet not when i set my mind to a thing makeev went down the stairs his footsteps echoed across the warehouse the judas gate banged behind him dillon turned and went back into the long room whistling softly but i dont understand aroun said there hasnt been a word on television and there wont be makeev turned from the french windows overlooking the avenue victor hugo the affair never happened that is the way the french will handle it the idea that mrs thatcher could have in any way been at risk on french soil would be considered a national affront aroun was pale with anger he failed this man of yours a great deal of talk makeev but nothing at the end of it a good thing i didnt transfer that million to his zurich account this morning but you agreed makeev said in any case he may ring at any time to check the money has been deposited my dear makeev i have five hundred million dollars on deposit at that bank faced with the possibility of me transferring my business the managing director was more than willing to agree to a small deception when rashid spoke to him this morning when dillon phones to check on the situation the deposit will be confirmed this is a highly dangerous man you are dealing with makeev said if he found out whos going to tell him certainly not you and hell get paid in the end but only if he produces a result rashid poured him a cup of coffee and said to makeev he promised an alternative target mentioned the british prime minister what does he intend hell be in touch when hes decided makeev said talk aroun walked to the window and stood sipping his coffee all talk no michael josef makeev told him you could not be more mistaken martin brosnans apartment was by the river on the quai de montebello opposite the île de la cité and had one of the finest views of notre dame in paris it was within decent walking distance of the sorbonne which suited him perfectly it was just after four as he walked toward it a tall man with broad shoulders in an oldfashioned trenchcoat dark hair that still had no gray in it in spite of his fortyfive years and was far too long giving him the look of some sixteenthcentury bravo martin aodh brosnan the aodh was gaelic for hugh and his irishness showed in the high cheekbones and gray eyes it was getting colder again and he shivered as he turned the corner into quai de montebello and hurried along to the apartment block he owned it all as it happened which gave him the apartment on the corner of the first floor the most favored location scaffolding ran up the corner of the building to the fourth floor where some sort of building work was taking place as he was about to go up the steps to the ornate entrance a voice called martin he glanced up and saw annemarie audin leaning over the balustrade of the terrace where in the hell did you spring from he asked in astonishment cuba i just got in he went up the stairs two at a time and she had the door open as he got there he lifted her up in his arms in an enormous hug and carried her back into the hall how marvelous to see you why cuba she kissed him and helped him off with the trenchcoat oh i had a rather juicy assignment for time magazine come in the kitchen ill make your tea a standing joke for years the tea surprising in an american but he couldnt stand coffee he lit a cigarette and sat at the table and watched her move around the kitchen her short hair as dark as his own this supremely elegant woman who was the same age as himself and looked twelve years younger you look marvelous he told her as she brought the tea he sampled it and nodded in approval thats grand just the way you learned to make it back in south armagh in nineteen seventyone with me and liam devlin showing you the hard way how the ira worked how is the old rogue still living in kilrea outside dublin gives the odd lecture at trinity college claims to be seventy but thats a wicked lie hell never grow old that one yes you really do look marvelous brosnan said why didnt we get married it was a ritual question he had asked for years a joke now there was a time when they had been lovers but for some years now just friends not that it was by any means the usual relationship he would have died for her almost had in a vietnam swamp the first time they had met now that weve got that over tell me about the new book she said a philosophy of terrorism he told her very boring not many people will buy a copy a pity she said coming from such an expert in the field doesnt really matter he said knowing the reasons still wont make people act any differently cynic come on lets have a real drink she opened the fridge and took out a bottle of krug nonvintage what else they went into the magnificent long drawing room there was an ornate gold mirror over the marble fireplace plants everywhere a grand piano comfortable untidy sofas and a great many books she had left the french windows to the balcony standing ajar brosnan went to close them as she opened the krug at the sideboard and got two glasses at the same moment the bell sounded outside when brosnan opened the door he found max hernu and jules savary standing there the jobert brothers behind them professor brosnan hernu said i am colonel max hernu i know very well who you are brosnan said action service isnt it whats all this my wicked past catching up with me not quite but we do need your assistance this is inspector savary and these two are gaston and pierre jobert youd better come in then brosnan said interested in spite of himself the jobert brothers stayed in the hall on hernus orders when he and savary followed brosnan into the drawing room annemarie turned frowning slightly and brosnan made the introductions a great pleasure hernu kissed her hand im a longtime admirer martin she looked worried now youre not getting involved in anything of course not he assured her now what can i do for you colonel a matter of national security professor i hesitate to mention the fact but mademoiselle audin is a photojournalist of some distinction she smiled total discretion you have my word colonel were here because brigadier charles ferguson in london suggested it that old devil and why should he suggest you see me because you are an expert in matters relating to the ira professor let me explain which he did covering the whole affair as rapidly as possible you see professor he said as he concluded the jobert brothers have combed our ira picture books without finding him and ferguson has had no success with the brief description we were able to give youve got a real problem my friend this man is not just anybody he must be special to attempt such a thing but we know nothing more than that we think hes irish and he speaks fluent french so what do you want me to do speak to the joberts brosnan glanced at annemarie then shrugged all right wheel them in he sat on the edge of the table drinking champagne while they stood before him awkward in such circumstances how old is he difficult monsieur pierre said he changes from one minute to the next its like hes more than one person id say late thirties and description small with fair hair he looks like nothing gaston put in we thought he was a nono and then he halfkilled some big ape in our café one night all right hes small fairhaired late thirties and he can handle himself what makes you think hes irish when he was assembling the kalashnikov he made a crack about seeing one take out a landrover full of english paratroopers is that all pierre frowned brosnan took the bottle of krug from the bucket and gaston said no theres something else hes always whistling a funny sort of tune a bit eerie i managed to follow it on my accordion he said it was irish brosnans face had gone quite still he stood there holding the bottle in one hand a glass in the other and he likes that stuff monsieur pierre said champagne brosnan asked well yes any champagne is better than nothing but krug is his favorite like this nonvintage yes monsieur he told us he preferred the grape mix pierre said the bastard always did annemarie put a hand on brosnans arm you know him martin almost certainly could you pick that tune out on the piano he asked gaston ill try monsieur he lifted the lid tried the keyboard gently then played the beginning of the tune with one finger thats enough brosnan turned to hernu and savary an old irish folk song the lark in the clear air and youve got trouble gentlemen because the man youre looking for is sean dillon dillon hernu said of course the man of a thousand faces someone once called him a slight exaggeration brosnan said but it will do they sent the jobert brothers home and brosnan and annemarie sat on a sofa opposite hernu and savary the inspector made notes as the american talked his mother died in childbirth i think that was nineteen fiftytwo his father was an electrician went to work in london so dillon went to school there he had an incredible talent for acting a genius really he can change before your eyes hunch his shoulders put on fifteen years its astonishing so you knew him well hernu asked in belfast in the bad old days but before that he won a scholarship to the royal academy of dramatic art only stayed a year they couldnt teach him anything he did one or two things at the national theatre nothing much he was very young remember then in nineteen seventyone his father whod returned home to belfast was killed by a british army patrol caught in crossfire an accident and dillon took it hard you could say that he offered himself to the provisional ira they liked him he had brains an aptitude for languages they sent him to libya to one of those terrorist training camps for a couple of months a fast course in weaponry thats all it took he never looked back god knows how many hes killed so he still operates for the ira brosnan shook his head not for years oh he still counts himself as a soldier but he thinks the leadership are a bunch of old women and they couldnt handle him hed have killed the pope if hed thought it was needed he was too happy to do things that were counterproductive the word is that he was involved in the mountbatten affair and since those days hernu asked beirut palestine hes done a lot for the plo most terrorist groups have used his services brosnan shook his head youre going to have trouble here why exactly the fact that he used a couple of crooks like the joberts he always does that all right it didnt work this time but he knows the weakness of all revolutionary movements that theyre ridden with either hotheads or informers you called him the faceless man and thats right because i doubt if youll find a photo of him in any file and frankly it wouldnt matter if you did why does he do it annemarie asked not for any political ends because he likes it brosnan said because hes hooked hes an actor remember this is for real and hes good at it i get the impression that you dont care for him very much hernu said in personal terms i mean well he tried to kill me and a good friend of mine a long time ago brosnan told him does that answer your question its certainly reason enough hernu got up and savary joined him we must be going i want to get all this to brigadier ferguson as soon as possible fine brosnan said we may count on your help in this thing i hope professor brosnan glanced at annemarie whose face was set look he said i dont mind talking to you again if that will help but i dont want to be personally involved you know what i was colonel whatever happens i wont go back to anything like that i made someone a promise a long time ago i understand perfectly professor hernu turned to annemarie mademoiselle a distinct pleasure ill see you out she said and led the way when she returned brosnan had the french windows open and was standing looking across the river smoking a cigarette he put an arm around her all right oh yes she said perfect and laid her head against his chest at that precise moment ferguson was sitting by the fire in the cavendish place flat when the phone rang mary tanner answered it in the study after a while she came out that was downing street the prime minister wants to see you when now sir ferguson got up and removed his reading glasses call the car you come with me and wait she picked up the phone spoke briefly then put it down what do you think its about brigadier im not sure my imminent retirement or your return to more mundane duties or this business in france hell have been told all about it by now anyway lets go and see and he led the way out they were checked through the security gates at the end of downing street mary tanner stayed in the car while ferguson was admitted through the most famous door in the world it was rather quiet compared to the last time hed been there a christmas party given by mrs thatcher for the staff in the pillared room cleaners typists office workers typical of her that the other side of the iron lady he regretted her departure that was a fact and sighed as he followed a young aide up the main staircase lined with replicas of portraits of all those great men of history peel wellington disraeli and many more they reached the corridor the young man knocked on the door and opened it brigadier ferguson prime minister the last time ferguson had been in that study it had been a womans room the feminine touches unmistakably there but things were different now a little more austere in a subtle way he was aware of that darkness was falling fast outside and john major was checking some sort of report the pen in his hand moving with considerable speed sorry about this it will only take a moment he said it was the courtesy that astounded ferguson the sheer basic good manners that one didnt experience too often from heads of government major signed the report put it on one side and sat back a pleasant grayhaired man in hornrimmed glasses the youngest prime minister of the twentieth century almost unknown to the general public on his succession to margaret thatcher and yet his handling of the crisis in the gulf had already marked him out as a leader of genuine stature please sit down brigadier im on a tight schedule so ill get right to the point the business affecting mrs thatcher in france obviously very disturbing indeed so prime minister thank god it all turned out as it did yes but that seems to have been a matter of luck more than anything else ive spoken to president mitterrand and hes agreed that in all our interests and especially with the present situation in the gulf there will be a total security clampdown what about the press prime minister nothing will reach the press brigadier john major told him i understand the french failed to catch the individual concerned im afraid that is so according to my latest information but colonel hernu of action service is keeping in close touch ive spoken to mrs thatcher and it was she who alerted me to your presence brigadier as i understand it the intelligence section known as group four was set up in responsible only to the prime minister its purpose to handle specific cases of terrorism and subversion that is correct which means you will have served five prime ministers if we include myself actually prime minister thats not quite accurate ferguson said we do have a problem at the moment oh i know all about that the usual security people have never liked your existence brigadier too much like the prime ministers private army thats why they thought a changeover at number ten was a good time to get rid of you im afraid so prime minister well it wasnt and it isnt ive spoken to the director general of security services its taken care of i couldnt be more delighted good your first task quite obviously is to run down whoever was behind this french affair if hes ira then hes our business wouldnt you agree absolutely good ill let you go and get on with it then keep me informed of every significant development on an eyesonly basis of course prime minister the door behind opened as if by magic the aide appeared to usher ferguson out the prime minister was already working over another sheaf of papers as the door closed and ferguson was led downstairs as the limousine drove away mary tanner reached forward to close the screen what happened what was it about oh the french business ferguson sounded curiously remote you know hes really got something about him this one oh come off it sir mary said i mean dont you honestly think we could do with a change after all these years of tory government wonderful spokesperson for the workers you make he said your dear old dad god rest him was a professor of surgery at oxford your mother owns half of herefordshire that flat of yours in lowndes square a million would you say why is it the children of the rich are always so depressingly leftwing while still insisting on dining at the savoy a gross exaggeration seriously my dear ive worked for labour as well as conservative prime ministers the color of the politician doesnt matter the marquess of salisbury when he was prime minister gladstone disraeli had very similar problems to those we have today fenians anarchists bombs in london only dynamite instead of semtex and how many attempts were there on queen victorias life he gazed out at the whitehall traffic as they moved toward the ministry of defence nothing changes all right end of lecture but what happened she demanded oh were back in business thats what happened he said im afraid well have to cancel your transfer back to the military police damn you she cried and flung her arms around his neck fergusons office on the third floor of the ministry of defence was on a corner at the rear overlooking horse guards avenue with a view of the victoria embankment and the river at the far end he had hardly got settled behind his desk when mary hurried in coded fax from hernu ive put it through the machine youre not going to like it one little bit it contained the gist of hernus meeting with martin brosnan the facts on sean dilloneverything dear god ferguson said couldnt be worse hes like a ghost this dillon chap does he exist or doesnt he as bad as carlos in international terrorist terms but totally unknown to the media or the general public and nothing to go on but we do have one thing sir whats that brosnan true but will he help ferguson got up and moved to the window i tried to get martin to do something for me the other year he wouldnt touch it with a bargepole he turned and smiled its the girlfriend you see annemarie audin she has a horror of him becoming what he once was yes i can understand that but never mind wed better get a report on their latest developments to the prime minister lets keep it brief she produced a pen and took notes as he dictated anything else sir she asked when he had finished i dont think so get it typed one copy for the file the other for the pm send it straight round to number ten by messenger eyes only mary did a rough type of the report herself then went along the corridor to the typing and copying room there was one on each floor and the clerks all had full security clearance the copier was clattering as she went in the man standing in front of it was in his midfifties white hair steelrimmed army glasses his shirt sleeves rolled up hello gordon she said a priority one here your very best typing one copy for the personal file youll do it straight away of course captain tanner he glanced at it briefly fifteen minutes ill bring it along she went out and he sat down at his typewriter taking a deep breath to steady himself as he read the words for the eyes of the prime minister only gordon brown had served in the intelligence corps for twentyfive years reaching the rank of warrant officer a worthy if unspectacular career culminating in the award of an mbe and the offer of employment at the ministry of defence on his retirement from the army and everything had been fine until the death of his wife from cancer the previous year they were childless which left him alone in a cold world at fiftyfive years of age and then something miraculous happened there were invitation cards flying around at the ministry all the time to receptions at the various embassies in london he often helped himself to one it was just something to do and at an art display at the german embassy hed met tania novikova a secretarytypist at the soviet embassy theyd got on so well together she was thirty and not particularly pretty but when shed taken him to bed on their second meeting at his flat in camden it was like a revelation brown had never known sex like it was hooked instantly and then it had started the questions about his job anything and everything about what went on at the ministry of defence then there was a cooling off he didnt see her and was distracted almost out of his mind hed phoned her at her flat she was cold at first distant and then shed asked him if hed been doing anything interesting he knew then what was happening but didnt care there was a series of reports passing through on british army changes in view of political changes in russia it was easy to run off spare copies when he took them round to her flat it was just as it had been and she took him to heights of pleasure such as he had never known from then on he would do anything providing copies of everything that might interest her for the eyes of the prime minister only how grateful would she be for that he finished typing ran off two extra copies one for himself he had a file of them now in one of his bedroom drawers the other was for tania novikova who was of course not a secretarytypist at the soviet embassy as she had informed brown but a captain in the kgb gaston opened the door of the lockup garage opposite le chat noir and pierre got behind the wheel of the old cream and red peugeot his brother got in the rear seat and they drove away ive been thinking gaston said i mean what if they dont get him he could come looking for us pierre nonsense pierre told him hes long gone gaston what kind of fool would hang around after whats happened no light me a cigarette and shut up well have a nice dinner and go on to the zanzibar afterwards theyve still got those swedish sisters stripping it was just before eight the streets at that place quiet and deserted people inside because of the extreme cold they came to a small square and as they started to cross it a crs man on his motorcycle came up behind them flashing his lights theres a cop on our tail gaston said he pulled up alongside anonymous in his helmet and goggles and waved them down a message from savary i suppose pierre said and pulled over to the pavement maybe theyve got him gaston said excitedly the crs man halted behind them pushed his bike up on its stand and approached gaston got the rear door open and leaned out have they caught the bastard dillon took a walther with a carswell silencer from inside the flap of his raincoat and shot him twice in the heart he pushed up his goggles and turned pierre crossed himself its you yes pierre a matter of honor the walther coughed twice more dillon pushed it back inside his raincoat got on the bmw and drove away it started to snow a little the square very quiet it was perhaps half an hour later that a policeman on foot patrol caped against the cold found them tania novikovas flat was just off the bayswater road not far from the soviet embassy shed had a hard day had intended an early night it was just before tenthirty when her doorbell rang she was toweling herself down after a nice relaxing bath she pulled on a robe and went downstairs gordon browns evening shift had finished at ten he couldnt wait to get to her and had had the usual difficulty parking his ford escort he stood at the door ringing the bell impatiently hugely excited when she opened the door and saw who it was she was immediately angry and drew him inside i told you never to come here gordon under any circumstances but this is special he pleaded look what ive brought you in the living room she took the large envelope from him opened it and slipped out the report for the eyes of the prime minister only her excitement was intense as she read through it incredible that this fool could have delivered her such a coup his arms were around her waist sliding up to her breasts and she was aware of his excitement its good stuff isnt it he demanded excellent gordon you have been a good boy really his grip tightened i can stay over then oh gordon its such a pity im on the night shift please darling he was shaking like a leaf just a few minutes then she had to keep him happy she knew that put the report on the table and took him by the hand quarter of an hour gordon thats all and then youll have to go and she led him into the bedroom after shed got rid of him she dressed hurriedly debating what to do she was a hard committed communist that was how she had been raised and how she would die more than that she served the kgb with total loyalty it had nurtured her educated her given her whatever status she had in their world for a young woman she was surprisingly oldfashioned had no time for gorbachev or the glasnost fools who surrounded him unfortunately many in the kgb did support him and one of those was her boss at the london embassy colonel yuri gatov what would his attitude be to such a report she wondered as she let herself out into the street and started to walk what would gorbachevs attitude be to the failed attempt to assassinate mrs thatcher probably the same outrage the british prime minister must feel and if gorbachev felt that way so would colonel gatov so what to do it came to her then as she walked along the frosty pavement of the bayswater road that there was someone who might very well be interested and not only because he thought as she did but because he was himself right in the center of all the actionparis her old boss colonel josef makeev that was it makeev would know how best to use such information she turned into kensington palace gardens and went into the soviet embassy by chance makeev was working late in his office that night when his secretary looked in and said a call from london on the scrambler captain novikova makeev picked up the red phone tania he said a certain affection in his voice for they had been lovers during the three years shed worked for him in paris what can i do for you i understand there was an incident affecting empire over there earlier today she said it was an old kgb coded phrase current for years always used when referring to assassination attempts of any kind at high government level where britain was concerned makeev was immediately alert thats correct the usual kind of itdidnthappen affair have you an interest very much so theres a coded fax on the way ill stand by in my office if you want to talk tania novikova put down the phone she had her own fax coding machine at a second desk she went to it tapping the required details out quickly checking on the screen to see that she had got it right she added makeevs personal number inserted the report and waited a few moments later she got a message received okay signal she got up lit a cigarette and went and stood by the window waiting the jumbled message was received in the radio and coding room at the paris embassy makeev stood waiting impatiently for it to come through the operator handed it to him and the colonel inserted it into the decoder and tapped in his personal key he couldnt wait to see the contents was reading it as he went along the corridor as excited as tania novikova when he saw the line for the eyes of the prime minister only he sat behind his desk and read it through again he thought about it for a while then reached for the red phone youve done well tania this one was my baby im so pleased does gatov know about this no colonel good lets keep it that way is there anything else i can do very much so cultivate your contact let me have anything else on the instant there could be more for you i have a friend coming to london the particular friend youve been reading about ill wait to hear she put down the phone totally elated and went along to the canteen in paris makeev sat there for a moment frowning then he picked up the phone and rang dillon there was a slight delay before the irishman answered who is it josef sean im on my way there utmost importance makeev put down the phone got his overcoat and went out four brosnan had taken annemarie to the cinema that evening and afterwards to a small restaurant in montmartre called la place anglaise it was an old favorite because and in spite of the name one of the specialities of the house was irish stew it wasnt particularly busy and they had just finished the main course when max hernu appeared savary standing behind him snow in london snow in brussels and snow in paris hernu brushed it from his sleeve and opened his coat do i deduce from your appearance here that youve had me followed brosnan asked not at all professor we called at your apartment where the porter told us you had gone to the cinema he was also kind enough to mention three or four restaurants he thought you might be at this is the second then youd better sit down and have a cognac and some coffee annemarie told him you both look frozen they took off their coats and brosnan nodded to the headwaiter who hurried over and took the order im sorry mademoiselle to spoil your evening but this is most important hernu said an unfortunate development brosnan lit a cigarette tell us the worst it was savary who answered about two hours ago the bodies of the jobert brothers were found by a beat policeman in their car in a small square not far from le chat noir murdered is that what you are saying annemarie put in oh yes mademoiselle he said shot to death two each in the heart brosnan said why yes professor the pathologist was able to tell us that at the start of his examination we didnt stay for the rest how did you know dillon without a doubt its a real pros trick colonel you should know that never one shot always two in case the other man manages to get one off at you as a reflex hernu stirred his coffee did you expect this professor oh yes hed have come looking for them sooner or later a strange man he always keeps his word never goes back on a contract and he expects the same from those he deals with what he calls a matter of honor at least he did in the old days can i ask you something savary said ive been on the street fifteen years ive known killers in plenty and not just the gangsters who see it as part of the job but the poor sod whos killed his wife because shes been unfaithful dillon seems something else i mean his father was killed by british soldiers so he joined the ira i can see that but everything thats happened since twenty years of it all those hits and not even in his own country why im not a psychiatrist brosnan said theyd give you all the fancy names starting with psychopath and working down i knew men like him in the army in vietnam in special forces and good men some of them but once they started the killing i mean it seemed to take over like a drug they became driven men the next stage was always to kill when it wasnt necessary to do it without emotion back there in nam it was as if people had become how can i put it just things and this you think happened to dillon hernu asked it happened to me colonel martin brosnan said bleakly there was silence finally hernu said we must catch him professor i know then youll join us in hunting him down annemarie put a hand on his arm dismay on her face and she turned to the two men a kind of desperate anger there thats your job not martins its all right martin soothed her dont worry he said to hernu any advice i can give any information that might help but no personal involvement im sorry colonel thats the way it has to be savary said you told us he tried to kill you once you and a friend that was in seventyfour he and i both worked for this friend of mine a man named devlin liam devlin he was what you might call an oldfashioned revolutionary thought you could still fight it out like the old days an undercover army against the troops a bit like the resistance in france during the war he didnt like bombs soft target bits that kind of stuff what happened the inspector asked dillon disobeyed orders and the bomb that was meant for the police patrol killed half a dozen children devlin and i went after him he tried to take us out without success obviously well we werent exactly kids off the street his voice had changed in a subtle way harder more cynical left me with a groove in one shoulder and i gave him one in the arm himself that was when he first dropped out of sight into europe and you didnt see him again i was in prison for over four years from nineteen seventyfive inspector belle isle youre forgetting your history he worked with a man called frank barry for a while another refugee from the ira who turned up on the european scene a really bad one barry do you remember him i do indeed professor hernu said as i recall he tried to assassinate lord carrington the british foreign secretary on a visit to france in nineteen seventynine in very similar circumstances to this recent affair dillon was probably doing a copycat of that operation he worshipped barry whom you killed on behalf of british intelligence i understand annemarie said excuse me she got up and walked down to the powder room hernu said weve upset her she worries about me colonel worries that some circumstances might put a gun in my hand again and send me sliding all the way back yes i can see that my friend hernu got up and buttoned his coat weve taken up enough of your time my apologies to mademoiselle audin savary said your lectures at the sorbonne professor the students must love you i bet you get a full house always brosnan said he watched them go and annemarie returned sorry about that my love he told her not your fault she looked tired i think ill go home youre not coming back to my place not tonight tomorrow perhaps the headwaiter brought the bill which brosnan signed then helped them into their coats and ushered them to the door outside snow sprinkled the cobbles she shivered and turned to brosnan you changed martin back there when you were talking to them you started to become the other man again really he said and knew that it was true ill get a taxi let me come with you no id rather not he watched her go down the street then turned and went the other way wondering about dillon where he was and what he was doing dillons barge was moored in a small basin on the quai stbernard there were mainly motor cruisers there pleasure craft with canvas hoods over them for the winter the interior was surprisingly luxurious a stateroom lined with mahogany two comfortable sofas a television his sleeping quarters were in a cabin beyond with a divan bed and a small showerroom adjacent the kitchen was on the other side of the passageway small but very modern everything a good cook could want he was in there now waiting for the kettle to boil when he heard the footfalls on deck he opened a drawer took out a walther cocked it and slipped it into his waistband at the rear then he went out makeev came down the companionway and entered the stateroom he shook snow from his overcoat and took it off what a night filthy weather worse in moscow dillon told him coffee why not makeev helped himself to a cognac from a bottle on the sideboard and the irishman came back with a china mug in each hand well whats happened first of all my sources tell me the jobert brothers have turned up very dead indeed was that wise to use an immortal phrase from one of those old james cagney movies they had it coming now what else has happened oh an old friend from your dim past has surfaced one martin brosnan holy mother of god dillon seemed transfixed for a moment martin martin brosnan where in the hell did he turn up from hes living right here in paris just up the river from you on quai de montebello the block on the corner opposite notre dame very ornate entrance within walking distance of here you cant miss it has scaffolding on the front some sort of building work going on all very detailed dillon took a bottle of bushmills from the cupboard and poured one why ive had a look on my way here whats all this got to do with me so makeev told himmax hernu savary tania novikova in london everything so he said as he finished at least we know what our friends are up to this novikova girl could be very useful to me dillon said will she play things our way no question she worked for me for some years a very clever young woman like me she isnt happy with present changes back home her boss is a different matter colonel yuri gatov all for change one of those yes she could be important dillon said do i take it this means you want to go to london when i know ill let you know and brosnan i could pass him on the street and he wouldnt recognize me youre sure josef i could pass you and you wouldnt recognize me youve never really seen me change have you have you come in your car of course not taxi i hope i can get one back ill get my coat and walk some of the way with you he went out and makeev buttoned his coat and poured another brandy there was a slight sound behind him and when he turned dillon stood there in cap and reefer coat hunched over in some strange way even the shape of his face seemed different he looked fifteen years older the change in body language was incredible my god its amazing makeev said dillon straightened up and grinned josef my old son if id stuck to the stage id have been a theatrical knight by now come on lets get going the snow was only a light powdering on the ground barges passed on the river and notre dame floodlit floated in the night they reached the quai de montebello without seeing a taxi makeev said here we are brosnans place he owns the block it seems his mother left him rather well off is that a fact dillon looked across at the scaffolding and makeev said apartment four the one on the corner on the first floor does he live alone not married has a woman friend annemarie audin the war photographer i saw her once back in seventy one in belfast brosnan and liam devlin my boss at the time were giving her a privileged look at the ira did you meet her not personally do they live together apparently not a taxi came out of a sideturning and moved toward them and makeev raised an arm well speak tomorrow the taxi drove off and dillon was about to turn away when brosnan came round the corner dillon recognized him instantly now then martin you old bastard he said softly brosnan went up the steps and inside dillon turned smiling and walked away whistling to himself softly at his flat in cavendish square ferguson was just getting ready to go to bed when the phone rang hernu said bad news hes knocked off the jobert brothers dear me ferguson said he doesnt mess about does he ive been to see brosnan to ask him to come in with us on this im afraid hes refused offered to give us his advice and so on but he wont become actively involved nonsense ferguson said we cant have that when the ship is sinking its all hands to the pumps and this ship is sinking very fast indeed what do you suggest i think it might be an idea if i came over to see him im not sure of the time ive things to arrange possibly the afternoon well let you know excellent i couldnt be more pleased ferguson sat there thinking about it for a while and then he phoned mary tanner at her flat i suppose like me youd hoped for a relatively quiet night after your early rise this morning he said it had crossed my mind has something happened he brought her up to date i think it might be an idea to go over tomorrow have a chat with hernu then speak to brosnan he must be made to realize how serious this is do you want me to come naturally i cant even make sense of a menu over there whereas we all know that one of the benefits of your rather expensive education is fluency in the french language get in touch with the transport officer at the ministry and tell him i want the lear jet standing by tomorrow ill handle it anything else no ill see you at the office in the morning and dont forget your passport ferguson put down the phone got into bed and switched off the light back on the barge dillon boiled the kettle then poured a little bushmills whisky into a mug added some lemon juice sugar and the boiling water and went back into the stateroom sipping the hot toddy my god martin brosnan after all these years his mind went back to the old days with the american and liam devlin his old commander devlin the living legend of the ira wild exciting days taking on the might of the british army facetoface nothing would ever be the same as that there was a stack of london newspapers on the table hed brought them all at the gare de lyon newsstand earlier there was the daily mail the express the times and the telegraph it was the political sections that interested him most and all the stories were similar the gulf crisis the air strikes on baghdad speculation on when the land war would start and photos of course prime minister john major outside number ten downing street the british press was wonderful there were discussions about security speculation as to possible arab terrorist attacks and articles that even included maps and street plans of the immediate area around downing street and more photos of the prime minister and cabinet ministers arriving for the daily meetings of the war cabinet london that was where the action was no doubt about it he put the papers away neatly finished his toddy and went to bed one of the first things ferguson did on reaching his office was to dictate a further brief report to the prime minister bringing him up to date and informing him of the paris trip mary took the draft along to the copy room the duty clerk just coming to the end of the night shift was a woman a mrs alice johnson a war widow whose husband had been killed in the falklands she got on with the typing of the report instantly had just finished putting it through the copier when gordon brown entered he was on a split shift three hours from ten until one and six until ten in the evening he put his briefcase down and took off his jacket you go whenever you like alice anything special just this report for captain tanner its a number ten job i said id take it along ill take it for you brown said you get going she passed him both copies of the report and started to clear her desk no chance to make an extra copy but at least he could read it which he did as he went along the corridor to mary tanners office she was sitting at her desk when he went in that report you wanted captain tanner shall i arrange a messenger no thanks gordon ill see to it anything else captain no im just clearing the desk brigadier ferguson and i are going to paris she glanced at her watch ill have to get moving were due out of gatwick at eleven well i hope you enjoy yourself when he went back to the copy room alice johnson was still there i say alice he said would you mind hanging on for a little while only somethings come up ill make it up to you thats all right she said you get off he put on his coat hurried downstairs to the canteen and went into one of the public telephone booths tania novikova was only at the flat because of the lateness of the hour when she had left the embassy the previous night ive told you not to ring me here ill ring you she told him i must see you im free at one impossible ive seen another report the same business i see have you got a copy no that wasnt possible but ive read it what did it say ill tell you at lunchtime she realized then that control on her part severe control was necessary her voice was cold and hard when she said dont waste my time gordon im busy i think id better bring this conversation to an end i may give you a ring sometime but then i may not he panicked instantly no let me tell you there wasnt much just that the two french criminals involved had been murdered they presumed by the man dillon oh and brigadier ferguson and captain tanner are flying over to paris in the lear jet at noon why theyre hoping to persuade this man martin brosnan to help them good she said youve done well gordon ill see you tonight at your flat six oclock and bring your work schedule for the next couple of weeks she rang off brown went upstairs full of elation ferguson and mary tanner had an excellent flight and touched down at charles de gaulle airport just after one by two oclock they were being ushered into hernus office at dgse headquarters on boulevard mortier he embraced ferguson briefly charles you old rogue its far too long now then none of your funny french ways ferguson told him youll be kissing me on both cheeks next mary tanner my aide she was wearing a rather nice armani trouser suit of dark brown and a pair of exquisite ankle boots by manolo blahnik diamond stud earrings and a small gold rolex divers watch completed the picture for a girl who was not supposed to be particularly pretty she looked stunning hernu who knew class when he saw it kissed her hand captain tanner your reputation precedes you only in the nicest way i hope she replied in fluent french good ferguson said so now weve got all that stuff over lets get down to brass tacks what about brosnan i have spoken to him this morning and hes agreed to see us at his apartment at three time for a late lunch we have excellent canteen facilities here everyone mixes in from the director downwards he opened the door just follow me it may not be quite the best food in paris but its certainly the cheapest in the stateroom at the barge dillon was pouring a glass of krug and studying a largescale map of london around him pinned to the mahogany walls were articles and reports from all the newspapers specifically referring to affairs at number ten the gulf war and how well john major was doing there were photos of the youngest prime minister of the century several of them in fact the eyes seemed to follow him about it was as if major was watching him and ive got my eye on you too fella dillon said softly the things that intrigued him were the constant daily meetings of the british war cabinet at number ten all those bastards all together in the same spot what a target brighton all over again and that affair had come close to taking out the entire british government but number ten as a target that didnt seem possible fortress thatcher it had been dubbed by some after that redoubtable ladys security improvements there were footsteps on the deck overhead he opened a drawer in the table casually revealing a smith amp wesson revolver closed it again as makeev came in i could have telephoned but i thought id speak to you personally the russian said what now ive brought you some photos weve had taken of brosnan as he is now oh and thats the girlfriend annemarie audin good anything else ive heard from tania novikova again it seems brigadier ferguson and his aide a captain mary tanner have flown over they were due out of gatwick at eleven he glanced at his watch id say theyll be with hernu right now to what end the real purpose of the trip is to see brosnan try and persuade him to help actively in the search for you really dillon smiled coldly martins becoming a serious inconvenience i might have to do something about that makeev nodded at the clippings on the walls your own private gallery im just getting to know the man dillon said do you want a drink no thanks suddenly makeev felt uncomfortable ive things to do ill be in touch he went up the companionway dillon poured himself a little more champagne sipped a little then stopped walked into the kitchen and poured the whole bottle down the sink conspicuous waste but he felt like it he went back into the stateroom lit a cigarette and looked at the clippings again but all he could think about was martin brosnan he picked up the photos makeev had brought and pinned them up beside the clippings annemarie was in the kitchen at the quai de montebello brosnan going over a lecture at the table when the doorbell rang she hurried out wiping her hands on a cloth that will be them she said ill get it now dont forget your promise she touched the back of his neck briefly and went out there was a sound of voices in the hall and she returned with ferguson hernu and mary tanner ill make some coffee annemarie said and went into the kitchen my dear martin ferguson held out his hand its been too long amazing brosnan said we only ever meet when you want something someone you havent met my aide captain mary tanner brosnan looked her over quickly the small dark girl with the scar on the left cheek and liked what he saw couldnt you find a better class of work than what this old sod has to offer he demanded odd that she should feel slightly breathless faced with this fortyfiveyearold man with the ridiculously long hair and the face that had seen rather too much of the worst of life theres a recession on you have to take whats going these days she said her hand light in his right weve had the cabaret act so lets get down to business ferguson said hernu went to the window ferguson and mary took the sofa opposite brosnan max tells me he spoke to you last night after the murder of the jobert brothers annemarie came in with coffee on a tray brosnan said thats right he tells me youve refused to help us thats putting it a bit strongly what i said was that id do anything i could except become actively involved myself and if youve come to attempt to change my mind youre wasting your time annemarie poured coffee ferguson said you agree with him miss audin martin slipped out of that life a long time ago brigadier she said carefully i would not care to see him step back in for whatever reason but surely you can see that a man like dillon must be stopped then others must do the stopping why martin for gods sake she was distressed now and angry its your job people like you this sort of thing is how you make your living max hernu came across and picked up a cup of coffee but professor brosnan is in a special position as regards this business you must see that mademoiselle he knew dillon intimately worked with him for years he could be of great help to us i dont want to see him with a gun in his hand she said and thats what it would come down to once his foot is on that road again it can only have one end she was very distressed turned and went through into the kitchen mary tanner went after her and closed the door annemarie was leaning against the sink arms folded as if holding herself in agony on her face they dont see do they they dont understand what i mean i do mary said simply i understand exactly what you mean and as annemarie started to sob quietly went and put her arms around her brosnan opened the french windows and stood on the terrace by the scaffolding taking in lungfuls of cold air ferguson joined him im sorry for the distress weve caused her no youre not you only see the end in view you always did hes a bad one martin i know brosnan nodded a real can of worms the little bastard has opened this time i must get a smoke he went inside hernu was sitting by the fire brosnan found a packet of cigarettes hesitated then opened the kitchen door annemarie and mary were sitting opposite each other holding hands across the table mary turned shell be fine just leave us for a while brosnan went back to the terrace he lit a cigarette and leaned against the balustrade she seems quite a lady that aide of yours that scar on her left cheek shrapnel whats her story she was doing a tour of duty as a lieutenant with the military police in londonderry some ira chap was delivering a car bomb when the engine failed he left it at the curb and did a runner unfortunately it was outside an old folks home mary was driving past in a landrover when a civilian alerted her she got in the car released the brake and managed to freewheel down the hill on to some wasteland it exploded as she made a run for it good god yes id agree on that occasion when she came out of hospital she received a severe reprimand for breaking standing orders and the george medal for the gallantry of her action i took her on after that a lot of still waters there brosnan sighed and tossed his cigarette out into space as mary tanner joined them shes gone to lie down in the bedroom all right brosnan said lets go back in they went and sat down again and he lit another cigarette lets get this over with what did you want to say ferguson turned to mary your turn my dear ive been through the files checked out everything the computer can tell us she opened her brown handbag and took out a photo the only likeness of dillon we can find its from a group photo taken at rada twenty years ago we had an expert in the department blow it up there was a lack of definition the texture grainy and the face was totally anonymous just another young boy brosnan gave it back useless i didnt even recognize him myself oh its him all right the man on his right became quite successful on television hes dead now not through dillon oh no stomach cancer but he was approached by one of our people back in nineteen eightyone and confirmed that it was dillon standing next to him in the photo the only likeness we have ferguson said and no bloody use at all did you know that he took a pilots license and a commercial one at that mary said no i never knew that brosnan said according to one of our informants he did it in lebanon some years ago why were your people on his case in eightyone brosnan asked yes well thats interesting she told him you told colonel hernu that hed quarreled with the ira had dropped out and joined the international terrorist circuit thats right it seems they took him back in nineteen eightyone they were having trouble with their active service units in england too many arrests that kind of thing through an informer in ulster we heard that he was operating in london for a time there were at least three or four incidents attributed to him two car bombs and the murder of a police informant in ulster whod been relocated with his family in maida vale and we didnt come within spitting distance of catching him ferguson said well you wouldnt brosnan told him let me go over it again hes an actor of genius he really can change before your eyes just by use of body language youd have to see it to believe it imagine what he can do with makeup haircoloring changes hes only five feet five remember ive seen him dress as a woman and fool soldiers on foot patrol in belfast mary tanner was leaning forward intently go on she said softly you want to know another reason why youve never caught him he works out a series of aliases changes hair color uses whatever tricks of makeup are necessary then takes his photo thats what goes on his false passport or identity papers he keeps a collection then when he needs to move makes himself into the man on the photo ingenious hernu said exactly so no hope of any help from television or newspaper publicity of the haveyouseenthisman type wherever he goes he slips under the surface if he was working in london and needed anything at allhelp weapons whateverhed simply pretend to be an ordinary criminal and use the underworld you mean he wouldnt go near any kind of ira contact at all mary said i doubt it maybe someone whod been in very deep cover for years someone he could really trust and people like that are thin on the ground there is a point in all this which no one has touched on hernu said who is he working for well it certainly isnt the ira mary said we did an instant computer check and we have links with both the ruc computer and british army intelligence at lisburn not a smell from anyone about the attempt on mrs thatcher oh i believe that brosnan said although you can never be sure there are the iraqis of course ferguson said saddam would dearly love to blow everyone up at the moment true but dont forget hizbollah plo wrath of allah and a few others in between hes worked for them all brosnan reminded him yes ferguson said and checking our sources through that lot would take time and i dont think weve got it you think hell try again mary asked nothing concrete my dear but ive been in this business a lifetime i always go by my instincts and this time my instincts tell me theres more to it well i cant help you there ive done all i can brosnan stood up all youre prepared to you mean ferguson said they moved into the hall and brosnan opened the door i suppose youll be going back to london oh i dont know i thought we might stay over and sample the delights of paris i havent stayed at the ritz since the refurbishment mary tanner said that will give the expenses a bashing she held out her hand goodbye professor brosnan it was nice to be able to put a face to the name and you he said colonel he nodded to hernu and closed the door when he went into the drawing room annemarie came in from the bedroom her face was drawn and pale did you come to any decision she asked i gave you my word ive helped them all i can now theyve gone and thats an end to it she opened the table drawer inside there was an assortment of pens envelopes writing paper stamps there was also a browning high power millimeter pistol one of the most deadly handguns in the world preferred by the sas above all others she didnt say a word simply closed the drawer and looked at him calmly ill make some tea she said and went into the kitchen in the limousine hernu said youve lost him he wont do any more i wouldnt be too sure of that well discuss it over dinner at the ritz later youll join us i hope eight oclock all right delighted hernu said group four must be rather more generous with its expenses than my own poor department oh its all on dear mary here ferguson said flashed this wonderful piece of plastic at me the other day which american express had sent her the platinum card can you believe that colonel damn you mary said hernu lay back and laughed helplessly tania novikova came out of the bathroom of gordon browns camden flat combing her hair he pulled on a dressing gown youve got to go he said i must come into the living room she pulled on her coat and turned to face him no more coming to the bayswater flat no more telephones the work schedule you showed me all split shifts for the next month why theyre not popular especially for people with families that isnt a problem for me so i agreed to do it for the moment and it pays more so you usually finish at one oclock and start again at six in the evening yes you have an answering machine the kind where you can phone home and get your messages yes good we can keep in touch that way she started for the door and he caught her arm but when will i see you difficult at the moment gordon we must be careful if youve nothing better to do always come home between shifts ill do what i can he kissed her hungrily darling she pushed him away i must go now gordon she opened the door went downstairs and let herself out of the street entrance it was still very cold and she pulled up her collar my god the things i do for mother russia she said she went down to the corner and hailed a cab five it was colder than ever in the evening a front from siberia sweeping across europe too cold for snow even in the apartment just before seven brosnan put some more logs on the fire annemarie lying fulllength on the sofa stirred and sat up so we stay in to eat i think so he said a vile night good ill see what i can do in the kitchen he put on the television news program more air strikes against baghdad but still no sign of a land war he switched the set off and annemarie emerged from the kitchen and picked up her coat from the chair where she had left it your fridge as usual is almost empty unless you wish me to concoct a meal based on some rather stale cheese one egg and half a carton of milk ill have to go round the corner to the delicatessen ill come with you nonsense she said why should we both suffer ill see you soon she blew him a kiss and went out brosnan went and opened the french windows he stood on the terrace shivering and lit a cigarette watching for her a moment later she emerged from the front door and started along the pavement goodbye my love he called dramatically parting is such sweet sorrow idiot she called back go back in before you catch pneumonia she moved away careful on the frozen pavement and disappeared round the corner at that moment the phone rang brosnan turned and hurried in leaving the french windows open dillon had an early meal at a small café he often frequented he was on foot and his route back to the barge took him past brosnans apartment block he paused on the other side of the road cold in spite of the reefer coat and the knitted cap pulled down over his ears he stood there swinging his arms vigorosly looking up at the lighted windows of the apartment when annemarie came out of the entrance he recognized her instantly and stepped back into the shadows the street was silent no traffic movement at all and when brosnan leaned over the balustrade and called down to her dillon heard every word he said it gave him a totally false impression that she was leaving for the evening as she disappeared round the corner he crossed the road quickly he checked the walther in his waistband at the rear had a quick glance each way to see that no one was about then started to climb the scaffolding it was mary tanner on the phone brigadier ferguson wondered whether we could see you again in the morning before going back it wont do you any good brosnan told her is that a yes or a no all right he said reluctantly if you must i understand she said i really do has annemarie recovered a tough lady that one he said shes covered more wars than weve had hot dinners thats why ive always found her attitude about such things where im concerned strange oh dear she said you men can really be incredibly stupid on occasions she loves you professor its as simple as that ill see you in the morning brosnan put the phone down there was a draught of cold air the fire flared up he turned and found sean dillon standing in the open french windows the walther in his left hand god bless all here he said the delicatessen in the side street as with so many such places these days was run by an indian a mr patel he was most assiduous where annemarie was concerned carrying the basket for her as they went round the shelves delicious french bread sticks milk eggs brie cheese a beautiful quiche baked by my wife with her own hands mr patel assured her two minutes in the microwave and a perfect meal she laughed then all we need is a very large tin of caviar and some smoked salmon to complement it he packed the things carefully for her ill put them on professor brosnans account as usual thank you she said he opened the door for her a pleasure mademoiselle she started back along the frosty pavement feeling suddenly unaccountably cheerful jesus martin and the years have been good to you dillon pulled the glove off his right hand with his teeth and found a pack of cigarettes in his pocket brosnan a yard from the table drawer and the browning high power made a cautious move naughty dillon gestured with the walther sit on the arm of the sofa and put your hands behind your head brosnan did as he was told youre enjoying yourself sean i am so hows that old sod liam devlin these days alive and well still in kilrea outside dublin but then you know that and thats a fact the job at valenton mrs thatcher brosnan said very sloppy sean i mean to go with a couple of bums like the joberts you really must be losing your touch you think so presumably it was a big payday very big dillon said i hope you got your money in advance very funny dillon was beginning to get annoyed one thing does intrigue me brosnan said what you want with me after all these years oh i know all about you dillon said how theyre pumping you for information about me hernu the action service colonel that old bastard ferguson and this girl sidekick of his this captain tanner nothing i dont know ive got the right friends you see martin the kind of people who can access anything really and were they happy when you failed with mrs thatcher just a tryout that just a perhaps ive promised them an alternative target you know how this game works i certainly do and one thing i do know is that the ira doesnt pay for hits never has who said i was working for the ira dillon grinned plenty of other people with enough reason to hit the brits these days brosnan saw it then or thought he did baghdad sorry martin you can go to your maker puzzling over that one for all eternity brosnan said just indulge me a big hit for saddam i mean the war stinks he needs something badly christ you always did run on president bush stays back in washington so that leaves the brits you fail on the best known woman in the world so whats next the prime minister where youre going it doesnt matter son but im right arent i damn you brosnan you always were the clever bastard dillon exploded angrily youll never get away with it brosnan said you think so ill just have to prove you wrong then as i said you must be losing your touch sean this bungled attempt to get mrs thatcher reminds me of a job dear old frank barry pulled back in seventynine when he tried to hit the british foreign secretary lord carrington when he was passing through saintétienne im rather surprised you used the same ground plan but then you always did think barry was special didnt you he was the best and at the end of things very dead brosnan said yes well whoever got him must have given it to him in the back dillon said not true brosnan told him we were facetoface as i recall you killed frank barry dillon whispered well somebody had to brosnan said its what usually happens to mad dogs i was working for ferguson by the way you bastard dillon raised the walther took careful aim and the door opened and annemarie walked in with the shopping bags dillon swung toward her brosnan called look out and went down and dillon fired twice at the sofa annemarie screamed not in terror but in fury dropped her bags and rushed at him dillon tried to fend her off staggered back through the french windows inside brosnan crawled toward the table and reached for the drawer annemarie scratched at dillons face he cursed pushing her away from him she fell against the balustrade and went over backwards brosnan had the drawer open now knocked the lamp on the table sideways plunging the room into darkness and reached for the browning dillon fired three times very fast and ducked for the door brosnan fired twice too late the door banged he got to his feet ran to the terrace and looked over annemarie lay on the pavement below he turned and ran through the drawing room into the hall got the door open and went downstairs two at a time it was snowing when he went out on the steps of dillon there was no sign but the night porter was kneeling beside annemarie he looked up there was a man professor with a gun he ran across the road never mind brosnan sat down and cradled her in his arms an ambulance and hurry the snow was falling quite fast now he held her close and waited ferguson mary and max hernu were having a thoroughly enjoyable time in the magnificent dining room at the ritz they were already on their second bottle of louis roederer crystal champagne and the brigadier was in excellent form who was it who said that when a man tires of champagne hes tired of life he demanded he must certainly have been a frenchman hernu told him very probably but i think the time has come when we should toast the provider of this feast he raised his glass to you mary my love she was about to respond when she saw in the mirror on the wall inspector savary at the entrance speaking to the headwaiter i think youre being paged colonel she told hernu he glanced round whats happened now he got up threaded his way through the tables and approached savary they talked for a few moments glancing toward the table mary said i dont know about you sir but i get a bad feeling before he could reply hernu came back to them his face grave im afraid ive got some rather ugly news dillon ferguson asked he paid a call on brosnan a short while ago what happened ferguson demanded is brosnan all right oh yes there was some gun play dillon got away he sighed heavily but mademoiselle audin is at the hôpital stlouis from what savary tells me it doesnt look good brosnan was in the waiting room on the second floor when they arrived pacing up and down smoking a cigarette his eyes were wild such a rage there as mary tanner had never seen she was the first to reach him im so sorry ferguson said what happened briefly coldly brosnan told them as he finished a tall graying man in surgeons robes came in brosnan turned to him quickly how is she henri he said to the others professor henri dubois a colleague of mine at the sorbonne not good my friend dubois told him the injuries to the left leg and spine are bad enough but even more worrying is the skull fracture theyre just preparing her for surgery now ill operate straight away he went out hernu put an arm around brosnans shoulders lets go and get some coffee my friend i think its going to be a long night but i only drink tea brosnan said his face bone white his eyes dark never could stomach coffee isnt that the funniest thing you ever heard there was a small café for visitors on the ground floor not many customers at that time of night savary had gone off to handle the police side of the business the others sat at a table in the corner ferguson said i know youve got other things on your mind but is there anything you can tell us anything he said to you oh yesplenty hes working for somebody and definitely not the ira hes being paid for this one and from the way he boasted its big money any idea who when i suggested saddam hussein he got angry my guess is you wouldnt have to look much further an interesting point he knew about all of you all of us hernu said youre sure oh yes he boasted about that he turned to ferguson even knew about you and captain tanner being in town to pump me for information thats how he put it he said he had the right friends he frowned trying to remember the phrase exactly the kind of people who can access anything did he indeed ferguson glanced at hernu rather worrying that and youve got another problem he spoke of the thatcher affair as being just a tryout that he had an alternative target go on ferguson said i managed to get him to lose his temper by needling him about what a botchup the valenton thing was i think youll find he intends to have a crack at the british prime minister mary said are you certain oh yes he nodded i baited him about that told him hed never get away with it he lost his temper said hed just have to prove me wrong ferguson looked at hernu and sighed so now we know id better go along to the embassy and alert all our people in london ill do the same here hernu said after all he has to leave the country some time well alert all airports and ferries the usual thing but discreetly of course they got up and brosnan said youre wasting your time you wont get him not in any usual way you dont even know what youre looking for perhaps martin ferguson said but well just have to do our best wont we mary tanner followed them to the door look if you dont need me brigadier id like to stay of course my dear ill see you later she went to the counter and got two cups of tea the french are wonderful she said they always think were crazy to want milk in our tea takes all sorts he said and offered her a cigarette ferguson told me how you got that scar souvenir of old ireland she shrugged he was desperately trying to think of something to say what about your family do they live in london my father was a professor of surgery at oxford he died some time ago cancer my mothers still alive has an estate in herefordshire brothers and sisters i had one brother ten years older than me he was shot dead in belfast in nineteen eighty sniper got him from the divis flats he was a marine commando captain im sorry a long time ago it cant make you particularly well disposed toward a man like me ferguson explained to me how you became involved with the ira after vietnam just another bloody yank sticking his nose in is that what you think he sighed it seemed the right thing to do at the time it really did and dont lets pretend i was up to my neck in it for five long and bloody years and how do you see it now ireland he laughed harshly the way i feel id see it sink into the sea with pleasure he got up come on lets stretch our legs and he led the way out dillon was in the kitchen in the barge heating the kettle when the phone rang makeev said shes in the hôpital stlouis weve had to be discreet in our inquiries but from what my informant can ascertain shes on the critical list sod it dillon said if only shed kept her hands to herself this could cause a devil of a fuss id better come and see you ill be here dillon poured hot water into a basin then he went into the bathroom first he took off his shirt then he got a briefcase from the cupboard under the sink it was exactly as brosnan had forecast inside he had a range of passports all of himself suitably disguised there was also a firstclass makeup kit over the years he had traveled backwards and forwards to england many times frequently through jersey in the channel islands jersey was british soil once there a british citizen didnt need a passport for the flight to the english mainland so a french tourist holidaying in jersey he selected a passport in the name of henri jacaud a car salesman from rennes to go with it he found a jersey driving license in the name of peter hilton with an address in the islands main town of saint helier jersey driving licenses unlike the usual british mainland variety carry a photo it was always useful to have positive identification on you hed learned that years ago nothing better than for people to be able to check the face with a photo and the photos on the driving license and on the french passport were identical that was the whole point he dissolved some black hair dye into the warm water and started to brush it into his fair hair amazing what a difference it made just changing the hair color he blowdried it and brilliantined it back in place then he selected from a range in his case a pair of hornrimmed spectacles slightly tinted he closed his eyes thinking about the role and when he opened them again henri jacaud stared out of the mirror it was quite extraordinary he closed the case put it back in the cupboard pulled on his shirt and went into the stateroom carrying the passport and the driving license at that precise moment makeev came down the companionway good god he said for a moment i thought it was someone else but it is dillon said henri jacaud car salesman from rennes on his way to jersey for a winter break hydrofoil from saintmalo he held up the driving license who is also jersey resident peter hilton accountant in saint helier you dont need a passport to get to london not if youre a jersey resident its british territory the driving license just puts a face to me always makes people feel happier makes them feel they know who you are even the police what happened tonight sean what really happened i decided the time had come to take care of brosnan come on josef he knows me too damned well knows me in a way no one else does and that could be dangerous i can see that a clever one the professor theres more to it than that josef he understands how i make my moves how i think hes the same kind of animal as i am we inhabited the same world and people dont change no matter how much he thinks he has hes still the same underneath the same man who was the most feared enforcer the ira had in the old days so you decided to eliminate him it was an impulse i was passing his place saw the woman leaving he called to her the way it sounded i thought she was gone for the night so i took a chance and went up the scaffolding what happened oh i had the drop on him but didnt kill him dillon laughed went out to the kitchen and returned with a bottle of krug and two glasses as he uncorked it he said come on josef facetoface after all those years there were things to be said you didnt tell him who you were working for of course not dillon lied cheerfully and poured the champagne what do you take me for he toasted makeev who said i mean if he knew you had an alternative target that you intended to go for major he shrugged that would mean that ferguson would know it would render your task in london impossible aroun im sure would want to abort the whole business well he doesnt know dillon drank some more champagne so aroun can rest easy after all i want that second million i checked with zurich by the way the first million has been deposited makeev shifted uncomfortably of course so when do you intend to leave tomorrow or the next day ill see meanwhile something you can organize for me this tania novikova in london ill need her help no problem first my father had a second cousin a belfast man living in london called danny fahy ira yes but not active a deep cover man brilliant with his hands worked in light engineering could turn his hand to anything i used him in nineteen eightyone when i was doing a few jobs for the organization in london in those days he lived at number ten tithe street in kilburn i want novikova to trace him anything else yes ill need somewhere to stay she can organize that for me too she doesnt live in the embassy i suppose no she has a flat off the bayswater road i wouldnt want to stay there not on a regular basis she could be under surveillance special branch at scotland yard have a habit of doing that with employees of the soviet embassy isnt that so oh its not like the old days makeev smiled thanks to that fool gorbachev were all supposed to be friends these days id still prefer to stay somewhere else ill contact her at her flat no more than that there is one problem makeev said as regards hardware explosives weapons anything like that you might need im afraid she wont be able to help you there a handgun perhaps but no more as i mentioned when i first told you about her her boss colonel yuri gatov the commander of kgb station in london is a gorbachev man and very well disposed to our british friends thats all right dillon said i have my own contacts for that kind of thing but i will need more working capital if i am checked going through customs on the jersey to london flight i couldnt afford to be caught with large sums of money in my briefcase im sure aroun can fix that for you thats all right then id like to see him again before i go tomorrow morning i think arrange that will you all right makeev fastened his coat ill keep you posted on the situation at the hospital he reached the bottom of the companionway and turned there is one thing say you managed to pull this thing off it would lead to the most ferocious manhunt how would you intend to get out of england dillon smiled thats exactly what im going to give some thought to now ill see you in the morning makeev went up the companionway dillon poured another glass of krug lit a cigarette and sat at the table looking at the clippings on the walls he reached for the pile of newspapers and sorted through them and finally found what he wanted an old copy of the magazine paris match from the previous year michael aroun was featured on the front cover inside was a sevenpage feature about his lifestyle and habits dillon lit a cigarette and started going through it it was one oclock in the morning and mary tanner was sitting alone in the waiting room when professor henri dubois came in he was very tired shoulders bowed and he sank wearily into a chair and lit a cigarette where is martin he asked her it seems annemaries only close relative is her grandfather martin is trying to contact him do you know him who doesnt mademoiselle one of the richest and most powerful industrialists in france very old eightyeight i believe he was once a patient of mine he had a stroke last year i dont think martin will get very far there he lives on the family estate château vercors its about twenty miles outside paris brosnan came in looking incredibly weary but when he saw dubois he said eagerly how is she i wont pretend my friend shed not good not good at all ive done everything that i possibly can now we wait can i see her leave it for a while ill let you know youll stay oh yes ill grab a couple of hours sleep on my office couch how did you get on with pierre audin i didnt had to deal with his secretary fournier the old mans confined to a wheelchair now doesnt know the time of day dubois sighed i suspected as much ill see you later when hed gone mary said you could do with some sleep yourself he managed a dark smile the way i feel now i dont think i could ever sleep again all my fault in a way there was despair on his face how can you say that who i am or to put it another way what i was if it hadnt been for that none of this would have happened you cant talk like that she said life doesnt work like that the phone on the table rang and she answered it spoke for a few brief moments then put it down just ferguson checking she put a hand on his shoulder come on lie down on the couch just close your eyes ill be here ill wake you the moment theres word reluctantly he lay back and did as he was told and surprisingly did fall into a dark dreamless sleep mary tanner sat there brooding listening to his quiet breathing it was just after three when dubois came in as if sensing his presence brosnan came awake with a start and sat up what is it shes regained consciousness can i see her brosnan got up yes of course as brosnan made for the door dubois put a hand on his arm martin its not good i think you should prepare for the worst no brosnan almost choked its not possible he ran along the corridor opened the door of her room and went in there was a young nurse sitting beside her annemarie was very pale her head so swathed in bandages that she looked like a young nun ill wait outside monsieur the nurse said and left brosnan sat down he reached for her hand and annemarie opened her eyes she stared vacantly at him and then recognition dawned and she smiled martin is that you who else he kissed her hand behind them the door clicked open slightly as dubois peered in your hair too long ridiculously too long she put up a hand to touch it in vietnam in the swamp when the vietcong were going to shoot me you came out of the reeds like some medieval warrior your hair was too long then and you wore a headband she closed her eyes and brosnan said rest now dont try to talk but i must she opened them again let him go martin give me your promise its not worth it i dont want you going back to what you were she grabbed at his hand with surprising strength promise me my word on it he said she lay back staring up at the ceiling my lovely wild irish boy always loved you martin no one else her eyes closed gently the monitoring machine beside the bed changed its tone henry dubois was in the room in a second outside martinwait he pushed brosnan out and closed the door mary was standing in the corridor martin she said he stared at her vacantly and then the door opened and dubois appeared im so sorry my friend im afraid shes gone on the barge dillon came awake instantly when the phone rang makeev said shes dead im afraid thats a shame dillon said it was never intended what now makeev asked i think ill leave this afternoon a good idea in the circumstances what about aroun hell see us at eleven oclock good does he know whats happened no lets keep it that way ill meet you outside the place just before eleven he replaced the phone propped himself up against the pillows annemarie audin a pity about that hed never gone in for killing women an informer once in derry but she deserved it an accident this time but it smacked of bad luck and that made him feel uneasy he stubbed out his cigarette and tried to go to sleep again it was just after ten when mary tanner admitted ferguson and hernu to brosnans apartment how is he ferguson asked hes kept himself busy annemaries grandfather is not well so martins been making all the necessary funeral arrangements with his secretary so soon ferguson said tomorrow in the family plot at vercors she led the way in brosnan was standing at the window staring out he turned to meet them hands in pockets his face pale and drawn well he demanded nothing to report hernu told him weve notified all ports and airports discreetly of course he hesitated we feel it would be better not to go public on this professor mademoiselle audins unfortunate death i mean brosnan seemed curiously indifferent you wont get him londons the place to look and sooner rather than later probably on his way now and for london youll need me you mean youll help us youll come in on this thing ferguson said yes brosnan lit a cigarette opened the french windows and stood on the terrace mary joined him but you cant martin you told me that you promised annemarie i lied he said calmly just to make her going easier theres nothing out there only darkness his face was rock hard the eyes bleak it was the face of a stranger oh my god she whispered ill have him brosnan said if its the last thing i do on this earth ill see him dead six it was just before eleven when makeev drew up before michael arouns apartment in avenue victor hugo his chauffeur drew in beside the curb and as he switched off the engine the door opened and dillon climbed into the rear seat youd better not be wearing designer shoes he said slush everywhere he smiled and makeev reached over to close the partition you seem in good form considering the situation and why shouldnt i be i just wanted to make sure you hadnt told aroun about the audin woman no of course not good dillon smiled i wouldnt like anything to spoil things now lets go and see him rashid opened the door to them a maid took their coats aroun was waiting in the magnificent drawing room valenton mr dillon a considerable disappointment dillon said nothings ever perfect in this life you should know that i promised you an alternative target and i intend to go for it the british prime minister rashid asked thats right dillon nodded im leaving for london later today i thought wed have a chat before i go rashid glanced at aroun who said of course mr dillon now how can we help you first im going to need operating money again thirty thousand dollars i want you to arrange that from someone in london cash naturally colonel makeev can finalize details no problem aroun said secondly theres the question of how i get the hell out of england after the successful conclusion of the venture you sound full of confidence mr dillon rashid told him well you have to travel hopefully son dillon said the thing with any major hit as ive discovered during the years is not so much achieving it as moving on with a whole skin afterwards i mean if i get the british prime minister for you the major problem for me is getting out of england and thats where you come in mr aroun the maid entered with coffee on a tray aroun waited while she laid the cups out on a table and poured as she withdrew he said please explain one of my minor talents is flying i share that with you i understand according to an old paris match article i was reading you bought an estate in normandy called château saint denis about twenty miles south of cherbourg on the coast thats correct the article mentioned how much you loved the place how remote and unspoiled it was a time capsule from the eighteenth century exactly what are we getting at here mr dillon rashid demanded it also said it had its own landing strip and that it wasnt unknown for mr aroun to fly down there from paris when he feels like it piloting his own plane quite true aroun said good this is how it will go then when im close to how shall we put it the final end of things ill let you know youll fly down to this saint denis place ill fly out from england and join you there after the job is done you can arrange my onwards transportation but how rashid demanded where will you find a plane plenty of flying clubs old son and planes to hire ill simply fly off the map disappear put it any way you like as a pilot yourself you must know that one of the biggest headaches the authorities have is the vast amount of uncontrolled airspace once i land at saint denis you can torch the bloody thing up he looked from rashid to aroun are we agreed it was aroun who said absolutely and if there is anything else we can do makeev will let you know ill be going now dillon turned to the door outside he stood on the pavement beside makeevs car the snow falling lightly thats it then we shant be seeing each other not for a while anyway makeev passed him an envelope tanias home address and telephone number he glanced at his watch i couldnt get her earlier this morning i left a message to say i wanted to speak to her at noon fine dillon said ill speak to you from saintmalo before i get the hydrofoil for jersey just to make sure everything is all right ill drop you off makeev told him no thanks i feel like the exercise dillon held out his hand to our next merry meeting good luck sean dillon smiled oh you always need that as well and he turned and walked away makeev spoke to tania on the scrambler at noon i have a friend calling to see you he said possibly late this evening the one weve spoken of ill take care of him colonel youve never handled a more important business transaction he said believe me hell need alternative accommodation by the way make it convenient to your own place of course and i want you to put a trace out on this man he gave her danny fahys details when he was finished she said there should be no problem anything else yes he likes walthers take care my dear ill be in touch when mary tanner went into the suite at the ritz ferguson was having afternoon tea by the window ah there you are he said wondered what was keeping you weve got to get moving to where she demanded back to london she took a deep breath not me brigadier im staying staying he said for the funeral at château vercors at eleven oclock tomorrow morning after all hes going to do what you want him to dont we owe him some support ferguson put up a hand defensively all right youve made your point however i need to go back to london now you can stay if you want and follow tomorrow afternoon ill arrange for the lear jet to pick you up both of you will that suffice i dont see why not she smiled brightly and reached for the teapot another cup brigadier sean dillon caught the express to rennes and changed trains for saintmalo at three oclock there wasnt much tourist traffic the wrong time of the year for that and the atrocious weather all over europe had killed whatever there was there couldnt have been more than twenty passengers on the hydrofoil to jersey he disembarked in saint helier just before six oclock on the albert quay and caught a cab to the airport he knew he was in trouble before he arrived for the closer they got the thicker the fog was it was an old story in jersey but not the end of the world he confirmed that both evening flights to london were canceled went out of the airport building caught another taxi and told the driver to take him to a convenient hotel it was thirty minutes later that he phoned makeev in paris sorry i didnt have a chance to phone from saintmalo the train was late i might have missed the hydrofoil did you contact novikova oh yes makeev told him everything is in order looking forward to meeting you where are you a place called hotel lhorizon in jersey there was fog at the airport im hoping to get out in the morning im sure you will stay in touch ill do that dillon put down the phone then he put on his jacket and went downstairs to the bar hed heard somewhere that the hotels grill was a quite exceptional restaurant after a while he was approached by a handsome energetic italian who introduced himself as the headwaiter augusto dillon took a menu from him gratefully ordered a bottle of krug and relaxed it was at roughly the same time that the doorbell sounded at brosnans apartment on the quai de montebello when he opened the door a large glass of scotch in one hand mary tanner stood there hello he said this is unexpected she took the glass of scotch and emptied it into the potted plant that stood by the door that wont do you any good at all if you say so what do you want i thought youd be alone i didnt think that was a good idea ferguson spoke to you before he left yes he said you were staying over suggested we followed him tomorrow afternoon yes well that doesnt take care of tonight i expect you havent eaten a thing all day so i suggest we go out for a meal and dont start saying no i wouldnt dream of it captain he saluted dont fool around there must be somewhere close by that you like there is indeed let me get a coat and ill be right with you it was a typical little sidestreet bistro simple and unpretentious booths to give privacy and cooking smells from the kitchen that were out of this world brosnan ordered champagne krug she said when the bottle came they know me here always champagne with you i was shot in the stomach years ago it gave me problems the doctors said no spirits under any circumstances no red wine champagne was okay did you notice the name of this place la belle aurore same as the café in casablanca humphrey bogart ingrid bergman he raised his glass heres looking at you kid they sat there in companionable silence for a while and then she said can we talk business why not what do you have in mind what happens next i mean dillon just fades into the woodwork you said that yourself how on earth do you hope to find him one weakness brosnan said he wont go near any ira contacts for fear of betrayal that leaves him with only one choice the usual one he makes the underworld anything he needsweaponry explosives even physical helphell go to the obvious place and you know where that is the east end of london yes just about as romantic as little italy in new york or the bronx the kray brothers the nearest thing england ever had to cinema gangsters the richardson gang do you know much about the east end i thought all that was history not at all a lot of the big men the governors as they call them have gone legitimate to a certain degree but all the oldfashioned crimesholdups banks security vansare committed by roughly the same group all family men who just look upon it as business but theyll shoot you if you get in the way how nice everyone knows who they are including the police its in that fraternity dillon will look for help forgive me she said but that must be rather a closeknit community youre absolutely right but as it happens ive got what you might call the entrée and how on earth do you have that he poured her another glass of champagne back in vietnam in nineteen sixtyeight during my wild and foolish youth i was a paratrooper airborne rangers i formed part of a special forces detachment to operate in cambodia entirely illegally i might add it was recruited from all branches of the services people with specialist qualifications we even had a few marines and thats how i met harry flood harry flood she said and frowned for some reason that names familiar could be ill explain harrys the same age as me born in brooklyn his mother died when he was born he grew up with his father who died when harry was eighteen he joined the marines for something to do went to nam which is where i met him he laughed ill never forget the first time up to our necks in a stinking swamp in the mekong delta he sounds quite interesting oh that and more silver star navy cross in sixtynine when i was getting out harry still had a year of his enlistment to do they posted him to london embassy guard duty he was a sergeant then and thats when it happened what did he met a girl at the old lyceum ballroom one night a girl called jean dark just a nice pretty twentyyearold in a cotton frock only there was one difference the dark family were gangsters what they call in the east end real villains her old man had his own little empire down by the river was in his own way as famous as the kray brothers he died later that year what happened she was totally fascinated jeans mother tried to take over ma dark everyone called her there were differences rival gangs that sort of thing harry and jean got married he took his papers in london stayed on and just got sucked in sorted the rivals out and so on you mean he became a gangster not to put too fine a point on it yes but more than that much more he became one of the biggest governors in the east end of london my god now i remember he has all those casinos hes the man doing all that riverside development on the thames thats right jean died of cancer about five or six years ago her mother died ages before that he just carried on is he british now no never gave up his american nationality the authorities could never toss him out because he has no criminal record never served a single day in jail and hes still a gangster that depends on your definition of the term theres plenty he got away with or his people did in the old days what you might call oldfashioned crime oh you mean nothing nasty like drugs or prostitution just armed robbery protection that sort of thing dont be bitter he has the casinos business interests in electronics and property development he owns half of wapping nearly all the river frontage hes extremely legitimate and still a gangster lets say hes still the governor to a lot of east enders the yank thats what they call him youll like him will i she looked surprised and when are we going to meet as soon as i can arrange it anything that moves in the east end and harry or his people know about it if anyone can help me catch sean dillon he can the waiter appeared and placed bowls of french onion soup before them good he said now lets eat im starving harry flood crouched in one corner of the pit arms folded to conserve his body heat he was naked to the waist barefoot clad only in a pair of camouflage pants the pit was only a few feet square and rain poured down relentlessly through the bamboo grid high above his head sometimes the vietcong would peer down at him visitors being shown the yankee dog who squatted in his own foulness although hed long since grown used to the stench it seemed as if hed been there for ever and time no longer had any meaning he had never felt such total despair it was raining faster now pouring over the edge of the pit in a kind of waterfall the water rising rapidly he was on his feet and yet suddenly it was up to his chest and he was struggling it poured over his head relentlessly and he no longer had a footing and struggled and kicked tokeep afloat fighting for breath clawing at the side of the pit suddenly a hand grabbed his a strong hand and it pulled him up through the water and he started to breathe again he came awake with a start and sat upright hed had that dream for years on and off ever since vietnam and that was a hell of a long time ago it usually ended with him drowning the hand pulling him out was something new he reached for his watch it was almost ten he always had a nap early evening before visiting one of the clubs later but this time hed overslept he put his watch on hurried into the bathroom and had a quick shower there was gray in his black hair now he noticed that as he shaved comes to us all harry he said softly and smiled in fact he smiled most of the time although anyone who observed closely would have noticed a certain worldweariness to it the smile of a man who had found life on the whole disappointing he was handsome enough in a rather hard way muscular with good shoulders in fact not bad for fortysix which he usually told himself at least once a day if only for encouragement he dressed in a black silk shirt buttoned at the neck without a tie and a loose fitting armani suit in dark brown raw silk he checked his appearance in the mirror here we go again baby he said and went out his apartment was enormous part of a warehouse development on cable wharf the brick walls of the sitting room were painted white the wooden floor lacquered indian rugs scattered everywhere comfortable sofas a bar bottles of every conceivable kind ranged behind only for guests he never drank alcohol there was a large desk in front of the rear wall and the wall itself was lined with books he opened the french windows and went on to the balcony overlooking the river it was very cold tower bridge was to his right the tower of london just beyond it floodlit a ship passed down from the pool of london in front of him its lights clear in the darkness so that he could see crew members working on deck it always gave him a lift and he took a great lungful of that cold air the door opened at the far end of the sitting room and mordecai fletcher came in he was six feet tall with irongray hair and a clipped moustache and wore a wellcut doublebreasted blazer and a guards tie the edge was rather taken off his conventional appearance by the scar tissue round the eyes and the flattened nose that had been broken more than once youre up he said flatly isnt that what it looks like flood asked mordecai had been his strong right arm for the best part of fifteen years a useful heavyweight boxer whod had the sense to get out of the ring before his brains were scrambled he went behind the bar poured a perrier water added ice and lemon and brought it over flood took it without thanking him god how i love this old river anything come up your accountant called some papers to sign on that market development i told him to leave them in the morning was that all maurice was on the phone from the embassy he says jack harvey was in for a bite to eat with that bitch of a niece of his myra flood nodded anything happen maurice said harvey asked if youd be in later said hed come back and have a go at the tables he hesitated you know what the bastards after harry and youve been avoiding him we arent selling mordecai and we certainly arent going into partnership jack harveys the worst hood in the east end he makes the kray brothers look like kindergarten stuff i thought that was you harry i never did drugs mordecai didnt run girls you know that okay i was a right villain for a few years we both were he walked into the sitting room to the desk and picked up the photo in its silver frame that always stood there when jean was dying for all those lousy months he shook his head nothing seemed important and you know the promise she made me give her toward the end to get out mordecai closed the window i know harry she was a woman and a half jean thats why i made us legitimate and wasnt i right you know what the firms net worth is nearly fifty million fifty million he grinned so let jack harvey and others like him keep dirtying their hands if they want yes but to most people in the east end youre still the governor harry youre still the yank im not complaining flood opened a cupboard and took out a dark overcoat theres times when it helps a deal along i know that now lets get moving whos driving tonight charlie salter good mordecai hesitated shall i carry a shooter harry for gods sake mordecai were legit now i keep telling you but jack harvey isnt thats the trouble leave jack harvey to me they went down in the old original freight elevator to the warehouse where the black mercedes saloon waited charlie salter leaning against it reading a paper a small wiry man in a gray chauffeurs uniform he folded the paper quickly and got the rear door open where to harry the embassy and drive carefully a lot of frost around tonight and ill have the paper salter got behind the wheel and mordecai got in beside him and reached for the electronic door control the warehouse doors opened and they turned onto the wharf flood opened the paper leaned back and started catching up on how the gulf war was progressing the embassy club was only half a mile away just off wapping high street it had only been open six months another of harry floods developments of old warehouse property the car park was up a side street at the rear and was already quite full there was an old negro in charge who sat in a small hut kept your place free mr flood he said coming out flood got out of the car with mordecai and took out his wallet as salter went off to park he extracted a fivepound note and gave it to the old man dont go crazy freddy with this the old man smiled wouldnt even buy me a woman at the back of the pub these days inflations a terrible thing mr flood flood and mordecai were laughing as they went up the side street and salter caught up with them as they turned the corner and reached the entrance inside it was warm and luxurious black and white tiles on the floor oak paneling oil paintings as the cloakroom girl took their coats a small man in evening dress hurried to meet them his accent was unmistakeably french ah mr flood a great pleasure will you be dining i should think so maurice well just have a look round first any sign of harvey not yet they went down the steps into the main dining room the club atmosphere continued paneled walls paintings table booths with leather seats the place was almost full waiters working busily a trio played on a small dais in one corner and there was a dance floor though not large maurice threaded his way through the tables by the floor and opened a door in quilted leather that led to the casino part of the premises it was just as crowded in there people jostling each other at the roulette wheel the chairs occupied at most of the tables we losing much flood asked maurice swings and roundabouts mr flood it all balances out as usual plenty of punters anyway and not an arab in sight mordecai said theyre keeping their heads down maurice told him what with the gulf business wouldnt you flood grinned come on lets go and eat he had his own booth in a corner to one side of the band overlooking the floor he ordered smoked salmon and scrambled eggs and more perrier water he took a camel cigarette from an old silver case english cigarettes were something hed never been able to come to terms with mordecai gave him a light and leaned against the wall flood sat there brooding surveying the scene experiencing one of those dark moments when you wondered what life was all about and charlie salter came down the steps from the entrance and hurried through the tables jack harvey and myrajust in he said harvey was fifty years of age of medium height and overweight a fact that the navy blue barathea suit failed to hide in spite of having been cut in savile row he was balding hardly any hair there at all and he had the fleshy decadent face of the wrong sort of roman emperor his niece myra was thirty and looked younger her jetblack hair caught up in a bun and held in place by a diamond comb there was little makeup on her face except for the lips and they were blood red she wore a sequined jacket and black miniskirt by gianni versace and very highheeled black shoes for she was only a little over five feet tall she looked immensely attractive men turning to stare at her she was also her uncles right hand had a degree in business studies from london university and was just as ruthless and unscrupulous as he was flood didnt get up just sat there waiting harry my old son harvey said and sat down dont mind if we join you do you myra leaned down and kissed flood on the cheek like my new perfume harry cost a fortune but jack says its like an aphrodisiac the smells so good thats a big word for you isnt it flood said she sat on his other side and harvey took out a cigar he clipped it and looked up at mordecai come on wheres your bleeding lighter then mordecai took out his lighter and flicked it without a change of expression and myra said any chance of a drink we know you dont harry but think about the rest of us poor sods her voice had a slight cockney accent not too much and it had its own attraction she put a hand on his knee and flood said champagne cocktail isnt that what you like itll do to be going on with not me cant drink that kind of piss harvey said scotch and water a big one maurice who had been hovering spoke to a waiter then whispered in floods ear your scrambled eggs mr flood ill have them now flood told him maurice turned away and a moment later a waiter appeared with a silver salver he removed the dome and put the plate in front of flood who got to work straight away harvey said ive never seen you eat a decent meal yet harry whats wrong with you nothing really flood told him food doesnt mean much to me jack when i was a kid in vietnam the vietcong had me prisoner for a while i learned you could get by on very little later on i was shot in the gut lost eighteen inches of my intestines youll have to show me your scar sometime myra said theres always a silver lining if i hadnt been shot the marine corps wouldnt have posted me to that nice soft job as a guard at the london embassy and you wouldnt have met jean harvey said i remember the year you married her harry the year her old dad died sam dark he shook his head he was like an uncrowned king in the east end after the krays got put inside and jean he shook his head again what a goer the boys were queuing up for her there was even a guards officer a lord he turned to myra straight up and instead she married me flood said could have done worse harry i mean you helped her keep things going a treat especially after her mum died we all know that flood pushed his plate away and wiped his mouth with a napkin compliments night is it jack now what have you really come for you know what i want harry i want in the casinos four of them now and how many clubs myra six she said and all this development on the river harvey went on youve got to share the cake theres only one trouble with that jack flood told him im a legitimate businessman have been for a long time whereas you he shook his head once a crook always a crook you yank bastard harvey said you cant talk to me like that i just did jack were in harry whether you like it or not try me flood said salter had drifted across the room and leaned against the wall beside mordecai the big man whispered to him and salter moved away myra said he means it harry so be reasonable all were asking for is a piece of the action you come in with me youre into computers building development clubs and gambling flood told her which means im in with you into pimps whores drugs and protection i shower three times a day sweetness and it still wouldnt make me feel clean you yank bastard she raised her hand and he grabbed her wrist harvey stood up let it go myra let it go come on ill be seeing you harry i hope not flood told him they went out and mordecai leaned down hes a disgusting piece of slime always turned my stomach him and his boyfriends takes all sorts flood said dont let your prejudices show mordecai and get me a cup of coffee the swine jack harvey said as he and myra walked along the pavement toward the car park ill see him in hell talking to me that way i told you we were wasting our time she said right he eased his gloves over his big hands have to show him we mean business then wont we a dark van was parked at the end of the street as they approached the side lights were turned on the young man who leaned out from behind the wheel was about twentyfive hard and dangerouslooking in a black leather bomber jacket and flat cap mr harvey he said good boy billy right on time harvey turned to his niece i dont think youve met billy watson myra no i dont think i have she said looking him over how many have you got in the back harvey demanded four mr harvey i heard this mordecai fletcher was a bit of an animal he picked up a baseball bat this should cool him no shooters like i told you yes mr harvey flesh on flesh thats all it needs and maybe a couple of broken legs get on with it hell have to come out sooner or later harvey and myra continued along the pavement five she said you think thats enough enough he laughed harshly who does he think he is sam dark now he was a man but this bloody yank theyll cripple him put him on sticks for six months theyre hard boys myra really she said now come on and lets get out of this bleeding cold and he turned into the car park it was an hour later that harry flood got ready to leave as the cloakroom girl helped him on with his coat he said to mordecai wheres charlie oh i gave him the nod a couple of minutes ago he went ahead to get the car warmed up i mean its spawn of the north time out there harry well have the bleeding thames freezing over next flood laughed and they went down the steps and started along the pavement when it happened it was very quick the rear doors of the van parked on the other side of the road swinging open the men inside rushing out and crossing the road on the run they all carried baseball bats the first to reach them swung hard mordecai ducked inside blocked the blow and pitched him over his hip down the steps of the basement area behind the other four paused and circled bats ready that wont do you any good billy watson said its legbreaking time there was a shot behind them loud in the frosty air and then another as they turned charlie salter moved out of the darkness reloading a sawedoff shotgun now drop em he said unless you want to be jam all over the pavement they did as they were told and stood there waiting for what was to come mordecai moved close and looked them over then he grabbed the nearest one by the hair who are you working for sonny i dont know mister mordecai turned him and ran him up against the railings holding his face just above the spikes i said who are you working for the youth cracked instantly jack harvey it was just a wages job it was billy who pulled us in billy said you bastard ill get you for that mordecai glanced at flood who nodded the big man said to billy you stay the rest of you piss off they turned and ran for it billy watson stood looking at them his face wild salter said he needs a good slapping this one billy suddenly picked up one of the baseball bats and raised it defensively all right lets be having you harry floodbig man no bloody good on your own are you mate mordecai took a step forward and flood said no and moved in himself all right son billy swung flood swayed to one side found the right wrist twisting billy cried out and dropped the baseball bat and in the same moment the american halfturned striking him hard across the face with his elbow sending him down on one knee mordecai picked up the baseball bat no hes got the point lets get going flood said he lit a cigarette as they went along the street mordecai said what about harvey you going to stitch him up ill think about it flood said and they moved across to the car park billy watson got himself together held onto the railings for a while it was snowing a little as he turned and limped across the road to the van as he went round to the drivers side myra harvey stepped out of the entrance of a narrow alley holding the collar of her fur coat up around her neck well that didnt go too well did it miss harvey he croaked i thought youd gone after my uncle dropped me off i got a taxi back i wanted to see the fun here he said are you telling me you expected it to go like it did im afraid so sunshine my uncle gets it wrong sometimes lets his emotions get the better of him you really think five young punks like you could walk all over harry flood she opened the drivers door and pushed him in go on get over ill drive she climbed behind the wheel the fur coat opened and the miniskirt went about as high as it could as she switched on billy said but where are we going back to my place what you need is a nice hot bath sunshine her left hand squeezed his thigh hard and she drove away seven the flight from jersey got into heathrow terminal one just after eleven the following morning it took half an hour for dillons case to come through and he sat smoking and reading the paper while he waited the war news was good for the coalition forces a few pilots down in iraq but the airstrikes were having a terrible effect his case came and he walked through there was a rush of customers as several planes had come in at around the same time customs didnt seem to be stopping anyone that morning not that theyd have found anything on him his suitcase contained a change of clothes and toilet articles no more and there were only a couple of newspapers in the briefcase he also had two thousand dollars in his wallet which was in twenty hundreddollar bills nothing wrong with that hed destroyed the french passport at the hotel in jersey no turning back now when he went back to france it would be very definitely a different route and until then the jersey driving license in the name of peter hilton was all the identification he needed he took the escalator to the upper concourse and joined the queue at one of the bank counters changing five hundred dollars for sterling he repeated the exercise at three other banks then went downstairs to get a taxi whistling softly to himself he told the driver to drop him at paddington station where he left the suitcase in a locker he phoned tania novikova on the number makeev had given him just on the chance she was at home and got her answering machine he didnt bother to leave a message but went out and hailed a cab and told the driver to take him to covent garden in his tinted glasses striped tie and navy blue burberry trenchcoat he looked thoroughly respectable the driver said terrible weather guv i reckon were going to see some real heavy snow soon i shouldnt be surprised dillons accent was impeccable public school english you live in london guv no just in town for a few days on business ive been abroad for some time dillon said glibly new york havent been in london for years a lot of changes not like it used to be so i believe i was reading the other day that you cant take a walk up downing street anymore thats right guv mrs thatcher had a new security system installed gates at the end of the street really dillon said id like to see that well go that way if you like i can take you down to whitehall then cut back to covent garden suits me dillon sat back lit a cigarette and watched they moved down whitehall from trafalgar square past horse guards with the two household cavalrymen on mounted duty wearing greatcoats against the cold sabers drawn must be bleeding cold for the horses the cabby said and then added here we are guv downing street he slowed a little cant stop if you do the coppers come up and ask you what youre doing dillon looked across at the end of the street so those are the famous gates thatchers folly some twerps call it but if you ask me she was usually right the bloody ira have pulled off enough stunts in london during the past few years id shoot the lot of them i would if i drop you in long acre will that do guv fine dillon told him and sat back thinking about those rather magnificent gates at the end of downing street the taxi pulled into the curb and dillon gave him a tenpound note keep it he said turned and walked briskly away along langley street the whole covent garden area was as busy as usual people dressed for the extreme cold more like moscow than london dillon went with the throng and finally found what he wanted in an alley near neals yard a small theatrical shop the window full of old costume masks and makeup a bell tinkled when he went in the man who appeared through a curtain at the rear was about seventy with snowwhite hair and a round fleshy face and what can i do for you he asked some makeup i think what have you got in boxes some very good kits here the old boy said he took one down and opened it on the counter they use these at the national theatre in the business are you amateur thats all im afraid church players dillon checked the contents of the box excellent ill take an extra lipstick bright red some black hair dye and also some solvent you are going to town claytons my name by the way ill give you my card in case you ever need anything else he got the required items and put them inside the makeup box and closed it thirty quid for cash and dont forget anything you need i wont dillon said and went out whistling in the village of vercors it was snowing as the cortege drove down from the chateau in spite of the weather villagers lined the street men with their caps off as annemarie audin went to her final rest there were only three cars behind the hearse old pierre audin and his secretary in the first a number of servants in the other brosnan and mary tanner with max hernu following walked up through the tombstones and paused as the old man was lifted from the car into his wheelchair he was pushed inside the rest followed it was very old a typical village church whitewashed walls the stations of the cross and it was cold very cold in fact brosnan had never felt so cold and sat there shaking slightly hardly aware of what was being said rising and kneeling obediently with everyone else it was only when the service ended and they stood as the pallbearers carried the coffin down the aisle that he realized that mary tanner was holding his hand they walked through the graveyard to the family mausoleum it was the size of a small chapel built in gray granite and marble with a steep gothic roof the oaken doors stood open the priest paused to give the final benediction the coffin was taken inside the secretary turned the wheelchair and pushed it down the path past them the old man huddled over a rug across his knees i feel so sorry for him mary said no need he doesnt know what time of day it is brosnan told her thats not always true she walked to the car and put a hand on the old mans shoulder as he sat there in his wheelchair then she returned so my friends back to paris hernu said and then london brosnan said mary took his arm as they walked toward the car tomorrow martin tomorrow morning will be soon enough and i wont take no for an answer all right he said tomorrow it is and he got in the rear of the car and leaned back suddenly drained and closed his eyes mary sitting beside him as hernu drove away it was just after six when tania novikova heard the doorbell she went downstairs and opened the door dillon stood there suitcase in one hand briefcase in the other josef sends his regards she was amazed since makeev had spoken to her she had accessed kgb files in london to discover as much about dillon as she could and had been astonished at his record she had expected some kind of dark hero instead she had a small man in a trenchcoat with tinted glasses and a college tie you are sean dillon she said as ever was youd better come in women had never been of great importance to dillon they were there to satisfy a need on occasions but he had never felt the slightest emotional involvement with one following tania novikova up the stairs he was aware that she had a good figure and that the black trouser suit became her her hair was caught up at the nape of the neck in a velvet bow but when she turned to him in the full light of her sitting room he realized that she was really rather plain you had a good trip she asked all right i was delayed in jersey last night because of fog would you like a drink tea would be fine she opened a drawer produced a walther two spare clips and a carswell silencer your preferred weapon according to josef definitely also i thought this might come in useful she handed him a small bundle they say it can stop a bullet at pointblank range nylon and titanium dillon unfolded it nothing like as bulky as a flak jacket it was designed like a small waistcoat and fastened with velcro tabs excellent he said and put it in his briefcase together with the walther and the silencer he unbuttoned his trenchcoat lit a cigarette and stood in the kitchen door and watched her make the tea youre very convenient for the soviet embassy here oh yes walking distance she brought the tea out on a tray ive fixed you up with a room in a small hotel just round the corner in the bayswater road its the sort of place commercial travelers overnight at fine he sipped his tea to business what about fahy no luck so far he moved from kilburn a few years ago to a house in finchley only stayed there a year and moved again thats where ive drawn a blank but ill find him ive got someone on his case you must its essential does kgbs london station still have a forgery department of course good he took out his jersey driving license i want a private pilots license in the same name and address youll need a photo he slipped a finger inside the plastic cover of the license and pulled out a couple of identical prints always useful to have a few of these she took one of them peter hilton jersey can i ask why this is necessary because when the right time comes time to get the hell out of it i want to fly and they wont hire a plane to you unless you have a license issued by the civil aviation authority he helped himself to some more tea tell your expert i want full instrument rating and twinengine ill write that down she opened her handbag took out an envelope slipped the photo inside and made a note on the cover is there anything else yes id like full details of the present security system at number ten downing street she caught her breath am i to take it that is your target not as such the man inside but thats a different thing the prime ministers daily schedule how easy is it to access that it depends what you want there are always fixed points in the day question time in the house of commons for example of course things are different because of the gulf the war cabinet meets every morning at ten oclock at downing street oh yes in the cabinet room but he has other appointments during the day only yesterday he did a broadcast on british forces network to the troops in the gulf was that from bbc no they have their own headquarters at bridge house thats near paddington station and not too far from here interesting i wonder what his security was like not much believe me a few detectives no more than that the british are crazy a damn good job they are this informant of yours the one who got you all the information on ferguson tell me about him which she did and when she was finished he nodded youve got him well and truly by the cobblers then i think you could say that lets keep it that way he got up and buttoned his coat id better go and book in at this hotel have you eaten she asked no i have a suggestion just along from the hotel is an excellent italian restaurent luigis one of those little familyowned places you get settled in at the hotel and ill walk along to the embassy ill check on what we have on the downing street defences and see if anythings turned up on fahy and the flying license ill put that in hand twentyfour hours all right she got a coat and scarf went downstairs with him and they left together the pavements were frosty and she carried his briefcase for him and held on to his arm until they reached the hotel ill see you in an hour she said and moved on it was the sort of place which had been a thriving pub and hotel in late victorian times the present owners had done their best with it and that wasnt very much the dining room to the left of the foyer was totally uninviting no more than half a dozen people eating there the desk clerk was an old man with a face like a skull who wore a faded brown uniform he moved with infinite slowness booking dillon in and gave him his key guests were obviously expected to carry their own cases the room was exactly what hed expected twin beds cheap coverings a shower room a television with a slot for coins and a kettle a little basket beside it containing sachets of coffee teabags and powdered milk still it wouldnt be for long and he opened his suitcase and unpacked among jack harveys interests was a funeral business in whitechapel it was a sizeable establishment and did well for as he liked to joke the dead were always with us it was an imposing threestoreyed victorian building which hed had renovated myra had the top floor as a penthouse and took an interest in the running of the place harvey had an office on the first floor harvey told his driver to wait went up the steps and rang the bell the night porter answered my niece in harvey demanded i believe so mr harvey harvey moved through the main shop with coffins on display and along the passage with the little chapels of rest on each side where relatives could view the bodies he went up two flights of stairs and rang the bell on myras door she was ready for him alerted by a discreet call from the porter let him wait for a moment then opened the door uncle jack he brushed past her she was wearing a gold sequined minidress black stockings and shoes you going out or something he demanded a disco actually well never mind that now you saw the accountants is there any way i can get at flood legally any problems with leases anything not a chance myra said weve gone through the lot with a finetooth comb theres nothing right then ill just have to get him the hard way that didnt exactly work last night did it i used rubbish thats why a bunch of young jerks who didnt deserve the time of day so what do you intend ill think of something as he turned to the door he heard a movement in the bedroom here whos in there he flung the door open and revealed billy watson standing there looking hunted jesus harvey said to myra disgusting all you can ever think of is a bit of the other at least we do it the right way she told him screw you he said no hell do that harvey stormed downstairs billy said you dont give a monkeys for anyone do you billy love this is the house of the dead she said and picked up her fur coat and handbag theyre lying in their coffins downstairs and were alive simple as that so make the most of it now lets get going dillon was sitting in a small booth in the corner at luigis drinking the only champagne available a very reasonable bollinger nonvintage when tania came in old luigi greeted her personally and as a favored customer and she sat down champagne dillon asked why not she looked up at luigi well order later one thing that hasnt been mentioned is my operating money thirty thousand dollars aroun was to arrange that dillon said its taken care of the man in question will be in touch with me tomorrow some accountant of arouns in london okay so what have you got for me he asked nothing on fahy yet ive set the wheels in motion as regards the flying license and number ten ive had a look at the file the public always had a right of way along downing street the ira coming so close to blowing up the whole cabinet at the tory party conference in brighton the other year made for a change in thinking about security the bombing campaign in london and attacks on individuals accelerated things so well the public used to be able to stand at the opposite side of the road from number ten watching the great and the good arrive and depart but no longer in december eightynine mrs thatcher ordered new security measures in effect the place is now a fortress the steel railings are ten feet high the gates by the way are neovictorian a nice touch that from the iron lady yes i saw them today luigi hovered anxiously and they broke off and ordered minestrone veal chops sauté potatoes and a green salad tania carried on there were accusations in some quarters that shed become the victim of paranoid delusions nonsense of course that lady has never been deluded about anything in her life anyway on the other side of the gates theres a steel screen designed to come up fast if an unauthorized vehicle tries to get through and the building itself the windows have specially strengthened glass and that includes the georgian windows oh and the net curtains are definitely a miracle of modern science theyre blastproof you certainly have the facts incredibly everything ive told you has been reported in either a british newspaper or magazine the british press puts its own right to publish above every other consideration they just refuse to face up to security implications on file at the clippings library of any major british newspaper youll find details of the interior of number ten or the prime ministers country home chequers or even buckingham palace what about getting in as ancillary staff that used to be a real loophole most catering for functions is done by outside firms and some of the cleaning but theyre very tough about security clearance for these people there are always slipups of course there was a plumber working on the chancellor of the exchequers home at number eleven who opened a door and found himself wandering about number ten trying to get out it sounds like a french farce only recently staff from one of the outside firms employed to offer cleaning services of one kind or another staff who had security clearance were found to be operating under false identities some of them had clearance for the home office and other ministries yes but all youre saying is mistakes occur thats right she hesitated have you anything particular in mind you mean potshots with a snipers rifle from a rooftop two hundred yards away as he comes out of the door i dont think so no i really have no firm idea at the moment but ill come up with something i always do the waiter brought their soup dillon said now that smells good enough to eat lets do just that afterwards he walked her round to her door it was snowing just a little and very cold he said must remind you of home this weather home she looked blank for a moment then laughed moscow you mean she shrugged its been a long time would you like to come up no thanks its late and i could do with the sleep ill stay at the hotel tomorrow morning lets say till noon from what i saw i dont think i could stand the thought of lunch there ill be back after two so youll know where ill be fine she said ill say good night then she closed the door dillon turned and walked away it was only after he rounded the corner into the bayswater road that gordon brown moved out of the shadows of a doorway opposite and looked up at tanias window the light came on he stayed there for a while longer then turned and walked away in paris the following morning the temperature went up three or four degrees and it started to thaw mary and hernu in the colonels black citroën picked brosnan up just before noon he was waiting for them in the entrance of the quai de montebello apartment block he wore his trenchcoat and a tweed cap and carried a suitcase the driver put the case in the trunk and brosnan got in the rear with the other two any news he asked not a thing the colonel told him like i said hes probably there already what about ferguson mary glanced at her watch hes due to see the prime minister now to alert him as to the seriousness of this whole business about all he can do brosnan said that and spread the word to the other branches of the security services and how would you handle it my friend hernu asked we know he worked in london for the ira in nineteen eightyone as i told mary he must have used underworld contacts to supply his needs he always does and it will be the same this time thats why i must see my old friend harry flood ah yes the redoubtable mr flood captain turner was telling me about him but what if he cant help theres another way i have a friend in ireland just outside dublin at kilrea liam devlin theres nothing he doesnt know about ira history in the last few years and who did what its a thought he lit a cigarette and leaned back but ill get the bastard one way or another ill get him the driver took them to the end of the charles de gaulle terminal where the private planes parked the lear was waiting on the tarmac there was no formality everything had been arranged the driver took their cases across to where the second pilot waited hernu said captain if i may presume he kissed mary lightly on both cheeks and you my friend he held out his hand always remember that when you set out on a journey with revenge at the end of it it is necessary to first dig two graves philosophy now brosnan said and at your time of life goodbye colonel they strapped themselves into their seats the second pilot pulled up the stairs locked the door and went and joined his companion in the cockpit hernu is right you know mary said i know he is brosnan answered but theres nothing i can do about that i understand believe me i do she said as the plane rolled forward when ferguson was shown into the study at number ten the prime minister was standing at the window drinking a cup of tea he turned and smiled the cup that refreshes brigadier they always say it was tea that got us through the war prime minister well as long as it gets me through my present schedule weve a meeting of the war cabinet at ten every morning as you know and all the other pressing matters to do with the gulf and the daytoday running of the country ferguson said yes well we do our best no one ever said politics was easy brigadier he put down the cup ive read your latest report you think it likely the man dillon is here somewhere in london from what he said to brosnan i think we must assume that prime minister youve alerted all branches of the security services of course but we cant put a face to him you see oh theres the description small fair haired and so on but as brosnan says hell look entirely different by now its been suggested to me that perhaps some press coverage might be useful ferguson said well its a thought but i doubt it would achieve anything what could they say in furtherance of an enquiry the police would like to contact a man named sean dillon who isnt called that anymore as regards a description we dont know what he looks like and if we did he wouldnt look like that anyway my goodness you carried that off beautifully brigadier the prime minister roared with laughter of course there could be more lurid headlines ira jackal stalks the prime minister no im not having any of that nonsense the prime minister said firmly by the way as regards the suggestion that saddam hussein might be behind this affair i must tell you your other colleagues in the intelligence services disagree they are firmly of the opinion this is an ira matter and i must tell you that is how they are pursuing it well if special branch think theyll find him by visiting irish pubs in kilburn thats their privilege there was a knock at the door an aide came in were due at the savoy in fifteen minutes prime minister john major smiled with great charm another of those interminable luncheons brigadier prawn cocktail to start and chicken salad to follow ferguson said find him brigadier the prime minister told him find him for me and the aide showed ferguson out tania with good news for dillon knew there was no point in calling at the hotel before two so she went to her flat as she was looking for her key in her handbag gordon brown crossed the road i was hoping i might catch you he said for gods sake gordon you must be crazy and what happens when something important comes up and you need to know cant wait for you to get in touch it might be too late so id better come in hadnt i you cant im due back at the embassy in thirty minutes ill have a drink with you thats all she turned and walked down to the pub on the corner before he could argue they sat in a corner of the snug pub which was empty aware of the noise from the main bar brown had a beer and tania a vodka and lime what have you got for me she asked shouldnt the question be the other way about she got up at once and he put a hand on her arm im sorry dont go then behave yourself she sat down again now get on with it ferguson had a meeting with the prime minister just before twelve he was back in the office at twelvethirty before i finished the first half of my shift he dictated a report to alice johnson shes one of the confidential typists who works with me the report was for the file did you get a copy no but i did the same as last time took it along to his office for her and read it on the way captain tanner stayed in paris with brosnan for the funeral of a french woman annemarie audin she prompted him theyre flying in today brosnan has promised full cooperation oh all the other branches of the intelligence services have been notified about dillon no newspaper coverage on the pms instructions the impression i got was hes told ferguson to get on with it good she said very good but you must stay on the case gordon i have to go she started to get up and he caught her wrist i saw you last night about eleven it was coming back to your flat with a man you were watching my flat i often do on my way home her anger was very real but she restrained it then if you were there youll know that the gentleman in question a colleague from the embassy didnt come in he simply escorted me home now let me go gordon she pulled free and walked out and brown thoroughly depressed went to the bar and ordered another beer when she knocked on the door of dillons room just after two he opened it at once she brushed past him and went inside you look pleased with yourself he said i should be dillon lit a cigarette go on tell me first ive had words with my mole at group four fergusons just been to see the prime minister they believe youre here and all branches of intelligence have been notified brosnan and the tanner woman are coming in from paris brosnans offered full cooperation and ferguson the prime minister said no press publicity just told him to go all out to get you its nice to be wanted second she opened her handbag and took out a passportstyle booklet one pilots license as issued by the civil aviation authority to one peter hilton thats bloody marvelous dillon said and took it from her yes the man who does this kind of thing pulled out all the stops i told him all your requirements he said hed give you a commercial license apparently youre also an instructor dillon checked his photo and rifled through the pages excellent couldnt be better and thats not the end she said you wanted to know the whereabouts of one daniel maurice fahy youve found him thats right but he doesnt live in london ive brought you a road map she unfolded it he has a farm here at a place called cadge end in sussex its twentyfive to thirty miles from london you take the road through dorking toward horsham then head into the wilds how do you know all this the operative i put on the job managed to trace him late yesterday afternoon by the time hed looked the place over then dropped into the pub in the local village to make a few enquiries it was very late he didnt get back to london until after midnight i got his report this morning and he says the farm is very out of the way near a river called the arun marsh country the village is called doxley the farm is a mile south of it theres a signpost he is efficient your man well hes young and trying to prove himself from what he heard in the pub fahy runs a few sheep and dabbles in agricultural machinery dillon nodded that makes sense one thing that might come as a surprise he has a girl staying with him his grandniece it seems my man saw her and what did he say that she came into the pub for some bottles of beer about twenty angel they called her angel fahy he said she looked like a peasant wonderful he got up and reached for his jacket i must get down there right away do you have a car yes but its only a mini easier parking in london no problem as you said thirty miles at the most i can borrow it then of course its in the garage at the end of my street ill show you he put on his trenchcoat opened the briefcase took out the walther rammed a clip in the bolt and put it in his lefthand pocket the silencer he put in the right just in case he said and they went out the car was in fact a minicooper which meant performance jet black with a gold trim excellent he said ill get moving he got behind the wheel and she said whats so important about fahy hes an engineer who can turn his hand to anything a bomb maker of genius and hes been in deep cover for years he helped me when i last operated here in eightyone helped me a lot it also helps that he was my fathers second cousin i knew him when i was a kid over here you havent mentioned the cash from aroun by the way ive to pick it up this evening at six all very dramatic a mercedes stops at the corner of brancaster street and town drive thats not far from here i say its cold even for this time of the year and the driver hands me a briefcase god help us he must have been seeing too much television dillon said ill be in touch and he drove away ferguson had stopped off at his office at the ministry of defence after downing street to bring the report on the dillon affair file up to date and clear his desk generally as always he preferred to work at the flat so he returned to cavendish square had kim prepare him a late lunch of scrambled eggs and bacon and was browsing through his times when the doorbell rang a moment later kim showed in mary tanner and brosnan my dear martin ferguson got up and shook hands so here we are again so it would seem brosnan said everything go off all right at the funeral ferguson asked as funerals go it went brosnan said harshly and lit a cigarette so where are we whats happening ive seen the prime minister again theres to be no press publicity i agree with him there brosnan said it would be pointless all relevant intelligence agencies plus special branch of course have been notified theyll do what they can which isnt very much brosnan said another point mary put in i know hes threatened the prime minister but we dont have a clue what he intends or when he could be up to something this very evening for all we know brosnan shook his head no i think therell be more to it than that these things take time i should know so where will you start ferguson asked with my old friend harry flood when dillon was here in eightyone he probably used underworld contacts to supply his needs harry may be able to dig something out and if not then ill borrow that lear jet of yours again fly to dublin and have words with liam devlin ah yes ferguson said who better when dillon went to london in nineteen eightyone he must have been under someones orders if devlin could find out who that could be a lead to all sorts sounds logical to me so youll see flood tonight i think so where are you staying with me mary said at lowndes square fergusons eyebrows went up really come on brigadier dont be an old fuddyduddy ive got four bedrooms remember each with its own bathroom and professor brosnan can have one with a lock on the inside of his door brosnan laughed come on lets get out of here see you later brigadier they used fergusons car she closed the sliding window between them and the driver and said dont you think youd better ring your friend let him know youd like to see him i suppose so ill need to check his number she took a notebook from her handbag i have it here its exdirectory there you go cable wharf thats in wapping very efficient and heres a phone she handed him the car phone you do like to be in charge he said and dialed the number it was mordecai fletcher who answered brosnan said harry flood please who wants him martin brosnan the professor this is mordecai we havent heard from you for whatthree or four years christ but hes going to be pleased a moment later a voice said martin harry i dont believe it youve come back to haunt me you bastard eight for dillon in the minicooper the run from london went easily enough although there was a light covering of snow on the fields and hedgerows the roads were perfectly clear and not particularly busy he was in dorking within half an hour he passed straight through and continued toward horsham finally pulling into a petrol station about five miles outside as the attendant was topping up the tank dillon got his road map out place called doxley you know it half a mile up the road on your right a signpost says grimethorpe thats the airfield but before you get there youll see a sign to doxley so its not far from here three miles maybe but it might as well be the end of the world the attendant chuckled as he took the notes dillon gave him not much there mister thought id take a look friend told me there might be a weekend cottage going if there is i havent heard of it dillon drove away came to the grimethorpe sign within a few minutes followed the narrow road and found the doxley sign as the garage man had indicated the road was even narrower high banks blocking the view until he came to the brow of a small hill and looked across a desolate landscape powdered with snow there was the occasional small wood a scattering of hedged fields and then flat marshland drifting toward a river which had to be the arun beside it perhaps a mile away he saw houses twelve or fifteen with red pantiled roofs and there was a small church obviously doxley he started down the hill to the wooded valley below and as he came to it saw a fivebarred gate standing open and a decaying wooden sign with the legend cadge end farm the track led through the wood and brought him almost at once to a farm complex there were a few chickens running here and there a house and two large barns linked to it so that the whole enclosed a courtyard it looked incredibly rundown as if nothing had been done to it for years but then as dillon knew many country people preferred to live like that he got out of the mini and crossed to the front door knocked and tried to open it it was locked he turned and went to the first barn its old wooden doors stood open there was a morris van in there and a ford car jacked up on bricks no wheels agricultural implements all over the place dillon took out a cigarette as he lit it in cupped hands a voice behind said who are you what do you want he turned and found a girl in the doorway she wore baggy trousers tucked into a pair of rubber boots a heavy rollneck sweater under an old anorak and a knitted beret like a tam o shanter the kind of thing you found in fishing villages on the west coast of ireland she was holding a doublebarreled shotgun threateningly as he took a step toward her she thumbed back the hammer you stay there the irish accent was very pronounced youll be the one they call angel fahy he said angela if its any of your business tanias man had been right she did look like a little peasant broad cheekbone upturned nose and a kind of fierceness there would you really shoot with that thing if i had to a pity that and me only wanting to meet my fathers cousin once removed danny fahy she frowned and who in the hell might you be mister dillons the name sean dillon she laughed harshly thats a damn lie youre not even irish and sean dillon is dead everyone knows that dillon dropped into the hard distinctive accent of belfast to steal a great mans line girl dear all i can say is reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated the gun went slack in her hands mother mary are you sean dillon as ever was appearances can be deceiving oh god she said uncle danny talks about you all the time but it was always like stories nothing real to it at all and here you are where is he he did a repair on a car for the landlord of the local pub took it down there an hour ago said hed walk back but hell be there a while yet drinking i shouldnt wonder at this time isnt the pub closed until evening that might be the law mr dillon but not in doxley they never close lets go and get him then she left the shotgun on a bench and got into the mini beside him as they drove away he said whats your story then i was raised on a farm in galway my da was dannys nephew michael he died six years ago when i was fourteen after a year my mother married again let me guess dillon said you didnt like your stepfather and he didnt like you something like that uncle danny came over for my fathers funeral so id met him and liked him when things got too heavy i left home and came here he was great about it wrote to my mother and she agreed i could stay glad to get rid of me there was no selfpity at all and dillon warmed to her they always say some good comes out of everything ive been working it out she said if youre dannys second cousin and im his greatniece then you and i are blood related isnt that a fact dillon laughed in a manner of speaking she looked ecstatic as she leaned back me angel fahy related to the greatest gunman the provisional ira ever had well now there would be some who would argue about that he said as they reached the village and pulled up outside the pub it was a small desolate sort of place no more than fifteen rather dilapidated cottages and a norman church with a tower and an overgrown graveyard the pub was called the green man and even dillon had to duck to enter the door the ceiling was very low and beamed the floor was constructed of heavy stone flags worn with the years the walls were whitewashed the man behind the bar in his shirt sleeves was at least eighty he glanced up and angel said is he here mr dalton by the fire having a beer the old man said a fire burned in a wide stone hearth and there was a wooden bench and a table in front of it danny fahy sat there reading the paper a glass in front of him he was sixtyfive with an untidy grizzled beard and wore a cloth cap and an old harris tweed suit angel said ive brought someone to see you uncle danny he looked up at her and then at dillon puzzlement on his face and what can i do for you sir dillon removed his glasses god bless all here he said in his belfast accent and particularly you you old bastard fahy turned very pale the shock was so intense god save us is that you sean and me thinking you were in your box long ago well im not and im here dillon took a fivepound note from his wallet and gave it to angel a couple of whiskies irish for preference she went back to the bar and dillon turned danny fahy actually had tears in his eyes and he flung his arms around him dear god sean but i cant tell you how good it is to see you the sitting room at the farm was untidy and cluttered the furniture very old dillon sat on a sofa while fahy built up the fire angel was in the kitchen cooking a meal it was open to the sitting room and dillon could see her moving around and hows life been treating you sean fahy stuffed a pipe and lit it ten years since you raised cain in london town by god boy you gave the brits something to think about i couldnt have done it without you danny great days and what happened after europe the middle east i kept on the move did a lot for the plo even learned to fly is that a fact angel came and put plates of bacon and eggs on the table get it while its hot she returned with a tray laden with teapot and milk three mugs and a plate piled high with bread and butter im sorry theres nothing fancier but we werent expecting company it looks good to me dillon told her and tucked in so now youre here sean and dressed like an english gentleman fahy turned to angel didnt i tell you the actor this man was they never could put a glove on him in all these years not once she nodded eagerly smiling at dillon and her personality had changed with the excitement are you on a job now mr dillon for the ira i mean it would be a cold day in hell before i put myself on the line for that bunch of old washer women dillon said but you are working on something sean fahy said i can tell come on lets in on it dillon lit a cigarette what if i told you i was working for the arabs danny for saddam hussein himself jesus sean and why not and what is it he wants you to do he wants something nowa coup something big americas too far away that leaves the brits what could be better fahys eyes were gleaming thatcher was in france the other day seeing mitterrand i had plans for her on the way to her plane perfect setup quiet country road and then someone i trusted let me down and isnt that always the way fahy said so youre looking for another target who sean i was thinking of john major the new prime minister angel said in awe you wouldnt dare sure and why wouldnt he didnt the boys nearly get the whole bloody british government at brighton danny fahy told her go on sean whats your plan i havent got one danny thats the trouble but there would be a payday for this like you wouldnt believe and thats as good a reason to make it work as any so youve come to uncle danny looking for help fahy went to a cupboard came back with a bottle of bushmills and two glasses and filled them have you any ideas at all not yet danny do you still work for the movement stay in deep cover that was the order from belfast so many years ago ive forgotten since then not a word and me bored out of my socks so i moved down here it suits me i like the countryside here i like the people they keep to themselves ive built up a fair business repairing agricultural machinery and i run a few sheep were happy here angel and me and still bored out of your socks do you remember martin brosnan by the way i do so you were bad friends with that one i had a runin with him in paris recently hell probably turn up in london looking for me hell be working for brit intelligence the bastard fahy frowned as he refilled his pipe didnt i hear some fanciful talk of how brosnan got into ten downing street as a waiter years ago and didnt do anything about it i heard that story too a flight of fancy and no one would get in these days as a waiter or anything else you know theyve blocked the street off the place is a fortress no way in there danny oh theres always a way sean i was reading in a magazine the other day how a lot of french resistance people in the second world war were held at some gestapo headquarters their cells were on the ground floor the gestapo on the first floor the raf had a fella in a mosquito fly in at fifty feet and drop a bomb that bounced off the street and went in through the firstfloor window killing all the bloody gestapo so the fellas downstairs got away what in the hell are you trying to say to me dillon demanded that im a great believer in the power of the bomb and the science of ballistics you can make a bomb go anywhere if you know what youre doing what is this dillon demanded angel said go on show him uncle danny show me what dillon said danny fahy got up putting another match to his pipe come on then and he turned and went to the door fahy opened the door of the second barn and led the way in it was enormous oak beams rearing up to a steeply pitched roof there was a loft stuffed with hay and reached by a ladder there were various items of farm machinery including a tractor there was also a fairly new landrover and an old bsa cc motorcycle in fine condition up on its stand this is a beauty dillon said in genuine admiration bought it secondhand last year thought id renovate it to make a profit but now im finished i cant bear to let it go its as good as a bmw there was another vehicle in the shadows of the rear and fahy switched on a light and a white ford transit van stood revealed so dillon said whats so special you wait mr dillon angel told him this is really something fahy said not what it seems there was an excited look on his face a kind of pride as he opened the sliding door inside there was a battery of metal pipes three in all bolted to the floor pointing up to the roof at an angle mortars sean just like the lads have been using in ulster dillon said you mean this thing works hell no ive no explosives it would work thats all i can say explain it to me ive welded a steel platform to the floor thats to stand the recoil and ive also welded the tubing together thats standard castiron stuff available anywhere the electric timers are dead simple stuff you can buy at any doityourself shop how would it work once switched on it would give you a minute to get out of the van and run for it the roof is cut out thats just stretched polythene covering the hole you can see ive sprayed it the same color it gives the mortars a clean exit ive even worked out an extra little device linked to the timer that will selfdestruct the van after its fired the mortars and where would they be over here fahy walked to a workbench standard oxygen cylinders there were several stacked together the bottom plates removed and what would you need for those semtex dillon asked naming the czechoslovakian explosive so popular with terrorists everywhere id say about twelve pounds in each would do nicely but thats not easily come by over here dillon lit a cigarette and walked around the van his face blank youre a bad boy danny the movement told you to stay in deep cover like i told you how many years ago was that fahy demanded a man would go crazy so you found yourself something to do it was easy sean you know i was in the light engineering for years dillon stood looking at it angel said what do you think i think hes done a good job as good as anything theyve done in ulster fahy said maybe but whenever theyve been used theyve never been too strong on accuracy they worked like a dream in that attack on newry police station six years ago killed nine coppers what about all the other times they couldnt hit a barn door someone even blew himself up with one of these things in portadown a bit hitandmiss not the way id do it i can plot the target on a largescale map have a look at the area on foot beforehand line the van up and thats it mind you ive been thinking that some sort of fin welded on to the oxygen cylinders would help steady them in flight a nice big curve and then down and the whole world blows up all the security in the world wouldnt help i mean what good are gates if you go over them youre talking downing street now dillon said and why not they meet at ten oclock every morning in the cabinet room what they call the war cabinet youd not only get the prime minister youd get virtually the whole government fahy crossed himself holy mother of god it would be the hit of a lifetime theyd make up songs about you danny dillon told him theyd be singing about danny fahy in bars all over ireland fifty years from now fahy slammed a clenched fist into his palm all hot air sean no meaning to it without the semtex and like i said that stuffs impossible to get your hands on over here dont be too sure danny dillon said there might be a source now lets go and have a bushmills and sort this out fahy had a largescale map of london spread across the table and examined it with a magnifying glass here would be the place he said horse guards avenue running up from the victoria embankment at the side of the ministry of defence yes dillon nodded if we left the ford on the corner with whitehall then as long as i had a predetermined sighting to get my direction i reckon the mortar bombs would go over those roofs in a bloody great curve and land smack on ten downing street he put his pencil down beside the ruler id like to have a look mind you and so you will dillon said would it work mr dillon angel demanded oh yes he said i think it really could ten oclock in the morning the whole bloody war cabinet he started to laugh its beautiful danny beautiful he grabbed the other mans arm youll come in with me on this of course i will good dillon said big big money danny ill set you up for your old age total luxury spain greece anywhere you want to go fahy rolled up the map and dillon said ill stay overnight well go up to london tomorrow and have a look he smiled and lit another cigarette its looking good danny really good now tell me about this airfield near here at grimethorpe a real brokendown sort of a place its only three miles from here what would you want with grimethorpe i told you i learned to fly in the middle east a good way of getting out of places fast now whats the situation at this grimethorpe place it goes way back into the past a flying club in the thirties then the raf used it as a feeder station during the battle of britain so they built three hangars someone tried it as a flying club a few years ago theres a tarmac runway anyway it failed a fella called bill grant turned up three years ago he has two planes there thats all i know his firm is called grants air taxis i heard recently he was in trouble his two mechanics had left business was bad he smiled theres a recession on sean and it even affects the rich does he live on the premises yes angel said he did have a girlfriend but she moved on i think id like to meet him dillon said maybe you could show me angel of course good but first id like to make a phone call he rang tania novikova at her flat she answered at once its me he said has it gone well unbelievable ill tell you tomorrow did you pick up the money oh yes no problem good ill be at the hotel at noon im overnighting here see you then and he rang off brosnan and mary tanner went up in the freight elevator with charlie salter and found mordecai waiting for them he pumped brosnans hand up and down its great to see you professor i cant tell you how great harrys been on hot bricks this is mary tanner brosnan said youd better be nice shes an army captain well this is a pleasure miss mordecai shook her hand i did my national service in the grenadier guards but lancecorporal was all i managed he led them into the sitting room harry flood was seated at the desk going over some accounts he glanced up and jumped to his feet martin he rushed round the desk and embraced brosnan laughing in delight brosnan said mary tanner shes army harry a real hotshot so watch your step im working for brigadier charles ferguson of british intelligence and shes his aide then ill behave flood took her hand now come over here and lets have a drink and you tell me what all this is about martin they sat in the sofa complex in the corner and brosnan covered everything in finest detail mordecai leaned against the wall listening no expression on his face when brosnan was finished flood said so what do you want from me martin he always works the underworld harry thats where he gets everything he needs not only physical help but explosives weaponry hell work the same way now i know he will so what you want to know is who hed go to exactly flood looked up at mordecai what do you think i dont know harry i mean there are plenty of legit arms dealers but what you need is someone whos willing to supply the ira any ideas flood asked not really guv i mean most of your real east end villains love maggie thatcher and wear union jack underpants they dont go for irish geezers letting off bombs at harrods we could make enquiries of course then do that flood said put the word out now but discreetly mordecai went out and harry flood reached for the champagne bottle youre still not drinking brosnan said not me old buddy but no reason you shouldnt you can fill me in with the events of recent years and then well go along to the embassy one of my more respectable clubs and have something to eat at around the same time sean dillon and angel fahy were driving along the dark country road from cadge end to grimethorpe the lights of the car picked out light snow and frost on the hedgerows its beautiful isnt it she said i suppose so i like it here the countryside and all that i like uncle danny too hes been really good to me that makes sense you were raised in the country back there in galway it wasnt the same it was poor land there it was hard work to make any kind of a living and it showed in the people my mother for instance it was as if theyd been to war and lost and there was nothing to look forward to youve got a way with the words girl he told her my english teacher used to say that she said if i worked hard and studied i could do anything well that must have been a comfort it didnt do me any good my stepfather just saw me as an unpaid farm laborer thats why i left the lights picked out a sign that said grimethorpe airfield the paintwork peeling dillon turned into a narrow tarmac road that was badly potholed a few moments later they came to the airfield there were three hangars an old control tower a couple of nissen huts a light at the windows of one of them a jeep was parked there and dillon pulled in beside it as they got out the door of the nissen hut opened and a man stood there who is it its me mr grant angel fahy ive brought someone to see you grant like most pilots was small and wiry he looked to be in his midforties wore jeans and an old flying jacket of the kind used by american aircrew in the second world war youd better come in then the interior of the nissen hut was warm heated by a cokeburning stove the pipe going up through the roof grant obviously used it as a living room there was a table with the remains of a meal on it an old easy chair by the stove facing a television set in the corner beneath the windows on the other side there was a long sloping desk with a few charts angel said this is a friend of my uncles hilton dillon said peter hilton grant put his hand out looking wary bill grant i dont owe you money do i not to my knowledge dillon was back in his publicschool role well that makes a nice change what can i do for you i want a charter in the next few days just wanted to check if you might be able to do something before i tried anywhere else well that depends on what you do have a plane i take it ive got two the only problem is how long the bank lets me hang onto them do you want to have a look why not they went out crossed the apron to the end hangar and he opened a judas so they could step through he reached to one side found a switch and lights came on there were two planes there side by side both twin engines dillon walked up to the nearest i know this baby a cessna conquest whats the other navajo chieftain if things are as tricky as you say what about fuel i always keep my planes juiced up mr hilton always full tanks im too old a hand to do otherwise you never know when a job might come up he smiled ruefully mind you ill be honest what with the recession there arent too many people looking for charters these days where would you like me to take you actually i was thinking of going for a spin myself one day dillon said im not sure when youre certified then grant looked dubious oh yes fully dillon took out his pilots license and passed it across grant examined it quickly and handed it back you could handle either of these two but id rather come myself just to make sure no problem dillon said smoothly its the west country i was thinking of cornwall theres an airfield at lands end i know it well grass runway ive got friends near there id probably want to stay overnight thats fine by me grant switched off the lights and they walked back to the nissen hut what line are you in mr hilton oh finance accountancy that sort of thing dillon said have you any idea when you might want to go i should point out that kind of charters going to be expensive around two thousand five hundred pounds with half a dozen passengers thats not so bad but on your own thats fine dillon said then there would be my overnight expenses a hotel and so on no problem dillon took ten fiftypound notes from his wallet and put them on the table theres five hundred down its a definite booking for some time in the next four or five days ill phone you here to let you know when grants face brightened as he picked up the bank notes thats fine can i get you a coffee or something before you go why not dillon said grant went into the kitchen at the far end of the nissen hut they heard him filling a kettle dillon put a finger to his lips made a face at angel and crossed to the charts on the desk he went through them quickly found the one for the general english channel area and the french coast angel stood beside him watching as he traced his finger along the normandy coast he found cherbourg and moved south there it was saintdenis with the landing strip clearly marked and he pushed the charts back together grant in the kitchen had been watching through the halfopen door as the kettle boiled he quickly made coffee in three mugs and took them in is this weather giving you much trouble dillon said the snow it will if it really starts to stick grant said it could make it difficult for that grass runway at lands end well just have to keep our fingers crossed dillon put down his mug wed better be getting back grant went to the door to see them off they got in the mini and drove away he waved closed the door and went to the desk and examined the charts it was the third or fourth down he was sure of that general english channel area and the french coast he frowned and said softly and whats your game mister i wonder as they drove back through the dark country lanes angel said not lands end at all mr dillon its that saintdenis place in normandy thats where you want to fly to our secret he said and put his left hand on hers still steering can i ask you to promise me one thing anything mr dillon lets keep it to ourselves just for now i dont want danny to know you do drive do you drive of course i do i take the sheep to market in the morris van myself tell me how would you like a trip up to london tomorrow morning with me you and danny id like it fine good thats all right then as they carried on through the night her eyes were shining nine it was a cold crisp morning winter on every hand but the roads were clear as dillon drove up to london angel and danny fahy following in the morris van angel was driving and more than competently he could see her in his rearview mirror and she stayed right on his tail all the way into london until they came to the bayswater road there was a plan already halfformed in his mind and he got out of the minicooper parked it at the curb and opened the doors of tanias garage as angel and danny drew up behind him he said put the morris inside angel did as she was told when she and danny fahy came out dillon closed the doors and said youll remember the street and the garage if you lose me that is dont be silly mr dillon of course i will angel said good its important now get in the mini were going for a little run round harry flood was sitting at the desk in his apartment at cable wharf checking the casino accounts from the night before when charlie salter brought in coffee on a tray the phone rang and the small man picked it up he handed it to flood the professor martin how goes it flood said i enjoyed last night the tanner lady is something special is there any news have you managed to come up with anything brosnan asked not yet martin just a minute flood put a hand over the receiver and said to salter wheres mordecai doing the rounds harry just like you asked him putting the word out discreetly flood returned to brosnan sorry old buddy were doing everything we can but its going to take time which we dont really have brosnan said all right harry i know youre doing your best ill stay in touch he was standing at mary tanners desk in the living room of her lowndes square flat he put the phone down walked to the window and lit a cigarette anything she asked and crossed the room to join him im afraid not as harry has just said it takes time i was a fool to think anything else just try and be patient martin she put a hand on his arm but i cant he said ive got this feeling and its hard to explain its like being in a storm and waiting for that bloody great thunderclap you know is going to come i know dillon mary hes moving fast on this im certain of it so what would you like to do will ferguson be at cavendish square this morning yes then lets go to see him dillon parked the minicooper near covent garden an enquiry in a bookshop nearby led them to a shop not too far away specializing in maps and charts of every description dillon worked his way through the largescale ordnance survey maps of central london until he found the one covering the general area of whitehall would you look at the detail in that thing fahy whispered you could measure the size of the garden at number ten to half an inch dillon purchased the map which the assistant rolled up tightly and inserted into a protective cardboard tube he paid for it and they walked back to the car now what danny asked well take a run round have a look at the situation that suits me angel sat in the rear her uncle beside dillon as they drove down toward the river and turned into horse guards avenue dillon paused slightly on the corner before turning into whitehall and moving toward downing street plenty of coppers around danny said thats to make sure people dont park a car had drawn in to the curb on their left and as they pulled out to pass they saw that the driver was consulting a map tourist i expect angel said and look whats happening dillon told her she turned and saw two policemen converging on the car a quiet word it started up and moved away angel said they dont waste time downing street dillon announced a moment later would you look at those gates danny said in wonder i like the gothic touch sure and theyve done a good job there dillon moved with the traffic round parliament square and went back up whitehall toward trafalgar square were going back to bayswater he said notice the route ive chosen he moved out of the traffic of trafalgar square through admiralty arch along the mall round the queen victoria monument past buckingham palace and along constitution hill eventually reaching marble arch by way of park lane and turning into the bayswater road and thats simple enough danny fahy said good dillon said then lets go and get a nice cup of tea at my truly awful hotel ferguson said youre getting too restless martin its the waiting brosnan told him floods doing his best i know that but i dont think time is on our side ferguson turned from the window and sipped a little of the cup of tea he was holding so what would you like to do brosnan hesitated glanced at mary and said id like to go and see liam devlin in kilrea he might have some ideas something he was never short of ferguson turned to mary what do you think i think it makes sense sir after all a trip to dublins no big deal an hour and a quarter from heathrow on either aer lingus or ba and liams place at kilrea is only half an hour from the city brosnan said all right ferguson said youve made your point both of you but make it gatwick and the lear jet just in case anything comes up and you need to get back here in a hurry thank you sir mary said as they reached the door ferguson added ill give the old rogue a call just to let him know youre on your way and he reached for the phone as they went downstairs brosnan said thank god at least i feel were doing something and i get to meet the great liam devlin at long last mary said and led the way out to the limousine in the small café at the hotel dillon angel and fahy sat at a corner table drinking tea fahy had the ordnance survey map partially open on his knee its extraordinary the things they give away every detail could it be done danny oh yes no trouble you remember that corner horse guards avenue and whitehall that would be the place slightly on an angle i can see it in my minds eye i can plot the distance from that corner to number ten exactly from this map youre sure youd clear the buildings in between dillon said oh yes ive said before sean ballistics is a matter of science but you cant stop there angel said we saw what happened to that man in the car the police were on him in seconds dillon turned to fahy danny well thats all you would need everything pretimed angel press the right switch to activate the circuit get out of the van and the mortars start firing within a minute no policeman could act fast enough to stop it but what would happen to you she demanded it was dillon who answered just listen to this we drive up from cadge end one morning early you danny in the ford transit and angel and me in the morris van well have that bsa motorcycle in the back of that angel will park the morris like today in the garage at the end of the road well have a duckboard in the back so i can run the bsa out and youll follow me is that it ill be right up your tail when we reach the corner of horse guards avenue and whitehall you set your switch get out of the ford and jump straight on my pillion and well be away the war cabinet meets every morning at ten with luck we could get the lot jesus sean theyd never know what hit them straight back to bayswater to angel waiting in the garage with the morris put the bsa in the back and away we go well be in cadge end while theyre still trying to put the fires out its brilliant mr dillon angel told him except for one thing fahy said without the bloody explosives we dont have any bloody bombs you leave that to me dillon said ill get your explosives for you he stood up but ive got things to do you two go back to cadge end and wait ill be in touch and when would that be sean soonvery soon and dillon smiled as they went out tania was knocking at his door precisely at noon he opened it and said youve got it she had a briefcase in her right hand opened it on the table to reveal the thirty thousand dollars hed asked for good he said ill just need ten thousand to be going on with what will you do with the rest ill hand it in at the desk they can keep your briefcase in the hotel safe youve worked something out i can tell she looked excited what happened at this cadge end place so he told her and in detail the entire plan what do you think he asked when hed finished incredible the coup of a lifetime but what about the explosives youd need semtex thats all right when i was operating in london in eightyone i used to deal with a man who had access to semtex he laughed in fact he had access to everything and who is this man how can you be sure hes still around a crook named jack harvey and hes around all right i looked him up but i dont understand amongst other things he has a funeral business in whitechapel i looked it up in the yellow pages and its still there by the way your mini i can still use it of course good ill park it somewhere in the street i want that garage free he picked up his coat come on well go and have a bite to eat and then ill go and see him youve read the file on devlin i suppose brosnan asked mary tanner as they drove through the center of dublin and crossed the river liffey by st georges quay and moved on out of the other side of the city driven by a chauffeur in a limousine from the embassy yes she said but is it all true the story about his involvement with the german attempt to get churchill in the war oh yes the same man who helped you break out of that french prison in nineteen seventynine thats devlin but martin you said he claimed to be seventy he must be older than that a few years is a minor detail where liam devlin is concerned lets put it this way youre about to meet the most extraordinary man youve ever met in your life scholar poet and gunman for the ira the last part is no recommendation to me she said i know he told her but never make the mistake of lumping devlin in with the kind of rubbish the ira employs these days he retreated into himself suddenly sombre and the car continued out into the irish countryside leaving the city behind kilrea cottage the place was called on the outskirts of the village next to a convent it was a period piece singlestoreyed with gothiclooking gables and lead windows on either side of the porch they sheltered in there from the light rain while brosnan tugged an oldfashioned bell pull there was the sound of footsteps the door opened cead míle fáilte liam devlin said in irish a hundred thousand welcomes and he flung his arms around brosnan the interior of the house was very victorian most of the furniture was mahogany the wallpaper was a william morris replica but the paintings on the walls all atkinson grimshaws were real liam devlin came in from the kitchen with tea things on a tray my housekeeper comes mornings only one of the good sisters from the convent next door they need the money mary tanner was totally astonished shed expected an old man and found herself faced with this ageless creature in black silk italian shirt black pullover gray slacks in the latest fashionable cut there was still considerable color in hair that had once been black and the face was pale but she sensed that had always been so the blue eyes were extraordinary as was that perpetual ironic smile with which he seemed to laugh at himself as much as at the world so you work for ferguson girl he said to mary as he poured the tea thats right that business in derry the other year when you moved that car with the bomb that was quite something she felt herself flushing no big deal mr devlin it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time oh we can all see that on occasions its the doing that counts he turned to brosnan annemarie a bad business son i want him liam brosnan said for yourself or for the general cause devlin shook his head push the personal thing to one side martin or youll make mistakes and thats something you cant afford to do with sean dillon yes i know brosnan said i know so he intends to take a crack at this john major fella the new prime minister devlin said and how do you think hes likely to do that mr devlin mary asked well from what i hear about security at ten downing street these days i wouldnt rate his chances of getting in very high he looked at brosnan and grinned mind you mary my love i remember a young fella of my acquaintance called martin brosnan who got into number ten posing as a waiter at a party not ten years ago left a rose on the prime ministers desk of course the office was held by a woman then brosnan said all in the past liam what about now oh hell work as he always has using contacts in the underworld not the ira i doubt whether the ira has any connection with this whatsoever but they did last time he worked in london ten years ago so i was wondering if we knew who recruited him that time it could help i see what you mean give you some sort of lead as to who he worked with in london all right not much of a chance but the only one weve got liam theres still your friend flood in london i know and hell pull out all the stops but that takes time and we dont have much to spare devlin nodded right son you leave it with me and ill see what i can do he glanced at his watch one oclock well have a sandwich and perhaps a bushmills together and i suggest you go to your lear jet and hare back to london ill be in touch believe me the minute i have something dillon parked round the corner from jack harveys funeral business in whitechapel and walked the briefcase in one hand everything was beautifully discreet down to the bell push that summoned the day porter to open the door mr harvey dillon lied cheerfully hes expecting me down the hall past the chapels of rest and up the stairs his office is on the first floor what was the name sir hilton dillon looked around at the coffins on display the flowers not much happening trade you mean the porter shrugged that all comes in the back way i see dillon moved down the hall pausing to glance into one of the chapels of rest taking in the banked flowers the candles he stepped in and looked down at the body of a middleaged man neatly dressed in a dark suit hands folded the face touched with makeup poor sod dillon said and went out at the reception desk the porter picked up a phone miss myra a visitor a mr hilton says he has an appointment dillon opened the door to harveys outer office and moved in there were no office furnishings just a couple of potted plants and several easy chairs the door to the inner office opened and myra entered she wore skintight black trews black boots and a scarlet threequarter length caftan she looked very striking mr hilton thats right im myra harvey you said you had an appointment with my uncle did i she looked him over in a casual way and behind him the door opened and billy watson came in the whole thing was obviously prearranged he leaned against the door suitably menacing in a black suit arms folded now whats your game she said thats for mr harvey throw him out billy she said and turned to the door billy put one rough hand on dillons shoulder dillons foot went all the way down the right leg stamping on the instep he pivoted and struck sideways with clenched fist the knuckles on the back of the hand connecting with billys temple billy cried out in pain and fell back into one of the chairs hes not very good is he dillon said he opened his briefcase and took out ten onehundreddollar bills with a rubber band round them and threw them at myra she missed the catch and had to bend to pick them up would you look at that she said and brand new yes new money always smells so good dillon said now tell jack an old friend would like to see him with more of the same she stood there looking at him for a moment eyes narrowed then she turned and opened the door to harveys office billy tried to get up and dillon said i wouldnt advise it billy subsided as the door opened and myra appeared all right hell see you the room was surprisingly businesslike with walls paneled in oak a green carpet in georgian silk and a gas fire that almost looked real burning in a steel basket on the hearth harvey sat behind a massive oak desk smoking a cigar he had the thousand dollars in front of him and looked dillon over calmly my times limited so dont muck me about son he picked up the bank notes more of the same thats right i dont know you you told myra you were an old friend but ive never seen you before a long time ago jack ten years to be precise i looked different then i was over from belfast on a job we did business together you and me you did well out of it as i recall all those lovely dollars raised by ira sympathizers in america harvey said coogan michael coogan dillon took off his glasses as ever was jack harry nodded slowly and said to his niece myra an old friend mr coogan from belfast i see she said one of those dillon lit a cigarette sat down the briefcase on the floor beside him and harvey said you went through london like bloody attila the hun last time i should have charged you more for all that stuff you gave me a price i paid it dillon said what could be fairer and what is it this time i need a little semtex jack i could manage with forty pounds but thats the bottom line fifty would be better you dont want much do you that stuffs like gold very strict government controls bollocks dillon said it passes from czechoslovakia to italy greece onwards to libya its everywhere jack you know it and i know it so dont waste my time twenty thousand dollars he opened the briefcase on his knee and tossed the rest of the ten thousand packet by packet across the desk ten now and ten on delivery the walther with the carswell silencer screwed on the end of the barrel lay ready in the briefcase he waited the lid up and then harvey smiled all right but itll cost you thirty dillon closed the briefcase no can do jack twentyfive i can manage but no more harvey nodded all right when do you want it twentyfour hours i think i can manage that where can we reach you youve got it wrong way round jack i contact you dillon stood up and harvey said affably anything else we can do for you actually there is dillon said sign of goodwill you might say i could do with a spare handgun be my guest my old son harvey pushed his chair back and opened the second drawer down on his right hand take your pick there was a smith amp wesson revolver a czech cesca and an italian beretta which was the one dillon selected he checked the clip and slipped the gun in his pocket this will do nicely ladys gun harvey said but thats your business well be seeing you then tomorrow myra opened the door dillon said a pleasure miss harvey and he brushed past billy and walked out billy said id like to break that little bastards legs myra patted his cheek never mind sunshine on your two feet youre useless its in the horizontal position you come into your own now go and play with your motorbike or something and she went back in her uncles office dillon paused at the bottom of the stairs and slipped the beretta inside the briefcase the only thing better than one gun was two it always gave you an ace in the hole and he walked back to the minicooper briskly myra said i wouldnt trust him an inch that one a hard little bastard harvey said when he was here for the ira in nineteen eightyone i supplied him with arms explosives everything you were at college then not in the business so you probably dont remember is coogan his real name course not he nodded yes hell on wheels i was having a lot of hassle in those days from george montoya down in bermondsey the one they called spanish george coogan knocked him off for me one night him and his brother outside a bar called the flamenco did it for free really myra said so where do we get him semtex he laughed opened the top drawer and took out a bunch of keys ill show you he led the way out and along the corridor and unlocked a door something even you didnt know darling the room was lined with shelves of box files he put his hand on the middle shelf of the rear wall and it swung open he reached for a switch and turned on a light revealing a treasure house of weapons of every description my god she said whatever you want its here he said hand guns ak assault rifles ms he chuckled and semtex there were three cardboard boxes on a table fifty pounds in each of those but why did you tell him it might take time keep him dangling he led the way out and closed things up might screw a few more bob out of him as they went back into his office she said what do you think hes up to i couldnt care less anyway why should you worry you suddenly turned into a bleeding patriot or something it isnt that im just curious he clipped another cigar mind you i have had a thought very convenient if i got the little bugger to knock off harry flood for me and he started to laugh it was just after six and ferguson was just about to leave his office at the ministry of defence when his phone rang it was devlin now then you old sod ive news for you get on with it then ferguson said dillons control in eightyone in belfast was a man called tommy mcguire remember him i do indeed wasnt he shot a few years ago some sort of ira feud that was the story but hes still around up there using another identity and what would that be ive still to find that out people to see in belfast im driving up there tonight i take it by the way that involving myself in this way makes me an official agent of group four i mean i wouldnt like to end up in prison not at my age youll be covered fully you have my word on it now what do you want us to do i was thinking that if brosnan and your captain tanner wanted to be in on the action they could fly over in the morning in that lear jet of yours to belfast that is and wait for me at the europa hotel in the bar tell brosnan to identify himself to the head porter ill be in touch probably around noon ill see to it ferguson said just one more thing dont you think you and i are getting just a little geriatric for this sort of game you speak for yourself ferguson said and put the phone down he sat thinking about it then phoned through for a secretary he also called mary tanner at the lowndes square flat as he was talking to her alice johnson came in with her notepad and pencil ferguson waved her down and carried on speaking to mary so early start in the morning gatwick again i think youll be there in an hour in the lear are you dining out tonight henry flood suggested the river room at the savoy he likes the dance band sounds like fun would you like to join us sir actually i would ferguson said well see you then eight oclock ferguson put down the phone and turned to alice johnson a brief note eyes of the prime minister only the special file he quickly dictated a report that brought everything up to date including his conversation with devlin one copy for the pm and alert a messenger usual copy for me and the file hurry it up and bring them along for my signature i want to get away she went down to the office quickly gordon brown was standing at the copier as she sat behind the typewriter i thought hed gone he said so did i but hes just given me an extra another eyes of the prime minister only really she started to type furiously was finished in two minutes she stood up hell have to hang on i need to go to the toilet ill do the copying for you thanks gordon she went out and along the corridor was opening the toilet door when she realized shed left her handbag on the desk she turned and hurried back to the office the door was partially open and she could see gordon standing at the copier reading a copy of the report to her astonishment he folded it slipped it in his inside pocket and hurriedly did another alice was totally thrown had no idea what to do she went back along the corridor to the toilet went in and tried to pull herself together after a while she went back the report and a file copy were on her desk all done gordon brown said and ive requested a messenger she managed a light smile ill get them signed right im just going down to the canteen ill see you later alice went along the corridor knocked on fergusons door and went in he was at his desk writing and looked up oh good ill sign those and you can get the pms copy off to downing street straight away she was trembling now and he frowned my dear mrs johnson what is it so she told him he sat there grimfaced and as she finished reached for the telephone special branch detective inspector lane for brigadier ferguson group four top priority no delay my office now he put the phone down now this is what you do go back to the office and behave as if nothing had happened but he isnt there brigadier he went to the canteen really ferguson said now why would he do that when tania heard gordon browns voice she was immediately angry ive told you about this gordon yes but its urgent where are you in the canteen at the ministry ive got another report is it important very read it to me no ill bring it round after i come off shift at ten ill see you at your place gordon i promise but i want to know what youve got now and if you refuse then dont bother to call again no thats all right ill read it which he did and when he was finished she said good boy gordon ill see you later he put the phone down and turned folding the copy of the report the door to the phone box was jerked open and ferguson plucked the report from his fingers ten dillon was in his room at the hotel when tania called him ive got rather hot news she said the hunt for a lead on you is moving to belfast tell me he said which she did when she was finished she said does any of this make any sense yes he said the mcguire fella was a big name with the provos in those days and hes dead is he or is he still around devlins right about that his death was reported supposedly because of infighting in the movement but it was just a ruse to help him drop out of sight if they found him could it give you problems maybe but not if i found him first and how could you do that i know his halfbrother a fella called macey he would know where he is but that would mean a trip to belfast yourself that would be no big deal an hour and a quarter by british airways i dont know what time the last plane tonight gets in id have to check just a minute ive got a ba worldwide timetable here she said and opened her desk drawer she found it and looked at the belfast schedule the last plane is eightthirty youll never make it its quarter to seven now its murder getting out to heathrow in the evening traffic and this weather will make it worse probably at least an hour or maybe an hour and a half i know dillon said what about the morning same time eightthirty ill just have to get up early is it wise is anything in this life ill handle it dont worry ill be in touch he put the phone down thought about it for a while then called british airways and booked a seat on the morning flight with an open return he lit a cigarette and walked to the window was it wise shed said and he tried to remember what tommy mcguire had known about him in eightyone nothing about danny fahy that was certain because fahy wasnt supposed to be involved that time that had been personal but jack harvey was another matter after all it had been mcguire whod put him onto harvey as an arms supplier in the first place he pulled on his jacket got his trenchcoat from the wardrobe and went out five minutes later he was hailing a cab on the corner he got in and told the driver to take him to covent garden gordon brown sat on the other side of fergusons desk in the halflight he had never been so frightened in his life i didnt mean any harm brigadier i swear it then why did you take a copy of the report it was just a whim stupid i know but i was so intrigued with it being for the prime minister you realize what youve done gordon a man of your service all those years in the army this could mean your pension detective inspector lane of special branch was in his late thirties and in his crumpled tweed suit and glasses looked like a schoolmaster he said im going to ask you again mr brown he leaned on the end of the desk have you ever taken copies like this before absolutely not i swear it youve never been asked by another person to do such a thing gordon managed to look suitably shocked good heavens inspector that would be treason i was a sergeantmajor in the intelligence corps yes mr brown we know all that lane said the internal phone went and ferguson lifted it it was lanes sergeant mackie im outside brigadier just back from the flat in camden i think you and the inspector should come out thank you ferguson put the phone down right i think well give you time to think things over gordon inspector he nodded to lane got up and moved to the door and lane followed him mackie was standing in the anteroom still in trilby and raincoat a plastic bag in one hand you found something sergeant lane asked you could call it that sir mackie took a cardboard file from his plastic bag and opened it a rather interesting collection the copies of the reports were neatly stacked in order the latest ones for the prime ministers attention on top lane said christ brigadier hes been at it for a while so it would seem ferguson said but to what purpose you mean hes working for someone sir without a doubt the present operation im engaged on is most delicate there was an attack on a man working for me in paris a woman died we wondered how the villain of the piece knew about them if you follow me now we know details of these reports were passed on to a third party they must have been lane nodded then well have to work on him some more no we dont have the time lets try another way lets just let him go hes a simple man i think hed do the simple thing right sir lane turned to mackie if you lose him youll be back pounding the pavement in brixton and so will i because im coming with you they hurried out and ferguson opened the door and went back in the office he sat down behind the desk a sad business gordon whats going to happen to me brigadier ill have to think about it ferguson picked up the copy of the report such an incredibly stupid thing to do he sighed go home gordon go home ill see you in the morning gordon brown couldnt believe his luck he got the door open somehow and left hurrying down the corridor to the staff cloakroom the narrowest escape of his life it could have meant the end of everything not only his career and pension but prison but that was it no more and tania would have to accept that he went downstairs to the car park pulling on his coat found his car and was turning into whitehall a few moments later mackie and lane hard on his tail in the sergeants unmarked ford capri dillon knew that latenight shopping was the thing in the covent garden area there were still plenty of people around in spite of the winter cold and he hurried along until he came to the theatrical shop claytons near neals yard the lights were on in the window the door opened to his touch the bell tinkling clayton came through the bead curtain and smiled oh its you what can i do for you wigs dillon told him a nice selection over here he was right there was everythingshort long permed blonde redhead dillon selected one that was shoulderlength and gray i see clayton said the granny look something like that what about costume i dont mean anything fancy secondhand in here clayton went through the bead curtain and dillon followed him there was rack upon rack of clothes and a jumbled heap in the corner he worked very quickly sorting through selected a long brown skirt with an elastic waist and a shabby raincoat that almost came down to his ankles clayton said what are you going to play old mother riley or a bag lady youd be surprised dillon had seen a pair of jeans on top of the jumble in the corner he picked them up and searched through a pile of shoes beside them selecting a pair of runners that had seen better days these will do he said oh and this and he picked an old headscarf from a stand stick em all in a couple of plastic bags how much clayton started to pack them by rights i should thank you for taking them away but weve all got to live ten quid to you dillon paid him and picked up the bags thanks a lot clayton opened the door for him have a good show luv give em hell oh i will dillon said and he hurried down to the corner hailed a cab and told the driver to take him back to the hotel when tania novikova went down to answer the bell and opened the door to find gordon brown there she knew by instinct that something was wrong whats this gordon i told you id come round to your place i must see you tania its essential something terrible has happened calm down she said just take it easy come upstairs and tell me all about it lane and mackie were parked at the end of the street and the inspector was already on the car phone to ferguson giving him the address sergeant mackies done a quick check at the door sir the card says a miss tania novikova oh dear ferguson said you know her sir supposedly a secretary at the soviet embassy inspector in fact shes a captain in the kgb that means shes one of colonel yuri gatovs people sir he runs london station im not so sure gatov is a gorbachev man and very prowest on the other hand i always understood the novikova woman to be to the right of genghis khan id be surprised if gatov knew about this are you going to notify him sir not yet lets see what shes got to say first its information were after shall we go in sir no wait for me ill be with you in twenty minutes tania peered cautiously through a chink in the curtains she saw mackie standing by his car at the end of the street and it was enough she could smell policemen anywhere in the world moscow paris londonit was always the same tell me again gordon exactly what happened gordon brown did as he was told and she sat there listening patiently she nodded when hed finished we were lucky gordon very lucky go and make us a cup of coffee in the kitchen ive got a couple of phone calls to make she squeezed his hand afterwards well have a very special time together really his face brightened and he went out she picked up the phone and called makeev at his paris apartment it rang for quite a time and she was about to put it down when it was picked up at the other end josef its tania i was in the shower he said im dripping all over the carpet ive only got seconds josef i just wanted to say goodbye im blown my mole was exposed theyll be kicking in the door any minute my god he said and dillon hes safe all systems go what that man has planned will set the world on fire but you tania dont worry i wont let them take me goodbye josef she put the phone down lit a cigarette then called the hotel and asked for dillons room he answered at once its tania she said weve got trouble he was quite calm how bad they rumbled my mole let him go and the poor idiot came straight here i smell special branch at the end of the street i see what are you going to do dont worry i wont be around to tell them anything one thing theyll know that gordon gave me the contents of tonights report he was in the telephone booth in the ministry canteen when ferguson arrested him i see promise me one thing she said whats that blow them away all of them the doorbell rang she said ive got to go luck dillon as she put down the phone gordon brown came in with the coffee was that the door yes be an angel gordon and see who it is he opened the door and started downstairs tania took a deep breath dying wasnt difficult the cause she believed in had always been the most important thing in her life she stubbed out her cigarette opened a drawer in the desk took out a makarov pistol and shot herself through the right temple gordon brown halfway down the stairs turned and bounded up bursting into the room at the sight of her lying there beside the desk the pistol still in her right hand he let out a terrible cry and fell on his knees tania my darling he moaned and then he knew what he must do as he heard something heavy crash against the door below he pried the makarov from her hand and as he raised it his own hand was trembling he took a deep breath to steady himself and pulled the trigger in the same moment that the front door burst open and lane and mackie started upstairs ferguson behind them there was a small crowd at the end of the street exhibiting the usual public curiosity dillon joined in his collar up hands in pockets it started to snow slightly as they opened the rear doors of the ambulance he watched as the two blanketcovered stretchers were loaded the ambulance drove away ferguson stood on the pavement for a few moments talking to lane and mackie dillon recognized the brigadier straight away had been shown his photo many years previously lane and mackie were obviously policemen after a while ferguson got in his car and was driven away mackie went into the flat and lane also drove away the stratagem was obvious for mackie to wait just in case someone turned up one thing was certain tania novikova was dead and so was the boyfriend and dillon knew that thanks to her sacrifice he was safe he went back to the hotel and phoned makeev at his flat in paris ive got bad news josef tania how did you know she phoned whats happened she was blown or rather her mole was she killed herself josef rather than get taken a dedicated lady and the mole the boyfriend did the same ive just seen the bodies carted out to an ambulance ferguson was there how will this affect you in no way im off to belfast in the morning to cut off the only chance of a lead they have and then ill amaze you josef and your arab friend how does the entire british war cabinet sound to you dear god you cant be serious oh but i am ill be in touch very soon now he replaced the phone put on his jacket and went down to the bar whistling ferguson was sitting in a booth in the lounge bar of the pub opposite kensington park gardens and the soviet embassy waiting for colonel yuri gatov the russian when he appeared looked agitated a tall whitehaired man in a camel overcoat he saw ferguson and hurried over charles i cant believe it tania novikova dead why yuri you and i have known each other for better than twentyfive years often as adversaries but ill take a chance on you now a chance that you really do want to see change in our time and an end to eastwest conflict but i do you know that unfortunately not everyone in the kgb would agree with you and tania novikova was one she was a hardliner true but what are you saying charles so ferguson told himdillon the attempt on mrs thatcher gordon brown brosnan everything gatov said this ira wild card intends to attempt the life of the prime minister thats what youre telling me and tania was involved oh very directly but charles i knew nothing i swear and i believe you old chap but she must have had a link with someone i mean she managed to convey vital information to dillon in paris thats how he knew about brosnan and so on paris gatov said thats a thought did you know she was in paris for three years before transferring to london and you know whos head of paris station for the kgb of course josef makeev ferguson said anything but a gorbachev man very much of the old guard it would explain a great deal ferguson said but well never prove it true gatov nodded but ill give him a call anyway just to worry him makeev had not strayed far from the phone and picked it up the moment it rang makeev here josef yuri gatov im phoning from london yuri what a surprise makeev said immediately wary ive got some distressing news josef tania tania novikova what about her she committed suicide earlier this evening along with some boyfriend of hers a clerk at the ministry of defence good heavens makeev tried to sound convincing he was feeding her classified information ive just had a session with charles ferguson of group four you know charles of course i was quite shocked i must tell you i had no knowledge of tanias activities she worked for you for three years josef so you know her as well as anyone have you any thoughts on the matter none im afraid ah well if you can think of anything let me know makeev poured himself a scotch and went and looked out into the frostbound paris street for a wild moment hed had an impulse to phone michael aroun but what would be the point and tania had sounded so certain set the world on fire that had been her phrase he raised his glass to you dillon he said softly lets see if you can do it it was almost eleven in the river room at the savoy the band still playing and harry flood brosnan and mary were thinking of breaking up the party when ferguson appeared at last if ever ive needed a drink i need one now a scotch and a very large one flood called a waiter and gave the order and mary said what on earths happened ferguson gave them a quick résumé of the nights events when he was finished brosnan said it explains a great deal but the infuriating thing is it gets us no closer to dillon one point i must make ferguson said when i arrested brown in the canteen at the ministry he was on the phone and he had the report in his hand i believe it likely he was speaking to the novikova woman then i see what youre getting at mary said you think she in her turn may have transmitted the information to dillon possibly ferguson said so what are you suggesting brosnan asked that dillon would go to belfast too perhaps ferguson said if it was important enough well just have to take our chances then brosnan turned to mary early start tomorrow wed better get moving as they walked through the lounge to the entrance brosnan and ferguson went ahead and stood talking mary said to flood you think a lot of him dont you martin he nodded the vietcong had me in a pit for weeks when the rains came it used to fill up with water and id have to stand all night so i didnt drown leeches worms you name it and then one day when it was as bad as it could be a hand reached down and pulled me out and it was martin in a headband hair to his shoulders and his face painted like an apache indian hes special people mary looked across at brosnan yes she said i suppose that just about sums him up dillon ordered a taxi to pick him up at six oclock from the hotel he was waiting for it on the steps his case in one hand when it arrived a briefcase in the other he was wearing his trenchcoat suit striped tie and glasses to fit the peter hilton persona carried the jersey driving license and the flying license as proof of identity in the case was a toilet bag and the items he had obtained from clayton at covent garden all neatly folded hed included a towel from the hotel socks and underpants it all looked terribly normal and the wig could be easily explained the run to heathrow was fast at that time in the morning he went and picked up his ticket at the booking desk then put his case through and got his seat assignment he wasnt carrying a gun no possible way he could do that not with the kind of maximum security that operated on the belfast planes he got a selection of newspapers went up to the gallery restaurant and ordered a full english breakfast then he started to work his way through the papers checking on how the war in the gulf was doing at gatwick there was a light powdering of snow at the side of the runway as the lear jet lifted off as they leveled off mary said how do you feel im not sure brosnan said its been a long time since i was in belfast liam devlin annemarie so long ago and sean dillon dont worry i wasnt forgetting him i could never do that he turned and stared far out into the distance as the lear jet lifted up out of the clouds and turned northwest although dillon wasnt aware of it brosnan and mary had already landed and were on their way to the europa hotel when his flight touched down at aldergrove airport outside belfast there was a halfhour wait for the baggage and when he got his case he made for the green line and followed a stream of people through customs officers stopped some but he wasnt one of them and within five minutes he was outside and into a taxi english are you the driver asked dillon slipped straight into his belfast accent and what makes you think that jesus im sorry the driver said anywhere special id like a hotel in the falls road dillon said somewhere near craig street you wont get much round there scenes of my youth dillon told him ive been working in london for years just in town for business overnight thought id like to see the old haunts suit yourself theres the deepdene but its not much im telling you a saracen armored car passed then and as they turned into a main road they saw an army patrol nothing changes dillon said sure and most of those lads werent even born when the whole thing started the driver told him i mean what are we in for another hundred years war god knows dillon said piously and opened his paper the driver was right the deepdene wasnt much a tall victorian building in a mean side street off the falls road he paid off the driver went in and found himself in a shabby hall with a worn carpet when he tapped the bell on the desk a stout motherly woman emerged can i help you dear a room he said just the one night thats fine she pushed a register at him and took a key down number nine on the first floor shall i pay now sure and theres no need for that dont i know a gentleman when i see one he went up the stairs found the door and unlocked it the room was as shabby as hed expected a single brass bedstead a wardrobe he put his case on the table and went out again locking the door then went the other way along the corridor and found the back stairs he opened the door at the bottom into an untidy backyard the lane beyond backed onto incredibly derelict houses but it didnt depress him in the slightest this was an area he knew like the back of his hand a place where hed led the british army one hell of a dance in his day he moved along the alley a smile on his face remembering and turned into the falls road eleven i remember them opening this place in seventyone brosnan said to mary he was standing at the window of the sixthfloor room of the europa hotel in great victoria street next to the railway station for a while it was a prime target for ira bombers the kind whod rather blow up anything rather than nothing not you of course there was a slight sarcastic edge which he ignored certainly not devlin and i appreciated the bar too much we came in all the time she laughed in astonishment what nonsense are you seriously asking me to believe that with the british army chasing you all over belfast you and devlin sat in the europas bar also the restaurant on occasion come on ill show you better take our coats just in case we get a message while were down there as they were descending in the lift she said youre not armed are you no good id rather keep it that way how about you yes she said calmly but thats different im a serving officer of crown forces in an active service zone what are you carrying she opened her handbag and gave him a brief glimpse of the weapon it was not much larger than the inside of her hand a small automatic what is it he asked rather rare an old colt i picked it up in africa hardly an elephant gun no but it does the job she smiled bleakly as long as you can shoot that is the lift doors parted and they went across the lounge dillon walked briskly along the falls road nothing had changed nothing at all it was just like the old days he twice saw ruc patrols backed up by soldiers and once two armored troop carriers went by but no one paid any attention he finally found what he wanted in craig street about a mile from the hotel it was a small doublefronted shop with steel shutters on the windows the three brass balls of a pawnbroker hung over the entrance with the sign patrick macey dillon opened the door and walked into musty silence the dimly lit shop was crammed with a variety of items television sets video recorders clocks there was even a gas cooker and a stuffed bear in one corner there was a mesh screen running along the counter and the man who sat on a stool behind it was working on a watch a jewelers magnifying glass in one eye he glanced up a wastedlooking individual in his sixties his face gray and pallid and what can i do for you dillon said nothing ever changes patrick this place still smells exactly the same macey took the magnifying glass from his eye and frowned do i know you and why wouldnt you patrick remember that hot night in june of seventytwo when we set fire to that orangeman stewarts warehouse and shot him and his two nephews as they ran out let me see there were the three of us dillon put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it carefully there was you and your halfbrother tommy mcguire and me holy mother of god sean dillon is that you macey said as ever was patrick jesus sean i never thought to see you in belfast city again i thought you were he paused and dillon said thought i was where patrick london patrick macey said somewhere like that he added lamely and where would you have got that idea from dillon went to the door locking it and pulled down the blind what are you doing macey demanded in alarm i just want a nice private talk patrick me old son no sean none of that im not involved with the ira not anymore you know what they say patrick once in never out how is tommy these days by the way ah sean id have thought youd know poor tommys been dead these five years shot by one of his own a stupid row between the provos and one of the splinter groups inla were suspected is that a fact dillon nodded do you see any of the other old hands these days liam devlin for instance and he had him there for macey was unable to keep the look of alarm from his face liam i havent seen him since the seventies really dillon lifted the flap at the end of the counter and walked round its a terrible liar you are he slapped him across the face now get in there and pushed him through the curtain that led to the office at the rear macey was terrified i dont know a thing about what i havent asked you anything yet but im going to tell you a few things tommy mcguire isnt dead hes living somewhere else in this fair city under another name and youre going to tell me where secondly liam devlin has been to see you now im right on both counts arent i macey was frozen with fear terrified and dillon slapped him again arent i the other man broke then please sean please its my heart i could have an attack you will if you dont speak up i promise you all right devlin was here a little earlier this morning enquiring about tommy and shall i tell you what he said please sean macey was shaking im ill he said that bad old sean dillon was on the loose in london town and that he wanted to help run him down and who could be a better source of information than dillons old chum tommy mcguire am i right macey nodded yes good now were getting somewhere dillon lit another cigarette and nodded at the large oldfashioned safe in the corner is that where the guns are what guns sean come on dont muck me about youve been dealing in handguns for years get it open macey took a key from his desk drawer went and opened the safe dillon pulled him to one side there were several weapons in there an old webley a couple of smith amp wesson revolvers the one that really caught his eyes was an american army colt automatic he hefted it in his hand and checked the magazine wonderful patrick i knew i could depend on you he put the gun on the desk and sat down opposite macey so what happened maceys face was very strange in color now i dont feel well youll feel better when youve told me get on with it tommy lives on his own about half a mile from here in canal street hes done up the old warehouse at the end calls himself kelly george kelly i know that area well every stick and stone devlin asked for tommys phone number and called him there and then he said it was essential to see him that it was to do with you tommy agreed to see him at two oclock fine dillon said see how easy it was now i can call on him myself before devlin does and discuss old times only i wont bother to phone i think ill surprise him much more fun youll never get in to see him macey said you can only get in at the front all the other doors are welded hes been paranoid for years terrified someones going to knock him off youd never get in the front door its all tv security cameras and that kind of stuff theres always a way dillon said there always was for you macey tore at his shirt collar choking pills he moaned and got the drawer in front of him open the bottle he took fell from his hands he lay back on the chair and dillon got up and went round and picked up the bottle trouble is patrick the moment i go out of the door youll be on the phone to tommy and that wouldnt do would it he walked across to the fireplace and dropped the pill bottle into the gleaming coals there was a crash behind him and he turned to find macey had tumbled from the chair to the floor dillon stood over him for a moment maceys face was very suffused with purple now and his legs were jerking suddenly he gave a great gasp like air escaping his head turned to one side and he went completely still dillon put the colt in his pocket went through the shop and opened the door locking it with the yale leaving the blind down a moment later he turned the corner into the falls road and walked back toward the hotel as fast as he could he laid the contents of the case on the bed in the shabby hotel room then he undressed first of all he put on the jeans the old runners and a heavy jumper then came the wig he sat in front of the mirror at the small dressing table combing the gray hair until it looked wild and unkempt he tied the headscarf over it and studied himself then he pulled on the skirt that reached his ankles the old raincoat that was far too large completed the outfit he stood in front of the wardrobe examining himself in the mirror he closed his eyes thinking the role and when he opened them again it wasnt dillon anymore it was a decrepit broken bag lady he hardly needed any makeup just a foundation to give him the sallow look and the slash of scarlet lipstick for the mouth all wrong of course but totally right for the character he took a half bottle of whisky from a pouch in the briefcase and poured some into his cupped hands rubbing it over his face then he splashed some more over the front of the raincoat he put the colt a couple of newspapers and the whisky bottle into a plastic bag and was ready to leave he glanced in the mirror at that strange nightmarish old woman showtime he whispered and let himself out all was quiet as he went down the backstairs and went out into the yard he closed the door behind him carefully and crossed to the door which led to the alley as he reached it the hotel door opened behind him a voice called here what do you think youre doing dillon turned and saw a kitchen porter in a soiled white apron putting a cardboard box in the dustbin go fuck yourself dillon croaked go on get out of it you old bag the porter shouted dillon closed the door behind him ten out of ten sean he said softly and went up the alley he turned into the falls road and started to shuffle along the pavement acting so strangely that people stepped out of the way to avoid him it was almost one and brosnan and mary tanner at the bar of the europa were thinking about lunch when a young porter approached mr brosnan thats right your taxi is here sir taxi mary said but we didnt order one yes we did brosnan said he helped her on with her coat and they followed the young porter through the foyer down the steps at the front entrance to the black cab waiting at the curb brosnan gave the porter a pound and they got in the driver on the other side of the glass wore a tweed cap and an old reefer coat mary tanner pulled the sliding glass partition to one side i presume you know where were going she said oh i certainly do my love liam devlin smiled at her over his shoulder moved into gear and drove away it was just after onethirty when devlin turned the taxi into canal street thats the place at the end he said well park in the yard at the side they got out and moved back into the street and approached the entrance be on your best behavior were on television he said and reached to a bell push beside the massive ironbound door not very homelike mary commented yes well with tommy mcguires background he needs a fortress rather than a cozy semidetached on some desirable estate devlin turned to brosnan are you carrying son no brosnan said but she is you are i suppose call it my innate caution or perhaps the wicked habits of a lifetime a voice sounded through the box beside the door is that you devlin and who else you stupid bugger ive got martin brosnan with me and a lady friend of his and were freezing in this damn cold so get the door open youre early you said two oclock they could hear steps on the other side and then the door opened to reveal a tall cadaverous man in his midsixties he wore a heavy arran pullover and baggy jeans and carried a sterling submachine gun devlin brushed past him leading the way in what do you intend to do with that thing start another war mcguire closed the door and barred it only if i have to he looked them over suspiciously martin he held out a hand its been a long time as for you you old sod he said to devlin whatevers keeping you out of your grave you should bottle it wed make a fortune he looked mary over and who might you be a friend devlin told him so lets get on with it all right this way the interior of the warehouse was totally bare except for a van parked to one side a steel staircase led to a landing high above with what had once been glassfronted offices mcguire went first and turned into the first office on the landing there was a desk and a bank of television equipment one screen showing the street another the entrance he put the sterling on the desk devlin said you live here upstairs ive turned what used to be the storage loft into a flat now lets get on with it devlin what is it you want you mentioned sean dillon hes on the loose again brosnan said i thought he must have come to a bad end i mean its been so long mcguire lit a cigarette anyway whats it to do with me he tried to knock off martin here in paris killed his girlfriend instead jesus mcguire said now hes on the loose in london and i want him brosnan told him mcguire looked at mary again and where does she fit in im a captain in the british army she said crisply tanners the name for gods sake devlin what is this mcguire demanded its all right devlin told him she hasnt come to arrest you although we all know that if tommy mcguire was still in the land of the living hed draw about twentyfive years you bastard mcguire said be sensible devlin told him just answer a few questions and you can go back to being george kelly again mcguire put a hand up defensively all right i get the point what do you want to know nineteen eightyone the london bombing campaign brosnan said you were dillons control mcguire glanced at mary thats right we know dillon would have experienced the usual problems as regards weapons and explosives mr mcguire mary said and ive been given to understand he always favors underworld contacts in that sort of situation is that so yes he usually worked in that way mcguire said reluctantly and sat down have you any idea who he used in london in nineteen eightyone mary persisted mcguire looked hunted how would i know it could have been anybody devlin said you lying bastard you know something i can tell you do his right hand came out of the pocket of the reefer holding an old luger pistol and he touched mcguire between the eyes quick now tell us or ill mcguire pushed the gun to one side all right devlin you win he lit another cigarette he dealt with a man in london called jack harvey a big operator a real gangster there that wasnt so hard was it devlin said there was a thunderous knocking on the door below and they all looked at the television screen to see an old bag lady on the front step her voice came clearly through the speaker the lovely man you are mr kelly could you spare a poor soul a quid mcguire said into the microphone piss off you old bag oh jesus mr kelly ill die here on your step in this terrible cold so i will for the whole world to see mcguire got up ill go and get rid of her ill only be a minute he hurried down the stairs and extracted a fivepound note from an old wallet as he approached the door he got it open and held it out take this and clear off dillons hand came up out of the plastic shopping bag holding the colt a fiver tommy boy youre getting generous in your old age inside he pushed him through and closed the door mcguire was terrified look what is this nemesis dillon said you pay for your sins in this life tommy we all do remember that night in seventytwo you me and patrick when we shot the stewarts as they ran out of the fire dillon mcguire whispered its you he started to turn and raised his voice devlin he called dillon shot him twice in the back breaking his spine driving him on his face as he got the door open behind him devlin appeared on the landing the luger in his hand already firing dillon fired three times rapidly shattering the office window then was outside slamming the door behind him as he started up the street two strippeddown landrovers four soldiers in each turned out of the main road attracted by the sound of the firing and came toward him the worst kind of luck but dillon didnt hesitate as he came to a drain in the gutter he pretended to slip and dropped the colt through the bars as he got up someone called stay where you are they were paratroopers in camouflage uniforms flak jackets and red berets each man with his rifle ready and dillon gave them the performance of his life he staggered forward moaning and crying and clutching at the young lieutenant in charge jesus sir theres terrible things going on back there in that warehouse theres me sheltering from the cold and these fellas come on and start shooting each other the young officer smelled the whisky and pushed him away check whats in the carrier sergeant the sergeant rifled through bottle of hooch and some newspapers sir right go and wait over there the officer pushed dillon along the pavement behind the patrol and got a loudhailer from one of the landrovers you inside he called throw your weapons out through the door then follow them with your hands up two minutes or well come in to get you all members of the patrol were in a readiness posture intent only on the entrance dillon eased back into the courtyard turned and hurried past devlins taxi finding what he was seeking in seconds a manhole cover he got it up and went down a steel ladder pulling the cover behind him it had been a way in which he had evaded the british army on many occasions in the old days and he knew the system in the falls road area perfectly the tunnel was small and very dark he crawled along it aware of the sound of rushing water and came out on the sloping side of a larger tunnel the main sewer there were outlets to the canal that ran down to belfast lough he knew that he pulled off the skirt and the wig and threw them in the water using the headscarf to wipe his lips and face vigorously then he hurried along the side until he came to another steel ladder he started up toward the rays of light beaming in through the holes in the cast iron waited a moment then eased it up he was on a cobbled pathway beside the canal the backs of decaying boardedup houses on the other side he put the manhole back in place and made for the falls road as fast as possible in the warehouse the young officer stood beside mcguires body and examined mary tanners id card its perfectly genuine she said you can check and these two theyre with me look lieutenant youll get a full explanation from my boss thats brigadier charles ferguson at the ministry of defence all right captain he said defensively im only doing my job its not like the old days here you know we have the ruc on our backs every death has to be investigated fully otherwise theres the devil to pay the sergeant came in the colonels on the wire boss fine the young lieutenant said and went out brosnan said to devlin do you think it was dillon a hell of a coincidence if it wasnt a bag woman devlin shook his head whod have thought it only dillon would be capable are you trying to say he came over from london specially mary demanded he knew what we were about thanks to gordon brown and how long is the scheduled flight from london to belfast brosnan asked an hour and a quarter which means hes got to go back she said perhaps liam devlin nodded but nothings absolute in this life girl youll learn that and youre dealing with a man whos kept out of police hands for twenty years or more all over europe well its time we got the bastard she looked down at mcguire not too nice is it the violence the killing drink with the devil and this is what it comes down to devlin told her dillon went in through the back door of the hotel at exactly twofifteen and hurried up to his room he stripped off the jeans and jumper put them in the case and shoved them up into a cupboard above the wardrobe he washed his face quickly then dressed in white shirt and tie dark suit and blue burberry he was out of the room and descending the back stairs briefcase in hand within five minutes of having entered he went up the alley turned into the falls road and started to walk briskly within five minutes he managed to hail a taxi and told the driver to take him to the airport the officer in charge of army intelligence for the belfast city area was a colonel mcleod and he was not the least bit pleased with the situation with which he was confronted it really isnt good enough captain tanner he said we cant have you people coming in here like cowboys and acting on your own initiative he turned to look at devlin and brosnan and with people of very dubious background into the bargain there is a delicate situation here these days and we do have the royal ulster constabulary to placate they see this as their turf yes well thats as may be mary told him but your sergeant outside was kind enough to check on flights to london for me theres one at fourthirty and another at sixthirty dont you think it would be a good idea to check out the passengers rather thoroughly were not entirely stupid captain ive already put that in hand but im sure i dont need to remind you that we are not an army of occupation there is no such thing as martial law here its impossible for me to close down the airport i dont have the authority all i can do is notify the police and airport security in the usual way and as youve been at pains to explain where this man dillon is concerned we dont have much to tell them his phone went he picked it up and said brigadier ferguson sorry to bother you sir colonel mcleod belfast hq we appear to have a problem but dillon at the airport had no intention of returning on the london flight perhaps he could get away with it but madness to try when there were other alternatives it was just after three as he searched the departure board hed just missed the manchester flight but there was a flight to glasgow due out at threefifteen and it was delayed
