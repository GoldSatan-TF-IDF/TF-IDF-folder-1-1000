sophie littlefield survivors book in the aftertime series an aftertime novella at first glance everyone thought he was a girl it was the hairso long and glossy that even disheveled and dirty and badly cut you wanted to touch it brush it braid itand those beautiful wide brown eyes with the impossibly long fringe of lashes the presence of a childcasss daughter ruthie was the only other one and she almost didnt count being barely three and not having the words to describe the worlds new horrorsthis had a discomfiting effect on people and the old woman wasnt dead though she looked it her mouth was slack and flies buzzed around her eyes it was faye who carried her walking in a crouching gait to minimize the jouncing but still the old womans head and limbs swayed and joggled in the raiders arms her hair was thin her skin slack and pouchy cass watched along with the others when they carried the two squatters in nearly unconscious from dehydration and exhaustion the boy had been keeping vigil next to his grandmother when they found him at that point he was so weak and so tired that he didnt hear the raiders come in didnt panic and bolt even when they came up the stairs even though it could have been anyone human or inhuman the boy hadnt left the stinking befouled mattress where she lay hastings used one of his few remaining saline bags and a precious needle on the grandmother but given the boys youth they took a chance forcing him to sip water and nibble at kaysev cakes a good gamblewithin hours his milky eyes cleared and his color returned and he plowed through the snack packs of crackers and nuts donated by the boxs merchants this really was the best treatment anyone could hope for aftertime while this was going on people wandered past the cinderblock medical cottage with greater frequency than usual not lingering but flicking glances at the narrow windows set high in the rough walls before continuing on their way to the comfort tents or the merchant stalls or the worn walking path around the perimeter of the box the box was a haven for addicts for people seeking oblivion for shysters and sharks and whores it was a place where you could buy anything that aftertime grudgingly offered except hope what role could a boy of seven or eight have in such a place as the afternoon wore on cass worked in the raised garden beds with ruthie playing nearby on a quilt spread over the earth it was warm for late septemberindian summer they used to call itand people came out of the tents and sheds and milled around in the common areas near enough that cass could hear their voices carried on the wind and sense their collective restlessness waiting for the spoils of the raid to be sorted and catalogued and distributed to the merchants waiting to barter and buy or for those with nothing to trade just to look to wish to covet there was little enough in the way of entertainment to be found cass remembered a book shed read in elementary school about a girl who lived in a longago western frontier town next to a railroad twice a week the train would stop and the townspeople would leave off what they were doing and come to watch the passengers who left the cars to stretch their legs to catch a glimpse of the belongings they carried with them and imagine where they might be going who they might meet at the other end of their journey it was the girls only contact with the world outside the town a notion that had stunned cass cass whose own father left for weeks at a time to travel the west coast with his band and sent her postcards from canada and oregon and mexico someday when she was old enough cass meant to go along with her daddy and see these things for herself who could have guessed that two decades later she and everyone else would be as isolated as the little girl in the book there were a variety of distractions on offer drugs and alcohol scavenged and raided and even manufactured from kaysevand that made the sameness palatable for some but cass could not partake of the boxs principal trade she had had to give up drinking she had her work in the gardens and she had her daughter and she had smoke and those had to be enough still she too was lured by the promise of a spectacle no matter how familiar last week the raiders brought jars of mucinex stool softener glucosamine and chondroitina treasure trove of geriatric unguents and salves but since most of the elderly were deadleveled by the fever abandoned to the beaters dead from suicide and stroke and heart failurethese were met with jeers still the raid on a convalescent home eight miles down the road had also yielded painkillers and sleep aids several cases of ensure and a dizzying variety of prescription meds these had been locked in a pharmacy whose complex security measures had apparently fended off everyone whod attempted to loot the place before but dors men were well armed with crowbars and sledges and lock toolsnot to mention unusual levels of training and testosterone or in fayes case just plain fearlessness cass had spent the day digging invasive oxalis out of the gardens reflecting on the irony that as the earth began to recover from the bioterror attacks that had decimated most of californias plants it was the weeds that were among the first to return funny since the toxins that had rained down on the crops during the siege had been formulated by scientists who once worked in industrial weed abatement oxalis was quite pretty as weeds went with its shamrockshaped leaves and tiny yellow flowers it was also among the most difficult to control neglect an oxalis runner at your peril it would send a taproot so far into the earth that pulling it carelessly meant that its root would snap and branch out and the plant would come back threefold not as bad still as missing a root of the blueleaf kaysev cass had an excellent angled weeding knife and a stirrup hoe that smoke had found in a potting shed in the ritzy festival hill neighborhood a few miles off she wore a tool apron tied around her waist painters pants cut off midthigh in a nod to the unseasonably warm weather her shears and a compact pruning saw hanging from the loops but her favorite implement for weeding was an old stainless butter knife that smoke had notched and bent for herits blade slim enough to go deep in the earth and its point dull enough to avoid slicing through the roots each time she grasped its familiar handle it brought smoke to mind calming her restlessness working the ruined earth helped pass the time while she waited for news everyone was moved by a child of coursehow could one not be it was true that people with children avoided the boxits culture was hardly family friendly still survivors traumatized or drunk or stoned though they might be could not harden their hearts in the presence of little ones feofor that was his name whispered from tent to tenthad the wide brown eyes that glinted gold in the firelight and the glossy blackbrown mop of hair that lay in abundant masses on his thin shoulders that made many of the women in the box twitch their fingers with griefstained memories of braiding their own lost childrens hair those women turned away bent double by the agony of their memories they took another hit or swallow or hoarded pill but casss own child was safe and as the afternoon shadows lengthened into evening she began to wonder if she should be part of what was unfolding if she ought to help a mother who was not hobbled by griefin the box she was the rarest of human resources she wiped her hands and packed her tools recited the compressed prayer of gratitude for her daughters safety that was a thousand words in a sigh lifted ruthie into her arms and went looking for the boy its policy fayes voice carried over the gravel bed fronting the trailer where dor made his home owner proprietor mayor leader foremanwhatever he wasdor was the heart of the box and the source of its power and as he stood with arms folded across his chest listening to the raiders make their case he was something akin to olympian as well george and threehigh and samcass was surprised to see sam there because sam was a quiet one and not given to opinions faye and smoke flanked dor on either side if you were new to the box if you had just arrived hoping to trade the last precious belongings you carried in a wheeled suitcase or a gym bag or a childs backpack for a few nights of safety a meal a highif you didnt know better you might read tension into this scene you might suppose that faye and smoke and dor meant to face down the others who stood exhausted on their feet and stinking of sweat and fear the perfume of every raid but it wasnt like that not really smoke was a good man and fair given to contemplation the first to listen and late with an opinion when he did talk he had a softspoken command that could quiet a gathering instantly everyone straining to hear when he was wrong he owned it but that was not often and he was casss own her hearts solace faye was quicker tempered a fiery woman who threw fuel on her losses and grief each day by walking her solitary beat around the outside of the box her hand on the holster at her belt faye loved to kill beaters screaming out her rage at everything that had been taken from her as she gunned down and hacked at the creatures that had lost their humanity for a flesh hunger but she was ready to lend anyone a hand with any undertaking and she was gentle with ruthie the six of them all worked together even dor they trained together buried the dead and shared gate duty and got drunk on kaysev wine they were each others family their consolation as members of dors security detail they possessed a fierce unity which wasnt to say that they agreed on everythingfar from it but they had found a rhythm a way to talk things out and they always came to an accommodation of one sort or another they would not fight among themselves when there was so much to fight outside the tenfoothigh chainlink walls no kids faye said pointedly fixing her gaze on dor the policy she spoke of was hisas were all policies even if they were rooted in public discussion what dor said became law and the unspoken subtext was that if you didnt like it there was the wideopen world out there elsewhere for you to go and form your own opinions theres ruthie sam said quietly not arguing not pleading something in the middle cass couldnt see his expression through his dark glasses but she didnt need to in order to know what he was asking moving slowly down the path because of her daughters weight in her arms she stopped short of the cleared space semihidden by the farthest row of tents until that moment she hadnt been trying to hide her approach but now she hesitated in the shadows avoiding the wide pool of yellow light cast by the xenon bulb wired over the door of dors trailer he ran it off his own private generator the perk of authority his home alone was lit up bright every night as he dreamed his solitary dreams within cass did not breathe hearing her daughters name the only child in the box ruthie was tolerated only because she was swept in on the terrible wave of events that brought cass and smoke here a month ago ruthie had been stolen by the religious order living in the stadium across the street cass had snuck in and taken her back in the process killing several of the orders most dangerous leaders among box citizens casss actions were counted a win a miracle a rare enough reason to celebrateso when she brought ruthie into the box not yet three years old shaved bald and made silent as a stone there had been rejoicing for ruthie symbol of victory over a vile neighbor exceptions had been made and no one complained not even dor who might have lamented the resulting loss of trade with the convent it helped that ruthie was silent and shy that she ate little and demanded nothing it helped even more that smoke was with her and that he was so valuable to dor but feo had not come in triumph he was merely one more spoil of a raid an incidental that came at a significant cost since he would have to be fed and clothed and would require far more sustenance than ruthie and what of the old woman there were few tasks left for the old and this one looked too weak even to shell kaysev beans or fold clothes on the fence drying lines a bad smell wafted from her she had soiled herself not once but many times and though cass didnt doubt that the boy had done his best a woman that far gone could not last long under the care of a onceuponatime orthopedist with a painkiller habit let us take him tonight smoke suggested quietly cass and i will find out what his story is and then we can all talk again tomorrow when we know more makes no sense to decide now its getting dark and folks need to be getting to bed and its not like either of them are going anywhere if faye objected she kept it to herself sam brought the boy out from the medical shed dressed in a borrowed sweater that hung off his bony frame someone had combed his hair and washed his hands when sam said goodbye he crouched down to look in feos eyes but the boy turned away and stared at a rusty nail that had been pounded flat against a post his fingers ruffled the hem of the borrowed sweater so gently that he might have been petting a newborn chick he came with them without objection though when smoke outlined the simple plan he could see his grandmother in the morning there would be food in the tent in case he was hungry if he needed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night smoke would take him he would not be left alone not even for a minute feo listened and at the end of smokes little speech he was silent for a moment then he shrugged okay in the time it took to walk to their tent ruthie heavy and sleepy in casss arms they found out that he was almost nine that the old woman was his fathers mother and spoke no english he described what had happened to her by hooking a finger in the corner of his mouth and tugging it down pulling at the skin under his eye a stroke then though neither smoke nor cass said the word when smoke asked feo how long shed been that way he shrugged again a gesture that cass realized constituted the better part of his repertoire i dont know he said to the ground what day is today cass and smoke exchanged a glance in fact they knew the answer tuesday september if anyone cared was it more than a day or two smoke pressed maybefive or seven inside the tent cass showed feo the beautiful soft oriental carpet that had come from an earlier raid on festival hill and told him he could sleep there that she would borrow some blankets and a pillow ruthie had fallen asleep in her arms so cass settled her into the small bed that had been fashioned from a shipping crate feo stared at her with mild interest this is my daughter ruthie cass explained she can sleep through just about anything once she goes down so its okay if we talk i had a sister before there was nothing to say to that of course why dont we get you a shower smoke suggested gathering his kit a plastic tub containing a cake of kaysev soap two folded cloths a disposable razor whose blade had been carefully removed and sharpened several times youre kind of tough on the sinuses cass opened her mouth to protest to say that no it was fine fearing wounding the skinny boys feelings further but feo abruptly laughed showing strong white teeth it was true he smelled terrible the odor lingering in the tent after the two left cass laid her hand gently on ruthies face feeling her soft skin the regular pulse in the hollow of her jaw before slipping out on her own errand leaving one canvas flap rolled and tied to let in air aftertime parents lucky enough to still have surviving children took to sleeping with them sandwiched between them one arm draped across the only precious thing they had left and the other curved around a trigger or blade beaters and marauders and all the other evils that invaded shelters made deep sleep a lost art fear pressed at your nostrils and lungs when you drifted off and was lying in wait when you startled awake dreams disappeared and even the nightmares receded as one desperate day melted into the next but in the box it was possible to sleep again no beater could scale the tall razortopped fences no outsider made it inside the front gates without surrendering his weapons those who drank or got high spent their restless nights and deadlimbed stupors in the cots that edged the front wall or in the nightly rental tents or slumped against the logs circling the bonfire the innermost neighborhood of tents the ones reinforced with posts and plywood and plastic tarps were the domain of the boxs permanent employees and they looked out for each other someone was always awake reading in front of his tent or walking the edge of that little neighborhood no outsider stood a chance of getting in ruthie was perfectly safe sleeping in the tent open to the stardusted night if she were to wake and cry or even whimper coral anne in the next tent over would be at her side holding her shushing her until smoke or cass returned cass slipped between the tents her feet sure and quick it was a perfect september evening warm and scented with the burntspice smell of flannel bush and wild sage native species that had started to return as summer gave way to autumn if you shut your eyes you could almost believe it was last year or the year before or a year in your childhood when you rode your bike along mountain blacktop and squirrels threw pinecones from tall branches and chattered and you waded into cold streams to wash away the rich red dirt caked on your ankles as a child maybe you stood in a stream with the shock of the cold making you shriek and your friends called you chicken they dared you to lie down on the currentsmooth stones and let the icy water wash over making a mermaid of you your long hair splayed in wet and curling tendrils you never guessed that the world would end before you were thirty everything you ever knew nations unleashing famine and war as an appetizer for a main course of the horrors that no one could have ever imagined no people falling sick with the fever from blueleaf kaysev pulling at their hair picking at their skin depleting themselves until the day they were human no more and existed only to hunt for uninfected flesh you never dreamed that most of the people you knew would be dead or worse cass pushed these thoughts away as she always pushed them away and walked toward the far end of the box at the very back in neat rows were the bluetarped comfort tents and the gray medical building if there was irony in this arrangement the prostitutes living next to the healers it was lost on those who lived in the box now the whole compound had sprung up less than a year ago but in even that short span of time its early days had grown hazy its history apocryphal the only man who had been there from the start was dor and he wasnt one to talk about the past some claimed to have been with him from the beginning but cass had her doubts about most of them besides the box was a living organism its configuration shifting daily with its changing population tent stakes pulled up cots overturned brawls settled quickly by the guards leaving new welts in the earth an oasis of life in a ruined land it changed from one week to the next strangers taking the place of travelers passing through belongings bartered and trinkets displayed to entice browsers with something to trade fronting the comfort tents was a welltended path edged with smooth stones and planted with patches of babys tears that cass had cultivated in the cold frame smoke had built for her the tiny seedlings were sending down roots and starting to spread after a winter of rains and nourishment drawn into patient chilly roots they would spread into gorgeous emeraldgreen masses this spring even though casss mission was somewhat urgent she paused with her flashlight to examine the plants on her knees in the soil passing her palm gently over their fringy tops testing their narrow stems she was pleased with what she found and after a moment she got to her feet satisfied she looked down at the dirt smudged on the knees of her canvas pants no worse than the dirt that was already there since she had worked in the gardens all day and laundry day was still two days away cass heard a moan coming through the open door of the medics cottage not that moans in this section were something new yellow light spilled from the door and there were other voices voices she recognized she knocked once on the aluminum door then pushed it aside and entered hastings and francie sat on stools pulled up on opposite sides of one of the two cots where the old woman lay with a dingy white sheet pulled up to her chin francie who had been a nurses assistant at oakland childrens hospital insisted on cleanaspossible linens and dor obliged paying someone to boil them hastings the orthopedist didnt much care he traded everything he earned for whatever painkillers were on offer cass was always surprised he could still be cajoled into coming to work but thats what francie did she was a cajoler and a nagger and cass suspected a mother figure to hastings though an odd one with her storklike limbs and mannish haircut and curt ways oh francie said glancing up quickly and then back to the patch of arm that they were examining theyd got the old woman out of her clothes and into one of the hospital gowns francie had scavenged somewhere its you i was afraid sam was back wont let us alone hastings grumbled he seemed sober tonight his hands steady as he squeezed and prodded gently nothings broken anyway someone took care of this old girl until recently you get the story out of the kid not yet cass said not really because what was the story at its heart anyone could tell the basicsthat the two had been alone in that house that they had run out of food and water that the boy had been forced to choose between leaving her side to look for more and staying in that broken place watching the days cycle past through the window dawns and sunsets and his grandmother weakening and her slipping away from him the rest of the storywho had his family been before did he play with his sister in a yard did they have a dog did his father take him fishing could he skip a stone across a pond or slide into home or finish his homework in a neat handwhat could it help now still she supposed she also wanted to know it if he would tell but for now she came for news of his grandmother in case he should demand it sometime in the night a bucket at the end of the bed held dirty water rags bobbing on top evidence that theyd attempted a sponge bath the womans hair though was sodden with grease and flecked with bits of unidentifiable matter matted to her head you get her name cass asked getting a folding chair from its place along the wall she helped sometimes if hastings was too wasted holding down limbs for setting and hands for stitching she set the chair close to the bed nana hastings snapped unless you can get that kid to tell you more you should bring him in too you know francie reminded her ive seen twelve cases of ringworm in the last week i wouldnt be surprised and i should look at his teeth all of that you sound like you plan on us keepin him hastings said hes not a pet hastings shrugged ill bring him tomorrow cass promised once smoke and i get him fed and calmed down a little is that okay francie peered at her over her glasses eyebrows raised lips pursed looking for a moment like a stern librarian albeit one who was liberally inked with aftertime tattoos names of her lost twisted in a fanciful script along with trailing stems and leaves and the occasional rosebud up and down her arms and shoulders and across her collarbones she reached a long carefully manicured finger to the old womans forehead and tapped gently the woman didnt respond her head lolled on her neck as though no muscles at all surrounded it and her face was as the boy had described lax and drooping on one side cass closed one eye trying to block off the frozen half of the old womans face searching for clues in the other half as to what the woman once looked like imagining a trip to the hairdresser for a wash and set a lacy cardigan pink lipstick and a purse with a tortoiseshell handle but even in the good half of the womans face she could not make out who she used to be if beatriz makes it that long you can try hastings muttered as he gently untied the faded cotton gown so he could continue his exam beatriz her idea hastings said gruffly jabbing a finger in francies direction francie shrugged unperturbed only until we find out her real one back in the tent smoke and feo had returned the boy sat gingerly on the edge of their bed very straight as if holding his breath his long hair had been washed and hung in a dripping glossy sheet but he didnt bother to wipe away the beads of water that trailed down his face some settling in his long dark eyelashes before rolling down over his brown cheeks and solemn mouth to fall in his lap he was dressed in what looked like a womans sweat suit and cass made a mental note to tell the guys to find him something elsesomething a boy would like at least the clothes were clean smoke was turned away lining up the things on their shelf in the plastic box cass saw that there was an extra toothbrush a childs stubby purple one she and smoke and nearly everyone else in the box had switched to the ones cut from woody kaysev stems people said they did a better job even than real toothbrushes the toothbrush was a special gift something to remind the boy of before which had presumably been a better time for him so too was the privacy smoke gave him pretending indifference as he tended to his housekeeping feos hungry eyes roved over the homey inside of the tent with its treasure trove of books and pictures cut from magazines and ruthies toys the silver candlesticks and the pretty rug and the stainedglass panels the home they had made together the family they had made together a mother and daughter and the man who found them after they thought every good thing was gone cass averted her own eyes turned away and adjusted ruthies covers she recognized the longing in the boys eyes and like smoke she turned away to give him privacy to enjoy a tiny sliver of something nice a thick layer of quilts for padding and a blue comforter borrowed from coral anne a pillow with a flannel case decorated with pine trees and bears the boy slept on the rug and seemed happy to do so he said nothing when cass and smoke bid him goodnight curled into a ball whose shape underneath the covers seemed impossibly small cass watched him for a moment before blowing out the candle smokes breathing already deep and even against her back where he lay with his arms around her holding her to his chest they lay like that still in the first light of morning when cass woke momentarily to see that the boy had edged closer to their bed he had the comforter twisted around himself and one hand rested outflung where it could touch the edge of the quilt that hung down from their bed it was an awkward position but as cass watched him he slept on without moving without a twitch or a sigh where is she was the first thing the boy asked sitting up with the twisted covers at his waist his hair had dried in shiny waves and cass had to suppress a smile to think how women used to struggle so mightily to get theirs to look like that ruthie stirred at the sound of his voice but didnt wake it was still early maybe six or sixthirty smoke had brought her a cup of coffee before leaving for the alley outside the west end where he and some of the other guards practiced a brutal training regimen cass set aside the paperback she had been reading marking her place with a postcard that had fallen out of an old issue of instyle two years for the price of one it read in bold presumptive letters good morning she said softly you want to know where your grandmother is yeah he was working at the clump of covers trying to get his legs untangled he looked like he was ready to bolt and cass knelt down on the floor next to him and placed her hand gently on the covers let me help she made it a question and for a moment the boy froze staring at her hand on the blue fabric where she had taken care not to touch him even through the comforter after a moment he relaxed a little and cass tugged and pulled and the comforter came free youll be cold cass said and got a fleecelined flannel shirt of smokes from the bar hung from the roof support that served as a closet they had nice hangers sturdy wooden ones with goldtone hooks that had come home from a raid a present for cass a little joke between themsmoke brought her silly luxuries things it would have never occurred to her to buy for herself before even if she could have afforded them this will be much too large she added holding it out for the boy to put his arms into the sleeves but i think we can make it work for now and i know that smoke wont mind a bit the boy looked dubious but he was already shivering in the morning chill so he allowed cass to guide the shirt onto his thin body buttoning the front and rolling up the sleeves if feo was sent away today at least he would have this in addition to the sweater a gift from someone who wished she could have done more now as for your grandmother theyre taking good care of her we have a couple good doctors here only a little lie and medicine that was a worse lie because cass was pretty sure that none of the things they had in their stores could help what was wrong with the old woman but she needs to rest a little later ill go over there and find out when the doctors say we can visit the boy considered this his brow knitting and his deep brown eyes darkening further he rocked forward his elbows on his knees and after a moment he sighed and looked cass in the eye okay can we eat now cass had watched with silent amusement as feo worked his way through two bowls of what had become the boxs standard breakfast fare for those who could afford ita rough cereal of dried kaysev beans mixed with shredded wheat to extend it one of the cooks had spooned some honey on top winking at cass they sat at the far end of one of the tables in the dining area the buzz of the merchants and customers just getting started at this time of day the others gave them their space nodding or waving but staying well away by now everyone would know all there was to know about the boy but they seemed to sense that he was skittish and shy and there were those who preferred to be left alone with their hangovers those who had lost their taste for hope still hungry cass asked nibbling at her kaysev cake and drinking the coffee that was now lukewarm feo nodded not looking up from his bowl and cass went to get him another when she came back he was gone they had managed to squeeze quite a lot into the box despite the fact that it was no larger than a football field and a half an entire little town with commerce and public facilities and even a jail and an outdoor church nightly rental cots lined the fence near the front gate merchants sold food and drugs and alcohol and all manner of scavenged and raided merchandise out of stands cobbled together from dismantled buildings in the center a public area for dining and socializing had been decorated with plastic flags and pretty thingsmirrors silk flowers childrens toyshung from lines strung between the skeletons of trees but the place was still a box literally a walledoff square with only one way out cass didnt panic because where would feo go there was no way for him to escape into the dangers outside another irony he couldnt escape but he could be forced out by their policies still cass walked the paths between the tents and merchant stands and the worn trail around the perimeter with haste searching for a glimpse of him she went first to the medic cottage where francie met her at the door with a frownshes no better and probably worseso cass told her that feo might turn up and to be on the lookout then she started crisscrossing the box at random she found him on the stoop of the large prefab storage shed that sam and george had made into their sleeping quarters and party room they called it the officers quarters and it was where the guards did much of their drinking beds and personal space took up the back and the rest was lined with shelves holding improvised weapons and a table with half a dozen chairs in the middle an ornate antique paintedmetal candelabrum hung over the table which was speckled with wax that had dripped down there was an ongoing poker game a minifridge that was hooked up to a generator whenever the raiders brought back beer and a library of skin magazines and car and drivers and stephen king novels sam and george were an odd pairsam young and quiet and almost obsessively neat his bunk made up every morning his clothes hung on hangers from pegs and george fifteen years older and content to live in malodorous squalorbut they got along this morning george was nowhere to be seen probably off training in that damn alleyway too feo sat hunched on one side of the step smokes shirt newly rimed with dirt at the hem he was drinking from a plastic bottle of cranberryjuice cocktail with a straw as unlikely a sight as any sam sprawled next to him wearing his wraparound ski sunglasses and a ghost of a smile in cowboy boots and jeans when he saw cass he sat up straight and gave her a mock salute mornin cass good morning he only got one eye feo said with hushed awe his mouth was ringed with sticky pink he showed me thats right sam said tapping the frayed patch beneath his pricey sunglasses the patch that he never took off sam had lost an eye in the yemen rice war likely treated by a field surgeon low on supplies and backup like everything else in that fiasco of a war cass had never seen their handiwork and the fact that sam had showed the boy struck her as extraordinary i told him you got to watch where youre goin around here be careful not to walk into any knifethrowing competitions i could throw a knife feo said i bet i could yeah buddy i bet you could sam took off his sunglasses and looked meaningfully at cass i thought id give feo a tour of the place here in a while cass saw how it wasit was written as plain as a sign in front of her face the boy wanted a big brother a favorite uncle hell maybe even a father his instincts took him straight to sam and sam bloomed with the attention it was almost heartbreaking to see the way his good eye was bright with purpose the barely concealed excitement under his facade of detachment and casual brio cass had long felt that hethe youngest of the guards and the most introspectivewas vulnerable he still wore his unspoken losses on the outside in his quietly deliberate way as though it hurt him merely to move through life hes gone from fighting for a country that no longer existed to fighting for his existence shed worried about him turning to drugs like so many people did in an attempt to erase the pain of loss and grief which made it all the harder to say what needed to be said maybe after feos all settled in somewhere nice he could come back for a visit with you guys she said carefully sam dropped his gaze to the ground chastened he accepted the rebuke they both knew that dors rules were absolute he was not a heartless leader and cass recognized that making the hardest choices was part of what made him a great one children had no place in what went on here someday soon when ruthie was a little older there would be a reckoning even for her and smoke dor would find a humane solutionas humane as possible anyway she supposed that as soon as the old woman died dor would send the boy out with one of the guards to find a good shelter where children were welcome even if that was ten miles away thirty whatever it took the man was generous in his own way though he preferred it not be widely known well she said why dont i let the two of you finish your drink and ill come back for feo in a bit okay the boy said quietly sam only nodded and put his glasses back on and cass turned away a little more time together was a small kindness it was rare enough to be able to do anything at all for anyone anymore cass had learned to take such opportunities when they came just as she reached her tentshe was barely through the door ruthies name on her lipsthe alarm sounded a series of bells strung around the box the effect was almost medieval the clanging strident and urgent and echoing from all corners once the first peal struck beaters a dozen times since she and smoke arrived they had come close enough to the fences to pose an immediate threat nearly always early in the morning drawn out by the light of day when the first rays of the sun reached the oncehuman things they left the stinking nests where they slept sprawled and entwined together for warmth they woke blinking and hungry and stumbled to their feet to venture out into the wrecked streets grunting and cawing pushing at each other and picking at their scalps and their scabbed and decaying arms mostly the beaters stayed clear of the boxs line of sight theyd learned that the danger was too great that the guards were all crack shots who could drop them even from a distance the killing shot in the base of the spine or the head so they waited for travelers hiding clumsily behind the leanto shacks and rundown cabins on the outskirts of town sometimes too in the alleyways or storefronts of the oncebustling city around them every week or so some poor soul on his way to the box would die horribly in the last half mile of his journey but once in a while inexplicably a cluster of them would risk approaching maybe they hoped for a break in the fence or to catch a guard unawares or a citizen out for a walk maybe it was raw animal hunger dor did not forbid his employees and customers to come and go but it always surprised cass just how many did maybe the adrenaline rush of walking past the gates was just another kind of drug maybe it was an exercise in despair the alarm didnt necessarily mean someone had been attacked only that beaters had been spotted nearby and as cass ran to the clearing along one side of the box with everyone else she prayed not smoke not smoke not smoke people were already milling around voices raised in fear everyone asking each other where the disturbance was when a shout went up from the west side the crowd turned as one and swarmed toward the fence you would think people would stay in their tents cover their ears and wait it out by now six months after the first beaters appeared everyone knew what an attack meant it was nothing youd ever want to see twice and yet no one seemed able to look away for cass who had the dubious distinction of being one of the only people ever to survive an attackof being bitten and infected and yet healed by some genetic crapshotthe memories were especially terrifying not smoke not smoke whod been out there she ran to the side of the crowd dodging stragglers and slow movers and sprinted past them all her lungs screamed for air and her boots pounded the hardpacked dirt sending shocks through her body but she reached the front and was among the first to reach the fence her momentum drove her into the chain link and she grabbed the wire in her fists and pulled herself up a few feet to get a clear view down the block there there eight of them their excited crowing filling the air their hair matted and their skin torn and crusted they were dressed in rags one of them had lost most of the skin of one arm and the bones showed through as it dangled uselessly another had had its face bashed in its cheek and jaw a pulped mess and still it clawed and shrieked they were stampeding after a screaming man one of them having seized the tail of his jacket with a crabbed and bony hand the man was desperately trying to shrug off the jacket but either the zipper was stuck or his terror prevented him from unfastening it as cass watched two of the other beaters threw themselves on him and he went down and then they were all upon him trying to get a grip on his arms and legs as he thrashed on the ground cass saw blood bloom on his exposed hands as he beat them against the concrete but it was no use one of the creatures took his armpits and others each took a foot and they lifted him into the air as the rest of them pushed and crowed reaching with greedy hands they meant to carry him back to their nest to feast to tear the flesh from his body with their teeth while he was still alive it wasnt smoke and despite her horror at the poor mans fate cass sagged in relief the victim had fair hair cut close sagging camo pants not someone cass knew he had to be recently arrived or a traveler who hoped to become a fellow citizen he was screaming without cease his voice distinct from the inhuman cries of the beaters and their almost lascivious excitement and thenabruptlyhe stopped a shot there had been a shot and there followed two more and the beaters who had been carrying the doomed man dropped him and one of them fell on top of him and rolled away dead most of the others ran tripping over each other and loping clumsily around the corner behind an apartment building splattering blood further down the street but one stayed behind his savaged face dark with rage and hunger as he screamed and tugged at the victims pant leg pulling the body along the street a few feet until finally he too gave up and loped away two men came sprinting from the sidecass hadnt noticed them they must have been crouched along the fenceand this time it was smoke and threehigh with his long gray ponytail and they ran crouched low and ready to shoot again they reached the man and smoke lifted him up over his shoulders and threehigh put one more bullet in one of the downed beaters heads and it exploded on the asphalt like a water balloon filled with blood someone on the ground behind cass vomited and she whispered a guilty prayer of thanks that smoke had been spared once again and stepped out of the sick womans way feo must have bolted again when the commotion started as cass followed the crowd away from the fence she saw sam tackle him lifting him as though he weighed nothing and holding him tightly in his arms cass caught up with sam while the crowd surged past on their way back to wherever theyd come from the boy was trembling in sams arms did he see she asked quietly yes unfortunately and casshe knew that guy before are you sure yes when he saw the beaters go after him he started yelling tío tíoi think that means uncle aw shit cass whispered nanaaaaa the boy wailed his voice muffled by sams shirt after trying in vain to get him calmed down cass and sam decided there was nothing for it but to take him to the clinic to see the old woman when they arrived smoke and threehigh were standing outside talking with dor smoke was the first to see them coming and he jogged over to her and held her and understood how great her fear had been and he whispered over and over that he was all right everything would be all right when she pulled back and looked into his face she knew the truth you had to end him didnt you hed been bitten did you do it or threehigh smoke looked away and that was her answer smoke was strong that wayhe knew that death was a mercy for an infected citizen that otherwise the fever would begin within hours and the victim would twitch and babble and pick at his own skin and his flesh hunger would grow and so smoke gave the gift of death swift and sure cass nodded tears stinging her eyes but there would be time later to wonder how much another death had cost smoke whether it played upon his soul and poisoned his dreams for now there were the living to be tended she entered the cottage the others following close behind feo knelt next to his grandmothers bed sobbing quietly sam crouched next to him his hand on the boys shoulder francie stood at the head of the bed her arms folded her face tired when she saw cass she frowned and shook her head and cass knew the old woman was dead hed lost everything then the last family he would ever know had died today cass couldnt bear it she turned on dor her face tight with anguish trying to find the right words but smoke put a hand around hers and stepped between them the guythe one outside the fencethat was his uncle he said quietly dor nodded heavily as though the worst news had lost the power to surprise him for a moment silhouetted in the sunlight streaming through the door he looked all too human his shoulders sagging and his hands hanging useless at his sides the boy can stay he said and then left without another word cass watched him go her heart quickening the possibilities flashing through her mind but as they knelt on the bare wood floor feo burrowed into sams arms and sambarely more than a boy himselfheld on so thats how it was to be in that moment the small idea that had been taking shape in casss mindher and smoke and two children a growing familyshifted and faded feo needed things she could not give in sam the boy found something familiar something he could hold on to who could say whyevery citizen aftertime had been altered by their own losses their own devastations smoke and cass left quietly hand in hand outside it was shaping up to be another warm autumn day the air was fragrant with the smell of kaysev cakes frying on a griddle and they walked hand in hand back to the tent ruthie would wake soon and they would take her to the clearing for breakfast and it would be all right later cass and ruthie would go to the gardens to pick mint leaves they would boil water and make a big batch of tea in the plastic pitcher and cass would add a few spoonfuls from her precious stash of sugar they would carry the tea down to the officers quarters and it would be a gift for mourning and new beginnings both
