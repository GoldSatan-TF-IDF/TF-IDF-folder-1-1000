w e b griffin final justice one one it was sunday night and at quarter after eleven the roy rogers restaurant at south broad and snyder streets in south philadelphia was just about full amal al zaid who was five feet seven inches tall and weighed pounds and who had spent sixteen of his twentyone years as dwayne alexander finston before converting to islam was mopping a spill from the floor just outside the kitchen door when he glanced at the clock mounted high on the wall near the front entrance to the restaurant the first thing he thought was that he had fortyfive minutes to go on his shift and then he would be free to ride his bicycle home to the apartment he shared with his mother two brothers and a sister in the tasker homes project a few blocks away grab a quick shower and then go by the mosque to see what was happening the second thing he thought wasthose two is bad news amal al zaid had seen two young men enter the restaurant both were in their early twenties one was of average height and build and the other short and overweight both of them stopped one at a time just inside the door and looked around the restaurant and then at each other and then nodded the averagelooking one slid into a banquette near the door the sortoffat one who had something wrapped in a newspaper sticking out of his jacket pocket walked all the way through the restaurant toward where amal al zaid was mopping the floor by the kitchen door amal al zaid then pushed the right door to the kitchen open and held it open while he pushed his mop bucket on wheels through it after a moment amal al zaid peered carefully through the small window in the kitchen door he saw that the short fat guy had taken a seat in the last banquette on the left with his back to the kitchen wall and he saw the short fat guy pull whatever he had wrapped in newspaper from his pocket and lay it on the banquette seat and then amal al zaid saw what it was a shortbarreled revolver holy shit zaid said barely audibly and turned and looked around the kitchen the kitchen supervisor maria manuela fernandez a thirtyfiveyearold in immaculate kitchen whites who carried pounds on her fivefootthree frame was a few steps away examining the latest serving trays to come out of the dishwasher zaid went to her touched her arm and when she turned to him said manuela i think were getting stuck up mrs fernandezs eyebrows rose theres a fat guy with a gun in the last booth zaid said pointing at the wall and theres another guythey came in togetherin the first booth on the right by the front door mrs fernandez walked quickly and looked through the window in the door then went to a wallmounted telephone near the door and dialed mrs fernandezs call was answered on the second ring by miss eloise t regis in the radio room of the philadelphia police department on the second floor of the police administration building at eighth and race streets in downtown philadelphia the police administration building is universally known in philadelphia as the roundhouse because the building has virtually no straight wallsexterior or interioror corridors even the interiors of the elevators are curved within the radio room are rows of civilian employees who under the supervision of a few sworn police officers sit at telephone and radio consoles receiving calls from the public and from police vehicles on the job and relaying official orders to police vehicles there are twentytwo police districts in philadelphia and six divisions of detectives there is also the special operations division which includes the highway patroldespite its name far more of an elite force than one concerned with highway trafficand the special investigations unit the traffic and accident divisions actually have the primary responsibility for the publics safety on the highways and streets of philadelphia their tools include a fleet of radioequipped tow trucks and other special vehicles the juvenile division is charged with dealing with crimes committed againstor byjuveniles additionally there are specialpurpose units such as the k unit the marine unit the airport unit and the vice narcotics organized crime and dignitary protection unitsand others each district division and special unit has its own complement of radioequipped police vehicles of all sorts and on top of this of course is the communications network necessary to maintain roundtheclock instantaneous contact with the vehicles of the senior command hierarchy of the police department the commissioner and his staff the deputy commissioners and their staffs the chief inspectors and their staffs and a plethora of other senior police officers with hundreds of police and support vehicles on the job at any one time it was necessary to develop both by careful planning and by trial and error a system permitting instant contact with the right vehicle at the right time the police commissioneror the commanding officer of the marine unitis not really interested in learning instantly about every automobile accident in philadelphia nor is a request from the airport police for a paddy wagon to haul off three drunks from their bailiwick of much interest to a detective investigating a burglary in chestnut hill philadelphia is broken down for police department purposes into eight geographical divisions and the park division each division is headed by an inspector and contains from two to four districts each commanded by a captain generally each division has its own radio frequency but in some divisions really busy districtsthe twentyfifth district in the east division for examplehave their own separate frequencies detectives cars and those assigned to other investigative units narcotics intelligence organized crime et cetera have radios operating on the hband all police car radios can be switched to an allpurpose emergency and utility frequency called the jband special operations division has its own the sband for example a police officer in the sixteenth district would routinely have his radio switch set to fl which would permit him to communicate with his the west division switching to f would put him on the universal jband a car assigned to south philadelphia with his switch set to fl would be in contact with the south division a detective operating anywhere with his switch set to fl would be on the detectives hband but he too by switching to f would be on the jband senior police officers have more sophisticated radios and are able to communicate with other senior police brass the detective frequency or on the frequency of some other service in which they have a personal interest ordinary police cars are required to communicate through the dispatcher and forbidden to talk cartocar cartocar communication is authorized on the j h and sbands communications discipline is strictly enforced otherwise there would be communications chaos there is provision however for a radio room dispatcher simply by throwing the appropriate switchto send a radio message simultaneously to every radioequipped police vehicle from a police boat making its way against the current of the delaware river through the hundreds of police cars on patrol to the commissioners and mayors cars this most often happens when an operator takes a call in which the calling party says officer needs assistance shots fired not every call to requesting police assistance is legitimate philadelphia has its fair share of lunaticssome say more than its fair sharewho like to involve the cops in any number of things having nothing whatever to do with maintaining the peace and tranquillity within the city of brotherly love and philadelphias youth having watched cop movies on television to learn the cant dial ten or twelve times every day to report a murder a body a robbery a car accident anything that will cause a flock of police cars lights flashing and sirens screaming to descend on a particular street corner and liven up an otherwise dull period of the day the people who answer the telephones didnt come to work yesterday howevermiss eloise t regis for example had been on the job for more than twenty yearsand usually theyknow from the timbre of the callers voice or the assurance with which the caller raises the alarm that this particular call is legitimate when miss regis answered the call from an excited latinosounding lady reporting a robbery in progress at the roy rogers at broad and snyder she hadknown the call was genuine at a call went out from police radio possible armed robbery in progress roy rogers restaurant broad and snyder unknown civilian by phone officer kenneth j charlton of the first district then patrolling the area responded one seven in on the roy rogers as mrs fernandez was speaking excitedly with miss regis there was the sound of a shot and some unintelligible shouts the door to the kitchen burst open and the fat guy with the gun came through it he saw mrs fernandez on the telephone and when she saw him she dropped the handset and moved away from the telephone placing her back against the wall near the telephone the fat guy went to the handset dangling from the wall phone put it to his ear listened a momentjust long enough to be able to determine with whom mrs fernandez was speakingthen grabbed the coiled expansion cord and ripped it free from the telephone then he looked at mrs fernandez and said you fucking bitch and raised his revolver to arms length and fired at her the bullet struck her just below her left ear and exited her skull just above her right ear her convulsing body slid down the wall until her knees were fully bent and then it fell forward onto the floor the fat guy then brandished his revolver at the other kitchen workers there were six three men and three women the fat guy had not seen amal al zaid when he had shoved the kitchen door open he had done so with such force that it went past the spring stop causing it to remain in the open position at a right angle to the doorway amal al zaid was behind it his back pressed against the wall literally paralyzed by fear in the fucking cooler motherfuckers the fat guy said waving his revolver and gesturing toward the walkin refrigerator when the kitchen staffstumbling in their haste one of the women moaning in terror as she held both hands to her mouthhad gone inside the walkin refrigerator the fat guy walked quickly toward it closed the door and looked around the kitchen holy christ amal al zaid thought that crazy niggers going to see me the fat guy found what he wanteda woodenhandled sharpening steelon a worktable right behind him picked it up and jammed it in the loops intended for a padlock in the refrigerator door then he turned and started for the kitchen door in the logical presumption that he would be seen by the guy whod just shot manuela amal al zaid lost control of his bladder and momentarily forgot that he was no longer a christian our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name the fat guy looked to the left as he made his way across the kitchen paused briefly to look down at the body of the goddamn bitch who had called the motherfucking cops and then went through the open kitchen door into the dining area amal al zaid finally found the courage to look through the narrow crack between the door and the doorjamb and saw that the fat guy was working his way though the dining room collecting wallets and coin purses and watches and rings from the customers the other sonofabitch was at the cashiers station by the front door taking the paper money from the cash register the fat guy finished robbing the four people at the banquette he was working then walked toward the front of the restaurant lets get the fuck out of here the fat guy said fuck fuckfucking fuck its a fucking cop the guy at the register said gesturing through the window he squatted down behind the cash register the fat guy slid into the banquette nearest to him on the right at officer charlton entered the restaurant holding his service pistol at his side he glanced at the cashiers station saw the man crouching behind it and took a halfdozen steps around the cashiers station the guy at the cash register suddenly stood up lunged at officer charlton and wrapped his arms around him preventing officer charlton from raising his pistol to fire it the fat guy jumped from the banquette ran to them shoved the muzzle of his pistol under charltons bulletproof vest and fired officer charlton stiffened then went limp and fell to the floor the guy who had been behind the cash register then stepped over charltons body then he turned and fired twice at the body then he ran out of the restaurant onto south broad street after the fat guy after a moment amal al zaid pushed himself off the wall and ran to the employees locker room shit oh fuck i pissed in my pants in the employees locker room he opened his locker and took his cellular telephone from his jacket punched in and when the voice said police radio he blurted this is the roy rogers restaurant at broad and snyder two black guys just shot the kitchen lady and a cop who walked in while they was robbing us this call too coincidentally was answered by miss regis and again her experience told her the call was legitimate sergeant she called raising her voice just to get his attention not to ask his permission then she threw the appropriate switch three fast short beeps signifying an emergency message were broadcast to every police radio in philadelphia miss regis pressed the switch activating her microphone assist the officer broad and snyder inside the roy rogers report of an officer shot assist the officer broad and snyder inside the roy rogers report of an officer shot this is a civilian by phone we have officers responding to a previous call of a possible armed robbery at that location two the second vehicle to reach the roy rogers restaurant at south broad and snyder streets in response to the first possible armed robbery in progress call over the fband was a new buick rendezvous cxl sport utility vehicle on the roof of which were three antennas capable of listening to police radio frequencies a fourth antenna was mounted on the rear window and just before getting close to synder street the driver of the car switched off a flashing blue light with a magnetic base that he had put on the roof after hearing the call the driver however was not a sworn police officer of the philadelphia police department andas had often been pointed out to himusing the flashing blue light on the roof to speed ones way through traffic was in violation of at least four laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania ranging from violation of paragraph of the criminal code of pennsylvaniaimpersonation of a public official such as a police officerto violation of paragraph of the criminal codesetting up a nuisance in public the rendezvous itself and all the expensive radios and scanners were the property of thephiladelphia bulletin with whom the driver michael j mickey ohara a wiry curlyhaired man in his late thirties was professionally associated the magnetic base flashing blue light was the property of the philadelphia police department having been removed by mr ohara from a wrecked and burned unmarked car rendering him liable to charges of having violated one or more of paragraphs and of the criminal code which deal with the unlawful taking of property mr oharas association with thebulletin went back twentyone years to his sixteenth year when he was hired as a copyboy shortly after having been expelled from west catholic high school monsignor dooley had caught mickey with a pocketful of francesco frankie the gut guttermos numbers slips and when mickey had refused to name his accomplice in that illegal and immoral enterprise the monsignor had given him the boot mickey had immediately found a home in journalism and had become a reporterthebulletin said staff writer before he was old enough to vote as he had risen in the bulletin city room hierarchy his remuneration had naturally increased he had been perfectly happy with his relationship with the bulletin and the compensation he was given until his childhood friend casimir bolinski had brought the subject up face it mickey those bastards are screwing you casimir had said when passing through philadelphia to visit his parents it was more than an idle observation it was a professional one because mickey had refused to name him as his fellow numbers runner casimir already known as the bull had graduated from west catholic high gone on to notre dame on a football scholarship and from notre dame to the green bay packers there while his packers teammates had spent their off seasons in various nonproductive if pleasant pursuits casimir had studied the law he hadnt wanted to if the truth be known but mrs antoinette bolinski who weighed approximately one third as much as her husband was a woman of great determination and the bull knew better than to argue with her to his surprise casimir liked the study of law and immediately showed a flair for the business aspects of the profession the day after the packersin an emotional ceremony retired the bulls jersey casimir j bolinskid juris announced the opening of his law offices in which he intended to deal with the relationships between professional athletes and their employers he started rather naturally by representing professional football players but as word spread throughout the world of sports about how successful the bull had been in securing pay far beyond the expectations of the players professionals from baseball basketball and even a number of jockeysthe creme de la creme so to speak of the world of sportsbegan to beat a path to his door the way it is mickey casimir had explained is when i first quit the game the guys would come to see me and say how they hanging bull whats this bullshit about you being a lawyer and now they come in shaved and all dressed up in suits and say thank you very much for seeing me dr bolinski antoinette bolinski had been thrilled to find out that d juris stood for doctor of law and that she was thus entitled to refer to casimir as my husband dr bolinski she immediately began to do so the phrase had a really classy ring to it and if the other lawyers didnt want to use the title screw them as once the fabled defense of the detroit lions had crumpled before the charging bull in that nevertobeforgotten zilch game the assembled legal counsel of thebulletin gave way before dr bolinskis persuasive arguments that the few extra dollars they were going to have to spend on mickey were nothing compared to the dollars they would lose in lost circulation if mickey moved over to the inquirer or the daily news jesus youre dumb mickey casimir had said later youve got the fucking pulitzer for christs sake you should have known thats worth a whole lot of dead presidents pictures as a result of the negotiations by dr bolinski on behalf of mr ohara with thebulletin mr oharas compensation was quadrupled and it was agreed that the bulletin would provide mr ohara with a private office and an automobile of mr oharas choice equipped as mr ohara wished and that he would be reimbursed for all expenses incurred in his professional work it being clearly understood this would involve a substantial amount of business entertainment with one exception howevermickey was the sole supporter of his widowed mother and had been having a really hard time paying her tab at the cobbs creek nursing center amp retirement homehis new affluence didnt change his life much after toying with the suggestion of dr bolinski that he have thebulletin buy him either a mercedes or a cadillac mickey had chosen the buick rendezvous a caddie or a krautmobile he reasoned would piss off most of the people with whom he worked by that he meant the police officers it was saidwith more than a little justificationthat mickey knew more cops by their first names than anyone else and that more cops knew mickey by sight than they did the police commissioner mickey knew that mostcertainly not allof phillys cops liked him and he attributed this to both reciprocationhe liked most copsand to the fact that he spelled their names right got the facts right and never betrayed a confidence as he did most nights mickey ohara had been cruising the city in the rendezvous when one of the scanners had caught the possible armed robbery call he was then five blocks south of the roy rogers on south broad street possible my ass he had said aloud then put the gumball machine on the roof glanced in the rearview mirror and made an illegal uturn on broad street when he reached the roy rogers he saw there was a blueand white door open parked on snyder which told him the cops had just arrived and the possible robbery in progress was probably still in progress because the cop wouldnt have left his car door open if he hadnt been in a hell of a hurry he doubleparked on snyder beside the police car grabbed his digital camera from the passenger seat and quickly got out of the rendezvous two black guys were coming out of the restaurant in a hurry in a reflex action mickey put the digital camera to his eye and snapped a picture the short fat black guy saw him raised his arm and took a shot at mickey with a shortbarreled revolver he missed but mickey as a prudent measure dropped to the ground beside the rendezvous when he looked up both of the doers were hauling ass down snyder street mickey got to his feet ran quickly to the roy rogers and went inside just inside the door there was a cop on the floor facedown in a spreading pool of blood mickey snapped that picture and then as he was waiting for the camera to recycle to take a second shot realized he knew the dead cop he was kenny charlton of the first district sonofabitch kenny was a good guy seventeen eighteen years on the job his wife works for the ugi they have a couple of kids the green light in the camera came on and he took another picture he was about to step around the body when he sensed motion behind him and looked over his shoulder a very large black man in the peculiar uniform of the highway patrol had entered the restaurant pistol drawn another highway patrolman was on his heels i think the doers just ran down snyder mickey said pointing two black guys one short and fat two black guys sergeant wilson carter turned to the highway patrolman behind him get out a flash he ordered the second highway patrolmanmickey knew the face but couldnt come up with a nameleft the restaurant quickly sergeant carter looked down at the body of officer charlton dropped to his knees felt his carotid artery and shook his head jesus mickey what happened he asked i got here just before you did ohara said shrugging in a helpless gesture there were now the sounds of approaching sirens at least two probably three maybe more they shot somebody in the kitchen too one of the restaurant patrons called out sergeant carter looked around to see who had called out and when he did one of the patrons a very tall very thin hawkfeatured black man stood up and pointed to the kitchen sergeant carter headed for the rear of the restaurant mickey followed him holding the digital camera in his hand concealing it as well as he could carter pushed open the door and went in the kitchen mickey caught it before it closed and followed him in there was a body of a chubby woman some kind of latina on the floor her head distorted and lying in a pool of blood jesus christ sergeant carter said one of them came in the kitchen a young black guy in kitchen whites said manuela was calling the cops he shot her they all gone carter asked there was just the two of them the young black guy said theyre gone you get a good look at him them the young black guy nodded carter went back into the dining room mickey didnt follow him he took a picture of the young black guy then held up his finger signaling him not to go anywhere and then took two pictures different angles of the body on the floor then he slipped the digital camera into his pocket whats your name he asked amal al zaid you want to spell that for me mickey asked and wrote it down and then asked where he lived then he asked amal al zaid what had happened and had just about finished writing that down when three other police officers entered the kitchena lieutenant a detective and a uniform lieutenant stanley j wrigley was acquainted with mr ohara jesus christ mickey how did you get in here he asked i got here before highway mickey replied the doers were two black guys carter put out a flash you have to get out of here mickey you know that lieutenant wrigley said yeah do me a favor wrigley said go out the back door otherwise the rest of the media will bitch youre getting special treatment again yeah sure stan you get a pretty good look at the doers the detective asked not good two young black guys one of them short and fat you told that to carter wrigley asked mickey nodded thanks mick wrigley said and ohara went to the rear door of the kitchen and went through it three twelve minutes later mickey ohara walked into his glasswalled office just off the city room of thephiladelphia bulletin adjusted the venetian blinds over the glass of the windows and doors so that he could not be seen from the city room locked the door and then sat down at his personal computer switched it on and waited for it to boot up he had two computers one was tied into thebulletins network and the other was his personally while he was waiting for his personal computer to boot up he spun around in his chair and faced the bulletin computer terminal keyboard and rapidly typed ce hold me space for the double murder at the roy rogers i was there and may have pics ohara he read what he had typed then pushed the send key then he spun around in his chair again and faced his own computer this stateoftheart device which fell under the provisions of his contract for personal services with the bulletin requiring the bulletin to provide him with whatever electronic devices and other tools he considered necessary to the efficient performance of his duties was brand new it had a twentyoneinch liquid crystal diode color monitor and provided more than a hundred different typefaces each clearer and more legible than the single typeface available on the bulletins computer terminals mickey took his digital cameraanother electronic device he considered necessary for the performance of his dutiesfrom his trouser pocket carefully removed the memory chip replaced it with another megabyte memory chip and shoved the chip he had removed into the mouthit reminded him of a feeding goldfishof a device connected to the keyboard of his computer he tapped some keys which caused the jpg images on the memory chip to be transferred into his computer the quick tapping of more keys brought the images up on the lcd monitor he then removed the memory chip from the goldfishs mouth unlocked a drawer in his desk and unlocked a metal box in the drawer dropped the memory chip into it relocked it closed the desk drawer and relocked that mickey was thinking of writing a bookcasimir bolinski said he was sure he could sell it for himfor big bucks mick if you ever get off your lazy irish ass and write a proposaland if he did he would need the pictures he tapped keys again and a photoediting program came up on the lcd monitors screen the first picture of the two black guys coming out of the roy rogers appeared it was really a lousy picture understandable in the circumstances for one thing he had thrown the viewfinder to his eye with such haste that the picture was cockeyed the two doers appeared in the lower right quarter of the picture and only from the waist up far worse the cameras internal light meter had detected the bright light coming from the door decided that was the ambient light and set the camera accordingly the entrance to the restaurant appeared in near perfect clarity but the two doers were not in the light from the door and consequently they could hardly be seen you could see it was two guys but you couldnt see any facial details mickey quite skillfully tried to fix it using all of the capabilities of the photoediting program he lightened the two guys that didnt work neither did darkening the perfectly captured restaurant entrance he tried everything else he could think of but nothing worked finally he gave up he cropped out the unnecessary background typed keys that renamed jpg to doersxrr jpg then pressed the enter key then he pushed other keys which ordered yet another electronic device necessary to the performance of his duties to print three copies eight by ten inches dots per square inch a electronic device hummed and clicked as it began to execute the order jpg and jpgthe pictures of the body of officer kenneth j charlton the poor bastard lying dead at the entrance of the roy rogersalso required editing he first made a copy of each as they had come from the camera renaming them chardwnjpg and chardwnjpg respectively and ordered three eightbyten copies of each at dots per square inch then he went back to each picture in turn cropped out unnecessary background very carefully edited the picture so that officer charltons eyes appeared to be closed not twisted in agony and then made the pool of blood in which charltons head was lying disappear he then renamed these pictures charbuljpg and charbuljpg ordered the printing of one eightbyten of each and also sent the pictures by the internet to oharaphillybulletincom he did much the same thing with the other picturesthose of that poor dame in the kitchen and the young black kid that he had made with the digital camera although a somewhat complicated process doing everything took him less than ten minutes he had a good deal of experience doing the same sort of thing and of course he had literally the best equipment thebulletins money could buy to do it with mickey knew that some peoplejust about any cop would think what he should have done was simply turn the memory chip over to the cops to assist them in their search for the murderers mickey had several problems with that for one thing if the cops had the memory chip there was no way he could get copies of the pictures before thebulletin went to bed at am for another while mickey thought it was important that the public get to see the bodies of kenny charlton and the puerto rican latina whatever lady lying where they had fallen there were families involved and there was no reason the families had to see how fucking gruesome it actually was seeing daddy and momma in the bulletin lying dead was going to be bad enough when he had finished he picked up his telephone with one hand and with the other slid out a shelf on his desk to which a list of telephone numbers was affixed under celluloid he found what he wanted and punched it in first district corporal foley mickey ohara jerry did they pick up the roy rogers doers yet not yet mick theyre still looking youre sure jerry jesus yeah im sure i thought they would have something by now every cop in philadelphias down here looking for them thank you jerry he dropped the telephone into its cradle looked at the gray monitor before him a cursor blinking on it and then tapped the balls of his fingers together as he searched for the lead sentence of what he was about to write he wanted to get it right after a moment it came to him ce slugmassive manhunt begins for roy rogers murderers by michael j ohara bulletin staff writer photos by michael j ohara philadelphia april philadelphia police began a massive manhunt just before midnight confident they would quickly apprehend the two young black men eyewitnesses say first shot to death mrs maria manuela fernandez kitchen supervisor of the roy rogers restaurant at south broad and snyder streets during a robbery and then shot police officer kenneth j charlton of the first district who responded to the call killing him instantly amal al zaid a maintenance worker at the restaurant told this reporter mrs fernandez a single mother of three was shot without warning by one of the robbers as she was on the telephone reporting the robbery to police authorities and then ambushed officer charlton as he entered the restaurant a few minutes later five minutes and words later mickey gave the computer screen a quick read cursed the goddamn scifi movie typeface then inserted a missing comma and pushed the send key then he turned to the printer picked the photographs from the tray put the ones intended for the cops into a large manila envelope and carrying the ones from which he had deleted the blood walked out of his office and across the city room to the city editor these the pics the city editor asked i thought you should see them in color mickey said i appended them to my piece but theyll look blackandwhite on the el cheapo network the city editor examined the photographs no blood he said it was both a question and a statement you noticed did you you perceptible sonofabitch nice work mickey the city editor said mickey ohara held up his hands in awhat are you going to do gesture then walked out of the city room he got in his car which was parked in a slot marked with a reserved for mr ohara sign and drove to the roundhouse where he parked in a slot marked with a reserved for inspectors sign and then entered the building the uniforms behind the plateglass window pushed the solenoid that opened the door to the lobby one of the uniforms a corporal called i thought youd be out at the roy rogers mickey mickey waved the manila envelope in his hand been there done that he said and walked across the lobby to the elevator he rode it to the first floor and then walked down the corridor until he came to a door marked homicide he pushed it open then made his way past a locked barrier by putting his hand behind it and pushing the hidden solenoid switch there was only one detective in the room a younger man who looked like he needed both a new razor and a months good meals got you minding the store have they fenson what can i do for you ohara the detective asked washingtons the lieutenant this week at least fenson said lieutenant jason washington had taken the examination for promotion to captain it was universally expected that he would pass i hear the results of the sergeants exam will be out tomorrow he said the lieutenants and captains should be right after that can you imagine him in a uniform addressing some uniform roll call in a district fenson asked no i cant ohara admitted is washington here hes out at the roy rogers scene what can i do for you its a question of what i can do for you ohara said can you get washington on the horn and tell him ive got a picture of the doers a lousy picture i admit but a picture he laid it on the detectives desk youre sure this is them and youre right its a lousy picture im sure ohara said i took it washington called a couple of minutes ago and said he was coming in the detective said mickey ohara used the gentlemens rest facility then sipped on a paper cup of tepid coffee eight minutes after that an enormoussix feet three poundssuperbly tailored very black man came into homicide known behind his back as the black buddha lieutenant jason washington regarded himselfand was generally regarded by othersas the best homicide detective in philadelphia and possibly the best homicide detective between bangor maine and key west florida michael my friend how are you he greeted ohara with obvious sincerity plus a warm smile and a friendly pat on the shoulder hey jason ohara said i have a lousy picture of the doers he pointed to the photograph lying on the detectives desk washington picked it up examined it carefully then looked at ohara i concur in your judgment of the quality he said and the source mickey i went in on the robberyinprogress call ohara said when i got there these two were leaving i took that picture and you believe these were the doers yeah thats them ohara said they match the description i got from one of the employees the camera zeroed in on the light in the doorway washington said pity its twelve hundred dots to the inch maybe the labll be able to salvage more than i could mickey said detective fenson washington said didnt you think considering mr oharas reputation as one of the more skilled photographers of the dark side of our fair city that it behooved you to get this photograph to the lab as quickly as possible thats a pretty bad picture lieutenant but a picture nevertheless detective fenson the black buddha said softly i constantly try to make the point that no stone should ever be left unturned fenson picked up the picture and walked out of the room i am grateful for the photograph mickey washington said even if others may not be i have a feeling that this case isnt going to be as easy to close as everyone else seems to feel it will be whys that intuition washington said nothing concrete your intuition is what legendary that has been said washington said smiling then added i just have the feeling mick i really hope im wrong i got a couple of shots of the bodies too ohara said and handed him the manila envelope washington looked at them then raised his eyes to ohara i presume that these will shortly appear in thebulletin i cleaned them up some ohara said but yeah they will washington took oharas meaning thank you mickey ohara gave a deprecating shrug buy you a cup of decent coffee jason cafe royal in the four seasons why not thebulletins paying then i accept your kind offer washington said two one office of the deputy commissioner patrol police administration building eighth amp race streets philadelphia pennsylvania thursday am when deputy commissioner patrol dennis v coughlin a tall heavyset ruddyfaced man who still had all of his curly silver hair and teeth at age fiftynine walked into his office on the third floor of the police administration building he saw that there were three documents on his desk demanding his immediate attention they were in the center of his leatherbound desk blotter held in place by a heavy china coffee mug bearing the logotype of the emerald society a fraternal organization of police officers of irish heritage denny coughlin had joined the emerald thirtyseven years before right after graduation from the police academy and coming on the job and had twice served as its president coughlin peeled off the doublebreasted jacket of his welltailored dark blue suit as he walked toward his closet exposing a smith amp wesson snubnosed special revolver worn butt forward on his right side except for those rare times over the years when he wore a uniform denny coughlin had slipped that same pistols holster onto his belt every morning for thirtythree years since the day he had reported on the job as a rookie detective he hung his jacket carefully on a hanger in his closet closed the door and turned to his desk captain francis xavier hollaran an equally large irishman who at fortynine still had all of his teeth but not very much left from what had once been a luxurious mop of red hair entered the room carrying a stainlesssteel thermos of coffee i went by homicide he greeted the commissioner nothing thats not in there hollaran indicated with a nod of his head the documents on the green blotter on coughlins desk its only nine hours coughlin replied theyll get something soon he paused then added jesus christ wont they ever learn wolf wolf boss frank hollaran said you answer so many calls like that that are false alarms you get careless and dead coughlin said more than a little bitterly two of the documents on the green blotter under the emerald society mug detailed the events surrounding the death on duty of officer kenneth j charlton of the first district in philadelphia districts are what are called precincts in many other major police departments one was an activities sheet which listed every move detectives of the homicide bureau had made in the case including a listing of every interview conducted the activities sheet was a discoverable document which meant it would have to be made available to the defense counsel of anyone brought to trial in the case attached to it was a teletype message known as a white paper which was a less formal less precise report as an unofficial internal memorandum the white paper was not discoverable the two documents together presented the details of the case as it had so far developed according to them officer charlton had at the previous evening responded to a radio report of a robbery in progress at the roy rogers restaurant at south broad and snyder streets in south philadelphia that was a fact and was listed on the activities sheet it was also a fact that officer charlton had not waited for backup to arrive before going into the restaurant the white paper theorized that officer charlton had been close to the scene when the call came and had probably decided that he would have backup within a minute or two but that waiting for it before entering the restaurant would give the robbers a chance to escape it was further theorized that the doers had probablyseen his patrol car coming charlton had been on the job seventeen years and if he had used his siren and flashing lights at all he was experienced enough to have turned them off before getting close to the scene one of the doers had then ducked behind the cashiers counter waited until officer charlton started to come behind the register then grabbed him and held him while the other doer had shoved a pistol under charltons body armor and fired and shot him in the spine after the doer who had grabbed charlton had paused long enough to fire two shots at charltons body both doers had then fled from the restaurant an autopsy might be able to determine if the first shot had killed charlton or whether he had still been alive when the second doer had shot him twice again it was splitting legal hairs under paragraph la of the criminal code of pennsylvania criminal homicide is defined as the act of intentionally knowingly recklessly or negligently causing the death of another human being paragraph b of the criminal code of pennsylvania further defines criminal homicide to be murder of the second degree when the offense is committed by someone engaged as the principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony armed robbery is a felony so if it was determined that officer charlton died immediately as a result of being shot by doer number one at the cash register doer number two was guilty of the crime of murder in the second degree because the act occurred while he was an accomplice in the commission of a felony if officer charlton was still alive when doer number two shot him twice again killing him then doer number two was guilty of murder in the second degree because he was the principal and doer number one was guilty as the accomplice the activities sheet reported that by the time other police arrived at the scene both doer number one and doer number two had disappeared into the night and that a very poorquality photograph had been taken of them as they left the scene by a citizen and turned over to the homicide bureau both commissioner coughlin and captain hollaran were familiar with all the details in the report on coughlins desk they had been at the roy rogers before officer charltons body had been taken away by the coroner there was a standing operating procedure that commissioner coughlinwho exercised responsibility for all the patrol functions of the departmentwould be immediately notified in a number of circumstances whatever the hour those circumstances included the death of a police officer on duty there was an unofficial standing operating procedure understood and invariably applied by the police dispatchers whenever a call came in asking to be connected with deputy commissioner coughlin so that he could be notified of the death of a police officer on dutyor something of almost as serious a naturecaptain f x hollaran was notified first after he was notified of such an incident hollaran would wait a minute or twooften using the time to put on his clothing and slip his smith amp wesson snubnose into its holsterand then call coughlins private and unlisted number to learn from coughlin whether he wanted to be picked up or whether he would go to the scene himself or whether there was something else coughlin wanted him to do the procedure went back many years to when captain denny coughlin had been given command of the homicide bureau and homicide detective frank hollaran had become without either of them planning itcoughlins righthand man as coughlin had risen through the hierarchy hollaran had risen with him with time out for service as a uniform sergeant in the fifth district as a lieutenant with northeast detectives and as district commander of the ninth district last night when hollaran had called coughlin coughlin had said you better pick me up frank its going to be a long night it had turned out to be a long night the commissioner himself ralph j mariani had shown up at the roy rogers minutes after coughlin and hollaran he had immediately put hollaran to work organizing the notification party the mayor who was out of town was not available so mariani would be the bearer of the bad news when finally the party was assembled it consisted of mariani coughlin the police department chaplain the pastor of the methodist episcopal church attended by the charlton family the first district captain and officer charltons lieutenant and sergeant captain leif schmidt the first district commander telephoned mrs charlton and told her that he had had a report her husband had been injured and taken to methodist hospital and that he had dispatched a car to pick her up and take her there sergeant stanley davis officer charltons sergeant accompanied by police officer marianna calley went to the charlton home and suggested to mrs charlton that it might be a good idea if officer calley who knew the kids stayed with them while she went to the hospital the notification protocol had evolved through painful experience over the years it was better to tell the wife at the hospital that she was now a widow rather than at her home there were several reasons high among them being that it kept the goddamn ghouls from the tv stations from shoving a camera in the widows face to demand to know how she felt about her husband getting killed it also allowed the notification party to form at the hospital before the widow got there the mayor would normally be there and the police commissioner and other senior white shirts and it was better for them to hurry to a known location than descend one at a time at the officers home which sometimes might not have space for them all and would almost certainly be surrounded by the goddamn ghouls of the fourth estate all of whom had police scanner radios and would know where to go telling the widow at the hospital hadnt made the notification any easier but it was the best way anyone could think of to do it the third document on deputy commissioner coughlins desk which had been delivered to his office shortly before five the previous afternoonjust after coughlin had left for the daywas in a sealed eightbyten manila envelope bearing the return address deputy commissioner personnel and addressedpersonal attention comm coughlin only coughlin tried and failed to get his fingernail under the flap and finally took a small penknife from his desk drawer and slit it open it contained a quarterinchthick sheaf of stapledtogether paper coughlin glanced at the first page quickly and then handed it to hollaran i think this is what they call a dichotomy coughlin said the good news is also the bad news hollaran took the sheaf of xerox paper and looked at the first three pages it was unofficially but universally known as the list it listed the results of the most recent examination for promotion to sergeant two thousand seven hundred and eightytwo police officerscorporals detectives and patrolmen with at least two years servicehad taken the examination passing the examination and actually getting promoted meant a fourteen percent boost in basic pay for patrolmen and a four percent boost for corporals and detectives a substantial percentage of detectives earned so much in overtime pay that taking the examination passing it and then actually getting promoted to sergeantwho put in far less overtimewould severely reduce their takehome pay many detectives took the sergeants examination only relatively late in their careers as a necessary step to promotion to lieutenant and captain because retirement pay is based on rank the examination had two parts written and oral originally there had been only a written examination but there had been protests that the written examination was culturally biased and an equally important oral examination had been added to the selection process passing the written portion of the examination was a prerequisite to taking the oral portion of the examination and a little more than five hundred examinees had failed to pass the written and been eliminated from consideration oral examinations had begun a month after the results of the written were published and had stretched out over four months six hundred eightyfour patrolmen corporals and detectives had passed the oral portion of the sergeants examination and were certified to be eligible for promotion that was not at all the same thing as saying that all those who were eligible for promotion would be promoted only fiftyseven of the men on the listless than ten percentwould be immediatelywithin a week or a monthpromoted a number of factors but primarily the city budget determined how many eligibles would be promoted and when the eligibles who werent promoted immediately would have to wait until vacancies occurredfor example when a sergeant was retired or promoted what that translated to mean was that if an individual ranked in the top or maybe on the list he or she stood a good chance of getting promoted anyone ranking below would almost certainly have to forget being promoted until the list expiredusually after two years and a new sergeants examination was announced and held the first name on the list in hollarans handthe examinee who had scored highestwas payne matthew m payroll no special operations why am i not surprised hollaran asked smiling and then added unctuously detective payne is a splendid young officer of whom the department generally and his godfather specifically can be justifiably proud go to hell frank detective paynes godfather said and then added what he needs is a couple of yearsmore than a couple three four yearsin uniform in a district you really didnt think matt would ask for a district assignment inuniform hollaran asked chuckling when police commissioner mariani had announced the latest examination for promotion to sergeant he had added a new twist which on the advice of other senior police officials and personnel experts he believed would be good for morale the five topranking examinees would be permitted to submit their first three choices of postpromotion assignment one of which would be guaranteed deputy commissioner coughlin had at first thought it wasnt a bad idea and then he had realized it was almost certainly going to apply to matthew m payne and that changed things mattys scoring firstwhich meant that there would be no excuse not to give him the assignment he had chosen made it even worse i had lunch with him last thursday coughlin said i told him all things considered that he stood a pretty good chance of placing high enough on the list how prescient of you commissioner hollaran said smiling how do you think youre going to like the lastout shift in night command captain the lastoutmidnight to eight amshift in night command was universally regarded as the departments version of purgatory for captains those who occupied the position usually had seriously annoyed the senior brass in one way or another there was no relief from the midnighttomorning hours the occupant was required to be in uniform at all times while on duty and he was the only captain in the department to whom the department did not issue an unmarked car some night command captains took their lumps and performed their duties without complaint while waiting until they were replaced by some other captain who had annoyed the hierarchy but many heard the message and retired or resigned come on hollaran said not awed by the threat matt took the exam grabbed the brass ring and hes a good cop and you know it and would be given his choice of assignment coughlin went on ignoring him and that he should seriously consider a couple of years in uniform and he said his three choices were going to be special operations highway and homicide somehow i cant see matt on a motorcycle hollaran said and highways under special operations and hes been in special operations too long as it is coughlin said which leaves homicide hollaran said which since he knows he cant stay in special operations forever is really what he wants hes got the system figured out and that surprises you with you and peter wohl as his rabbis coughlin flashed him an annoyed look hollaran suddenly smiled youre having obscene thoughts again frank coughlin asked or something else amuses you the black buddha hollaran said wait till he finds out the empty sergeants slot in homicide will be filled by brandnew sergeant payne coughlin smiled despite himself theyre pretty close coughlin said which makes their situation even more uncomfortable for both of them theyll be able to handle it hollaran said two at detective matthew m paynea six foot tall lithely muscled pound twentysixyearold with neatly cut dark thick hair and dark intelligent eyesarrived in the parking lot behind the roundhouse at the wheel of an unmarked new ford crown victoria he was neatly dressed in a tweed jacket gray flannel slacks a white buttondowncollar shirt and striped necktie and when he finally found a place to park the car and got out of the car carrying a leather briefcase he looked more like a stockbroker or a young lawyer than what comes to mind when the phrase police detective is heard there seemed to be proof of this when he entered the building and had to produce his badge and identification card before the police officer guarding access to the lobby would pass him into it but as he was walking toward the elevator he was recognized by a slight wiry startingtobald thirtyeightyearold in a wellworn blue blazer he was not a very imposinglooking man but mattand othersknew him to be one of the best homicide detectives in the same league as jason washington as i live and breathe the fashion plate of special operations detective anthony c harris greeted him what brings you here from the arsenal down to where the working cops work hey tony payne said smiling as they shook hands he looked quickly at his watch got time for a cup of coffee harris shook his head guess who wants me to take a look at the roy rogers scene harris said south broad that one i saw mickeys piece in the bulletin harris nodded i thought theyd have them by now payne said mickey said massive manhunt it would help if we knew who were looking for harris said no ones picked anybody out of the mug books and theres no talk on the streets i thought there were a bunch of witnesses there were i have just been looking at police artist sketches to go by them twentyfive different people shot kenny charlton payne picked up on the use of charltons first name you knew him one of the good guys matt harris said just a little bitterly with a little bit of luck right after i get a positive id on these two bastards theyll resist arrest im a cop a detectivehell i think im going to be a sergeantand i dont know if he means that or not harris too was quick to pick up on things on other peoples faces the subject was changed so whats new with you matt he asked a famous movie star is coming to philadelphia matt said i thought all movie stars were famous harris said which one they havent told me yet matt said im on my way to the auditorium for the preliminary meeting with gerry mcguire of dignitary protection and just for the record there are also infamous movie stars score one for the fashion plate harris said dont let this go to your head but the black buddha and i miss you matt now that were back with the police department both jason washington and tony harris over their bitter objections had been transferred to the special operations division when it was formed and only recentlyafter they had trained other special operations detectives to inspector peter wohls high standardshad been allowed to return fuck you tony and we dont see much of you why dont younot today wait till we get the charlton doerscome by when you have the time and buy us lunch yeah i will give my regards to the movie star harris said touched paynes arm and walked across the lobby to the exit matt walked across the lobby toward the auditorium the dignitary protection unit as the name suggests is charged with protecting dignitaries visiting philadelphia philadelphias own dignitariesthe mayor for example and the district attorneyare protected by police officers but those officers are not under the dignitary protection unit staffing the unit poses a problem sometimes there are severaleven a dozendignitaries requiring protection and sometimes only one or two or none at all what has evolved is that only a few mena lieutenant two sergeants and half a dozen detectivesare assigned full time to dignitary protection when needed additional detectiveswho dont wear uniforms on duty and thus already have the necessary civilian clothingare temporarily reassigned from their divisions then returned to their regular duties after the visiting dignitary has left town over time most of the detectives placed on temporary duty with dignitary protection had come from the special operations division as had uniformed officers of the highway patrol which was part of special operations special operations had citywide authority for one thing which meant that its officers knew more about the back alleys and such of the entire city than did their peers who spent their careers in one district that was useful to dignitary protection and the department had yet to hear a complaint from any visiting dignitary that en route from pennsylvania station or the airport to his hotel his car had been preceded and trailed by nattily uniformed police officers mounted on shiny motorcycles with sirens screaming and blue lights flashing but the roman emperor spectacle was really a pleasant byproduct of the fact that highway patrol officers were the elite of the department it was hard to get into highway hard to stay there if you didnt measure up and while there you could count on being where the actionheaviest criminal activity was the dignitary in his limousine in other words was protected by fouror eight or even twelveof the besttrained bestequipped streetwise uniforms in the department consequently dignitary protection had gotten in the habit of requesting temporary personnel from special operations first because the commanding officer of special operations almost always gave dignitary protection whatever it asked for without question there had been a lot of talk that the smart thing to do would be to simply transfer the unitif dignitary protection wasnt a special operation what wasto special operations that hadnt happened for a number of reasons never really spelled out but certainly including the fact that inspector peter wohl the commanding officer of special operations probably could not have won an election for the most popular white shirt in the department for one thing at thirtyseven he was the youngest inspector in the department for another he already had in the opinion of many inspectors and chief inspectors too much authority and in the course of his careerespecially when he had been a staff inspector in internal affairs again the youngest man to hold that rankhe had put a number of dirty cops some of them high ranking in the slam almost all police officers of all ranks although they dont like to admit it have ambivalent feelings toward dirty cops and the cops who catch them and send them to the slam dirty cops deserve the slam and the guys who put them there deserve the gratitude and admiration of every honest police officer on the other handjesus christ olharry was a good cop for seventeen years before this happened and hows his family going to make out while hes doing time and when he gets out no pension no nothing im glad hes not on my conscience when wohlafter having placed second of eleven examinees on the written examination for promotion to inspector appeared before the senior officers conducting the oral part of the exam his ability to handle the conflicting emotions that dealing with dirty cops evoked was one of the reasons he got promoted so while just about everyone agreed that dignitary protection belonged in special operations it didnt go there it stayed a separate unit there was so much going on between dignitary protection and special operations however that inspector wohl had decided there should be one man charged with liaison between the two he had assigned this dutyin addition to his other dutiesto detective matthew m payne it was no secret anywhere in the department that inspector wohl was detective paynes rabbi and there were many who thought that this was the reason payne was given the assignment and to a degree the suspicions had a basis in fact the function of a rabbi is to groom a young police officer for greater responsibilityand higher rankdown the line as he had risen upward in the police department inspector wohls rabbi had been inspector then chief inspector then deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin as commissioner coughlin had risen upward through the ranks his rabbi had been captain and ultimately the hon jerome h jerry carlucci mayor of the city of philadelphia who had liked to boast that he had held every rank in the police department except policewoman before answering the peoples call to elective public office and his honor too had had a rabbi his had beenultimately before he retiredchief inspector augustus wohl whose only son peter had entered the police academy at twenty two weeks after he had graduated from temple university wohl did think that learning about dignitary protection would do detective payne some goodthe more a cop knew about the department the betterbut another major reason was efficiency whoever sat in at the meetings at dignitary protection would be expected to report to wohl precisely what had happened and what would be asked of special operations matt payne not only had the ability to write a report quickly and accurately but he had almost permanently attached to his right wrist a stateoftheart laptop computer on which and through which the final reports of what happened at the dignitary protection meeting would be written and transmitted to inspector wohls desktop computer long before detective payne himself could return to special operations headquarters in what once had been the us armys frankford arsenal as payne was about to push open the door to the auditorium sergeant al nevins a stocky barrelchested fortyfiveyear old trotted across the lobby and caught his arm nevins was one of the two sergeants permanently assigned to dignitary protection god loves me he said youre early i was afraid youd show up on time and i put out the arm for you and radio reported they couldnt find you he offered no explanation instead turned and raising his voice called across the lobby lieutenant paynes here lieutenant gerry mcguire the commanding officer of dignitary protectiona somewhat plump pleasantlooking fortyfiveyearoldwalked across the lobby to them he wassurprising mattin uniform i tried to have al reach out for you matt mcguire said im glad youre here were going to do this now in the ritzcarlton whos coming to town sir matt asked stan colt lieutenant mcguire said my life is now complete matt said stan colt was an almost unbelievably handsome and muscular actor who had begun his theatrical career in a rock band used the fame that had brought him to get a minor part in a police series on television and then used that to get his first role in a theatrical motion picture playing a detective that motion picture had been spectacularly successful largely matt thought because of the special effects there had been a halfdozen followons none of which matt had seenthe first one had reminded him of the comic books hed read as a kid in one scene stan colt had fired twentytwo shots without reloading from a sevenshot colt held sidewardbut he understood they had all done exceedingly well at the box office matt mcguire said be aware that the mayor and the commissioner look upon him as a philadelphia icon right up there with benjamin franklin he looked at his watch and added i mean now were due there at ninethirty he waved matt ahead of him across the lobby sergeant nevins followed them whats going on at the ritzcarlton matt asked mr colts advance party is there lieutenant mcguire replied and possibly the archbishop though more likely monsignor schneider and the commissioner said he might drop by colts people are calling it a previsit breakfast conference whats going on west catholic high school is going to give mr colt his high school diploma mcguire said which he apparently didnt get before he went off to show business and fame in connection with this there will be two expensive lunches two even more expensive dinners and a starstudded performance featuring mr colt and a number of friends the proceeds will all go to the west catholic building fund the archbishop i understand is thrilled and the mayor and the commissioner are thrilled whenever the archbishop is thrilled i get the picture matt said the elevator door opened and lieutenant mcguire led the way out of the building to the parking lot wheres your car al mcguire asked mines in the garage again mines right over there matt said pointing and immediately regretted it the assignment of unmarked cars in the philadelphia police departmentexcept in special operationsworked on the handmedown principle new cars went to the chief inspectors who on receipt of their new vehicles handed down their slightly used vehicles to inspectors who in turn handed down their wellused if not wornout vehicles to captains entitled to unmarked cars who passed their nearly wornout vehicles farther down the hierarchy special operations had a federal grant for experimental policing techniques which among other things provided money for automobiles special operations vehicles were not provided out of the department budget in other words and the grant was worded so that unneeded and unexpended funds were supposed to be returned to the federal government the result of that was that not one dollar of unneeded and unexpended funds had ever been returned to washington and everyone in special operations who drove an unmarked cardown to lowly detectives and patrol officers in plainclothes assignmentsdrove a new vehicle when the annual grant money was received new cars were purchased by special operations and the used special operations cars were turned over to the department motor pool for assignment from matts perspective it was a good deal for the department all around once a year the department got thirtyodd carsmost of them in excellent shapefor nothing and the department did not have to provideand pay forthirtyodd unmarked cars to special operations however from the perspective of lieutenant mcguire and of most other lieutenants and captains and even more than a few more senior officerslowly detectives and officers in plainclothes should not be driving new cars when captains and lieutenants were driving cars on the steep slope leading to the crusher all lieutenant mcguire said however when he got in the front seat of the car beside matt was i love the smell of a new car they drove up market street to city hall and then around it to the ritzcarlton whose main entrance was on the west side of south broad street just across from city hall mcguire looked at his watch again and said park in front i dont want to be late matt pulled into space normally reserved for taxis put a plastic covered police official business sign on the dashboard and then hurried after mcguire and nevins the stan colt advance party was in a large suite the windows of which looked down on the statue of william penn atop city hall a buffet had been laid outan impressive one complete to a man in chefs whites manning an omelet stoveand there were seven or eight people in the room including two men in clerical collars matt knew the archbishop by sight and he wasnt one of the two so the grayhaired one in the welltailored suit had to be monsignor schneider in an adjacent room was a long conference table on which water and coffee carafes cups and saucers and even lined pads and ballpoint pens had been laid out there were two telephones on the table and television sets mounted on the walls this suite was designed not for luxuryalthough its no dumpbut as somewhere the boss can gather the underlings together and inspire them matt walked into the conference room took a telephone cord from his briefcase and looked along the walls for a telephone jack finding none he dropped to his knees and got under the table there were two double telephone jacks and he plugged the telephone cord into one of them as he backed out he became aware of nylonsheathed legs can i help you a female voice asked as he got to his feet no thanks he said i managed to get it in jesus christ will you look at this the hole with only a little trouble laptop the blonde asked yes maam to take notes yes maam shes probably stan colts squeeze far too beautiful for a common man jesus christ shes stunning she put out her hand im terry davis she said with gam is that one r and an i or two rs and a y not that it matters but two rs and a y and whats gam global artists management she answered making her surprise that he didnt know evident in the tone of her voice of course matt said i should have known if you need anything else just let me know thank you very much have you had your breakfast not quite an hour before detective payne had had two fried eggs two slices of taylor ham two bagels a glass each of orange juice and milk and two cups of coffee i could eat a little something now that you mention it well when you have your laptop up and working wont you please have some breakfast youre very kind matt said she smiled at him and walked back to the room with the buffet in the process convincing payne that both sides of her were stunning he turned the laptop on pushed the appropriate buttons thought a moment about whether he wanted to make this official or not decided he didnt and then typed very quickly for he was an accomplished typist the private screen name for inspector wohl and then his own he wanted a copy of what he was about to type dignitary is stan colt coming to town to raise money for west catholic high school so far two dinners two lunches and a benefit performance will know dates locations etc after breakfasting upper floor suite ritz carlton with mcguire monsignor schneider terry davis of gam others i think im in love in a moment the computer told him his mail had been sent probably less than a minute later the computer on the table behind inspector peter wohls desk at special operations headquarters would give off a ping and a message would appear on his monitor telling him he had an email message from which was detective paynes badge number a similar action would take place on detective paynes desktop and when he got back to the office he would copy the message into his desktop leaving the computer on payne went into the room with the buffet lieutenant mcguire seated at a table with monsignor schneider and the other priest waved him over yes sir payne do you know the monsignor no sir monsignor this is detective payne of special operations which will be providing most of the manpower for mr colts security while hes here im very pleased to meet you the monsignor said smiling and standing up to offer his hand your boss and i are old friends was that incidental information to put me at ease or areyou telling me that if i displease you in any way youll go right to wohl detective payne this is father venno of my office the monsignor went on wholl be my liaison representing the archdiocese how do you do father matt said politely putting out his hand and looking over vennos shoulder finding terry davis at a table with two empty chairs and wondering if he could get away with joining her why dont you get a platethe omelets are wonderful and join us monsignor schneider said shit thank you very much sir payne said although he didnt have nearly as much appetite as hed had when contemplating taking breakfast with miss davis the omelets offered did have a certain appeal and detective payne returned to the table with a western omelet with everything an english muffin and a large glass of orange juice that was an unfortunate business on south broad street last night wasnt it monsignor schneider said at the gene autry the roy rogers monsignor father venno corrected him wasnt it the monsignor repeated directing the question to matt payne his face making it clear he didnt like to be corrected yes sir it was matt said have there been any developments in the case theyre working on it sir matt said i think theyll wrap it up pretty quickly greater love the monsignor said somewhat piously officer charlton was a good man lieutenant mcguire said a very sad situation over father vennos shoulder matt saw that the two empty chairs at terry daviss table were now occupied by sergeant al nevins and another manpresumably from gamand that everyone was smiling at one another ive just placed you father venno said a tone of satisfaction in his voice excuse me matt said you were involved in that unfortunate incident in doylestown a couple of months ago werent you unfortunate incident and it was six months ago not a couple and i was just starting to think id be able to start really forgetting it thanks a lot father what unfortunate incident was that monsignor schneider asked at the crossroads diner monsignor father venno said the fbi and detective payne were attempting an arrest of a terrorist the monsignor interrupted remembering a terrorist armed with a machine gun several people lost their lives he looked at payne you were involved in that were you yes sir i was matt said as i recall the monsignor said three people died and another young woman was shot i believe there were just two deaths monsignor lieutenant mcguire said the terrorist a man named chenowith and a civilian a young woman who was cooperating with the fbi what was her name matt susan reynolds matt answered and i loved her and she loved me but we didnt make it to that vinecovered cottage by the side of the road because that lunatic chenowith let fly with his automatic carbine he had a sudden painfully clear mental image of susan on her back in the parking lot behind the crossroads diner her mouth and her sightless eyes open her blond hair in a spreading pool of blood the carbine bullet had made a small neat hole just below her left eye and a much nastier hole at the back of her head as it exited he laid his fork down put his napkin on the table and stood up will you excuse me please he said and looked around the room in search of a bathroom as he walked across the room he heard monsignor schneider ask detective payne has experience working with the fbi does he and heard lieutenant mcguires answer yes he does monsignor then he was in the bathroom hurriedly fastening the lock and hoping that he could splash cold water on his face quickly enough to force back the bile and nausea he felt rising ninety seconds later he was leaning with his back against the bathroom wall wiping his face with a towel exhaling audibly he had managed to keep from throwing up but there had been a cold sweat and he could feel the clammy touch of his undershirt on his skin youre going to have to stop this shit matthew that was a long time ago susan is not going to come back and youre going to have to really put all of that out of your mind or theyll put you in a rubber room finally he hung the towel back on its rack and then after purposefully taking several slow deep breaths unlatched the door and went out of the bathroom everyone was filing into the conference roomhow the hell long was i in the john and he joined the line at the end taking his seat at the table where he had left the laptop he saw a dark blue plastic folder lying beside his laptop there was a neatly printed label on its coverstan colts visit to philadelphia matt looked around the table and saw that everyone had been provided with a folder and that there was another laptop on the table in front of a man about his age wearing a gray business suit matts seat turned out to be beside monsignor schneider are you all right son you look a little pale a little indigestion sir im afraid i gulped the omelet if i may have your attention a natty intenselooking man in a dark suit said waited until everyone was looking at him and then went on i think it might be a good idea if we all knew each other ill start with me my name is rogers kennedy and im a senior vice president of global artists management heading up gams new york office let me say that im delighted to be here and its my intention to see that mr colts activities here raise just as much money as possible for west catholic high school which is really dear to mr colts heart and to see that thats done in such a manner that mr colt will look back on the experience fondly to make sure that any bumps in the road so to speak are smoothed out beforehand or that the best possible detour is set up this lovely young lady who is living proof that there is such a thing as the opposite of the dumb blonde of fame and legend is miss terry davis of gams west coast division vice president davis has been charged with the handson management of mr colts visit head gam man is rogers kennedy senior vp from nyc terry davis gam vp from la is handson boss and this

project no offense intended certainly detective kennedy said were delighted to have you i think i have just been had and i really dont want to babysit a movie actor matt looked at lieutenant gerry mcguire who smiling at matts discomfort sarcastically gave him a hiddenbehindhis hand thumbsup gesture matt returned it with a hiddenbehind hishand gesture of his own the index finger of his balled fist held upright lieutenant mcguire smiled even more broadly if youll open the folder before you rogers kennedy went on youll find the tentative schedule we have worked out for mr colts visit and i think it would be a good idea to go over it now to see if there are any potential bumps in stans road we may have missed matt opened the folder wohls going to want at least three copies of this i can take it to the office and xerox it better yet scan it into the computer so when the inevitable changes are made to it they wont have to be written on it and the whole thing rexeroxed or i can type it into the laptop now and skip the scanning he immediately began to type and was finished long before rogers kennedy monsignor schneider and lieutenant mcguire had worked their way through it item by item when he looked up he saw that terry davis was looking at him when he smiled at her she looked away think about this matthew if your life was really over when that sonofabitch chenowith killed susan would you now be wondering what vice president davis looks like in her birthday suit or considering the possibilities of getting her into that condition peter wohl said dad said amy said just about everybody including the secondrate shrink with the bad breath they made me go see told me that it would take time but i would get over susan if that is the case and jesus that would be great then why when father venno placed me in that unfortunate incident was i instantly back in that goddamned crossroads diner parking lot with susans blood sticky on my hands followed as usual with the coldsweatandnausea business he looked across the table at terry davis again as if sensing his eyes on her she looked at him are you going to be the salvation of m m payne you stunning longlegged blonde goddess or have i already slipped over the border into lala land he winked at her she looked away shaking her head but he could see she was smiling he walked up to her when the meeting was over well i guess well be seeing more of one another she said is there anything i can do for you you mean in connection with this he asked yes of course i dont think thats going to happen he said the only reason i was here was because my boss had other things to do and didnt want to come in the first place you said that not me matt said but there is something you can do for me name it have dinner with me no thats getting right to the point isnt it he said you didnt leave yourself any wriggle room im on a redeye back to the coast at twelvethirty she said and between now and then im going to go make the appropriate noises over a girlfriend from colleges toddler ive never seen dare i hope that changes your response from hell no to maybe some other time well be working together im sure well take some meals together matt lieutenant gerry mcguire called ive got to get back to work he looked at her and shrugged then walked out of the suite three one matt payne dropped lieutenant mcguire and sergeant nevins at the roundhouse and thenafter thinking it over for a moment at the parking lot exitheaded back toward center city rather than toward the delaware river and interstate which would have taken him to special operations headquarters inspector wohl would expect him to come to the arsenalstill called that although the us army was long gonedirectly from the meeting with dignitary protection but that couldnt be helped he needed a quick shower and a change of linen the cold sweat he had experienced had been a bad one and had produced an offensive smell sometimes the cold sweats just left him clammily uncomfortable but sometimes they were accompanied by an unpleasant odor which he thought was caused by something he had eaten he hoped that was the reason he didnt want to think of other unpleasant possibilities he went over to spruce street and west on it past broad street to nineteenth where he turned right and then right and right again onto manning manning was more of an alley than a street but it gave access to the parking garage beneath the brownstone mansion on rittenhouse square that housed the delaware valley cancer society the yearold building had been converted several years before to office space which as the owner of the building had frequently commented had proven twice as expensive as tearing the building down and starting from scratch would have been inside the buildingwith the exception of a tiny apartment in the garretwas now modern office space with all the amenities including an elevator and parking space for cancer society executives in the basement outside the building preserved the dignity of rittenhouse square thought by many to be the most attractive of philadelphias squares when the ownerthe building had been in his family since it was builthad authorized the expense of converting the garret not suitable for use as offices he thought the tiny rooms could probably be rented to an elderly couple perhaps or a widow or widower someone of limited means who worked downtown perhaps in the franklin institute or the free public library and who would be willing to put up with the inconvenience of access and the slanting walls and limited space because it was convenient cheap and was protected aroundtheclock by the wachenhut security service it was instead occupied by a single bachelor the owners son matthew m payne because the city of philadelphia requires that its employees live within the city limits and the payne residence in wallingford a suburb did not qualify the owner of the building had decreed that two parking spaces in the underground garage be reserved for him both his wife and his daughter he thought would appreciate having their own parking spaces in downtown philadelphia and it was after all his building matt payne pulled the unmarked crown victoria into one of the two reserved parking spots the second reserved parking spot held a silver porsche carrera which had been his graduation present when he had finished his undergraduate work at the university of pennsylvania he carefully locked the car then trotted to the elevator which was standing with its door open he pressed the door closed and the elevator started to move once he was past the ground floor he pulled his necktie loose and began to open his shirt the buttons were open nearly to his belt when the door opened and he started to step out onto what he expected to be the third floor it was instead the second two female employees of the delaware county cancer society had summoned the elevator to take them to the third floor which was occupied by the various machines necessary to keep track of contributors and the techniciansall of whom were maleand was seldom visited by anyone not connected with the machines the ladies recoiled at the unexpected sight of a partially dressed maleobviously in the act of undressing even further and from whose shoulder was slung a rather large pistolcoming out of the elevator at them sorry matt payne said gathering his shirt together with both hands and indicating with a nod of his head that they were welcome to join him in the elevator the ladies smiled somewhat weakly and indicated they would just as soon wait for the next elevator thank you just the same he pushed again and the elevator rose one more floor when the door opened there was no one in sight matt crossed the small foyer quickly pushed the keys on a combination lock on a door shoved it open and went up the stairs to his apartment two at a time not quite ninety seconds later he was in his showera small stall shower there wasnt room for a bathtubwhen his cell phone went off he stuck his head and one arm out from behind the shower curtain payne there was no direct response to that instead matt heard a familiar voice say somewhat triumphantly got him inspector a mental picture of police officer paul t omara came to paynes mind officer omara a very neat very wholesomelooking young officer in an immaculate wellfitting uniform was sitting at his desk in the outer office of the commanding officer of special operations officer omara was inspector wohls administrative assistant he had assumed that duty when the incumbentofficer m m paynehad been promoted to detective officer omara like inspector wohl was from a police family his father was a captain who commanded the twentyfifth district his brother was a sergeant in civil affairs his grandfather like peter wohls father and grandfather had retired from the philadelphia police department more important his father was a friend of both deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin and chief inspector retired augustus wohl when officer omara who had five years on the job in the traffic division had failed for the second time to pass the examination for corporal both commissioner coughlin and chief wohl had had a private word with inspector wohl they had pointed out to him that just because someone has a little trouble with promotion examinations doesnt mean hes not a good cop with potential it just means that he has trouble passing examinations not like you peter or for that matter matt the inference had been youre not really all that smart youre just good at taking examinations one or the other or both of them had suggested that what officer omara needed was a little broader experience than he was getting in the traffic division such as he might get if it could be arranged to have personnel with your approval of course assign him to special operations as your administrative assistant now that matty got himself promoted and the jobs open officer omaras performance as wohls administrative assistant had been satisfactory he was immensely loyal hardworking and reliable the trouble with officer omara as detective jesus martinez had often pointed out was that he had been at the end of the line when brains were passed out and an original thought and a cold drink of water would probably kill him inspector wohl came on the line a moment later whens the meeting going to be over he asked without any preliminaries its over sir youre en route here actually sir im in the shower you had planned to come to work today yes sir i will be there directly the line went dead shit another three minutes and when he asked youre en route here i could have said yes sir i wonder whats going on why did he put the arm out for me two twenty minutes laterafter having twice en route responded to radio requests for his locationdetective payne entered the walled collection of aging redbrick buildings once known as the us army frankford arsenal and now somewhat hopefully dubbed the arsenal business center by the city of philadelphia when business had not rushed to the arsenal the city had given its permission for two units of the police department to occupy some of the buildings one was the sex crimes unit and the other the far larger special operations division which previously had been operating out of a building at castor and frankford avenues built in the frankford grammar school had rendered the city more than a century of service before being adjudged uninhabitable by the bureau of licenses inspections it had then served as special operations division headquarterswith inspector peter wohl installed in what had been the principals officeuntil space had become available in the arsenal business center just as soon as funds became available the city intended to demolish the old school unless of course itreally died of old age and fell down by itself thereby saving the city that expenditure matt drove through the collection of old and mostly unused arsenal buildings until he came to one of the newer buildingsthe cornerstone was marked and drove around it looking for a place to park there were none even the spot reserved for commissioner was occupied he finally parked a block away and then trotted to the special operations headquarters building inspector wohl was now housed in the groundfloor office of what had once been the office of the arsenals commanding officer he pushed open the door from the corridor to wohls outer office officer omara pushed a lever on his intercom sir detective payne is here send him in matt knocked politely at the door and waited for permission to enter come in please inspector wohl called matt pushed the door open there were five people in the room inspector peter wohl sitting behind his desk captain michael j sabara fortyish a short barrelchested lebanese who was wohls deputy captain david pekach the weaselfaced fairskinned small wiry thirtysevenyearold commanding officer of the highway patrol and sitting side by side on wohls couch two white shirts matt was really surprised to see in wohls office deputy commissioner patrol dennis v coughlin and his executive officer captain francis x hollaran what the hell is going on im delighted detective payne inspector wohl said sarcastically that you have managed to squeeze time for us into your busy schedule theres one bastard i would really like to see shuffling around in shackles captain hollaran said handing something to captain pekach youd like to see him in shackles captain sabara replied id like to see him fry id strap him in the chair myself despite his somewhat menacing appearance captain michael sabara was really a rather gentle man matt was surprised at his vehemence fry id strap him in the chair myself who are they talking about you were saying detective payne inspector wohl went on sorry sir i had to change my clothes payne said when was the last time you got a postcard dave commissioner coughlin asked i get one every couple of months pekach replied the one before this was from rome this ones from someplace in france probably from where he lives coughlin said shaking his head the sonofabitch knows the french wont let us extradite him unless it had something to do with monsignor schneider i dont think i want to hear why you had to change your clothes inspector wohl said nothing to do with the monsignor sir good inspector wohl said i presume everything went well at the meeting everything went well at the meeting matt said i emailed you sir so you did wohl said and i was delighted to hear that you think youre in love but wondered why you thought you should notify me officially youre in love are you payne captain pekach asked no sir im not then why did you tell inspector wohl you were and as part of your official duties commissioner coughlin asked it was a little joke sir matt said jesus why the hell did i do that and damn it i sent it to his personal email address so it wasnt official you have to watch that sort of thing matty commissioner coughlin said his tone suggesting great disappointment in matts lack of professionalism who are you in love with payne captain sabara asked there was a girl at the meeting matt said i the sort of girl you could bring home to dinner with your mother sabara pursued or to dinner with my martha captain pekach asked martha was mrs pekach sir more important sabara asked what makes you think this female is in love with you i am having my chain pulled just for the hell of it or is there more to this actually sir i knew she was in love with me from the moment she saw me i seem to have that effect on women there were smiles but not so much as a chuckle let me put it to you this way matty commissioner coughlin said very seriously theone thing a detectiveor a newly promoted sergeant doesnt need is a reputation as a ladies man what did he say or a new sergeant it tends to piss off the wives of the men theyre working with coughlin finished now there was laughter congratulations matty coughlin said youre number one on the list he stood up went to matt shook his hand and put his arm around his shoulders ill be damned matt said damned probably almost certainly wohl said but for the moment were all proud of you yeah we are matt pekach said i dont think even our beloved boss was ever number one on a list yeah he was coughlin corrected him peter was number one on the lieutenants list officer omara appeared at the door with a digital camera lined them all up with matt in the middle and took four pictures of them theres a dark side to this pekach said matt you know marthas going to have a party for you she doesnt have to do that matt said she will want to pekach said ive got to go back to work coughlin said he looked at hollaran frank and i would have been out of here long ago if detective payne hadnt found it necessary to take a bath in the middle of the morning it was a matter of absolute necessity matt said so well leave just as soon as matty calls his father and mother and lets them have the good news sir wohl asked confused you dont mind if i borrow him for a couple of hours do you peter no sir ill wait for you outside matty coughlin said yes sir there was a round of handshakes and in a moment matt and wohl were alone in the office sit down have a cup of coffee and call wohl said you seem a little shaken matt said aloud what he was thinking i thought i was going to pass he said not number one but pass but now that its happenedsergeant payne youll get used to it matt wohl said poured him a cup of coffee and pointed to the couch an order for him to sit down coughlin will wait he said prepare yourself for another what you need is a couple of years in uniform speech another you know about the first wohl nodded and for the record matt i think hes right i dont want to be a uniform sergeant matt said you need that experience wohl said end of my speech thank you matt said sat down took out his cellular and started pushing autodial buttons it didnt take long mrs elizabeth newman the payne housekeeper said i thought you knew matt your mother went to wilmington overnight goddamn it i did know thanks elizabeth i did know i forgot on the second call mrs irene craig executive secretary to brewster cortland payne esq founding partner of mawson payne stockton mcadoo amp lester arguably philadelphias most prestigious law firm said a certain tone of loving exasperation in her voice i left two messages on your machine matt your dad went to washington on the eightthirteen this morning and is going to spend the night with your mother in wilmington and i got both of them too goddamn it im sorry to bother you mrs craig forgive me no i wont but i love you anyway on the third call a nasalvoiced female somewhat tartly informed him that dr payne would be teaching all day and could not be reached unless it was an emergency thank you very much tell dr payne please that unless we have her check within seventytwo hours were going to have to repossess the television amy always teaches all day on monday inspector wohl said inspector wohl knew more about dr paynes schedule than her brother did they were close friends and onandoff lovers matt looked at him but said nothing lowranking police officers should not keep deputy commissioners waiting wohl said you might want to write that down yes sir thank you very much sir deputy commissioner coughlin was standing on the stairs to the building waiting for him you drive matty he ordered frank had things to do you can either drop me at the roundhouse later or ill catch a ride somehow yes sir where are we going the roy rogers at broad and snyder coughlin said you heard about that yes sir i ran into tony harris at the roundhouse this morning did they get the doers not yet coughlin said we will of course we should have already id like to know why we havent and en route i will get the speech i really hate to refuse anything he asks of me and hes right and peter made it clear he agrees with him i probably would learn a hell of a lot i dont know and should if i went to one of the districts as a uniform sergeant but i dont want to be a uniform sergeant spending my time driving around a district waiting for something to happen getting involved in domestic disturbances petty theft and all that i like being a detective i like working in civilian clothing and i didnt come up with that ruling that the highfive guys get their choice of assignment they offered that prize and i won it fair and square and i want it thats what ill tell him when all else fails tell the truth what did your mother have to say commissioner coughlin asked my father went to washington matt replied hes going to meet mother in wilmington and theyll spend the night so ill have to wait until they get back to tell them and i couldnt get amy on the phone she teaches all day on monday is he still pushing you to go to law school here it comes maybe you should think about it matt with great subtlety and even greater determination he means well matty coughlin said i know whats peter got you working on coughlin asked im not supposed to tell you but on the other hand youre deputy commissioner coughlin you have every right in the world to ask a coponthetake question captain cassidy of the eighteenth is driving to his new condominium at atlantic city in his new gmc yukon xl he gave his old onelast years to his daughter who is married to a sergeant in the eleventh they also have a condo at the shore peter got it from internal affairs coughlin asked until just now i thought he got it from you matt said either you or chief lowenstein he said he wanted answers before internal affairs got involved chief inspector matthew l lowenstein was chief of detectives and have you come up with any answers not so far what have you got so far his major expense is the condo matt said the payment on the mortgageis about a month they furnished it from scratch and the furniture payment is a month the yukon whats ayukon coughlin interrupted im not really sure what cassidy hasand the old one too that he gave to his daughteris the big gmc until i started this i thought they called them suburbans okay coughlin said anyway he bought the new yukonno tradeinwith no money down on a fouryear note thats a month thats about thirtyfour hundred a month coughlin interrupted which is a large chunk out of a captains pay his house is paid for matt said he lives in northeast philly not far from chief wohl i know he has two kids in school one in archbishop ryan high school and the other in temple i dont know yet what that costs its not cheap on the income side in the last nine months his mother who lived with him died and so did a brother an unmarried brother in easton there was some insuranceim working on how muchand some property im working on that gut feeling i dont think hes on the take matt said not the type you think you can tell by looking do you matty the black buddha told me that just because you cant take your gut feeling to court doesnt mean you should ignore it matt said you better get out of the habit of calling him that if youre going to homicide it doesnt make him mad matt argued he told me that buddha was a very wise man and god knows im black coughlin chuckled have you thought whatlieutenant washington is going to think if you go to homicide thats two if youre going to homicides come on uncle denny get the speech over with sure matt said aside from the fact that captain patrick cassidy is an affable irishman who is good to his wife and daughter and probably has a dog named spot why arent you made suspicious by his sudden new affluence there could be a number of explanations for it im all ears he cared for his mother for years she could have left him money or the brother even if they didnt i can hear his wife saying okay thats over your mothers gone i want a place at the shore even if they cant afford it i hope to find out they can matt said i was going to go to easton today to check the brothers will was here i am at your orders matt said we wont be at the roy rogers long coughlin said i just wanted a look around after the crime scene people did their business i thought you might want to have a look since you may go to homicide thats two ifs and a may wheres the speech i would thank you they rode in silence for a minute or two and there was no speech which both surprised and worried matt there has to be a hook in the two ifs and a may whats he done had a word with the commissioner who will call me in and say that while im certainly entitled to go to homicide the department has a real problem they really need a sergeant with your experience in the special victims unit and youll certainly understand that the needs of the department are paramount and i give you my word that youll get to homicide one day if thats what hes done he certainly wont tell me shit who were they talking about when i walked in matt asked whos who the bastard frank hollaran said hed really like to see in shackles that mike sabara wants to personally strap in the electric chair isaac fort festung the sonofabitch keeps sending pekach postcards who is he you really dont know coughlin asked his surprise evident in his voice no i dont matt confessed the name sounds familiar but no i really dont know what did he do how old are you matty twentyseven i guess thats why you never heard of him when you were seven years oldno six she was in the trunk for a yearfort festung beat his girlfriend to death stuffed her body in a trunk and put the trunk in a closet when they finally found her her body was mummified jesus and he sends dave pekach postcards from prison matt asked and then remembering added i thought dave said from france he did coughlin said festung never went to prison after dave got a search warrant found the body and arrested him his lawyer now our beloved senator feldman got him released at his arraignment on forty thousand dollars bail and he jumped it he was charged with murder and got out on bail matt asked incredulously yeah thats just what he did coughlin said and hes been on the run ever since a couple of months ago they found him in france and now hell be extradited and tried hes already been tried the onlyin absentia trial i ever heard about the jury found him guilty and eileen solomon sentenced him to life without possibility of parole the da matt asked surprised the hon eileen mcnamara solomon had just been reelected as district attorney of philadelphia taking sixtyseven percent of the votes cast before she was da she was a judge coughlin said and no matty it doesnt look as if hell be extradited hes got the french government in his pocket and knows it and likes to rub it in our faces especially dave pekachs thats what the postcard was all about hes still thumbing his nose at the system ill be damned matt said get the case out and read it its interesting coughlin said and then nodding out the windshield i wonder if theyre just slow or they got something matt followed his glance the crime scene van was parked on snyder street fifty yards past the roy rogers restaurant i think theres a place to park right in front of the van coughlin said you can drop me here you want me to come in matt asked as he pulled to the curb thats the idea coughlin said as he got out of the car if youre going to homicide you might find this educational thats three ifs and a may three matt had to show his badge to the uniform standing outside to get past him into the roy rogers and then was surprised to find coughlin waiting for him just inside the door the restaurant was empty except for a man matt guessed was the manager sitting with a cup of coffee at one of the banquettes near the door and a forensic technician trying to findor maybe liftprints from a banquette at the rear of the restaurant by the kitchen door and then the kitchen door opened and detective tony harris came through it and saw coughlin he walked up to him commissioner he said tony coughlin said as they shook hands then coughlin asked they found something jason didnt think they found enough harris said thats why he sent them back the famous jason washingtons never leave a stone unturned philosophy never leave the stonesunder the stone unturned harris said can you walk it through for me tony bright eyes here just might learn something sure harris said two doers they came through that door two young black guys one of them fat theyi got this primarily from a guy who works heretook a look around then the fat one walked to the last booth on the left and sat down and the other one sat in the first boothwhere you are matt my eyewitness who was mopping the floor by the door ducked into the kitchen he looked out saw the fat guy take a revolverwrapped in newspaperfrom his jacket and told the kitchen supervisor she called the next thing my eyewitness knew there was a shot harris pointed to the ceiling above where matt was standing we recovered the bullet full jacket if we can find the gun we can most likely get a good match then the fat doer went into the kitchen lets have a look coughlin said yes sir harris said and led them through the restaurant to the kitchen doors we have a bunch of prints from both sides of the doors harris said all the employees had been fingerprinted so were running the ones we lifted against those he pushed the door open my eyewitness was behind the door with his back against the wall harris said he saw the fat doer grab the telephone listen a momentpresumably long enough to hear she was talking to police radiorip the phone from the wall call her an obscene name hold his revolver at arms length and shoot her she slid down the wall and then fell forward he pointed to the chalked outline of a body on the floor and to blood smeared on the wall then the fat doer herded everybody but my eyewitness who he didnt see into the cooler and jammed a sharpening steel into the padlock loops he pointed to the cooler door then went on then he went back into the restaurant not seeing my eyewitness and started to take wallets et cetera from the citizens doer number one meanwhile is taking money from the cash register right about then kenny charlton came through the door doer number one is crouched behind the cashiers counter kenny saw him the doer jumps up wraps his arm around kenny wrestles with him the fat doer then runs up sticks his gun under kennys bulletproof vest and fires kenny goes down doer number one steps over kennys body takes two shots at it and then follows doer number two out the door and down snyder mickey ohara got their picture but its a lousy picture no fault of mickeys why did the fat doer stick his gun under charltons vest matt asked why not just shoot him in the head or the lower back below the vest coughlin gave him a look matt could not interpret and finally decided it was exasperation at his having asked a question that obviously could not be answered tony harris held up both hands in a helpless gesture the restaurant manager walked up to them with three mugs of coffee on a tray i thought you and the other detectives might like thats very nice of you coughlin said mr benetti this is commissioner coughlin harris said oh jesus im sorry i like to think im still a detective coughlin said no offense taken i uh dont know how to say this benetti said but im glad to see you here commissioner i would hate to have what those animals did to mrs fernandez and officer charlton wind up as an unsolved crime were going to try very hard mr benetti to make sure that doesnt happen coughlin said benetti looked at coughlin then put out his hand thank you he said and walked away coughlin looked over his shoulder then pointed to one of the banquettes he slid in one side and tony harris and matt into the other still no idea who these animals are coughlin asked harris shook his head no the police artists stuff is just about useless harris said everybody saw somebody else were going to have to have a tip or make them with a fingerprint coughlin shook his head one question tony i want the answer off the top of your head how would you feel about having sergeant payne in homicide harris chuckled then smiled i heard the list was out he said good for you matt that doesnt answer my question tony coughlin said welcome welcome tony said i should have known better than to try that coughlin said in law school they teach you never to ask a question to somebody on the stand unless you know what the answers going to be commissioner you asked harris said whats wrong with matt coming to homicide hes too young for one thing he hasnt been on the job long enough for another i can go on hes also smart harris said and hes a stoneunderthe stone turner i didnt wonder why this bastard didnt shoot kenny in the head or lower back matt already thinks like the black buddha the other stuff we can teach him coughlin snorted and hes going to make a good witness on the stand harris said think about that ill be damned coughlin said for a moment i thought i guess to be honest hopedyou were pulling my leg but youre serious arent you tony harris nodded his head i thought youd be all for him coming to homicide he said coughlin looked between the two of them but didnt respond directly after a moment he asked are you about finished here tony just about i need a ride to the roundhouse my pleasure matts going to easton on a job i gave peter wohl and peter gave to matt coughlin said and hed better get going what jobs that harris asked one of those id rather not talk about coughlin said looking at matt but the sooner youknow something matt the better yes sir i understand you sore at me matt coughlin said i could never be sore at you matt said coughlin met his eyes and then nodded then he pushed himself out of the banquette four matt started to head for the schuylkill expressway as the fastest way out of town when he turned onto south street he punched the autodial button on his cellular which caused inspector wohl to answer his cellular on the second ring matt boss commissioner coughlins on his way back to the roundhouse and im on my way to easton okay from the cheerful sound of your voice i guess you again refused to listen to his sage advice he didnt offer any matt said he tried to sandbag me with tony harris and tony said i already think like the black buddha they can teach me what i have to know and welcomeno welcome welcometo homicide there was a moments silence he also told me he gave you the cassidy job matt said again there was a perceptible pause if you come up with something unpleasant give me a call wohl said otherwise fill me in in the morning yes sir matt said wohl broke the connection without saying anything else at the next intersectionsouth and twentieth streets matt changed his mind about the schuylkill expressway and instead drove back to rittenhouse square where he drove into the underground garage parked the unmarked ford and got in the porsche it had occurred to him that he hadnt driven the porsche much lately and it needed a run what he liked best about the porschesomething he somewhat snobbishly thought most people didnt understandwas not how easily you could get it up to well over miles per houra great many cars would do thatbut how beautifully it handled on narrow winding roads making or where lesser cars would lose control at or less such as the twenty miles or so of route between kintnersville and easton where the road ran alongside the old delaware canal with the winding road and a lot else on his mind god that was an unexpected compliment from tony harris me thinking like jason and it couldnt have been timed better uncle denny had egg all over his face i wonder when the promotion will actually happen what am i going to do if captain cassidys brothers will hasnt been filed in the courthouse some people dont even have wills what do they call that intestate something like that with a little luck the courthousell have a computer and i can do a search for all real estate in the name of john paul cassidy ive got to find out more about whatshisname who stuffed his girlfriend in a trunk and sends dave pekach taunting postcards from europe uncle denny said the body was a mummified and b in the trunk for a year didnt it smell ill have to find out when stan colt is going to grace philadelphia with his presence i really would like to see more a hell of a lot more of vice president terry davis nice legs nice everything he didnt think about route passing through doylestown right past the crossroads diner until the diner itself came into view shit shit shit the mental image of susan with the neat hole under her sightless eyes jumped into his mind no goddamn it no not twice in one day think of something else terry davis in the shower a mummified body in a trunk if you want to feel nauseous think of a stinking mummified body but a mummies dont stink they look like leather statues but they dont smell b mummies are bodies that have gone through some sort of preservation process they gut them i think i remember from sixth grade and then fill the cavity with some kind of preservatives or was it rocks sand and then wrap them in linen the body in this weirdos trunk might have been dried out after a year but technically speaking it wasnt mummified after a year why wasnt it a skeleton wouldnt the flesh have completely decomposed giving off one hell of a stink in a year there is a lot you dont know about bodies and ergo sum a sergeant of the homicide bureau should know a lot about dead bodies maybe i can take a course at the university not a bullshit undergraduate course but a course at the medical school amys a professor she should a know and b have the clout to have her little brother admitted christ im going seventyfive in a fiftyfive zone sorry to be speeding officer what it was when i passed the crossroads diner was that i naturally recalled my girlfriend with the back of her head blown out in the parking lot terry davis has long legs nice long legs why do long legs turn me on why do some bosoms but not others turn me on why did terry davis turn me on like that she really does have nice legs and she smelled good too he recognized where he was what he thought of as the end of straight out of doylestown the concrete highway turned into macadam made a sharp right turn then a sharp left turn and then got curvy right around the next curve is where we pick up the old canal ill be damned im not going to throw up and im not sweatsoaked thank you god he made the left turn and shoved his foot hard against the accelerator four one johnny cassidys shamrock bar was on the hill in easton nearand drawing much of its business fromlafayette college even at four in the afternoon there were a lot of customers mixed students and faculty and other staff of the college matt took a stool at the bar and ordered a beer a pickled egg and a cassidy burgerfamous all over the hill and struck up a conversation with the bartender who had a plastic nameplate with a shamrock and mickey oneal manager printed on it pinned to his crisp white opencollar cuffsrolledup shirt matt thought he was probably thirtyfive or forty and was not surprised that he was talkative when matt asked how johnny cassidy was oneal shook his head sadly and said the big c had gotten him five no six months before johnny kept feeling tired and he finally went to the doctor and six weeks later he was dead died the same week as his mother in fact so whats going to happen to the bar its going to stay open mickey oneal said firmly and then went on to explain that hed worked in the place for fifteen years before johnny died starting out as an afternoon bartender and working his way up to assistant manager and got to know him real well johnny had been godfather to two of his kids they called him uncle johnny when johnny knew his time was up he made a deal with mickey and his brotherjohnnys younger brother nice guy whos a cop in philadelphia and who had cared for their mother until she died johnny had never marriedwhich gave twentyfive percent of the place to oneal and the rest to his brother were talking about me buying him out over time you know but right now im just running the place for the both of us once a month i write him a check for his share of what we make its a pretty good deal all around the bar stays open which means i have a job and his brother gets a checka nice check i dont mind sayingonce a month which is nice too johnny figured he owed his brotherdid i say hes a cop in phillyfor taking care of their mother all those years there were now answers to the questions raised by what detective payne had learned at the northampton county court house seven months before for one dollar and other good and valuable consideration all assets real estate inventory and goodwill of the property privately held by john paul cassidy at tatamy road easton had been sold to the shamrock corporation the building at tatamy road housed both johnny cassidys shamrock bar and above it four apartments on two floors it would appear on the surfacehe would nose around a little more of coursethat there was a perfectly good reason for captain cassidys sudden affluence if the brother had insurance which seemed likelyand the mother did which also seemed likelythat would explain where he had gotten the cash to buy the condominium at the shore and it seemed reasonable that getting a check every month for his share of the profits would explain why captain cassidy felt he could afford to give his old suburban to his daughter and buy a new yukon xl no money down to be paid for with the monthly check detective payne had a third beer on the house and another pickled egg and then got back in his porsche to return to philadelphia two the temptation to take the very interesting winding road beside the old delaware canal was irresistible but he didnt want to go back through doylestownpast the crossroads dinerso he turned off route onto route a few miles south of riegelsville and followed it along the delaware a few miles past new hope his cellular phone tinkled he looked at his watch and saw that it was quarter to five thats probably peter despite what he said about filling him in in the morning he wants to know what i found out yes sir inspector sir detective payne at your service sir hey matt a familiar voice said it was that of chad nesbitt they had been best friends since kindergarten the crown prince of tomato soup himself to what do i owe the honor where are you chad asked a tone of exasperation in his voice about five miles south of picturesque new hope on route i presume there is some reason for your curiosity what are you doing way up there fighting crime of course protecting defenseless citizens such as yourself from evildoers daffy wants you to come to supper can you daffy was mrs nesbitt why does that make me suspicious matt for christs sake make peace with her it gets to be a real pain in the ass for me with you two always at each others throat whats the occasion theres a girl she wants you to meet not only no but hell no this ones nice i think youll like her shes a nymphomaniac who owns a liquor store sometimes matt you can be a real pain in the ass chad said there was a perceptible silence come on matt please if you give me your solemn word that when i get there we can go directly from how do you do to carnal pleasures on your carpet without fuck you come or dont when as soon as you can get here okay matt said take me half an hour depending on the traffic on interstate the wachenhut security guards who stood in the colonialstyle guard shack at the entrance to stockton place in society hill were chosen by wachenhut with more care than their guards at the more than one hundred other locations wachenhut protected in the philadelphia area not only was wachenhuts regional vice president for the philadelphia area resident in one of the luxury apartments behind the stripedpole barrier but so were executives of other corporations which employed large numbers of wachenhut security personnel number stockton place for example a triplex constructed behind the facades of four of the twelve prerevolutionary brownstone buildings on the east side of stockton place was owned by nb properties inc the principal stockholder of which was chadwick thomas nesbitt iii and was occupied by mr and mrs chadwick t nesbitt iv mr nesbitt iv was working his way upward in the corporate rankshe had recently been named a vice presidentof nesfoods international of which his father was chairman of the executive committee four of nesfoods internationals philadelphiaarea manufacturing facilities employed the wachenhut corporation to provide the necessary security as did many other nesfoods establishments around the world it therefore behooved wachenhut to put its best security foot forward so to speak on stockton place it wasnt only a question of providing faultless aroundthe clock securitywachenhut had learned how to do that splendidly over the yearsbut to do so in such a manner as not to antagonize those being protected and their guests the senior security officer on duty in the shack when the porsche carrera rolled up was a retired soldier who had spent twenty years in the corps in the military police his retirement pay wasnt going as far as hed thought it would and since he had enlisted at seventeen and retired at thirtyeight hed still been a young man who wanted to work wachenhut had been glad to have him assigned him with a raise in payto stockton place after only six months on the job and made him a supervisor eighteen months after he had joined the firm his superiors thought he would be capable of handling the sometimes delicate stockton place assignment and he had proven them right when the silver porsche carrera slowed as it approached the barrier the senior security officer on duty nodded at it then spoke softly to the trainee now this guy doesnt look like hes either about to break into an apartment or try to sell something very few burglars drive cars like that so you smile at him ask him who he wishes to see and then for his name then you say thank you very much sir raise the barrier and call whoever he said hes going to see and tell them hes coming got it the trainee said and stepped out of the guard shack good evening sir he said to the driver how may i help you matthew payne to see mr nesbitt matt said thank you sir the trainee said and stepped inside the guard shack and pushed the button that raised the barrier before the porsche was past the barrier the wachenhut supervisor was on the interior telephone like this he said and then when the phone was answered said this is the gate we have just passed a mr payne to see mr nesbitt matt pulled the porsche to the curb in front of number got out walked to the redpainted door and pushed the doorbell the door was opened almost immediately by mr nesbitt iv who looked very much like matt payne but a little shorter and a little heavier hello you ugly bastard he said then he raised his voice dump the dope the cops are here then he embraced matt thanks for coming and for christs sake behave yourself the ground floor foyer of number was open to a skylight in the roof invisible from the street to the right was the door to the elevator and to the left the door to the stairs there were balconies on the first and second floors of the atrium mrs chadwick t nesbitt iv the former daphne elizabeth browne known for most of her life as daffy a tall attractive blonde appeared on the upper balcony looked down smiled and called matt how nice come up matt and chad got on the elevator and when the door closed and he was reasonably sure he couldnt be heard matt asked how nice is she into the sauce chad laughed looketh not ye gift horse in ye mouth he said the elevator stopped and the door opened revealing the living room of the apartment floortoceiling tinted glass walls provided a view of the delaware river the benjamin franklin bridge and on the new jersey shore mounted on nowdisused buildings a huge illuminated sign showing a steaming bowl of soup and the legend nesfoods delivers taste and nutrition daffy nesbitt kissed matt on the cheek then turned and cried terry this is chads and my oldest friend in the world sitting on the thickly carpeted floor with miss penelope alice nesbitt aged twentytwo months was terry davis she smiled at matts pleased surprise matt looked at mrs nesbitt get it over with daffy he said get what over with whatever youre going to say next in the mistaken belief that it will either be clever or terribly amusing hey matt shes being nice chad said thats what worries me matt said hello again terry said again daffy asked we met this morning terry said id tell daffy we had breakfast together but she would read something into that matt said smiling at terry now whos being clever and terribly amusing you prick daffy snapped daffy please try to control your vulgarity in front of my goddaughter matt said unctuously terry davis laughed is she really she asked your goddaughter yeah matt said shes adorable yeah what do you mean you had breakfast daffy asked at the ritzcarlton no less matt said anybody for a drink chad asked you got any champagne matt asked you hate champagne daffy said not on those days on which i get promoted i dont matt said but ill settle for scotch promoted to what daffy asked to sergeant thank you for asking no shit hey good for you matt chad said he went behind a wet bar and came up with a bottle of champagne i knew there was one in here terry daffy said matt is a police officer i know one of philadelphias finest terry said who said that daffy asked in disbelief the monsignor what was his name schneider matt said i think hes a closet cop groupie he dropped to the carpet and picked up the toddler and tickled her she shrieked in delight matt you know youre not supposed to do that with her daffy said she obviously hates it matt said what have you got against tickling he nonetheless handed the child to terry and got up it hyperexcites her daffy said oh matt said the champagne cork popped and matt walked to the wet bar and took a glass then handed it to terry thank you she said congratulations thank you he said and turned to daffy yes thank you very much id love to youd love to what stay for supper matt said would you believe wiseass that chad tried to call you to ask you to supper he said they said you were out of town and they didnt know when youd be back daffy said i talked to him but i didnt know if he could make it chad said so i didnt tell you daffy has this terrible habit of offering me up to the ugliest women matt said i think they pay her thats what i thought she was doing to me when she said someone was coming she really wanted me to meet terry said youre not nearly as ugly as i thought you would be then you cant ask for your money back can you terry laughed you really are a bastard arent you she asked he took a second glass of champagne from chad then making a show of thinking it over carefully shrugged and handed it to daffy in these circumstances i will give you a walk he said which means what that tonight i will not wring your neck for playing cupid matt said half the police department already knows im in love with terry damn you youre embarrassing terry are you embarrassed terry matt asked im still having trouble getting used to the idea that youre a policeman she said and that you showed up here did you know i was here of course i had you under surveillance from the time you left the savoyplaza that man in the overcoat who exposed himself to you on broad street one of my better men terry laughed baloney she said ill prove it to you he has a camera delicacy forbids my telling where ill send you a print he mimed opening an overcoat focused his hips and then mimed pushing a shutter cord say cheese click gotcha chad laughed oh god terry said i cant believe you did that daffy said but youre smiling daffy darling we thought wed eat in daffy said quickly changing the subject terry has to be at the airport at eleventhirty i bought some shrimp at the twelfth street market but monday the cook is off thats daffys way terry matt said of asking whether i will be good enough to prepare my world famous wild turkey shrimp wild turkey shrimp over wild rice matt said yes daffy i will butyoull have to peel the slimy crustaceans thats beneath the dignity of a master chef such as myself ive got to give penny her bath daffy complained ill peel the shrimp terry said i have to see this wild turkeyyoure talking about the whiskey matt nodded shrimp bring your glass ill bring the bottle the kitchen for some unknown reason is on the ground floor matt led terry into the kitchen turned on the fluorescent lights and then took his jacket off and laid it on a counter then he took his pistol from its shoulder holster held it toward the floor away from terry removed the clip and then ejected the round in the chamber im impressed terry said if that was your intention he gave her a dirty look but didnt reply he reloaded the ejected round in the magazine put the magazine in the pistol the pistol in the shoulder holster then shrugged out of that and hung it on an empty hook of the pot rack above the stainlesssteel stove then he looked at her i wasnt trying to impress you i dont like leaving guns around with a round in the chamber sorry she said and then asked what kind of a gun is that he looked at her for a moment before deciding the question was a peace offering its an officers model colt matt said a a cutdown version of the old army thats what all the cops carry no most philadelphia cops carry glocks theyre semiautomatic like this one but ninemillimeter not then i think this a better weapon and they let you do that with great reluctance i had to go through a lot of bureaucratic bullshdifficulty before i got permission to carry this what is it with colt terry asked excuse me theres some sort of significance obviously stan actually changed his name legally to colt and he always carries a colt automatic in his films what was his name before coleman stan colt nee stanley coleman yeah whatever works i guess matt said chuckling to answer your question i suppose there is a certain romance to colt they call the old colt revolver the gun that won the west and then the colt model the big brother of my pistolwas the service weapon right through vietnam now the services use a ninemillimeter beretta you ever shoot anybody with that pistol not with that one but you have shot someone why dont we just drop this subject right here matt flared sorry she said offended and sarcastic he found a plastic bag of shrimp in the refrigerator took it to the sink tore the bag open and started to peel them after a long moment terry went and stood beside him and took a handful of shrimp he glanced at her but said nothing they peeled shrimp in silence for perhaps three minutes and then matt said thats not the first time youve peeled shrimp how can you tell most people dont know how to squeeze the tail that way my dad has a boat we have a place on catalina island i practically grew up peeling shrimp your fathers a movie star producer executive lawyer she said with connections in the industry enough to get me my first job with gam sos mine matt said a lawyer with connections daffy told mewhen she was selling me on the blind date actually hes my adoptive father matt said as he took a large skillet from an overhead rack your parents were divorced mine too my father was killed before i was born matt said he was a cop a sergeant named john x moffitt and he answered a silent alarm and got himself shot my mother married my dadthat sounds funny doesnt itabout six months later hed lost his wife in a car crash a really good guy he adopted me legally is that why youre a policeman because of your father thats one of the reasons certainly matt said as he unwrapped a stick of butter i like being a cop daffy doesnt approve terry said i know daffy would be delightedbecause of chadif i married a nice young woman such as yourself went to law school and took my proper role in society yeah terry replied thoughtfully i picked up a little of that tell me about your promotion the sergeants examination list came out today matt said with underwhelming modesty i was number one and get to pick my assignment which is homicide what is that some sort of a death wish huh homicide sounds dangerous she said killers right i never thought about it matt said but now that i do homicides not dangerous being on the street is dangerous my father was a uniform sergeant in a district thats dangerous cops get hurt answering domesticdisturbance calls stopping speeders homicides nothing like that youve been watching too many stan colt movies i dont really understand street cops face the bad guys every day last night a uniform cop answered a robberyinprogress call at the roy rogers restaurant on broad street one of the two bad guys shoved a revolver under his bulletproof vest and killed him the first homicide guy didnt get to the scene for maybe fifteen minutes by then the bad guys were long gone she looked at him but said nothing the trick to this is to saute them slowly in butter with a little cajun seasoning he said you add the booze just before serving and flame it and since the rice isnt done we can put this on hold and have another glass of wine while we wait for the rice and the bathers to finish with the bathee what about when they arrest the bad guys isnt that dangerous first you have to find out who the bad guys are then make sure you canto the district attorneys satisfaction make the case against them then if theyre not already in the roundhouse surrounded by cops if you have to go out to arrest them you take enough uniforms with you to make sure nobody gets hurt thats not much like one of stans movies is it she asked not much he agreed as he filled her glass then why does homicide have the prestige you were as proud as a peacock to tell me you were going to homicide homicide detectives are the best detectives in the department he said when youre trying somebody for a capital offense all the ts have to be crossed and the is dotted theres no room for mistakes people who kill people should pay for it and homicide sergeants modesty precludes my answering that question modest you aint sergeant sergeant i aint either im just number one on the list god only knows when ill actually get promoted and sent to homicide and in the meantime youll have to do something beneath your dignity like protecting stan from his adoring fans or vice versa meaning now that were going to be professionally associated i think i should tell you that stan likes young women very young women that ought to go over big with the monsignor and the cardinal and im noti am now really sorry to saygoing to be involved in that thats dignitary protection and sometimes since the subject came up that can be really dangerous dignitaries celebrities attract lunatics like a magnet youre not going to be involved no i was just there this morning to seefor my boss what the triumphal visit will involve im with special operations and we usually provide the bodies needed im sorry too she said we will solve that problem when you come back he said i really want to see more of you so what do you do in special operations she said obviously changing the subject today for example i think i proved that a cop whos been spending more money than a cop makes came by it entirely honestly internal affairs no this was unofficial before internal affairs got involved now there wont be an internal affairs investigation a good thing because just being involved with internal affairs makes people look bad mr and mrs chadwick t nesbitt iv and a freshly bathed penelope in her nightgown appeared in the kitchen at this point and detective payne resumed his preparation of wild turkey shrimp over wild rice at matt said that he would be happy to deliver terry to the airport to catch the redeye to the coast at as he closed the trunk of the porsche after having taken terrys luggage from it and she was standing close enough to him to be kissed a uniform walked up and said youre going to have to move it sir sorry matt took out his badge and said three sixtynine which was police cant for i am a police officer the uniform walked away matt looked at terry saddened by the lost opportunity terry stood on her toes and kissed him chastely on the lips thanks she said then quickly turned and entered the airport she turned once and looked back at him and then he lost sight of her he got back in the porsche and on the way to rittenhouse square decided that all things considered today had been a pretty good day three the hon alvin w martin mayor of the city of philadelphia a trim fortythreeyearold in a wellcut harris plaid suit smiled at police commissioner ralph j mariani and waved him into his city hall office thank you for coming so quickly ralph he said have you had your coffee the mayor gestured toward a silver coffee service on a sideboard i could use another cup thank you mariani said he was a stocky italian balding natty i was distressed ralph the mayor said to hear about the trouble at the roy rogers very sad mariani said i knew officer charlton a fine man and mrs fernandez who paid with her life for calling a genuine tragedy sir mariani said im going to the funeral home at three this afternoon martin said i should say homes officer charltons first and then mrs fernandezs i think it would be a good idea if you went with me yes sir of course i feel sure the press will be there the mayor said id really like to have something to tell them im afraid i dont have much news mr mayor mariani said were working on it of course and its just a matter of time until we nail those animals but so far when you say youre working on it what exactly does that mean that were applying all our resources to the job whos in charge of the investigation lieutenant washington of homicide sir the mayor knew lieutenant jason washington which was not the same thing as saying he liked him the mayor thought of washington as a difficult man who was not able to concealor perhaps didnt want to concealhis contempt for politicians mayor martin had sought lieutenant washington out shortly after taking office the police department always provides a police officer sometimes a sergeant but most often a lieutenant to drive the mayoral limousine serving simultaneously of course as bodyguard hed toyed with the idea of having a white officera very large happy smiling irishman who would look good in the background of news photos came to mindbut before he could make the appointment hed seen washington striding purposefully though the lobby of the roundhouse and asked who he was that night he had mentioned the enormous lieutenant to his wife beatrice at supper i thought you knew jason beatrice said hes marthas husband the mayor knew his wifes friend martha washington beatrice as the mayor thought of it was into art and that sort of thing and martha washington was both a very successful art dealer and a painter of some repute no i dont the mayor confessed how do you think hed like to be the mayors driver i dont think so beatrice had said i cant imagine jason as a chauffeuryours or anyone elses youre going to have to get used to being the mayors wife precious mayor martin had taken the trouble to meet washington socially which had proven more difficult to do than he thought it would be the mayor had arranged for the washingtons to be invited to a friends cocktail party and when they sent their regrets to a second friends cocktail party which invitation they also declined with regret on the third try he finally got to meet them and alvin w martins first impression of jason washington that night was that he was going to like him possibly very much and that he would look just fine in the background of press photos washington was an imposing man superbly tailored and erudite without rubbing it in your face the mayor studying washingtons suit with the eye of a man who appreciated good tailoring wondered how he could afford to dress that well on a detectives salary he decided the artist wife picked up the tab he finally managed to get him alone id really like to get together with you jason you dont mind if i call you jason do you not at all im in the process of selecting a driver would you be interested with all possible respect mr mayor absolutely not actually it would entail more than just driving the limo the mayor had said i really need someone around who can explain the subtleties of the police department to me im sure youll have no trouble finding such a person mr mayor and specifically i need input from someone knowledgeable about what i might be able to do for our fellow blacks in the police department i can tell you that mr mayor in a very few words really support a meaningful pay raise get it through the city council policemen often have a hard time making ends meet i was speaking specifically of black police officers there are two kinds of police officers mr mayor the bad onesa small minorityand all the others and all the others are colored blue thats a little jingoistic isnt it lieutenant simplistic perhaps mr mayor and perhaps chauvinistic but i dont think jingoistic which as i understand the word carries a flavor of belligerence i certainly didnt intend let me be very frank the mayor said when i asked around for the name of an outstanding black officer to whom i could turn with questions regarding the police department generally and black officers in the department specifically your name immediately came up you have a splendid reputation and i wondered how it is youre a lieutenant only a lieutenant is that what you mean all right if you want to put it that way you dont think race had anything to do with you having been a policeman twentythree years before being promoted to lieutenant mr mayor ive spent most of my career in homicide youve been described to me as one of the best homicide investigators anywhere washington ignored the compliment and continued where because of the extraordinary amount of overtime required most detectives make as much as inspectors and some as much as chief inspectors i was a little late reaching my present rank because i never took the examination until i had assurance in writing that should i pass and be promoted i would not be transferred from homicide aware that his temper was rising the mayor said i wasnt aware that you could make deals like that they arent common frankly the more you reject the idea the more it appeals to me i need someone who will tell me how things are rather than what they think i want to hear and i was under the impression that police officers serve where their superiors decide they can be of the most value thats true of course washington had replied but it is also true that police officers my age with twenty years or more of service can retire at any time they so desire the mayor suddenly saw the headline in thebulletin ace homicide lieutenant retires rather than become mayors driver well im disappointed of course the mayor had said but i will certainly respect your wishes you will be available wont you if i need an expert to explain something to me im at your service mr mayor washington had said mayor martin now looked across his desk and asked and what does lieutenant washington have to say about why these people havent been arrested its been two days commissioner mariani replied i talked to him last night mr mayor he says hes doing everything he can think of to do and that somethings bound to turn up right now we dont even know who the doers are there were no witnesses there were witnesses sir mickey ohara of thebulletin even took a picture of the doers as they left the restaurant he was one of the first to reach the scene unfortunately it wasnt a very good photograph we have a picture of these people the mayor asked incredulously not a very good picture mr mayor i can see the story in thebulletin the mayor said unpleasantly even with a photo provided by the bulletin police are unable to identify much less arrest ohara wouldnt write a story like that mariani said he understands our problem you have more faith in the press than i do obviously the mayor said and none of the witnesses can come up with a description of these people we put police artists on the job immediately mr mayor the result of that has been a number of pictures none of which look like any other picture everybody saw something else the bottom line then is that you dont have a clue as to who these people are were doing our best sir thats really not good enough commissioner the mayor said i need something for the press and i need it by three this afternoon what would you like me to say sir how about forming a task force we have one in everything but name now sir a cop has been killed washington can have anything he asks for its just going to take some time im afraid a cop and a single mother of three the mayor said we dont want to forget her do we were not forgetting her sir but when a police officer is killed it sort of mobilizes the entire department just for the record commissioner the entire police department should be mobilized whenever any of our citizens is brutally murdered yes sir of course what about special operations commissioner sir supposing i announce this afternoon that i have ordered that the special operations division take over the investigation sir its a homicide the commissioner said you dont think its a good idea i gather mr mayor it wont accomplish anything thats not already been done if i call inspector wohl who is the commanding officer of special operations sir okay if i call him right now and give him the job hell say yes sir and then hell call lieutenant washington and ask him how he can help i dont know this for a fact but ill bet wohl has already done that lets do it anyway the mayor said make it official and tell this inspector wohl you said yes sir to light a fire under washington yes sir sir inspector wohl was once a homicide detective so much the better arookie homicide detective jason washington as a very experienced very good homicide detective was charged with bringing detective wohl up to homicide speed commissioner the mayor interrupted somewhat sharply im getting the feeling youre dragging your feet for reasons i cant imagine so i repeat call this inspector wohl and tell him he is now in charge of this investigation task force and i expect results yes sir ill do so immediately theres one more thing the mayor said the cardinal called me at home last night yes sir about the visit of stan colt the cardinal said that colt being here may raise a half million dollars or more for west catholic high school it probably will sir the cardinal wants to make sure mr colts visit goes smoothly and in this case i want what the cardinal wants so do i mr mayor after the cardinal called me about mr colt coming here i gave mr colt visiting dignitary status for his trip he will be under the care of the dignitary protection unit so he told me the mayor replied what he called me about was the assignment to colts visit of a particular detective apparently this detective made a very good impression on monsignor schneiderwhos doing the nuts and bolts of colts visit for the cardinalwhen they met at some sort of preliminary meeting id like this done certainly sir you have the detectives name payne the mayor said and then he read the commissioners face you know him is there going to be some problem with this we published the sergeants examination ratings yesterday the commissioner said detective payne ranked number one in other words hes a very bright detective and a very good one and now hes a sergeant he will be whenever the promotion ceremony is held and when will that be whenever you decide mr mayor how about he checked his calendar im free from ninefifteen until ten tomorrow morning sir we have the funds to promote the top twentyone men on the list immediately it would be difficult to get all twentyone in on such short notice the mayor gave him a look that was mingled curiosity and exasperation we could promote the top five commissioner mariani said you will recall sir we offered the top five examinees their choice of assignment and you can get all five in here tomorrow morning yes sir im sure i can good well get him in here and promote him and the others and then assign sergeant payne to dignitary protection but theres a small problem there too im sorry to say payne is entitled to his choice of assignment commissioner why dont you suggest to detective payne that the dignitary protection unit would be a fine choice of assignment he wants to go to homicide sir how do you know that deputy commissioner coughlin told me sir hes detective paynes godfather figuratively speaking or literally the mayor asked sarcastically both sir the mayor exhaled in exasperation then i suggest you suggest to deputy commissioner coughlin that he suggest to detective payne that dignitary protection would be a fine choiceindeed the only choice for detective payne to make mr mayor the prizethe choice of assignmenthas been widely publicized if we dont make good on the promise what im afraid the fraternal order of police would jesus christ the mayor exploded how about this then commissioner we promote payne sergeant payne is assigned to homicide and thentemporarily assigned to dignitary protection for stan colts visit that would work fine sir then please see that its done the mayor said ill look for you here about quarter to three thank you commissioner five one inspector wohl and detective payne were alone in wohls office at the arsenal paynes laptop was on wohls coffee table and payne was bent over it using it as a notebook as he reported to wohl on his investigation of the sudden affluence of captain cassidy wohl held up his hand to detective payne to stop he was about to answer his cellular phone he picked the cellular up from his desk and answered it wohl then he slipped the cellular into a device on his desk which activated a handsoff system are you there inspector jason washingtons deep resonant voice came from the speaker just putting the phone in the whatchamacallit jason lieutenant washington reporting for duty sir do i have to tell you this wasnt my idea jason i understand it was the mayors inspiration of the day washington said well just for the record lieutenant you are designated the senior investigating officer for the mayors task force investigating the murders at the roy rogers you will report directly to me now is there anything you feel you need to facilitate your investigation no sir if there is you will promptly let me know yes sir we now go off the record wohl said who told you the commissioner off the record he also told me about matt i thought matt would have called me me too wohl said detective payne why didnt you telephone lieutenant washington and inform him of your spectacular performance hes there washington asked brighteyed and bushytailed well detective payne i thought matt said raising his voice so the microphone on wohls desk would pick it up tony would tell you as indeed he did when can we expect your services sergeant homicides wastebaskets need emptying do they jason wohl asked innocently im not a sergeant yet you will be as i understand it at approximately ninethirty tomorrow morning may i assume that you will report for duty immediately thereafter your wastebaskets must be overflowing wohl said i have nothing so mundane in mind for sergeant payne inspector his first duty will be to supervise detective harris and harriss team matt thoughtthat will be a blind man leading the guide dog around tonys somehow fallen from grace wohl asked actually peter it was tonys idea he figures matt can keep other people from looking over his shoulder and we all know what a splendid typist sergeant payne is wohl considered thatthe problem of how rookie sergeant payne will fit into homicide has been solved jason said it was tonys idea but i suspect jason was involved matt will follow harris around relieve him of as many administrative details as possible and since he is both bright and aware of his massive ignorance of homicide procedures he will keep his mouth shut do whatever tony suggests which will include making sure that the rest of tonys team does what tony wants them to do and when and in the process learn a hell of a lotand grunted his agreement tony hasnt come up with anything on the doers wohl asked theyre out there somewhere peter washington said i think it highly unlikely that the mob imported two professionals from new york to stick up a roy rogers wohl chuckled one distinct possibility peter is that these two master criminals once they have gone through thebest estimate less than fifteen hundred dollars they earned on this job will do it again yeah wohl agreed seeing both the likelihood of a second or third or fourth robbery before they werealmost inevitablycaught and the likelihood that once they were arrested they could be identified in a lineup as the roy rogers doers there is an obvious downside to that washington went on their willingness to use their weapons compounded by the fact they know they are already facing murder two wohl interjected and there will be no greater penalty if they use them again washington finished for him or they may really go underground matt said knowing theyre wanted for murder two the cheap seats have been heard from wohl said i was about to make reference to wisdom from the mouths of babes washington said except of course hes right god dont tell him that his ego needs no buttressing actually peter he will bring a fresh approach which may very well be useful yesterday when tony walked coughlin and our new sergeant through the roy rogers matt wondered aloud why doer two put his revolver under charltons vest tony was somewhat chagrined that question hadnt occurred to him is that significant never leave a stone unturned washington began or the stone under the stone wohl finished you were as i recall an apt pupil washington said it might be it opens avenues of inquiry is doer two a cop hater for example is he someone who knew and intensely disliked kenny charlton did stan coltwhich brings us to thatuse the underthevest technique in one of his cinema fantasies yeah wohl agreed what about stan colt the commissioner didnt mention that sergeant paynes services will be required in dignitary protection when stan colt comes to our fair city no wohl said simply he didnt he apparently made a very good impression on monsignor schneider washington said as incredible as that might sound i am to lose his services temporarily whenever the colt people think they need him cant you get me out of that matt asked on the other hand that would give me a lot of time with terry no washington said petertony just walked in shaking his head ruefullyyou asked if there is anything i need i just thought of something its yours wohl said im a little short of wheels sergeant payne obviously will no longer be needing his sparkling new crown victoria okay wohl said and to prove what a fully cooperating fellow i am i will even have sergeant payne deliver it to you tomorrow when he reports for duty its always a pleasure dealing with you inspector washington said and the line went dead peter removed the cellular phone from the handsoff system laid it on the desk and turned to matt now where were we the telephone on his desk buzzed and wohl answered it the conversation was very brief wohl said yes sir three times yes sir at three once and yes sir one final time he looked at matt again the commissioner thinks it would be a very good idea if i were to be at the monti funeral home at three he said to coincide with the visit of the mayor and his announcement that he has formed a task force to quickly get the roy rogers doers matt nodded now where were we wohl asked again two when the hon alvin w martin got out of the mayoral limousine at the monti funeral home on south broad street in yeadon just outside the city limits he paused long enough on the sidewalk to tell the press that he would have an announcement to make as soon as he had offered his condolences to mrs charlton and the charlton family then he made his way into the funeral home itself where he found the long wide carpeted central corridor of the building about half full of men with police badges on their uniforms or hanging from breast pockets of suits from chains around the necks or on their belts each of the badges had a narrow black mourning bandsliced from the elastic cloth around the bottom of old uniform capsacross it the mayor spotted deputy commissioner coughlin at almost the end of the corridor commissioner mariani had told him that coughlin knew mrs charlton and would escort him into the viewing room where charltons body was laid out wait until the mayor paid his respects at the casket then introduce him to mrs charlton and finally lead him out of the viewing room coughlin was in the center of a group of seven men mayor martin recognized first mr michael j ohara of thebulletin no camera and in a suit what the hell is he doing here and with these peopleand then captain hollaran coughlins executive assistant or whatever the hell his title isand lieutenant jason washington the others he could not remember having metor for that matter even seen before one was in the special uniform of the highway patrol and as martin drew closer he saw the insignia of a captain that made him the highway patrols commanding officerthat little fellow is the head of highway patrol there was another captain a large man with an imposing even somewhat frightening mien jesus id hate to get on the wrong side of himin a standard police captains blue tunic and white shirt uniform the other two menyoung men one in his twenties the other maybe ten years olderin coughlins group didnt look like policemen both were wearing gray singlebutton suits very much like the suit the mayor was himself wearing ill give three to two that they get their clothes in the same place and that place is brooks brothers they look like lawyers ill give even money thats what they are well i would have lost that one he thought as the older of the lawyers turned toward commissioner coughlin probably to tell him he spotted meand in doing so his previously concealed breast pocket came into view there was a blackbanded badge hanging from it martin extended his hand and smiled just a little as he reached coughlin a sad occasion commissioner he said indeed it is coughlin said mr mayor i dont believe you know any of these officers aside from captain hollaran and lieutenant washington im really sorry to say i dont martin said good to see you jason captain good afternoon mr mayor they said almost in unison this is inspector peter wohl of special operations coughlin said and the older lawyer put out his hand how do you do sir captain sabara his deputy coughlin went on and captain pekach of highway patrol when the mayor had shaken their hands coughlin gestured toward the other lawyer and this is detective payne mr mayor is it indeed congratulations on the exam detective payne thank you what im looking at here is the police establishment a politically correct police establishment coughlin and hollaran the irish cops of fame and legend god only knows what the roughlooking one is eastern european maybe wohl sounds german payne looks like a wasp and jason washington representing the afroamericans what did washington say all cops are blue all were missing is a jew as if on cue a large stocky ruddy faced barrelchested man with a full head of curly silver hair a badge with a mourning strip on it hanging from his pocket walked up to the group he was chief inspector of detectives m l lowenstein afternoon he said thank you for coming chief lowenstein the mayor said i really wanted you here when i make the announcement lowenstein nodded at him then put out his hand to detective payne i saw the list matt he said congratulations he knows payne too that young man really gets around thank you have you seen denise coughlin asked lowenstein sarah and i went to the house monday evening lowenstein said and looked at commissioner mariani neither the commissioner nor the mayor had trouble translating the look ive already expressed my condolences so theres no reason for me to be here again except for this political bullshit about a task force anytime youre ready mr mayor coughlin said ill take you in right the mayor said and nodded and followed coughlin into the viewing room it was a large room with an aisle between rows of folding chairs up front the first row of chairs on the right was upholstered mayor martin saw the heads of two children on either side of a grayhaired womanthe widow and their kidsand of several other adults family members probably officer kenneth j charlton was laid out in a gray metal casket in the center of the room as he walked down the aisle behind charlton the mayor could see his face and then enough of the body to see that charlton was to be buried in his uniform coughlin stopped in the aisle next to the first row of chairs and the mayor realized he was expected to approach the casket alone there was a priedieu in front of the casket which made the mayor uncomfortable so far as he was concerned he had learned this from his father the rev dr claude charles martin now pastor emeritus of the second african methodist episcopal churchpriedieux were a roman catholic device or maybe catholicepiscopal device of which he did not approve so what the hell do i do now ignore it as pop would have me do and stand by the casket looking thoughtfully down at the body or use the damn thing and feel and perhaps look hypocritical he dropped to his knees onto the padded priedieu and bent his head and looked at the face of officer charlton you poor bastard goddamn the animals that did this to you the anger took him by surprise lord forgive my anger but what we have here is a good man who put his life on the line to protect other human beings and lost it lord take him into your arms and give him the peace that passes all understanding hes wearing his badge will they take it off or bury him with it probably take it off give it to his family or is there some sort of memorial with the badges of the other cops whove been killed in the line of duty they have their pictures hanging in the lobby of the roundhouse but i cant remember if their badges are there too lord protect this mans wife and children and give them the strength to get through this ordeal make them wise in your ways dear lord and grant them thy peace give the police the wisdom to find the people who did this to this thy servant lord and quickly before they kill someone else lord jesus guide my steps with thy almighty hand in the name of the father the son and the holy spirit amen the mayor took one more look at the face of officer kenneth j charlton and then got somewhat awkwardly off the priedieu then he turned and walked toward the widow and the children mrs charlton stood up then urged the boy and the girl to their feet mrs charlton im alvin martin it was good of you to come mayor and you have my most sincere condolences and my this is kenny jr and this is deborah kenny deborah your father was a brave man who died a hero you can be very proud of him there was no response if there is ever anything i can do for you i want you to call me you understand kenny jr and deborah nodded their heads but didnt look at him the mayor nodded at mrs charlton then turned and walked to the aisle and then down it his press relations officer was waiting for him in the corridor outside the viewing room he led the mayor to another viewing room where the press was waiting for him the press relations officer had arranged mariani and the other police department brass in a line against the wall and he handed the mayor two threebyfive cards on which the essence of the announcement had been printed in large letters the mayor glanced at them quickly then turned to face the press this is a very sad day he began both a citizena single mother of threeand a police officer have lost their lives as a result of a brutal attack that affects not only their grieving survivors but every citizen of philadelphia this sort of outrage cannot be tolerated and it will not be i have ordered the formation of a task force to be commanded by inspector peter wohl of the special operations division three when matt payne driving the unmarked crown victoria came down pennsylvania route and approached the driveway to his parents home in wallingford he looked carefully in the rearview mirror before applying the brake twofiftytwo was lined with large old pine trees on that stretch and the drives leading off it were not readily visible he had more times than he liked to remember come uncomfortably close to being rearended wallingford is a small philadelphia suburb between media through which us known locally as the baltimore pike runs and chester which is on the delaware river it is not large enough to be placed on most road maps although it has its own post office and railroad station it is a residential community housing families whom sociologists would categorize as uppermiddleincome upperincome and wealthy in separate dwellings some very old and some designed to look that way brewster cortland payne ii had raised his family now grown and gone in a large house on four acres on providence road in wallingford it had been in the payne family for more than two centuries what was now the kitchen and the sewing room had been the whole house when it had been built of fieldstone before the revolution additions and modifications over two centuries had turned it into a large rambling structure that fit no specific architectural category although a real estate saleswoman had once remarked in the hearing of mrs patricia mrs brewster c payne that the payne place just looked like old old money the house was comfortable even luxurious but not ostentatious there was neither swimming pool nor tennis court but there was in what a century before had been a stable a fourcar garage the payne family swam as well as rode at the rose tree hunt club they had a summer house in cape may new jersey which did have a tennis court as well as a berth for their boat a fiftyeightfoot hatteras calledfinal tort v matt made it safely into the drive and as he approached the house saw a twoyearold somewhat battered gmc suburban parked with one of its front wheels on the grass beside the parking area by the garage it had been brewster paynes gift to his daughter amelia payne md not because she needed such a large vehicle but in the hope that the trucksizedand truckstrongvehicle would keep her alive amy paynes inability to conduct a motor vehicle over the roads of the commonwealth of pennsylvania without on the average of once a week at least grazing other motor vehicles street signs and on memorable occasion a fire hydrant was almost legendary amy payne was in the kitchen with her mother and mrs elizabeth newman the payne housekeeper when matt walked in they were peeling shrimp amy was a notquitepretty young woman who wore her hair short not for purposes of beauty but because it was easier to care for that way mrs newman was a comfortablelooking grayhaired woman in her fifties patricia payne was older than she looked at first glance she was trim for one thing with a luxuriant head of dark brown almost reddish hair and she had the fair skin of the irish well if it isnt the famous soontobe sergeant matthew payne amy greeted her brother how good of you to find time in your busy schedule for us amy patricia payne protested got another fire hydrant did you sigmund matt said as he walked to the table and kissed his mother you were on television patricia payne said i guess you know that wasnt my idea matt said the mayors press guy grabbed my arm and said you stand there you did look uncomfortable his mother said well i guess congratulations are in order arent they thats what i came out to tell you matt said how did you find out not from you obviously amy said hey i tried to call when i found out matt said didnt i elizabeth yes he did and she told me you and dad were going to be overnight in wilmington matt said and added i even tried to call you sigmund freud i thought that had to be you sophomoric humor im almost afraid to ask patricia payne said he told the receptionist to tell me they were going to repossess my television unless they got paid amy said matt you didnt patricia payne said but her face revealed that she found a certain element of humor in the situation i walked into the office and the receptionist all embarrassed whispered in my ear and said that the finance company had called mrs newman laughed out loud im going to get you for that wiseass amy said i put a bottle of champagne in the refrigerator after denny called patricia payne said go get your father and well open it hes in the living room uncle denny called matt asked were invited to the promotion ceremony patricia said dennys very proud of you we all are you too sigmund matt asked dr payne gave him the finger and that goes for your boss too she said we had dinner monday night and he didnt say a goddamn word all peter knew was that the list was out he didnt know when the promotion would come through except that it wasnt going to be anytime soon thats probably why he didnt tell you she snorted matt walked out of the kitchen down a narrow corridor and through a door into a rather small comfortably furnished room with booklined walls and the chairs arranged to face a large television screen brewster c payne was sitting with his feet up on the matching ottoman of a red leather armchair one of two he was a tall angular dignified man in his early fifties he had a legal brief in his lap and his right hand was wrapped around a glass of whiskey you were on the boob tube he said you looked distressed i was matt said and then went on amys pissed that uncle denny told you before i did for the record i tried to call just as soon as i found out thats not why shes somewhat less than enthusiastic brewster payne said i think she was hoping youd fail the test and leave the police department mothers got champagne in the fridge matt said changing the subject but id rather have a quick one of those payne pointed at a bottle of scotch sitting with a silver water pitcher a silver ice bowl and several glasses matt helped himself and while he was doing so brewster payne rose from his chair when matt raised his glass his father held out his glass and touched matts its what you want matt so im happy for you and proud number one thank you you can stay for supper we bought some shrimp on the road from wilmington sure i made shrimp last night for chad and daffy but what the hell we could thaw a steak shrimps fine daffy was playing matchmaker again id already met her shes from los angeles shes handling i guess is the word stan colt when he comes to town his real name is stanley coleman i saw it in the paper are you involved with that somehow peter sent me to a meeting to see what dignitary protection is going to need to protect super cop monsignor schneiderwho sitteth at the right hand of the bishopwas there i think hes a cop groupie he knew all about doylestown anyway he asked for me by name when super cop aka colt aka coleman comes to town ill be temporarily assigned to dignitary protection terry said hes interested in very young women that ought to make it interesting is that the young womans name terry terry davis two rs and a y she said her fathers a lawyer with movie connections and he got her the job with gam which stands for global artists management i think i know him brewster payne said if its the same fellow he masterfully defends whenever challenged the motion picture industrys amazingly imaginative accounting practices interesting matt said if you happen to bump into him im getting the impression that you are somewhat taken with this young lady and therefore not entirely unhappy with the prospect of protecting what did you call him super cop shes a blonde nice legs matt said and she knows how to peel shrimp what more can one ask for what indeed brewster payne said matt patricia payne said at the door i told you i was going to open a bottle of champagne i needed a little liquid courage to face sigmund freud matt said she turned without replying and after a moment her son and husband followed her into the kitchen the three women were standing around the chopping block in the middle of the kitchen they each held a champagne glass and there were two more on the chopping block and something else wrapped in a handkerchief matt and his father picked up the champagne stems to sergeant payne patricia payne said and they all touched glasses matt took a sip and set it down ive got something for you she said i wanted the family to be together when i gave it to you she picked up the handkerchief and handed it to him even before he unwrapped it matt knew what it was it was a police badge and he knew whose your fathers she said matt looked at the sergeants badge number of the police department of the city of philadelphia when denny called patricia payne went on he said that he could arrange for you to be assigned your fathers number if i wanted i told him i thought you would like that and he asked me if i happened to still have it and i told him id have to look i found it it was in the attic and your fathers offduty gun the snubnosed he looked at his mother but didnt say anything your father was a good man matt his mother said a good police officer i have two fathers matt said his voice breaking my other father is a good man too brewster payne looked at him write this down matt never reply to a heartfelt compliment you never can come up with something worth saying he put his arm around matts shoulder and then embraced him give that to denny before the ceremony tomorrow patricia payne said hell know how to handle it matt nodded and slipped the badge into his pocket under the circumstances brewster payne said picking up his whiskey glass barring objections i think ill have another of these me too matt said first well finish the champagne patricia payne said and then well all have a drink matt had just turned onto i in swarthmore to return to philadelphia when the sband radio in the crown victoria went off stwelve he pulled the microphone from under the center armrest twelve meet the inspector in the block of north second got it en route thank you he said it was entirely possible that a crime had been committed in the block of north second street requiring his professional attention but it was far more likely that he was going to find inspector wohl inside the premises at north second which was known as liberties bar and was the preferred watering hole of the homicide bureau i wonder what thats all about i wonder why he didnt call me on the cell phone tomorrow i will no longer be stwelve there was a somewhat battered threeyearold crown victoria parked on second street in front of liberties bar and a last years crown victoria three brandnew crown victorias and a buick rendezvous when matt walked into liberties the drivers of these vehicles were sitting around two tables pushed together along the wall across from the ornately carved centuryold bar they were deputy commissioner coughlin chief inspector lowenstein inspector wohl lieutenant washington detective harris and michael j ohara esq there was a bottle of old bushmills irish whiskey a bottle of chivas regal a bottle of jack daniels and two bowls one with cashews the other with stick pretzels on the table whats going on matt asked slipping into a chair at the table beside harris i am interrogating a witness to the roy rogers job harris said nodding at ohara and getting nothing out of him jesus tony mickey said the bastards took a shot at me matt poured scotch into a glass it would behoove you to go easy on that tonight detective payne wohl said which is the reason we put the arm out for you we didnt want you to go off somewhere and get smashed by yourself yes sir matt said and picked up the drink and took a sip then he took his fathers badge from his apartment and slipped it to denny coughlin mom found that and said to give it to you he said coughlin looked at the badge then laid it on the table whats that lowenstein asked jack moffitts sergeants badge coughlin replied i remember the day he got it he looked at matt and said i dont want to hand this to your mother a second time you understand me matts mouth ran away with him color me careful watch your lip matty coughlin said that would make a good yarn mickey ohara said new sergeant gets hero fathers badge which you wont write right lowenstein said okay mickey said shrugging his shoulders and reaching for the bottle of old bushmills i loved jack like a brother coughlin said and he had a lot of balls but he wasnt a hero his big balls got him killed he answered a silent alarm without backup i remember lowenstein said i had north detectives when it happened jack knew better coughlin said he could still be walking around if hed done what he was trainedorderedto do dennis how would you judge dutch moffitts behavior jason washingtons sonorous voice asked coughlin looked at him obviously annoyed at the question was that an excess of male egoim dutch moffitt of highway patrol i can handle this punk by myself washington pursued or a professional assessment of the situation in which he found himself with the same result coughlin looked at him for a long moment before deciding if and what to answer dutch said lay the gun on the counter son i dont want to have to kill you im a police officer was that the right thing to do i think so i would like to think thats what i would have done i would also like to think i would have looked around for a second doer dutch didnt and the junkie girlfriend shot him i worked with dutch peter wohl said i cant believe he didnt look for a second doer he had trouble keeping his pecker in his pocket but he was a very good street cop your mother never told you dont speak ill of the dead peter coughlin said especially in front of the deceaseds nephew wohl shrugged unrepentant coughlin had another thought your grandmothers going to be in the mayors office tomorrow matty i thought she had a right to be oh shit matt blurted coughlin glared angrily at him i was going to tell her later matt said somewhat lamely maybe even go by shes your grandmother matt coughlin said on the edge of anger i dont like the way she treats my mother matt said dont tell me shes still pissed that jacks widow married payne lowenstein asked its a religious thing matt coughlin said patricia raised matt as an episcopal after payne adopted him you christians do have your problems dont you lowenstein asked how many angelscan fit on the head of a pin coughlin gave him the finger i dont agree with her matty coughlin said you know that but shes still your grandmother does my mother know shes coming if your mother knew she would being the lady she is not go jesus before you two continue with what is sure to be an indeterminable discussion of mother moffitt washington interrupted may i finish with my profound observation matt realizedwondering why it had taken him so longthat while no one at the table was drunk it was also obvious that no one was on their firstor thirddrink either he looked at the bottles the chivas regal was half empty the jack daniels and the old bushmills were almost dry and washington had even called coughlin by his first name what the hell is this all about why are all these people sitting around here getting smashed how could we stop you mickey ohara asked washington continued with the given that sergeant jack moffitt was a good street cop that captain dutch moffitt was a good street cop and that officer charlton had survived almost to retirement as a street cop what mistakeindeed whatfatal mistakedid all three of them make they werent as good as they thought they were mickey asked close michael washington said oh shit not that they didnt turn over the rock under the rock crap again tony harris said yes indeed washington said that turn over the rock under the rock crap again if sergeant moffitt had looked around the gas station one more time if dutch had looked around the waikiki diner one more time if charlton had taken one more look i dont think thats such a profound observation jason coughlin said more like selfevident lowenstein said i was trying to make the point for matts edification washington said coughlin looked at him then at matt hes right matty he said pay attention yes sir matt said would you like to see how your names will appear in tomorrowsbulletin mickey asked or shall we go back to discussing mother moffitt he took several sheets of paper from his inside jacket pocket and swung them back and forth curiosity underwhelms me wohl said and held his hand out for the sheets of paper slugmayor forms double murder task force jack dont bury this with the underwear ads these slimeballs need catching and use the pictures by michael j ohara bulletin staff writer photos by jack weinberg bulletin photographer philadelphiamayor alvin w martin surrounded by the heavy hitters of the philadelphia police department and standing not far from where the body of officer kenneth charlton lay in state in the monti funeral home in the block of south broad street this afternoon announced the formation of a special police task force to bring the two men who murdered charlton and mrs maria m fernandez during the robbery sunday evening of the roy rogers restaurant on south broad street both a citizena single mother of threeand a police officer have lost their lives as a result of a brutal attack that affects not only their grieving survivors but every citizen of philadelphia the mayor said adding this sort of outrage cannot be tolerated and it will not be photo lr lowenstein mariani martin coughlin flanked by police commissioner ralph j mariani deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin and chief inspector of detectives matthew lowenstein martin announced that inspector peter f wohl the highly regarded commanding officer of the special operations division would head the task force photo lr washington wohl and harris speaking to this reporter later inspector wohl said it was not his intention to take over the investigation from lieutenant jason washington who is beyond question the most skilled homicide investigator i know of but rather to ensure that lieutenant washington and his able team leader detective anthony harris get whatever assistance they need from not only special operations but the entire police department so these criminals can be quickly removed from our streets photo lr sabara wohl pekach sgt m m payne and capt f x hollaran wohls deputy captain michael j sabara and captain david r pekach commanding officer of the elite highway patrol nodded their agreement with both wohls cold determination and with his explanation of the difficulty sometimes encounteredas nowin identifying the perpetrators of a crime the patrons of the roy rogers restaurant were terrorized by the cold brutality of these criminals shots were fired two people were killed and everyone elses life was in danger its regrettable but i think very understandable that the horrified witnesses cant really agree on a description of the men we seek this is not to say that we wont apprehend them and soon but that it will take a bit longer than we like wohl went on to say that its only in the movies that a fingerprint lifted from the scene of a crime can be quickly matched with that of a criminal whose identity is unknown there are hundreds of thousands of fingerprints in our files millions in those of the fbi and the prints we have in our possession will have to be matched to them one at a time until we get a match wohl went on to explain that once the people sought are in custody their fingerprints can be used to prove they were at the scene of the crime but until that happens fingerprints wont be of immediate use to us and once we have these people in custody and can place them in a police lineup there is no question in my mindexperience showsthat the witnesses to their crime will be able to positively identify them this crime will not go unpunished wohl said that police are already running down a number of leads but declined to elaborate end wohl slid the two sheets of paper across the table to coughlin lowenstein leaned over so that he could read it too magnificent story mickey wohl said theres just one little thing wrong with it all those quotes from me are pure bullshit is the black buddha the most skilled homicide investigator you know of or not ohara challenged of course i am washington said let me see that when youre finished dennis please he is but i didnt tell you that wohl said but if i had asked you would have said so right and im right about the fingerprints right but i didnt even talk to you at the goddamn funeral home but if you had you would have said what i said you said more or less right thisll be in the paper tomorrow mick lowenstein asked it will and i wouldnt be at all surprised if it was on page one pity you couldnt have put in there that we had a latenight conference lowenstein said martin would have loved that i didnt know about the latenight conference until i walked in here ohara said when i heard on the command band that everybody was headed to the block of north second i thought there was a war on here commissioner coughlin and myself were conferring privately with inspector wohl lowenstein said when these underlings coincidentally felt the need for a latenight cup of coffee at this fine establishment there were chuckles nice story mickey coughlin said presuming the conference is over wohl said as he got to his feet i am going home he looked at matt and so are you coughlin stood up are we square with the tab here ill get the tab mickey ohara said my pleasure brighteyed and bushytailed and at the mayors office at quarter to nine matty coughlin ordered and i expect you to be nice to your grandmother i have as always jason washington said getting to his feet thoroughly enjoyed the company of my colleagues and i am sure you have all profited greatly from the experience detective harris shook his head then chuckled then giggled and then laughed that proved contagious and each of them was smiling or chuckling or laughing as they filed out the door onto north second street six one the hon alvin w martin looked up from his desk when his executive assistant dianna kerrgally a tall thin stylish thirtyish black woman slipped into his officethin its ten past nine mr mayor is everybody in the conference room just about but commissioner mariani has someone he wants you to meet she nodded toward the outer office sure send him in the mayor replied with an enthusiasm he really didnt feel he had things to do and the less time spent on the promotion ceremony the better it wasnt only commissioner mariani he had with him deputy commissioner coughlin and a tall lean sternfaced grayhaired woman in a simple black dress and the young detective who had scored number one good morning mr mayor mariani said good morning ralph the mayor smiled at the woman who returned it with a barely perceptible curling of her lips she looks like that farmers wife in the grant wood painting whats that on her dress miniature police badges three of them mr mayor coughlin said i thought before the program begins that youd like to meet mrs gertrude moffitt im delighted how do you do mrs moffitt she nodded her lips curled slightly again but she didnt say anything mrs moffitt is the widow of a police officer and two of her sons died in the line of duty as police officers coughlin said well that explains the three badges sergeant john x moffitt and captain richard c moffitt coughlin went on thats a proud tradition mrs moffitt the mayor said im honored to meet you she nodded again and she is detective paynes grandmother coughlin finished the tradition continues then the mayor said this must be a proud moment for you if my grandson still carried his fathers name it would be she said what the hell does that mean detective payne looked pained whatever the hell it is im not going to get into it here and now since you know full well mrs moffitt that police work never ceases im sure youll forgive me if i ask the commissioner if there have been any developments in the roy rogers case im afraid not mr mayor damn the press will be in the conference room it would have been a perfect place and time to announce the cops have finally bagged those animals but commissioner coughlin tells me there was a meeting last night of all the principals of the task force plus chief of detectives lowenstein really well i hope something good will come from it i feel sure that it will mr mayor coughlin said we all feel there will be developments in the very near future i hope youre right commissioner the mayor said mrs moffitt when we go into the conference roomhe looked at his watchand were going to have to do that right now i think it would be very appropriate if you were to pin his new badge on your grandson and a picture like that will certainly make the evening news all right she said here it is mother moffitt coughlin said thats jacks badge thats jacks badge she asked looking at the badge coughlin was holding out to her yes it is you told me dennis coughlin that it had been buried with him i was wrong coughlin said and where was it all these years she had it didnt she patricias jacks widow mother moffitt she snatched the badge out of his hand well at least she wont have it now mother moffitt said if you will all go into the conference room now dianna kerrgally asked gesturing at a door we can get the ceremony under way when the mayor tried to follow the procession into the conference room dianna kerrgally held up her arm palm extended to stop him he stopped dianna kerrgally using her fingers and mouthing the numbers counted downward from ten then signaled the mayor to go into the conference room he walked briskly to the head of the table where a small lectern had been placed he looked around the room smiling attempting to lock eyes momentarily with everyone there were five promotees all of whom looked older than detective payne and all but payne were in uniform two of the promotees were grayhaired all the promotees were accompanied by family andor friends dianna kerrgally had put out the word no more than four per promotee and apparently that had been widely ignored the large room was crowded just about full there were three video cameras at the rear of the room and at least half a dozen still photographers one of them was michael j ohara of thebulletin ill have to remember to thank him for that frontpage story about the task force jesus is that who i think it is it damn sure is brewster c payne in the flesh the last time i saw him was on monday in washington in the senate dining room he was the something really important has come up reason our distinguished senior senator was sorry he couldnt have lunch with me whats his connection with detective payne when dianna kerrgally came to the lectern to hand him the threebyfive cards from which he would speak he motioned her close to him and whispered the tall wasp in the back of the room she looked and nodded his name is brewster payne she whispered back i know who he is ask him if he can spare me a minute when this is over she nodded if i may have your attention ladies and gentlemen the mayor began raising his voice so that it could be heard over the hubbub in the room the next time we do something like this there should be a microphone i realize youre a busy man mr payne the mayor said as dianna kerrgally ushered brewster payne into his office but i did want to say hello i dont think weve ever actually met have we i dont believe we have but didnt i see you in washington on monday across the dining room the mayor said waving him into a chair i need a cup of coffee do you have the time thank you very much payne said id love one dianna please right away mr mayor would it be impolitic for me to ask what you and the senator seemed to be talking so intently about my firm represents nesfoods payne said the senator chairs the agricultural subcommittee we were talking about tomatoes united states and mexican nesfoods gave me one hundred thousand for my campaign i wonder how much they gave to the senator the tomato growers here are concerned about cheap mexican tomatoes that issue has been resolved by the free trade agreement what i hoped to dowhat i think i didwas convince the senator that its in everybodys best interests for the department of agriculture to station inspectors in nesfoods processing plants in mexico so that we can process the tomatoes there and ship the pulp in tank trucks to the nesfoods plants here and in california that will both save nesfoods a good deal of money and actually increase the quality of the finished product apparently the riper the tomato when processed the better the pulp and what was the problem as hard as it is to believe there are those who are unhappy with the free trade agreement payne said dryly and object to stationing agriculture department inspectors on foreign soil but after you had your little chat the senator seemed to see the light i hope so mr mayor dianna kerrgally came into the office with a silver coffee service and poured coffee when she had left them alone again the mayor looked over his coffee cup and said i wasnt aware until this morning that your son was a policeman i think of it as the firms loss is the citys gain payne said actually matts my adopted son his fathera police sergeantwas killed before he was born i adopted matt before he could walk youd rather he would have joined mawson payne stockton mcadoo and lester the mayor asked wouldnt your father prefer to see you in a pulpit payne responded whenever i see him he shakes his head sadly the mayor said i dont think hes given up hope that i will see the error of my ways neither have i given up hope payne said but in the meantime i am as proud of matt as i daresay your father is of you i like to think public service is an honorable even noble calling so does matt payne said he thinks of the police as a thin blue line all that separates society from the barbarians unfortunately hes probably right the mayor said payne set his cup down i dont want to keep you mr payne the mayor said but i did want to say hello could we have lunch one day id be delighted payne said and thank you for the coffee he stood up shook hands with the mayor and walked out of the room commissioner mariani told me that if i didnt send that young man to homicide as promised i could expect trouble from the fraternal order of police he didnt tell me that the fop would be represented pro bono by mawson payne stockton mcadoo amp lester two the hon eileen mcnamara solomon philadelphias district attorney devoutly believed that at least seventy percent of the nurses under fifty in the surgical department of the hospital of the university of pennsylvania would rush to console benjamin a solomon md the moment he started to feel sorry for himself because his wifetheda had become careless about her appearance so although she was always too busy to waste a lot of time in a beauty parlor she made it to cathleens coiffeurs every tuesday at am watched what she ate and weather permitting jogged on the parkway for an hour starting at am monday wednesday and friday the result was a rather tall lithe fortynineyearold who wore her blonde hair cut stylishly but short and whose husband had no reason to see if the grass was greener in someone elses bedroom after graduationthird in her classfrom the university of pennsylvania school of law and passing the bar examination eileen mcnamara had declined offers to join any of the several more or less prestigious law firms because she suspected she was going to become the token female instead she took a job with the public defenders office which had the responsibility of providing legal counsel to the indigent she had quickly proven herself to be a highly competent courtroom lawyer but she had always been a little uncomfortable after she had convinced a jury that there was reasonable doubt that some miserable sonofabitch had actually pistolwhipped a grandmother while in the process of robbing her corner grocery or some other miserable sonofabitch had actually been pushing drugs on grammar school kids and she had been unhappy in the company of her colleagues who almost universally believed that having been born into poverty or to a drugaddict mother or of afroamerican puerto ricanlatinouter mongolianwhatever parentage was an excuse to commit robbery rape and murder and to meanwhile support oneself in outrageous luxury by selling what were known as prohibited substances to others so she had changed sides philadelphias district attorney was delighted to offer miss eileen mcnamara a position as an assistant district attorney not only because she was a goodlooking blonde but also because her record of successfully defending people his assistant das had prosecuted unsuccessfully had made them look even more incompetent than they actually were she had been somewhat happier in the das office but not much the cases she would have liked to prosecute seemed to get assigned to the more experienced of her fellow assistant das and the cases she was assigned to prosecute wereshe quickly figured outthe ones her fellow assistant das didnt want because the cases were either weak or politically dangerous or both but she did her best with the cases she was given and managed to convince one jury after another that not only was there not any reasonable doubt that some miserable sonofabitch had done what the cops had said he or she had done but that he or she had done it with full knowledge of what he or she was doing and in the belief he or she was going to get away with it and therefore did not deserve much pity from the criminal justice system assistant district attorney mcnamara quickly discovered as something of a surprisethat as a general rule of thumb she liked the cops by and large they were really what they considered themselves to be a thin blue line protecting society from the barbarians what surprised her in this regard was that they seemed to genuinely share her concern for what she thought of as the other group of innocent victims of a criminal act the first group was of course those who had been robbedbeaten murdered by the criminal the second group was the wives parentschildren of the miserable sonofabitch who had committed the crime eileen mcnamara had been an assistant district attorney almost three years when she first ran into benjamin solomon md facs more accurately when ben ran into her rearending her plymouth with his cadillac as she was looking for a parking place in south philadelphia ben hadnt been going very fast just not paying attention but fast enough to do considerable damage to her trunk and right fender the accident had taken place within if not the sight then the hearing of officer martin shaugnessy officer shaugnessy had trotted to the scene he pretended not to recognize the goodlooking blonde assistant da who had once made mincemeat out of the public defender who had decided that the best way to get his client off the hook was to paint arresting officer shaugnessy as an ignorant prejudiced police thug who took an almost sexual pleasure in persecuting young men of puerto rican extraction how much have you had to drink sir was his first question now to dr solomon who had just given miss mcnamara his effusive apologies and insurance card drink its eightthirty in the morning i havent even had my breakfast people who speed and drive as recklessly as you obviously were sir are often driving under the influence would you please extend your right arm close your eyes and try to touch your nose officer i dont think the doctor has been drinking miss mcnamara said i think this was just a simple fender bender you sure officer shaugnessy asked dubiously im sure miss mcnamara said and im sure the doctor and i can work this out between us well if you say so maam thank you miss mcnamara said yes maam officer shaugnessy said he filled out the form which the insurance companies would need and then went back to walking his beat while they were waiting for the wrecker eileen became aware that the doctor kept stealing looks at her for some reason it didnt make her uncomfortable usually when men did that it did as the wrecker hauled her plymouth away dr solomon looked directly at her his eyes on hers did make her uncomfortable what was that with the cop all about dr solomon asked you know him i know a lot of cops eileen said that one looked familiar but do i know him no how is it you know a lot of cops im an assistant da really an assistant da ben had asked genuinely surprised goodlooking blondes dont come to mind when i hear that term on the other hand you do look like a doctor eileen heard herself say adding quickly what kind chestcutter ben had said thoracic surgeon what do you mean i look like a doctor your eyes eileen said you have intelligent kind eyes when she heard what she had said she blushed so do you ben had said softly after a minute can i buy you breakfast breakfast and lunch and dinner and whatever else you want to eat for the rest of your life youre sure you havent been drinking i dont drink he said if i sound a little strange i was at the table all nightuntil about an hour ago and then i met you benjamin solomon md and eileen mcnamara lld were united in matrimony not quite a month later which caused varying degrees of joy and despair within their respective eastern european hebraic and irish roman catholic communities they had been married three years when eileen told ben the strangest thing had happened the previous afternoon she had been asked if she would be interested in running for judge in a special election called by the governor to fill two vacancies caused by the incarceration of two incumbent jurists i think you should ben had said after a moment youve been on both sides of the fence and i think youd do a good job straddling the middle and you already have the name judge solomon the second she won the election handily primarily she believed because nobody had ever heard of her and there was general contempt for those whose names were known to the voters and she liked the bench at least trying to keep things fair and just they hadnt been able to have childrenbens fault the gynecologists said probably because hed worn jockey shorts all of his lifeand she really regretted that but she told herself that a child whose parents both had independent careers could not have gotten the attention it deserved and that made being childless a little easier to bear she had been on the bench six years when a delegation of pols came to her and proposed that she run for district attorney the incumbent had been elected to congress her service as an assistant da and her six years on the bench had taught her that there was considerable room for improvement in the office of the district attorney she talked the offer over with ben she was sure that she would make a hell of a good da but she hadnt been at all sure that she could win and if she lost she would be out of a job she couldnt run for reelection to the bench and for da at the same time ben said she should give it a shot she would always regret it later if she didnt and ben said it wasnt as if they were going to have to sell the dog to make the car payments if she found herself unemployed that was a reference to the fact that bens scalpel earned more than ten times as much money for them as the government paid her to wield her gavel she ran and won with fiftytwo percent of the vote the first time she ran for reelection she got fiftyeight percent and the last time shed garnered sixtyseven percent of the vote eileen mcnamara solomon had two cellular telephones which when she was there she placed in rechargers on her desk beside the office phone with all its buttons one of the cellulars which buzzed when called was her official phone she made herself available with it aroundtheclock the second nokia cellular had a green face and when it was called it played when irish eyes are smiling this was her private line its number known to very few people it had been a gift from ben who said that believe it or not he had a busy schedule too and didnt like to be put on hold when the green phone began to play when irish eyes are smiling she thought it was probably ben and wondered if he was about to ask her to lunch hi she said to the telephone you busy eileen a female voice inquired she knew the voice never too busy for you martha how are you eileen mcnamara and martha peebles had met in art appreciation at the university of pennsylvania and the tall then sort of skinny eighteenyearold irish girl and the seventeenyearold slight short wasp with an acne condition had been immediately comfortable with each other eileen had told martha all about her family then taken her home to meet king kongher brotherand her father both bricklaying subcontractors and her mother martha had been visibly reluctant to talk about her family except to say that her mother had died and she lived with her father and brother who was a wouldbe actor martha had not offered to take eileen home with her and eileen wondered if she was maybe ashamed of her father or her home and went out of her way to make sure martha understood she didnt care if her father had problems or what her house looked like or how much money there was it was four months before martha finally took eileen home on a saturday and eileen got to meet the brother stephen who was light on his feet and her father alexander martha had shown her around the house and property which had taken a little time as there were twentyeight rooms in the turnofthecentury mansion set on fourteen acres behind stone walls on glengarry lane in chestnut hill plus a guest house a hothouse and stables for alexander peebless polo ponies i never saw anything like this eileen had confessed as they left the stables not even in the movies martha had looked at her i really dont want this to change things between us martha said youre the best friend i ever had eileen had never forgotten the frightened look in marthas eyes dont be silly and dont tell anybody else please why should i eileen had never had a best friend in high school and neither martha said had she they became and remained best friends and stayed best friends martha was the first person eileen had told about ben right after he rearended her and martha had been her only bridesmaid when she married ben and eileen really worried about martha particularly after her father died cutting the queer brother out of his will and leaving everything to martha everything included the tamaqua mining corporation which owned among other things somewhere between ten and twelve percent of the known anthracite coal reserves in the united states there had been no man there never had been one in marthas life seriously there were several reasons for this eileen thought the primary reason being that martha aware that she was no great beauty suspected that what few suitors she had had were primarily interested in her money followed closely by marthas comparison of her young men with her father and finding that none of them came close to matching up eileen really thought that maybe her best friend was losing it when she began to complain that her house was being burgled on a more or less regular basis and that the police werent paying attention eileen called denny coughlin and told him she would appreciate it if he would lean on the commanding officer of the fourteenth district and get him to send enough uniforms around to glengarry lane often enough to convince the inhabitant that her property and person were being adequately protected denny coughlin had called her back within the hour to tell her she could put her mind at rest about miss peebles hed called the fourteenth district commander as shed asked him to do and captain jessup had told him he was a little late it seems miss peebless lawyer brewster payne had talked with his partner colonel mawson whod telephoned police commissioner czernich about miss peebless problem the commissioner had called jessup and told him not to worry about miss peebles anymore he had given the problem to special operations and highway patrol would now be rolling by glengarry on a regularat least hourlybasis special operations had been told the commissioner didnt want to hear of any more problems at glengarry lane the next morning just after judge solomon had walked into her chambers at nine martha peebles had called eileen it happened what happened my knight in shining armor he finally came martha are you all right his name is david pekach and hes the captain commanding highway patrol and we did it eileen martha reported that captain pekach had called to inform her that her property would now be patrolled by highway patrol on a regular frequent basis and that she could put her mind at rest my god eileen hes so much like daddy all man you just feel safe when youre with him what do you mean you did it martha you know what i mean martha said not even very shyly youre not telling me this cop just walked in the door and you took him to bed no of course not not then what happened was that he said he would swing by at midnight himself and i said i never went to bed that early and if he had the timedidnt have to get home to his wifewhy didnt he stop in and id give him a cup of coffee and he said he wasnt married and thank you hed like a cup of coffee and he came back at midnight and thats when we did it i think youre out of your mind i know im out of my mind with love his first name is david and i thought it was going to hurt the first time and it didnt god eileen it was wonderful denny tell me about captain david pekach of highway patrol was the call that came next what would you like to know eileen and why the whys my business tell me about him what about him hes a good cop is he married no hes never been married before he made captain and they gave him highway patrol he was a lieutenant in narcotics he grew a pigtail and the dealers thought he was one of them hes got one hell of an arrest record thats all when he was a rookie detective in homicide just a kid when the rest of the department didnt think the sainted fort festung could possibly do anything like hurt his girlfriend dave pekach finally got a judge to give him a search warrant i know who he is eileen interrupted remembering him from the trial like i said eileen hes a very good cop tell me about him and women i understand hes quite a swordsman who told you that coughlin asked eileen youve seen him hes a little guy looks like a weasel women do the opposite of swoon when they see him ive never even seen him with a woman whats this all about thanks denny brewster courtland payne esq gave miss martha peebles in marriage to captain david pekach three weeks later the hon eileen mcnamara solomon was the matron of honor eileen i realize this is short notice but id really like you and ben to come for supper tonight martha peebles pekach said now whats up brewster paynes sonmattjust made sergeant and precious and i are having a little party for him that kid made sergeant eileen asked surprised very privately she thought of detective matt payne as the wyatt earpor maybe the stan coltof the main line most cops never draw their weapons in twenty years of service brewster paynes kid had already shot two critters and been involved in an ok corral shootout in bucks county and he hadnt been on the job much over five years and now hes a sergeant he was number one on the list the mayor promoted him this morning ill have to check with ben eileen said with or without him eileen please sixish three lieutenant jason washington who was sitting in his glasswalled office his feet resting on the open lower drawer of his desk deep in thought became aware that detective kenneth j summers a portly fortyyearold who was on the desk was waving at him he raised his eyebrows to suggest that summers now had his attention summers pointed to the telephone washington nodded and reached for it homicide lieutenant washington dave pekach jason dare i to hope that you are calling to tell me two critters have flagged down a highway car and overwhelmed by remorse are asking how they can go about confessing to the roy rogers job you dont have them yet pekach asked surprised you know where we are david washington said in the absence of a better idea i have four people running down a somewhat esoteric idea proposed by the newest member of our happy little family matt indeedsergeant matthew payne he wonderedcausing tony harris some chagrinsand between thee and me me toofor not having had the same thought firstwhy doer number one took the trouble to put his weapon under kenny charltons bulletproof vest instead of simply shooting him in the head yeah i wonder why there may be no reason but for the moment we are considering the possibility that he knew kenny felt some personal animosity toward him and wanted to make sure the wound was fatal thats possible that sounds like a deliberate act not like something that just happened so we are now compiling a photo album of every young africanamerican critter kenny ever arrested and since kenny spent many years on the street there is a large number of such critters it may work jason pekach said thoughtfully and i have tony starting all over again from step one washington said actually i was calling about matt pekach said my martha wants to wash down his sergeants badge somehow i dont think your martha used that phrase shes having a few people in is the way she put it you and your martha of course and tony and my martha asked me to ask you if it would be a good idea to ask the other guys in homicide what and where are the festivities tonight here six sixthirty if it stays nice outside like the last one which come to think of it lieutenant was to wash down your new badge i was about to say david that tonight is not the best of times but then i remembered the profound philosophical observation that all work et cetera et cetera tony will be there ill see to that and so will my martha and i and i will put a card on the bulletin board advising everyone that edibles and intoxicants will be available at glengarry lane for anyone interested in celebrating sergeant paynes promotion you think anyone will come edibles and intoxicants may entice one or two and simple curiosity about castle pekach will entice some of the others i dont want to make it a command performance is henry going to grace the premises captain henry c quaire was commanding officer of the homicide unit my martha called whatshername gladys washington furnished gladys and henry will be there pekach said why am i not surprised washington said gladys quaire regarded an invitation to glengarry lane as the philadelphia equivalent of an invitation to watch the races at ascot from the royal enclosure pekach chuckled then said goodbye four when dr and mrs benjamin solomon drove through the gate at glengarry lane the macadam road to the house was lined with various models of ford crown victoria automobiles they were in bens cadillac as eileen was wearing what she thought of as her doctors wife hat but she could not leave her das hat very far behind in the new ford crown victoria that followed the cadillac into what was still known as the peebles estate detective albert unger of the district attorneys squad pushed his microphone button as he rolled past the gate radio done go done at glengarry lane in chestnut hill until further notice got it philadelphia provides an unmarked detectivedriven police car to its district attorney the detective of course also serves as bodyguard to the da usually this made sense and it was nice to be picked up at the house and dropped off by a car but sometimesnow for exampleit didnt there were going to be at least thirtyknowing martha probably morepolice officers at glengarry lane all of them armed and many senior enough to be accompanied by their own armed drivers the person of the district attorney was going to be about as safe as it could be and if something happened that required the immediate presence of the district attorney any of the white shirts unmarked cars would be available to take her there with siren howling but because he went where she went poor al unger would just have to hang around the car waiting for the radio to go off while the da was at the party he wouldnt be alone deputy commissioner coughlins driver and the drivers of the other senior white shirts would also have to hang around waiting for their radios to go off martha peebles pekach would ensure of course that the caterers waiters would make sure they were fed eileen was not surprisedthe weather was wonderful that the party was being held outside the stables alexander peebless polo ponies were long gone and the grass field where they had once played was ideal for an outside party tables had been set up and waiters moved among them serving drinks and steaks and italian sausage from charcoal stoves their hostess and her husband greeted them as they walked on the field sorry to be late ben had to work eileen said hugging martha peebles youre here thats all that matters martha peebles said she kissed dr solomon i put you with the paynes martha went on gesturing toward one of the tables guess who i got a postcard from captain pekach said when you get a minute ive got something to tell you about that eileen said in a couple of minutes pekach said eileen saw ben smiling and she saw why amelia a payne md was sitting with her parents ben not only would have someone to talk tohe really had little in common with the cops or for that matter with brewster c payneand he and amy payne both liked each other and shared a disdain for some of their fellow healers at the university of pennsylvania medical school and many of ups bureaucratic procedures about which they couldand almost certainly wouldtalk at length deputy commissioner coughlin and brewster c payne got to their feet as the solomons approached the table the men wordlessly shook hands eileen sat down beside patricia payne and ben sat down across the table beside amy wheres the birthday boy eileen askedand before patricia could answer dealt with the waiter irish rocks for me diet coke over there she pointed at her husband then added make it a double ive been a good girl all day one for me too please patricia payne said not a double where issergeant payne eileen asked amelia a payne snorted i guess youre thrilled huh eileen asked not really amy said truth to tell matt went into the house for something hell be back patricia said is it safe to say youre thrilled eileen asked patricia mixed emotions patricia replied proud sure happy for matt sure but the badge the mayor pinned on him was his fathers ouch eileen said they kept it all these years i had it i thought it was the right it was eileen said firmly mother moffitt showed up at the ceremony amy said to cast her usual pall on things amy patricia payne said dave got another postcard from our fugitive coughlin said obviously to get off the subject of mother moffitt he told me eileen said there was something today ill tell you later when i tell dave am i permitted to ask our fugitive brewster payne said isaac fort festung eileen said oh that chap that despicable sonofabitch coughlin said and added immediately forgive the french a waiter handed the district attorney a drink she waited until patricia payne had hers then touched glasses and took a healthy sip to sergeant payne she said thank you patricia payne said denny despicable sonofabitch is an apt description of fort festung so an apology for your language is not necessary eileen said but if youre asking for a general pardon for our french brothersim not about to forgive them there were chuckles and smiles shes even stopped buying french perfume dr solomon said see if you can enlist patricia in your cause eileen brewster payne said what they should have done when he showed up in francehe entered france illegally by the way and was using a phony name also illegalwas deport him on the next plane didnt that have something to do with the death penalty patricia asked that was their first excuse but when that didnt wash we didnt have the death penalty at the time of his trial there was no way i could have sentenced him to death as much as i might have liked tothey said they wouldnt let us extradite because hed been triedin absentia i thought the legislature took care of that and guaranteed him a new trial if he asked for one brewster c payne said they did and we so informed the french now theyre giving us some nonsense about the statute of limitations eileen said were appealing that we expect a decision on that tomorrow and if it goes our way were back to step one in other words we start asking all over again for his extradition she stopped suddenly becoming aware that two men were seeking her attention and theres dave pekach waiting for me to tell him what i just told you she said nodding at pekach who was standing at the edge of the field excuse me she got to her feet and turned to a waiter medium rare she ordered one piece of italian sausage a sliced tomato no potatoes ill be back in five minutes or less she pointed at her husband that handsome gentleman will have the same she stood up and walked to pekach and followed him into the stable they walked almost to the end of it did i interrupt something important pekach asked you and denny coughlin looked pretty serious we were talking about saint isaac eileen said what did the new postcard say the usual having fine time wish you were here best regards isaac the arrogant sonofabitch the district attorney said and then went on i had a calltony casio didfrom the state department today i have the feeling im about to hear something i shouldnt matt payne said coming into the passageway from inside one of the stalls what the hell were you doing in there pekach asked curiously im gone matt said sorry stay eileen said theres no reason you shouldnt hear this maybe you should what were you doing in there pekach pursued matt looked between them and decided that when you dont know what the hell to say tell the truth you remember the scene inthe godfather the wedding where everybody handed the bride an envelope as a tribute to the godfather not because they gave a damn about the bride yeah pekach said so i felt like the bride matt said out of respect to you and martha andor my parents andor denny coughlin everybody was coming to the table and saying congratulations sergeant and then amy would snort so i came to hide in here you should have waited until ben and i finally got here eileen said our congratulations would have been absolutely sincere he looked at her for a moment thank you he said and then added like i said i wasnt trying to eavesdrop and im gone youre not interested in fort festung eileen asked im becoming fascinated okay stay latest bulletin eileen said tony casio hes eileens fugitive guy pekach explained had a call from the state department this afternoon the french are going to rule on the statute of limitations tomorrow and their legal counsel read fbi guy heard that itll go our way which leaves us where we start the extradition business all over again if the decision comes down tomorrow in our favor we start the extradition process again tomorrow and this time pekach asked the french can stall only so long david eileen said well get him pekach looked at her a long moment but didnt say anything okay birthday boy eileen said back to the table and smile nice when somebody says congratulations yes maam matt said five at just about the time the last of the unmarked ford crown victorias was leaving the peebles estatesomewhere around amhomer c daniels a sixfeetoneinch pound thirtysixyearold caucasian male who had once been a paratrooper and still wore his light brown hair clipped close to his skull was standing in the shadow of a tree in the block of independence street in northeast philadelphia in the area known as east oak lane he was looking up at the secondstory windows on the right side of what had been built as a singlefamily home not quite large enough to be called a mansionnot quite a century before it had been empty for a while after world war ii and then had been converted to a multifamily dwelling with two apartments on the ground floor two on the second and a third in what had been the servants quarters on the third daniels who was wearing a black coverall thought of himself as a businessman rather than a truck driver although in each of the past several years he had driven a peterbilt eighteenwheel tractortrailer rig miles all over the country for one thing he was a partner in las vegas classic motor cars inc the company that owned the peterbilt and he almost always had the same partners interest in the trucks cargo and sometimes he owned all of the cargo las vegas classic motor cars inc as the name implied dealt with what they referred to as the grand marques of automobiles ranging from the vintagesuch as duesenbergs and piercearrows no longer manufacturedto the contemporarysuch as ferrari the larger mercedesbenz and rolls royce as a general rule of thumb if an automobile was worth less than las vegas classic motor cars inc was not interested a boattailed dusey in grand concourse condition and worth say had the opposite effect they bought and sold some cars themselves and accepted some cars on consignment often they would buy a decent classic and spend up to rebuilding it from the frame up to grand concourse condition before offering it for sale they also provided frame up restoration for owners of classic cars and had earned an international reputation for the quality of their work cars of this sort were genuine works of art and as one would not entrust a rodin sculpture or an andy warhol painting of a tomato can to the acme trucking company or even the united parcel service one could not move for example a grand concoursecondition mercedesbenz sl gull wing coupe worth to or from las vegas without taking the appropriate precautions dragging such a motorcar along behind a car or truck on one of the clever devices available from uhaul was obviously out of the question so was loading such a vehicle on a flatbed trailer chaining it in place and covering it with a tarpaulin the solution was to ship such a vehicle within a trailer and for a while las vegas classic motor cars inc had done just that then it had occurred to the partners that contracting for the transport direct sole cargo of vehicles was costing them a lot of money they crunched the numbers and concluded the expense of buying and operating their own truck was justified they bought the peterbilt had a trailer specially modified essentially the installation of padding and means to hold the vehicles immobile while being transportedand hired a professional truck driver that had proved to be a disaster the driver had hit somethinghe saidon the road causing him to lose control go into a ditch and turn over the devices installed to keep the packard le baron bodied convertible in place had not been strong enough to hold the massive car when the trailer had turned over and massive damage had resulted the partners had suspected that what had really happenedtruck drivers like to make mileswas that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel the insurance company had similar suspicions and although they hadfinallypaid up they had immediately informed the partners that their rates in the future would regrettably have to be raised significantly that was when the idea of homer driving the rig had come up for one thing homer had been an overtheroad tractortrailer driver immediately after leaving the service for another homer and his wife had finally had enough of each other and it wouldnt be much of a hardship for him to spend a week or ten days away from vegas and other benefits came to mind if there was a motor vehicle in saint louis say of interest to las vegas classic motor cars inc and homer was thereor near therewith the truck he could both have a good look at itwithout the cost of an airplane ticket to get there and backmake a recommendation to the partners and if they decided to make the deal just load the new acquisition on the truck right then and there and then there was the restoration business homer could look at a car someone wanted to have las vegas classic motor cars inc restore quote the owner a price and if a deal was struck just load the car right then and there and haul it back to vegas the original trailer of course was shot they bought another and really customized it the new trailer was heated and airconditioned and would hold three cars instead of twofive if they were all porsches which happened several times in addition cabinets were built for tools and there was what looked very much like an oldtimey railroad sleeper compartment which held a toilet a bed a shower a tiny desk for homers computer and a closet for homers clothes when homer was trying to make a deal for say a buick limited sparesinthefenders convertible touring sedan worth say large he should look like a businessman not a truck driver and if he was going coasttocoastfor that matter anywhere overnightand needed some sleep he could just pull into a truck stop go in the back get a couple of hours of shuteye and then get back on the road without the hassle of having to find a motel where he could park the rig and then pay fifty sixty buckssometimes morefor just using the bed for a couple of hours the whole arrangementtraveling all over the country includedhad proven ideal for homers hobby which was to find some young bitch who looked like the bitch he had wasted ten years of his life on who lived by herself and then being very careful about it when everything fell into place get into her apartment scare the living shit out of hera man in a black ski mask waving a jim bowie replica knife with a polished shiny twelveinch blade in her face did that very nicelycut her clothes off with the knife tie her to her bed and take beforeduringandafter slipping the salami to her pictures with his digital camera this was the fourth time homer had stood in the shadow of a tree looking up at the apartment of miss cheryl anne williamson who at twentythree looked very much like mrs bonnie dawson daniels had looked when she was that age that is to say she was tall slender blonde had very fair skin and even homer thought that deceptive look of sweetness and innocence that bonnie had deceptive because bonnie the bitch was anything but sweet and innocent the first time homer had stood in the shadow of the tree he had followed cheryl home from halligans pub where he had seen her cockteasing the guys at the bar it had been immediately apparent to homer that cheryl had not gone to the bar to maybe meet somebody she could get to know really well maybe even someday marry much less to get laid she had gone to the bar to cocktease some dummy get him all worked up and then let him know she wasnt at all interested in fucking him what she got her kicks fromjust like bonnie the bitchwas humiliating some poor bastard letting him know he wasnt good enough for her the first night when cheryl had left halligans pub he had followed her home that time he was driving a yearold cadillac de ville used as a loaner by willow grove automotive where he had parked the rig las vegas classic motor cars did a lot of business with willow groveon that trip he had dropped off two porsches from california and would leave with a really nice rolls royceand the guy who ran it always loaned him a car overnight when he was in town that first time homer had watched her park her chrysler sebring watched as she entered the apartment building and then stood in the shadow of the tree until lights went on in a secondfloor apartment then he went to the sebring homer had once spent six months working for las vegas towing and repossession and getting into the sebring was no problemand got cheryls name address and phone and social security numbers from documents in her glove compartment then he got back in the de ville and went back to willow grove automotive parked the de ville gave the keys to the security guy went to the rig made sure the current had been plugged in and then went to the compartment in the trailer locking it from the inside he took off all his clothes and sat down in front of the computer turned it on took one of the good cds from its hiding place slipped it in the drive looked at the index thought a moment and then decided saint louis was what he wanted transferred the folder stl to the computer decrypted it then ran photoeaze which allowed him to run a slide show of the digital images in stl the girl in saint louiskarendidnt look as much like bonnie the bitch as the one tonight did but hed had his good times with her as the slide show ran he dropped his hand to his groin and played with himself he ran the slide show againthere were twelve picturesand then pushed hold on number which showed karen tied to the bed immediately after hed slipped her the salami hed really shown her she wasnt as high and mighty as she thought she looked soiled and humiliated itll really be great to get this new one this cheryl like that that thought had been so exciting that he ejaculated before he intended to couldnt be helped goddamn this cheryls really going to be a good one he cleaned himself up with kleenex then took the cd from the drive and put it back in the hiding place erased folder stl from the hard drive and then started the us government approved slack wipe program that would run for a couple of hours what the program did was overwrite and overwrite and overwrite again the slack space on the hard drive so there would be no chance of anybody ever being able to recover the images of karen he had just looked at then he took a shower and went to bed at seven the next morning he got behind the wheel of the peterbilt got on the pennsylvania turnpike and headed west there was a guy in grosse pointe michigan who collected rollses and there was a good chance hed be interested in some kind of a deal with the one now in the rig three weeks more or less later homer had again stood in the shadow of the tree outside cheryl williamsons apartment he had gone to halligans pub in hopes of seeing her there and when she hadnt shown hed gone to the apartment complex by then primarily because of a credit check he had run on her he knew a good deal about her he knew where she worked for one thing and where she had gone to school and that she had never been married and that she owed fifteen payments of on the chrysler sebring and thirtythree payments of on the furniture in her apartment the lights were on in her apartment which meant that she was there and that he could probably take the coveralls and face mask and jim bowie knife from his briefcase and get the job done it was a temptation hed thought of her a lot but it was also possible that she wasnt alone in the apartment and there was no sense taking any chances all things come to he who waits he had decided to wait it was a month after that that he stood for the third time in the shadow of the tree looking up at her apartment this time cheryl had been in the harrison lounge cockteasing some poor slob who had no idea what a bitch she was and when shed leftalone of coursehed followed her home again that night he was sure was going to be the night he even went back to his carthis time a plymouth voyager loaner from willow grove there being nothing better on the lotand changed into the costume when the lights went out in cheryls apartment he decided he would wait five minutes before climbing the back stairs to her apartment thirty seconds later cheryl came out of the building got into the sebring and drove off there was no way of telling of course where the bitch was going or wheneven ifshe was coming back if he continued to wait in the shadow of the tree somebody might see him and if he went back and waited in the voyager the cops might drive by and wonder what someone was doing sitting in a car at quarter to three in the morning when he got back to willow grove and the rig he loaded den into the computer and watched the sixteen pictures hed taken three months before of an arrogant bitch named delores in denver a notsoarrogant bitch anymore which was nice to look at and remember but delores was not nearly as pretty as cheryl and delores didnt look nearly as much like bonnie the bitch as cheryl did tonight homer had the feeling everything was going to fall into place willow grove automotive had loaned him a dark gray de villenot the one hed had beforeand when he got to halligans the minute he pulled into the parking lot he saw cheryls sebring and didnt even have to go into the lounge he just sat in the de ville and waited for her to come out when she did a guy came out after her and they had a little argument in the doorway the bitch was obviously telling the guy shed been cockteasing for the last hour at least that he had it wrong that not only was she not that kind of girl but even if she was she wouldnt give any to a jerk like him the guy went back in halligans pub cheryl got in her sebring and when she was out of sight homer started the de ville he knew where she lived and he didnt even have to follow her and when he got near independence street he sawon sixtyseventh avenue northa dark place where he could park the de ville where it wouldnt attract attention and where he could change into the costume without being seen and when he got to the tree and looked up at cheryls apartment the lights were on he figured she had been there no more than four five minutes at most the light came on a minute or so later in a little window he was sure was the bathroom and he thought about what cheryl would look like in the shower while he waited for the light to go out ten minutes later it went out and no more than a minute after that so did the lights in her bedroom homer checked the pockets of the coveralls to make sure he had the jim bowie replica knife the camera and the plastic thingamajigs he would use to tie her spreadeagled on her bed as he pulled on a pair of disposable rubber gloves homer started to get a hardon thinking about what he was going to do and told himself to cool it he didnt want it to be over too soon outside wooden stairs with a narrow platform had been added to the old building to provide a rear entrance to the secondfloor apartments he went up them quickly putting his feet on the outside of each step if you stepped in the middle sometimes the stairs would squeak and the last thing he wanted to do was to have some yapping dog hear him and start barking when he got to the platform and her back door he pulled the black ski mask from his pocket and pulled it over his head then took a close look at the door there were actually two doors an outer combination screen and winter door the screen thing was in place he put the blade of the jim bowie replica in the crack between the screen and the frame and carefully pried it open wide enough so that he could get his hand inside to unlatch it then he very carefully pulled it open it came easy without squeaking once he had the screen door open he made sure that the screen was back in place he was pleased when he saw that he hadnt even scratched the sonofabitch the inner door wasnt much more trouble there was a pretty good lock but the construction was cheesy and all it took to pop the lock was to force the blade of the jim bowie replica into the frame and lean on it a little homer opened the door wide enough to get the blade inside and ran it up and down checking for a chain or whatever and when there was none opened the door all the way stepped into the kitchen and then closed it behind him after a minute there was enough light for him to see pretty good he was glad hed waited there was a little table in the kitchen he probably would have bumped into this was the hairy part of the operation making it from just being inside into the bedroom and to the bed itself without making any kind of racket homer made his way slowly and carefully through the kitchen into the living room and then to a door he was pretty sure was the bedroom door this sometimes was a problem if there was a lock on the bedroom door and it had to be popped it sometimes woke the bitches up no lock the door opened smoothly inward there was more light in the room two of those gotothebathroom little lights plugged into sockets near the floor cheryl was in bed lying on her stomach she was wearing pajamas homer walked to the bed very carefully reached out for cheryls shoulder and then suddenly grabbed it jerked her over on her back then pushed her hard down on the bed with his hand on her throat one fucking sound and you get your throat cut he said waving the jim bowie replica in front of her face cheryl whimpered please dont hurt me she said scared shitless im going to fuck you bitch homer said its up to you whether you get hurt or not he grabbed cheryls left wrist put a plastic tie on it jerked it tight and then tied it to the bed the headboard was wrought iron sometimes when the headboard was materialor there was no headboard at all that had happened twicethere was a problem you had to tie the bitch to the springs which meant tying a couple of the ties together to make one long enough no problem like that tonight he tied the left tie to a curve in the wrought iron then reached across the bitch for her right hand cheryl started to sob homer slapped her hard not a sound bitch he said once he had the second plastic tie in place he jerked on it to make sure it wouldnt come loose then jerked on the other one then he knelt on the bed sat back on his heels and ran the blade of the jim bowie replica down cheryls body from the neck between her boobs to her crotch she whimpered again he tied her right ankle to the wrought iron at the foot of the bed and then the left ankle then he ran the blade up her body again not a peep you fucking bitch he went to the light switch by the door and flipped it on cheryls eyes were wide with terror he leaned over the bed and put the blade of the jim bowie replica under her pajama top and one by one cut the buttons off so that it could be easily opened when it came time for that he took the digital camera from the coveralls and took cheryls picture then he leaned over her and pushed the left side of her pajama top off her breast and took a picture of that very nice her nipples had become erect homer became aware that he had a hardon a real hardon he reached into the coveralls and took it out and waved it at her this is for you bitch he said he walked to the bed and pushed cheryls pajamas off her right breast and then took a picture of her like that then he went and knelt on the bed so that he could rub the head of his penis on her nipples that was very exciting so exciting that he knew he was going to have an orgasm and since that was the case he might as well have a good one so he put his hand on it and pumped rapidly until he ejaculated onto her breasts and face she turned her head and whimpered as fast as the camera would permit homer took three pictures of that and then had an artistic inspiration he took the jim bowie replica and carefully scraped some of the semen from cheryls breast on it and then laid it between her breasts with the tip just under her chin and he took two pictures of that looked at them in the cameras builtin viewer and then put the camera on the bedside table ill be right back homer said were just getting started he went into the bathroom and first urinated and then standing over the washbasin washed his genitals toying with them thinking that when he went back in the bedroom he would be able to get a shot of his sperm on her breasts and face that was an exciting thought so exciting that he felt himself begin to grow hard again and he thought thats what he would do get it up again so that when he went back in the bedroom she would see it and get a hint of what was in store for her when he went back in the bedroom the goddamn bitch had somehow got her right hand free from the plastic tie that had given her enough movement to twist onto her side and to pull her telephone from the bedside table she was punching in a number you goddamn fucking bitch homer said angrily what the fuck do you think youre doing he moved quickly to the bed made a fist and punched her as hard as he could in the face he turned her on her back again and punched her again he reached for the telephone to pull the line free from the socket it wouldnt come at first and he pulled harder and then the line snapped and the phone came out of his hand and flew across the room and smashed into the mirror mounted on the wall the mirror broke into three large pieces and two of them fell to the floor where they shattered into small pieces jesus christ that made enough noise to wake the fucking dead thats going to cost you bitch he said menacingly he realized he was breathing heavily and took a moment to calm down then he looked down at cheryl there was a little blood on her face running down over her lips and she was looking at something on the ceiling he looked up to see what she was looking at there was nothing but the ceiling and the light fixture he looked back down at her and she was still looking at the ceiling he waved his hand in front of her eyes there was no reaction jesus christ homer said softly he reached down and slapped cheryl on both cheeks goddamn you wake up he said there was no reaction oh shit homer said softly and waved his hand in front of her open eyes again shit shit shit homer said then he went to the door turned the lights in the bedroom off and made his way back through the apartment to the kitchen and let himself out taking care to make sure the screen doors latch had automatically locked after he pushed it shut he went quickly to the de ville and was halfway down the block before he remembered to take the black ski mask off and then homer had an at first chilling thought i dont have the fucking camera he patted his pockets to make sure shit shit shit oh fuck it i never took the rubber gloves off so there wont be any fingerprints and they cant trace it to me i bought it in that store with the arabs in times square in new york the time i picked up the silvergray bentley i paid cash ill just have to get another one it was getting pretty old anyway seven one on the other side of cheryl anne williamsons bedroom wall in her secondfloor apartment on independence street was the bedroom wall of the apartment occupied by mr and mrs herbert mcgrory there was a mirror on that wall toothe apartments were roughly mirror images of each otherand when cheryls bedside telephone slipped out of homer c danielss hand and flew with sufficient velocity into her mirror to cause it to shatter it also struck the plasterboard behind the mirror at that point on the wall behind the plasterboard was one of the twobyfourinch vertical studs arranged at sixteeninch intervals along the wall between each stud insulation material had been installed more to deaden sounds between the two apartments than for thermal purposes technically this was a violation of the philadelphia building code which requires that living areas be separated by a firewall either of concrete or cement blocks the building inspector somehow missed this violation over the years a number of philadelphia building inspectors have been found guilty of accepting donations from building contractors for overlooking violations of the building code manyperhaps mostof these corrupt civil servants have been found guilty and fined or sentenced to prison or both but it was obviously difficult for the city to reinspect every structure examined and passed by the inspector caught not looking and it wasnt done the stud moved not far but far enough to strike the back of the mirror on the mcgrorys wall the mirror bent then cracked and then a large roughly triangular piece of it slid out of the frame and crashed onto the floor the noise woke mrs joanne mcgrory a short rather plump thirtysixyearold who was in bed with her husband who was tall rather plump and thirtyeight years old she sat up in the bed and exclaimed jesus mary and joseph she looked around the dark room and then down at mr mcgrory who was asleep on his stomach herb after a moment without moving herb replied what get up for gods sake why whats happened get up herb damn you mrs mcgrory turned on the lamp on her bedside table as mr mcgrory sat up the first thing mr mcgrory noticed was the shattered mirror jesus what happened to the mirror how would i know its busted i can see that what happened mr mcgrory ran over the possibilities it could have been a sonic boom he theorized sonic boom you know when an airplane goes faster than sound oh god herb sometimes well you tell me he said get up and see if anything else is wrong she said dont cut your feet on the broken glass jesus do it now herb two minutes later after taking a cautious tour of their apartment mr mcgrory returned to announce that the only thing that seemed to be wrong was the mirror you didnt hear anything joanne asked significantly nodding toward the wall with the broken mirror several times the mcgrorys had heard the sounds of cheryl williamson entertaining gentleman callers in her bedroom once they had had to bang on the wall to request less enthusiasm mr mcgrory smiled and said could be and then made a circle with the thumb and index finger of his left hand into which he then inserted with a pumping motion the index finger of his right hand youre disgusting joanne said and then added this time its too much the mirror is busted im going to go over there and read the riot act to her no youre not he said yes i am no youre not then im going to call the cops i wont have this call the cops what are you going to say the lady next doors boyfriend screwed her so hard the mirror fell off our wall unless we do something about it were going to have to pay for that mirror joanne argued okay herb said after a moments thought go tell her what happened if i go over there what shes going to say is that she doesnt have any idea what im talking about would you would i what say gee im sorry my scre lovemaking broke your mirror and ill write you a check and what good do you think calling the cops is going to do it cant do any harm can it joanne asked reasonably maybe something is wrong next doorwith her and i dont want us to have to pay for the mirror joanne went to the telephone on the bedside table and punched at am a call went out from police radio disturbance house independence street secondfloor left apartment officer james hyde a tall thin darkhaired young man of twentyfour reached for his microphone in his patrol car pushed the button and replied thirtyfive twelve got it a moment later there was another response this one from officer haywood l cubellis a pound sixfootseven twentyfiveyearold africanamerican from his patrol car thirtyfive seventeen ill back him up whenever possiblein other words usuallytwo cars will respond to a disturbance house call such calls usually involve a difference of opinion between two people of oppositeor the samesex sharing living accommodations by the time the cops are called tempers are ator overthe boiling point if two officers are present each can listen sympathetically to the complaints of one abused party visavis the other which also serves to keep the parties separated one lonely police officer can be overwhelmed both cars arrived at independence street a few minutes after am although neitherthere was little traffic had used either siren or flashing lights while it might be argued that neither officer hyde nor officer cubellis was a highly experienced police officerhyde had been on the job three years and cubellis fourthey had enough experience to know that it was better for officers responding to a disturbance house call to bring with them calm reason and order rather than the heightened excitement that howling sirens flashing lights and screaming tires produce hey wood jim hyde called as both got out of their cars and started into the apartment complex officer haywood cubellis waved but did not respond he followed hyde to the secondfloor door of apartment b and stood to one side as hyde both knocked with his nightstick and pushed the doorbell mrs mcgrory answered the door in her bathrobe with herb standing behind her in trousers and a sleeveless undershirt looking a little uncomfortable both hyde and cubellis made a quick analysis nice people looked sober no bruises or signs of anything having been thrown or overturned in the apartment you called the police maam hyde asked yes i did what seems to be the trouble i like to think of myself as a reasonable person joanne said live and let live as they say but this is just too much what is it maam come in and ill show you joanne said and motioned the two policemen into the apartment both nodded at herb and herb nodded back officer hyde looked at the broken mirror what happened thats what we would like to know joanne said thats why we called you you dont know what happened to the mirror hyde asked herb my husband and i were sound asleep when it happened i told her i thought it was probably a sonic boom herb said thats nonsense joanne said it came from in there she pointed at the wall whats in there the next apartment joanne said what do you think came from in there that broke your mirror you tell the officers herb this was your idea you tell them herb said sometimes you make me sick joanne said you really do why dont you tell us what you think happened maam officer cubellis suggested well all right i will so far as i know shes a very nice girl her name is cheryl williamson but she every once in a while sheentertains in there if you know what i mean most of the time theres absolutely no problem but once or twicemore than once or twiceshe they have gotten sort of carried away with what theyre doing and it gets a little noisy if you take my meaning whats that got to do with your mirror officer hyde asked it broke joanne said as if surprised by the question and you think the people next door are responsible well herb and i certainly arent joanne said jim why dont i talk to the lady next door officer cubellis suggested why not hyde said maybe something happened to her joanne said officer cubellis left the mcgrory bedroom i dont know how much it will cost to replace that mirror but it wont be cheap and i dont see why we should pay for it joanne said yes maam officer hyde said five minutes later officer cubellis returned and reported that it didnt appear anyone was home in the next apartment he had both rung the bell and knocked at cheryl williamsons front door and then gone outside the house up the side stairs and knocked at her back door there was no doorbell button there that he could find there was no response from either place and he could hear no sounds from inside the apartment or see any lights i know she came in joanne said i woke up when she came in her screen door squeaks it was a little after midnight possibly she went out again officer cubellis said or maybe she knows the cops are here and doesnt want to answer her door why would she want to do that the mirror of course joanne said somebodys going to have to pay for it maam youll just have to take that up with her yourself in the morning officer hyde said cant you just go in and see if shes there or not joanne asked no maam we cant do that for all we know shes in there lying in a pool of blood joanne said maam why would you say that did you hear any noises anything like that joanne thought it over before replying no she said finally with some reluctance but that doesnt mean anything the mirrordid get busted yes maam officer cubellis said patiently but that doesnt give us the right to break into that apartment think about this you and mr mcgrory are in here watching a stan colt movie on tv lots of shooting women screaming explosions particularly at the end the lady in the next apartment hears this and gets worried and calls when the movie is over you and mr mcgrory go out for a hamburger so when the police get here theres no answer and they break in and then you come home and find the police in your apartment and the door broken in who would have to pay for the broken door if something like that happened joanne inquired the police officer cubellis began and then changed his mind about the ending would have to make the lady next door pay for the broken door he said because she was the one who wanted the police to break in jesus christ joanne herb mcgrory said officers im sorry we put you to all this trouble no trouble at all sir thats what were here for officer hyde said im sure youll be able to work things out about the mirror officer cubellis said officers cubellis and hyde left the mcgrory apartment got into their patrol cars and put themselves back into service officer hyde filled out a form an initial report form for almost all police incidents on it he stated that the mcgrory mirror had been broken and that mrs mcgrory believed the occupant of the adjacent apartment was somehow responsible an initial investigation of the adjacent apartment revealed that there was no response at that location and the premises were locked and secured two when it was am in philadelphiathe time that officers hyde and cubellis reported to police radio that they were back in service after the disturbance house callit was am in the village of cognacboeuf a small village in the southwest of france not far from bordeaux despite the name no cognac was distilled in the area and the local farmers raised only enough milk cows for local consumption although sheep were still grown in the area even that business had suffered from the ability of australian and argentine sheep growers to produce a higher grade of wool and a better quality of lamb at a lower price what once had been a bustling small village was now just a small outoftheway village catering to what small farmers were left and to retirees both french and from as far away as england sweden and even the united states of america the retirees sold their houses or apartments in hamburg or copenhagen and spent the money to buyat very low prices nobody but retirees had use for themancient farmhouses with a hectare or two of land spent enough money to make them livable and then settled down to watching the grass grow the piaf mill for example which sat on a small stream a kilometer from cognacboeuf had been purchased with hectares of land six years before by a swedish woman inge pfarr stillman and her husband walter an american using the moneyabout inge had gotten from the sale of her apartment in uppsala near stockholm it had gradually become believed that walter stillman a burly man who wore a sloppy goatee as white as what was left of his hair was a retired academic he was obviously welleducated and it was thought he was writing a book the mill now converted into a comfortable home was full of books and every day the postman on his bicycle delivered yesterdaysinternational heraldtribune from paris and once a week the international editions of time and newsweek most afternoons stillman could be found in le relais the better of cognacboeufs two eating establishments neither of which had won even one of michelins stars often playing chess with pere marcel the parish priest and drinking the localvin ordinaire the people of cognacboeufin particular the shopkeepershad come to call stillman respectfully msieu le professeur his name was actually isaac david festung and he was a fugitive from justice having been convicted of violation of paragraph a of the criminal code of the commonwealth of pennsylvania for having intentionally and knowingly caused the death of mary elizabeth shattuck a human being by beating andor strangling her by the neck until she was dead msieu le professeurs true identity had come to light two years before when at sunrise a dozen members of frances gendarmerie nationale had appeared pistols drawn at the piaf mills door when madame stillman opened it to them the gendarmes had burst in and rushed across the mills ground floor to the stairs then up the stairs to the loft there they foundnaked under a goosedown comforter in beda man who although he insisted indignantly that he had never even heard of anyone named isaac festung they arrested and placed in handcuffs after a brief stop at the constabulary office in cognacboeuf to report the suspect was in custodythere was no telephone in piaf mill and the radios in the gendarmes peugeots were out of range of their headquartersthe man still denying he had ever even heard of isaac festung was taken in a gendarmerie car to gradnignan prison in bordeaux fingerprinted and placed in a cell fortyfive minutes after that a technician of the french surete sent from paris after comparing stillmans justtaken prints with a set of prints of one isaac david festung furnished via interpol by the office of the philadelphia district attorney declared that it was his professional opinion that they matched beyond any reasonable doubt when confronted with this announcement isaac festung shrugged his shoulders and said that it was sad but he wasnt surprised that it had been inevitable that the american cia would finally gain control of interpol and finally be able to silence him madame stillman meanwhile back at the piaf mill had gotten dressed and then driven to the telephone office in cognacboeuf there she had made several telephone calls and had then come out to repeat more or less what her husband had said in bordeaux he was being persecuted by the american fbi and cia both for being a peace activist and for what he knew what he knew was not specified he had fled the united states they both said after he was arrested on a preposterous charge of murder furious that he had escaped their clutches the cia and fbi had arranged for a kangaroo trialin absentia which had predictably found him guilty and sentenced him to death one of the telephone calls madame stillmanmrs festung made was to a lawyer in paris who promptly called a press conference to make public what outrageous violations of lawand common decencythe barbaric american government was attempting to perpetrate the next day the newspapers of franceand elsewhere in europecarried the story often accompanied by outraged editorials for one thing the european convention on human rights had declared that an accused criminal was entitled to his day in court which meant that he had the absolute right to be physically present in the courtroom to refute witnesses making for example preposterous charges that he had beaten andor strangled his girlfriend and then stuffed her body into a trunk which he then stored in a closet in his apartment until the odor from there had caused his neighbors to call the police asking them to investigate as astonishing an outrage as that was the americans had the incredibly barbaric arrogance to sentence the man illegally tried to an illegal sentence that of being put to death by electrocution the death penalty was not permitted under french law extradition of someone sentenced to death even in a trial at which he was present when a jury of his peers had found him guilty was absolutely forbidden many of the editorials demanded both that mr festung be immediately set free and that the french government make in the strongest possible language their outrage known to the united states government the government of france wasnt willing to go that far possibly because the united states government suggested that if it did the united states government would no longer honor requests of france passed to them via interpol the matter would be decided the french government announced as soon as humanly possible in a french court france being france that took six months during which mr festung remained confined in gradnignan prison in bordeaux mrs festung visited him frequently sometimes daily while they waited for the wheels of french judicial bureaucracy to grind inexorably the united states government then contracted for the services of a french law firm to represent it at the appeal hearing there was a legal counsel with a large support staff more than forty people it was saidattached to the united states embassy in paris but it turned out that before he had become the legal counsel of the united states heand most of the members of his staffhad been special agents of the federal bureau of investigation and were not allowed to practice law even in the united states this revelation produced a plethora of editorials in the french press on the theme that it was a gross violation of french sovereignty to have american secret policemen operating under diplomatic cover on the sacred soil of la belle france what was next some editorials demanded the cia operating in france when the caseactually the appealwas finally heard the french lawyers representing the united states very politely made the following points trialsin absentia are permitted under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania the immediate jurisdiction when the accused has not shown up as promised after being released on bail and his whereabouts are unknown and undeterminable in the case of mr festung there was no sentence of death by electrocution at the time of his trial the commonwealth of pennsylvania had no provision in its laws to execute anyone by electrocution or any other means mr festung had been sentenced to life imprisonment the government of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on learning that mr festung had been located in france and understanding the french distaste for trialsin absentia had passed special legislation applying specifically to mr festung guaranteeing his right to a new trial if he should wish one inasmuch as mr festung had entered france illegally on a false passport in a false name he was not entitled under french law to the protection of french law and furthermore french law stated that someone apprehended in france who had entered the country illegally would be immediately deported the threejudge bank of appeals justices considered the case for almost threequarters of an hour before deciding to deny the request of the united states government for the extradition of isaac david festung now known as walter stillman resident of cognacboeuf isaac david festung was free to go a cheering crowd greeted the festungs both outside the court building and when they returned to their home in cognacboeuf the united states ambassador to the french republic decided to appeal the decision of the court of appeals it was whispered that he did so somewhat reluctantly and only at the insistence of the secretary of state personally the story went that the secretary had been approached by the hon carl feldman the senior senator from the state of pennsylvania at the urging of the hon eileen mcnamara solomon the philadelphia district attorney the story whispered about went on to say that mrs solomon had told senator feldman that she could see no way to keep out of the newspapers the fact that senator feldman had been this slimy sonofabitchs lawyer and had gotten him released on baila ridiculous figure for someone facing a murder two chargewhich he had then jumped and offered the suggestion that if the senator hoped to get reelected it might well behoove him to also get it into the papers that having recognized the error of his ways he was doing everything in his power to have the murdering sonofabitch extradited neither senator feldman nor district attorney solomon would comment on this story but it was soon announced by the french ministry of justice that what the court of appeals hadreally meant to say when it had released mr festung was that he was to be released only to cognacboeuf and there he would be under the surveillance of the gendarmerie national pending the results of the appeal of the us embassy of their decision to the supreme court of france when isaac festung woke in his bed at just about the time officers cubellis and hyde were reporting themselves back in service in philadelphiaand six months after the ministry of justices announcementhe was not at all worried about what the french supreme court would decide best served the interests of justice not only had his lawyers told him he had nothing to be worried about but based on his own analysis of the situation by which he meant his analysis of france and the french mentality intellectual and politicalhe did not see much indeed anycause for concern the french fort festung had concluded had an identity problem and an enormous capacity for selfdeception at the same time they professed france to be a world power equal to any they knew this wasnt true they were about as important in the world fort festung had concluded as the italians perhaps even less important the difference was the italians knew what they were and acted accordingly and the french refused to admit what they were and acted accordingly the most important factor in the equation was that the french really hated america and americans the italians were grateful that the americans had run the germans and the native fascists out of italy in the second world war and grateful again for the american relief effort after the war and for american help in keeping the communists from taking any real power in italy the french were privately shamed that the americans had twice been responsible for chasing the boche from french soil american aid to france after the war had made france resentful not grateful and france had been relieved when the americans took a whipping in what had been french indochina it would have been almost too much for the french to bear if the yankees had beaten the vietnamese into submission after they had failed dien bien phu was just one more name on a very long list of battles that the proud french army had lost something one would never suspect watching them strut down the champs elysees on bastille day with flags flying fort saw proof of his theory in french automobiles most of them he thought in addition to being notoriously unreliable were spectacularly ugly and they had yellow headlights no other country in europe put yellow headlights on their cars so far as fort could tell the only advantage of the yellow headlights was that they immediately identified a car as having been made in france they couldnt even sell french cars in the united states they didnt meet american safety standards automobiles made for example in korea did and that was not even getting into the comparisons that could be made between peugeots and citroens and the mercedesbenzes and porsches made by the hated boche on the other side of the rhine and which were highly regarded around the world there were when he had time to think about it literally hundreds of other proofs of frances general inferiority and the french unwillingnessperhaps inabilityto accept it what this all added up to was that when a frenchman found himself in a position where he could tell the united states to go fuck itself he could count on hearty cheers from the great majority of his countrymen the issue in other words no longer had anything to do with what happened in philadelphia so many years ago or with fort festung it had become a question of the french republic proving its sovereignty and independence before the world france the worlds center of culture and civilization was not about to bow to the will of the goddamned uncultured uncivilized and despicable united states of america vive la france in the meantime living in cognacboeuf wasnt at all bad he admitted he missed the excitement of philadelphia and obviously he could never go back there but with this business all out in the open when the supreme court issued its decision he would be able to travel all over france which meant paris and in the meantime fort festung thought as he got out of bed and put on a loosely fitting shirt and baggy cotton trousers and slipped his sockless feet into thong sandals life here in cognacboeuf wasnt at all bad he could for example get on his bicycle ride into cognacboeuf take a table at la relais have rolls fresh from the oven locally made butter coffee and a hooker of cognac placed before him and consume them while he explained to the locals what the stories intime and the trib really meant and that was exactly what isaac david festung did while officers hyde and cubellis remained on patrol in philadelphia maintaining as well as they could peace and domestic tranquillity in the city of brotherly love three when captain henry c quaire walked into homicide a few minutes after eight the same morning he saw sergeant matthew m payne sitting on a chair outside the chief of homicides office sergeant payne rose when he saw captain quaire good morningsergeant quaire said smiling and then waved his hand toward the door of his office come on in matt payne followed him into the office one of your major responsibilities sergeant quaire said pointing to his coffee machine is to make sure that one of your subordinates makes sure that machine is tended and ready for service by the time i walk in here yes sir matt said quaire poured an emerald society cup full and turned to payne help yourself matt and then pull up a chair yes sir thank you privately henry quaire was not overjoyed at the assignment of sergeant payne to homicide for one thing hed had nothing to do with it almost traditionally the chief of homicide had been able to select his men and there were a number of sergeantsthree in particular who wanted the assignmentwhom quaire considered to be far better qualified to be a sergeant in homicide than sergeant payne but the commissioner had had his offthewall idea of giving the top five guys on the sergeants list their choice of assignment so paynes assignment was a done deal and there was no way he could fight it not that he really wanted to he decided for one thing he was off the hook about picking one of the other sergeants if he had had to make a choice between them two of them would not have gotten the assignment and theyand their rabbis would have been disappointed and their rabbis probably pissed now they could be pissed at the commissioner and it wasnt as if payne was an absolute incompetent getting shoved down his throat he was in fact a pretty good cop who would probably do a good job in homicide before moving onward and upward in the police hierarchy like his rabbi inspector peter wohl he was one of those people who seemed predestined for evergreater responsibility and the rank that went with it nor was there going to be so far as quaire sensed muchif anyresentment from the homicide guys about having a brandnew sergeant with just over five years on the job as a homicide supervisor for one thing payne was close to the two most respected people in homicide lieutenant jason washington and detective tony harris washington had no problem with paynes assignment and when quaire had asked tony harris harris had been almost enthusiastic ive worked with him captain harris said hes smart as hell and this place can use a little class unless im wrong hes going to be dynamite on the witness stand smart as hell and being dynamite on the witness stand were two desirable characteristics for anybody in homicide and then there was the fact that everybody in homicide knew that payne had had two good shootings the first had been the serial rapist in northwest philadelphia whod tried to run payne down in his van that bastard had already had his next intended victim trussed up like a christmas turkey in the back of his van when payne had interrupted his plans with a bullet in his head the second was when they were rounding up the doers in the goldblatt amp sons furniture job and wohl had put payne and mickey ohara in an alley to keep them out of the line of fire while highway and special operations uniforms went in the front one of the doers had appeared in the alley with a semiautomatic payne had taken a hit in the leg but hed downed the bad guy anyway and then there was the third incident just six months ago payne had run downgood detective worka lunatic terrorist they wanted the fbi had been looking for him without coming close for years payne knew the critter was going to be in the parking lot of a diner in doylestown he had no authority in doylestown and didnt think the doylestown cops would know how to handle the terrorist so hed called an fbi guy he knewone of the good ones for a change and the fbi guy had gone to doylestown when theyd tried to put the collar on the lunatic hed let loose with an automatic carbine wounding a bystander woman and killing the woman whod led payne to the lunatic thered been a hell of an exchange of gunfire handguns against an automatic carbine the fbi guy had actually put the critter down but payne had been involved up to his eyeballs and hadnt blinked if things were perfect a cop would never have to take his pistol out of his holster but things arent perfect and all copsincluding homicide detectivesadmire the cops who do it right when they have to take out their weapons and then finally captain quaire was aware that at dave pekachs wifes party for payne last night payne had sat at a table with deputy commissioner coughlin district attorney eileen mcnamara solomon chief inspector of detectives matthew lowenstein and inspector wohl making it clear he had friends in high places welcome aboard matt quaire said thank you sir would you have any objection to being assigned to lieutenant washingtons squad no sir so be it quaire said youre a bright young man do i have to remind you that youre the new kid on the block and that most of the people here have been in homicide longer than youve been on the job i dont mean to sound flippant sir but thats not the first time thats been pointed out to me and in a situation like that what are you going to do keep my eyes open and my mouth shut sir dont go too far matt with the mouth shut youre a sergeant and youll be expected to act like one yes sir i understand what im doing here is wasting my time and his before he walked in here this morning he was coached on what to expect and how to behave by peter wohl who was a very young detective here or by denny coughlin or by the black buddha maybe even by matt lowenstein or tony harris or more likely all of the above when is this business with stan colt going to happen quaire asked i think hes coming on friday sir i havent had the time to check with lieutenant mcguire you better check with him soon for the obvious reasons ill do it right now sir and let me know yes sir okay matt go to work captain quaire said glad youre going to be with us thank you sir four at am as jack williamson drove his chrysler m northward on i toward bucks countycoincidentally just beyond and to the left of the industrial correction center and just shy of the philadelphia police academyhis cellular telephone buzzed williamson was a tall rather goodlooking welldressed twentynineyearold whose business card identified him as senior sales consultant for overbrook estates which offered custombuilt executive homes on quarteracre lots in overbrook estates a new gated community in beautiful bucks county starting in the midks he cursedfor having forgot to do so earlieras he reached for the earphone and jammed it in place and then pushed the button on the microphone which he was supposed to have clipped to his jacket but now held somewhat awkwardly in his right hand jack williamson he said this is your mother oh shit now what does she want what can i do for you mother on my way to work where im already twentyfive minutes late im worried about cheryl can we talk about this later she doesnt answer her phone probably because she knows its you calling and not even the answering machine answers maybe its full and shes not at work i called there too and just possibly mother dear she told them to tell you she was out mother she

go youll call me his mother asked jack detected a triumphal tone in her voice score another one for momma dear ill call he looked for found and took the next exit rampexit and a block onto willets road pulled to the side clipped the cellulars handsoff microphone to his shirt then picked the phone up and held down the key which caused the cellular to automatically dial cheryls number there was no answer which meant she wasnt there he hung up then held down the key which caused the cellular to automatically dial cheryls cellular number after five rings a recorded female voice announced that the party he was attempting to reach was either not available at this time or out of the local calling area he cursed again dropped the phone onto the seat put the m in gear and headed down willets deciding the best way to get to cherylsall the fucking way across north phillywas to take roosevelt boulevard and then adams avenue into the east oak lane section of philadelphia when he got to cheryls door he could hear the chimes inside playing the first few bars of be it ever so humble but there was no answer which meant that cheryl was already probably at work he decided that when he got back to the car he would call her at her office and turned to leave then nature called and he was a long way from overbrook estates he felt around the top of the door frame for her spare key and when he didnt find it turned over the floor mat in front of the door and when it wasnt there either took a last shot and standing on his toes ran his hands over the trim above the windows next to cheryls door he knocked a key off failed to catch it and it bounced off the floor and went over the edge of the walkway jesus h christ he said and went down the stairs and two minutes later managed to find the key in the grass he unlocked the door and entered the apartment there were he remembered two toilets one with a bathtub off cheryls room and another just a water closet and a washbasin off the kitchen he went to the latter and relieved himself he was on the walkway checking to make sure the door was locked when a female voice asked is everything all right now what the hell jack found himself facing mrs joanne mcgrory im cheryls brother he said jack williamson and as soon as you satisfy your goddamn curiosity and go away so you cant see what im doing i will put the goddamn key back where it belongs im joanne mcgrory next door im pleased to meet you jack said im pleased that everything is all right joanne mcgrory said after the mirror i was worried excuse me our mirror came crashing off the wall and i thought maybe something happened in there too everythings fine in there i called the cops but they wouldnt go inside you called the cops why well if you were in bed in the middle of the night and your mirror came crashing down off the wall what would you do mrs mcgrory youre telling me the police were here last night yes they were joanne mcgrory said i called them thinking that something might have happened to cheryl and what did they do say they said they couldnt go into her apartment jesus h christ is my imagination running away with me is something really wrong here jack williamson put the key back in the lock and reentered the apartment hed already been in cheryls kitchen and living room so he went to her bedroom and opened the door oh my god holy christ what happened in here shes buck fucking naked and shes tied to the bed he walked to the bed and looked down at cheryl her eyes were open but sightless oh my god shes dead he turned mrs mcgrory was coming into the bedroom i think youd better get out of here he said well excuse me im just trying to be neighborly get the fuck out of here goddamn it jack said waited until she had fled and then looked for cheryls telephone it wasnt on her bedside table it was on the floor and he could see the cord had been broken jesus ill have to use the cell phone in the car what the hell am i going to tell mother as he went through the living room he remembered that cheryl had a second phone mounted on the kitchen wall he went to it then stopped maybe its got fingerprints on it i better use my cell phone in the car fuck it he took the handset from its cradle with his handkerchief and using his ballpoint pen punched in police department operator a male voice answered on the second ring jesus may i help you sir im my sisters apparently been murdered jack williamson said and where are you sir in her apartment second floor right independence street i let myself in and found her and your name sir williamson jack williamson you just stay where you are please mr williamson ill get police officers over there right away jesus christ shes tied to the goddamn bed help will be there very shortly mr williamson officer roland stone was twelve blocks from cheryls apartmentnear the intersection of godfrey avenue and howard streetwhen his radio went off stone replied take independence street secondfloor apartment right meet the complainant report of a use cautionthe complainant is on the scene and states it is a possible homicide i have it stone said and flipped on the light bar on the roof and the siren as he turned left onto water street aandy police radio called next to alert the supervisora sergeantin the area a i copied im en route sergeant john j haley responded he was three blocks away from cheryl williamsons apartment this meant haley had heard the initial call to and there was no need for the police radio operator to repeat the information without really thinking about it sergeant haley oriented himself with regard to where he wasat franklin street and sixtyfifth avenue northand where he was going took a quick look made a uturn and stepped hard on the accelerator he used neither the light bar nor the siren they wouldnt be necessary when he got out of his car at the curb in front of independence and started inside a white middleaged woman was standing on the walkway just off the porch up there she said gesturing inside second floor on the right haley took the porch stairs and then the interior stairs two at a time the door to cheryl williamsons apartment was ajar there was a white late twenties male sitting on a couch his head bent police sergeant haley said in there the man on the couch said gesturing toward an interior door whats happened here some fucking perverted cocksucker killed my sister thats what happened here sergeant haley went into cheryls bedroom stayed only long enough to determine that the naked female in the bed was deadhe had seen enough bodies to make that determination with certainty he didnt feel for a pulseand then stepped backward into the corridor and then went into the living room looking at the guy who said he was the brother sergeant haley squeezed the transmit switch on his lapel microphone a a police radio responded a notify northwest detectives and homicide we have an apparent homicide white female no obvious cause of death but there are signs of a possible rape hold myself and car out at the scene jack williamson looked up at sergeant haley she is dead right im afraid so they both could hear the growing scream of officer stones patrol car approaching eight one in the radio roomroom doesnt do justice to the large area in which police radio is housedin the roundhouse the radio operator who had taken sergeant haleys call then pressed a button on his console that automatically dialed the number of the desk man at the northwest detectives division detective units operate on what is known as the wheel its actually a roster of the names of the detectives on duty at the moment and its designed to equitably distribute the workload in most detective divisions there is a detective assigned to man the desk the desk man answers the telephone when a job comes in the desk man assigns it to the detective next up on the wheel when the phone rang in the northwest detectives division it was answered by detective o a lassiter who was not the desk man but was filling in for detective len ford who was in the mens room taking a personal as a bathroom break is referred to on police radio it also happened that detective lassiter was next up on the wheel detective lassiter was twentyfive years old with pounds distributed attractively around her fivefootseveninch frame she had dark black hair green eyes long attractive legs and had what her fellow detectives agreed privately very privatelywere a magnificent ass and bosom this is police radio operator number the police radio operator began then went into the details of the call hed received from sergeant haley detective lassiter wrote them down on a lined tablet and finally said okay we got it then raised her voice to call out to lieutenant fred c vincent hey lieutenant we got one what kind of job is it lassiter vincent asked homicide possible rape white female twentythree years old her brother found her inside her apartment tied to the bed hes still at the scene you better take somebody with you vincent said ill get over there as soon as i can yes sir detective lassiter said and then raising her voice called out charley you loose enough to go with me whats the job detective charley touma a plump fortyfouryearold asked thats not an answer charley thats another question lieutenant vincent answered for detective lassiter i am at your disposal detective lassiter touma said whats the job homicide possible rape young white female detective lassiter said as she opened the drawer of her desk took from it her glock mm semiautomatic pistol and slipped it into its holster lieutenant vincent was pleased that detective touma would be working with detective lassiter touma was a good man a gentle man the job was probably going to be messy and although he knew he wasnt supposed to let feelings like this intrude in any way in official business the truth was that lieutenant vincent looked upon detective lassiter as if not a daughter then as a little sister immediately after talking to the desk man at northwest detectives the police radio operator pushed the button that automatically dialed the number of the man on the desk in the homicide unit which was physically almost directly under him in the roundhouse detective joe damata a slightly built natty oliveskinned fortyyearold who was next up on the homicide wheel answered the phone homicide damata this is radio the operator said and then proceeded to repeat almost verbatim what hed reported to detective lassiter at northwest detectives and detective damata as detective lassiter had done carefully wrote everything down then said got it thanks he looked around for lieutenant jason washington and saw that he was in his office talking withalmost certainly telling him the way things workedsergeant matt payne the only problem joe damata had with payne as a sergeant in homicide was that it made him reconsider the decision hed made years before when hed been in homicide a year and there was a sergeants exam coming up and he had decided not to take it it was pretty clear by then that hed cut the mustard and wouldnt be asked to consider a transfer he realized that he would much rather be a homicide detective than a sergeant or a lieutenant or even a captain somewhere else for one thing with all the overtime he was taking home as muchor moredough as an inspector but the money wasnt all of it he liked homicide homicide was special and it paid well who needs to be a sergeant so he hadnt taken the exam and hadnt thought about getting promoted since and he knew that manyperhaps mostof the homicide detectives had made the same decision at some time in their careers another trouble with taking the exam and making sergeant was that hed have to leave homicide the personnel theory there being it was bad policy to have somebody who last week was one of the boys this week be their supervisor even if he went to a regular detective districtsouth for exampleas a sergeant he wouldnt be doing any investigations himself just supervising detectives who were investigating retail thefts stolen autos and the occasional more exciting aggravated assaults or bank robberies and if you turned up a good suspect on a bank job the fbi would immediately take over if he were sent to a uniform district a very distinct possibility in todays careerdevelopmentminded department then he would be devoting his investigatory skills to disturbance house calls there were exceptions of course there were exceptions to everything jason washington had taken the lieutenants exam with the understanding that if he made it he would stay in homicide and the word was out that with a couple of belts in him after hed heard payne was coming to homicide tony harris had gone to washington and asked if he couldnt do the same thing and washington said he would work on it there was something else too the reason payne was the new sergeant was the nutty first five get their choice of assignment decision commissioner mariani had come up with that could have come out worse payne was a youngster but he was a good cop hed been doing in critters from the time hed come on the job denny coughlin had gotten him assigned as peter wohls administrative assistant to keep him out of trouble until he realized that rich kids from the main line really shouldnt be cops just because their father and uncle got blown away as cops he had been working for wohl hardly any time at all when hed popped the northwest serial rapist and taken him permanently off the streets without putting the commonwealth to the expense of a trial maybe it was in his blood who the hell knew but the point was payne was a good cop what if the number one guy had been somebody else some dickhead out of community relations some other candyass good at taking exams but who on the street couldnt find his butt with both hands and who would piss his pants if he had to stare down some critter what then joe damata pushed himself out of his chair and walked to lieutenant washingtons door he waited until he had washingtons attention we got one jason he said white female twentythree probably involved with a rape dare i hope the culprit is in custody washington asked damata shook his head no thirtyfifth district uniform is holding the scene he said sergeant payne will accompany you to the scene washington said smiling broadly checking to make sure everything you know has to be done is done you will explain each step in the procedure to him so that he will be assured you know what youre doing in other words show the rookie the ropes anytime youre ready sergeant joe said let me know what happens sergeant washington said yes sir matt got up and followed damata into the outer room what i usually do first sergeant damata said is secure my replacement on the wheel matt nodded damata raised his voice kramer put thehustler down and take the phone detective alonzo kramer who appeared to be reading a large ledger at his desk waved his hand to indicate he understood he was now up on the wheel matt payne wondered if he really had a copy ofhustler magazine hidden behind the green ledger and decided he didnt want to know what i will do now sergeant joe damata said punching numbers on a telephone is inform the very clever technicians assigned to the mobile crime lab that their services are going to be required other detectiveswho matt did not need to be told were the squad who would work the casebegan to gather around damatas desk damata put the telephone handset in its cradle with your permission sergeant i will designate detectives reeves and grose to remain behind reeves who went to night school and now reads almost at the sixthgrade level will research the victim see what he can find out about her in the filesdoes she have a rap sheet outstanding warrants et cetera et cetera grose who cant read at all will seek out a judge to get us a search warrant for the premises detectives grose and reeves having picked up on what was happening were smiling im sure youre aware sergeant damata went on that our beloved lieutenant washington is pickypicky about getting a search warrant before we even start rooting in garbage cans in search of evidence and photographing the deceased he has made that point detective matt said something to do i believe with slimeball lawyers getting critters off because the evidence was gained unlawfully so i was led to believe matt said and i think with your permission sergeant that i will designate detective slaybergthats the fat one in the cheap suit screw you joe detective slayberg said but he was smiling as the recorder hes very good at describing premises so i usually get stuck with that sergeant slayberg said many years ago matt said mock seriously when i was a young police officer i made the mistake of letting my sergeant know i could type with all the fingers on both hands the others chuckled boy slayberg said with all possible respect sergeant that was a dumb fucking thing to do so i learned matt said there were more chuckles so now these little details out of the way and with your permission sergeant i think we should proceed to the scene absolutely with just about everybody working the roy rogers job matt were a little short of wheels you mind if slayberg and i ride out there with you or did quaire beat you out of that new car you brought with you not yet matt said but then i havent been here very long i wonder why quaire didnt grab the car he watched as all the detectives who would be going to the scene went to filing cabinets unlocked them and then took from them their personal equipment which included their weapons surgical rubber gloves and leather or vinylcovered folders holding legal tablets he followed damata out of homicide at the last moment picking up his briefcase with his laptop inside from atop a filing cabinet near the door two when matt got out of the unmarked ford he saw that yellowandblack tape reading police line do not cross had been strung along both sides of the path into the apartment complex to prohibit access to one of the buildings two uniformed white shirts a captain and a lieutenant were standing talking to two detectives one of them a woman on the concrete path in front of what was obviously the crime scene captain alex smith the district commander joe damata said good guy i dont make the lieutenant lew sawyer slayberg furnished hes a prick the broad is from special victims and shes a real bitch what the fuck is she doing here slayberg asked special victims unit doesnt have anything to do with homicide investigations even when the victim has been raped smile nicely at her matt damata said captain smith saw the three of them coming and smiled hello joe he said putting out his hand good morning sir i know you know harry but sergeant payne yeah sure how are you harry he shook slaybergs hand i know who you are sergeant but i dont think weve ever actually met i dont think so sir matt said reaching for smiths outstretched hand this is lieutenant sawyer smith said and detectives domenico and ellis of special victims i think i used to see you around the arsenal didnt i detective domenico asked there was something about her smile matt didnt like and he remembered what slayberg had said i used to be out there with special operations matt said everybody nodded at each other but no hands were shaken what have we got captain joe asked a dead girl the doer is probably a sicko and maybe a problem what kind of a problem there was a disturbance house call here last night two cars responded the lady next door said her mirror fell off the wall she said the trouble came from the williamson apartment and wanted them to check it out there was no response when the officers rang the bell no lights no sounds and no signs of a breakin so they couldnt take the door uhoh damata said i think i know whats coming captain smith nodded so they left he said and then the brother let himself in this morning found his sister and the lady next door told him what had happened last night actually early this morning and the brother is pretty upset with the police department for not taking the door the first time we were here ouch damata said slaybergs cellular buzzed he said his name listened then said thanks we just got here wait he turned to matt sergeant the search warrant is on the way grose will bring it reeves said theres nothing but a couple of driving violations on either the victim or her brother and wants to know what you want him to do tell grose to tell reeves to come out with him and the warrant matt said forgetting that he had promised himself to keep his eyes open and his mouth shut he stole a quick glance at damata and saw nothing on his face to suggest he thought matt had ordered the wrong thing and he remembered what quaire had said about his being expected to act like a sergeant why dont we go have a quick look matt said to damata and slayberg the search warrants on the way he started to walk toward the stairs and became aware that everybody started to follow him im not about to tell the district captain he cant have a look at the scene but that doesnt apply to the lieutenant and certainly not to the smiling lady from special victims its your job sergeant but i would like a look after you sir he said waving captain smith ahead of him lieutenant would you mind waiting until the crime lab people do their thing matt asked i just wanted a quick look but youre right lieutenant sawyer said you understand matt said to detective domenico the ice in your eyes detective domenico sergeant payne thought would freeze the balls off a brass monkey whats your problem youre not even supposed to be here this isnt a rape a child molestation its a homicide the uniform in front of cheryl williamsons door stepped aside when he saw captain smith and the others once they got inside captain smith touched matts arm i know sex crimes he said using the old name for the special victims unit doesnt have anything to do with a homicide investigation even when a sexual assault is involved they just happened to be in my office talking to me about an unsolved rape when this job came out yes sir matt said and then he saw in joe damatas eyes that he found this interesting after a moment so did matt an unsolved rape and they just happened to be here at a homicide rape scene is there something else were not being told i think ill have to send a team over to the special victims unit to see what their files may have without a word joe damata opened his leatherbound notepad turned to the last page of the tablet and scrawled a note for himselfsex crimes unsolved rape in area lt sawyer det domenico ellis there was another female detective in the apartment sitting on the couch beside a welldressed somewhat distraughtlooking man she stood up when she saw them sergeant payne had an unprofessional thoughtnow thats a very interesting member of the opposite sex captain id rather not have anybody in there until we get the search warrant and the crime lab the very interesting member of the opposite sex said the warrants on the way matt said and were just going to stand in the door for a quick look take a good long look the man on the couch said as he stood up if you cops did what youre supposed to do my sister would probably still be alive im very sorry for your loss sir damata said youre sorry that does cheryl a lot of fucking good who are you detective olivia lassiter asked almost a challenge joe damata homicide damata said ive got the job this is harry slayberg and sergeant payne damata and slayberg nodded at detective lassiter as they walked around matt to the bedroom door who are you matt asked lassiter northwest detectives she said damata and slayberg stood in the doorway of cheryl williamsons bedroom and looked aroundwithout enteringfor about sixty seconds then they stepped away from the bedroom door and started looking around the living room captain smith went to the bedroom door jesus he said softly matt saw that damata and slayberg had rubber gloves on their hands wondered why he hadnt seen them put them on and pulled a pair of his own from his pocket he was about to walk to the door when the apartment door opened again and two men entered payne knew one of them a balding rumpled man in a wellworn suit dr howard mitchell of the medical examiners office he had with him a photographer a young man matt could not remember ever having seen before matt found it interesting that dr mitchell had come to the scene personally usually technicians from the mes office worked a death scene and the me did not he either supervised the autopsy or did it himself probably matt decided mitchells appearance had something to do with a special operations job hed heard about one that had almost been assigned to him although in the end it had been assigned to detectives jesus martinez and charles t mcfadden it had begun when a highly indignant citizen the nephew of a woman whod fallen down her cellar stairs and broken her neck had gone to his district and told the desk sergeant to report that hed just gotten aunt myrtles last visa bill aunt myrtle didnt drink couldnt drive and there was no way she could have charged worth of booze at mickeys liquor store in camden new jersey on the day of her death the report had worked its way through the bureaucracy to the roundhouse where it had been discussed by deputy commissioner coughlin and chief inspector of detectives lowenstein they agreed there was something about it that made it seem more than a simple case of creditcard fraud and since it crossed state lines it became a federal offense which meant it was in the province of the fbi although both coughlin and lowenstein held the fbi in the highest possible respect they also suspected that a credit card fraud involving only would not get the fbis full attention give it to peter wohl lowenstein said not this job get him to see if there have been other reports of other things missing from other recently deceased citizens coughlin hadunnecessarilytold peter wohl that if somebody at funeral homes cops at the scene or maybe even from the mes office were taking things they shouldnt he would rather learn this from special operations than from the fbi charley mcfadden and hayzus martinez had been given the job because they had less on their plates when the job came in than matt did it hadnt taken mcfadden and martinez long to discovermatt couldnt remember ever before having seen charley so personally indignantthat a lot of stuff had disappeared over the past six months and that it was pretty clear it had disappeared into the pockets of some of the mes technicians they had apparently decided that since the deceased had no further need for rings watches other jewelry and cash they might as well put the same to good usetheir own four of them had been arrested tried and convicted good morning doctor captain smith said from the bedroom door hey smitty dr mitchell said and then spotted matt hey payne i saw your picture in the paper good morning doctor matt said the search warrants en route dr mitchell winked at damata and slayberg then walked to the bedroom door pulling on rubber gloves as he did so the photographer followed him mitchell gestured with his hand for the photographer to stop at the door then went inside the medical examiner needed no ones permission to enter the crime scene it belonged to him until he released it to homicide matt walked to the bedroom door dr mitchell bent over cheryl williamsons body took a quick look put his fingers on her carotid artery looked at his watch and announced i pronounce her dead as of ten fiftyfive he looked over his shoulder at matt unofficially it looks like her neck is broken and to judge from the lividity of the body id guess shes been dead eight nine hours or so he signaled to the photographer that it was all right for him to enter the room and started for the bedroom door matt got his first look at the victim she was naked with her legs spread apart by plastic ties tied to the footboard her upper body was twisted to the left her left hand was tied to the headboard and matt could see another tie hanging loose from her right wrist she looked at him out of sightless eyes and his mind was instantly filled with susan reynoldss sightless eyes looking at him in the parking lot of the crossroads diner he felt the knot in his stomach and the cold sweat forming on his back and stepped quickly away from the door jesus not now dear god dont let me get sick to my stomach and make an ass of myself on my first homicide job he bumped into something somebody and saw that it was detective olivia lassiter and that he had almost knocked her over she looked at him with what he thought was annoyance he started to say sorry but was interrupted by jack williamson bitterly asking you got a good look i hope he turned his back to williamson and touched detective lassiters arm you get anything out of him and then before she could reply asked why didnt you get him out of here i was just getting him calmed down enough to talk when you walked in she said he doesnt want to leave and i didnt want to push him come with me matt said that sounds like an order she said okay matt said it was a request a suggestion but i want you to come with me she met his eyes defiantly for a moment then shrugged and turned away from the open door matt walked to the couch jack williamson looked up at him with cold contempt mr williamson im sergeant payne im the homicide supervisor and i need to talk to you and we cant do that in here in just a few minutes there will be technicians all over the place and we cant be in their way i want you to come with detective lassiter and me to someplace where we can talk okay the lady next door offered anything we need olivia said what about her kitchen she had said she would put a pot of coffee on well just sit around and have a friendly cup of coffee right and maybe a big mac with my sister like that in there we have to talk someplace mr williamson and we have to get out of the way of the technicians and sitting down over a cup of coffee seems a better idea to me than standing on the sidewalk matt said what do you say williamson shrugged a gesture of surrender and stood up mrs mcgrory this is sergeant payne of homicide we have to talk privately to mr williamson olivia said when mrs mcgrory answered her knock could we use your kitchen certainly thank you very much matt said as she led them in her kitchen anything i can do to help theres a fresh pot in the mr coffee just help yourself thats very kind of you matt said i feel just terrible about this especially with the cops being outside while it was happening we dont know for sure thats what happened mrs mcgrory matt said of course thats what happened i was here wasnt i thank you very much mrs mcgrory olivia said easing her out of the kitchen and then closing the door why dont you sit down matt suggested to williamson ill get the coffee how do you take yours mr williamson black williamson said black olivia said olivia and williamson sat down at the kitchen table while matt took the glass decanter and poured coffee into ceramic mugs he walked to the table and set the mugs on it okay matt said lets get a couple of things understood between us mr williamson i dont know what happened last night when mrs mcgrory called the police and i dont care you dont fucking care williamson asked disgusted and incredulous my job is to find the person or persons who killed your sister and see that when theyre brought to trial they wont walk out of the courtroom because some legal t wasnt crossed or some legal i didnt have a dot i understand that youre unhappy with what you think happened last night what happened last night was that the fucking cops didnt do a goddamn thing to help my sister if you believe the police did something they shouldnt have or didnt do something they should have you have every right to make an official complaint fuckinga right i do and i will but i think youll agree mr williamson that right now the priority is to find out who did this thing and the sooner the better would you agree with that jesus of course i agree with that all im saying is that if those fucking cops had done what they were supposed to do last night my sister would still be alive theres one more thing mr williamson matt said your language is beginning to offend me i hope youll watch your mouth i would really rather not have you transported to homicide and placed in an interview room until you get your emotions under control williamson glared at him but didnt say anything matt opened his briefcase and took out his laptop whats that for im one of those guys who cant read his own writing matt said i take notes this way are you objecting to it if i did then ill take out a notebook and ballpoint and waste a lot of time trying to make sense of my notes when i finally have to type them up all right williamson shrugged matt turned the laptop on and began to type is it jack mr williamson john j for joseph whats your first name and badge number lassiter olivia she furnished okay mr williamson lets start with your personal data matt said residence twenty minutes later matt said i think thatll be enough for the time being mr williamson okay you know how to work a laptop williamson nodded matt slid the laptop in front of him would you take a look at that please and see if ive got it right williamson read the several pages matt had typed and then nodded his head okay matt turned the laptop off closed the cover and put it back in his briefcase when i get that printed mr williamson ill have a detectivemost likely detective lassiterbring it to you for your signature when williamson asked itll wait until tomorrow matt said i know that youre going to be busy today ill call you tomorrow to see when it will be convenient i have to tell you this williamson said when my mother hears about what happened last night this morning with the cops god im not trying to talk you out of filing a formal complaint matt said honestly im not but for what its worth from what ive heard the officers who responded to the disturbance house call were just going by the book if they hadany indication that somethinganythingwas going wrong had gone wrong in the apartment they would have taken action williamson looked at him but didnt respond directly what am i supposed to do if my mother wants to come here well right now she cant have access to the apartment not today and probably not tomorrow either tell her that jesus christ williamson said id be happy to go with you mr williamson detective lassiter said if you think it would make things any easier and id like to talk to her too that doesnt have to be right now your call it couldnt do any harm williamson said and maybe if you were there if youll give me your cellular number sergeant ill call and let you know how things went detective lassiter said matt wrote the number on a small sheet of notepaper and handed it to her she tore it in half and wrote two numbers on it i guess you have the northwest number right she asked matt nodded my cellular and apartment she said thank you matt said under other circumstances olivia my lovely i would be overjoyed that you shared your telephone numbers with me come to think of it olivia despite the circumstances i am overjoyed that you have shared your telephone numbers with me mrs mcgrory was not in her living room as they passed through but matt could hear her voice in the next room only her voice which suggested she was on the telephone he decided he had already thanked her and it would be better not to disturb her when she was on the phone when they went downstairs and through the front door he saw that the press was gathered behind the police line do not cross tape and that the moment they saw them two detectives with badges showing escorting a sofarunidentified white malevideo cameras rose with their red recording lights glowing and still camera flashbulbs went off wheres your car matt asked halfway down the street she said and pointed matt touched the arm of one of the uniforms i want to get detective lassiter and this gentleman to her car down the street and i dont want the press to get in the way no problem the uniform said raised his voice and called dick dick was a very large police officer of africanamerican heritage he and the other uniform led the way through the assembled journalists one on each side of detective lassiter and mr williamson sergeant payne brought up the rear which gave him a chance to decide that detective lassiter had a very nice muscular structure of the lower half of the rear of her body as he walked back to independence ignoring questions from the press about the identity of mr williamson he realized he didnt really have much of an idea of what he was supposed to do now he remembered something he had been taught at the marine base quantico while in the platoon leaders program reconnoiter the terrain he spent perhaps ten minutes walking around the outside of the big old house even going up the rear stairs and then into the basement he saw nothing of particular interest three when matt returned to the front of the house two uniforms were carrying a stretcher with cheryl williamsons body on it down the pathway to a thirtyfifth district wagon well i wont have to look at the sightless eyes again not that im liable to forget them when they had moved past him matt went up the stairs and into the williamson apartment what happened to that very pretty detective from northwest joe damata greeted him she went with the brother to tell the mother this is our job matt damata said there was a slight tone of reproof in his voice she calmed the brother down he liked her i cant imagine why damata said and a i thought that would make things easier with the mother the brother suggested his mother was going to blow her cork when she found out that there was a disturbance house call here and the uniforms didnt take the door and b somebody had to talk to the mother and i think she can do that as well as we could which means that we can be here your call damata said two things matt you want a look at the rear door i saw the outside from the stairs matt said as he followed damata into the kitchen and to the door i didnt see any signs of forced entry did you those scratches might be an indication that somebody pried it open joe said pointing operative word might the door was latched locked like that but if you leave the lever in the up position like that it locks automatically what do the crime lab guys say what i just told you no signs at all on the front door so we dont know if the doer broke in or whether she let him in could be either way if she knew the doer let him in matt grunted most murders are committed by people known to the victim you said two things matt said this is interesting damata said taking a plastic evidence bag from his pocket it held a digital camera it may be of courseand probably ishers but it was under the bed which is a strange place to store an expensive camera like this even stranger there are no fingerprints on it not even a smudge why dont we see what pictures are in it it doesnt work damata said his tone suggesting that matt should have known he could come up with a brilliant idea like seeing what pictures were in the camera all by himself which might be because it got knocked off the bedside table when the doer jerked the telephone out of the wall and threw it at the mirror no prints on the phone either matt asked damata held up his rubbersurgicalgloved hands im getting the idea the doer is a very careful guy he said which also suggests he knows how to get through a door without making a mess and which suggests that although they are lifting a lot of prints in hereso far theyve done both doors the bedroom and her bathroomi would be pleasantly surprised if they came up with something useful yeah matt agreed so i was just about to call you to ask if i should take the camera to the crime lab and see if there are any pictures in it as opposed to having a district car run it down there which would put a uniform in the evidence chain that too damata said i was thinking that if there are pictures in there i could get a look at them a lot quicker if i was there when the lab took them out of the camera then wait for the lab to print them the cameras been fingerprinted i told you theres nothing on it not even a smudge matt set his briefcase on the kitchen table opened it rummaged around and closed it again were in luck he said ive got the gizmo what gizmo matt walked to the door leading from the kitchen to the living room and motioned to one of the uniforms in the living room dont let anybody come in here until i tell you okay the uniform nodded and stood in the center of the doorjamb matt closed the door whos in the bedroom he asked harry making the sketch damata said a uniforms keeping people out of there too what are you doing matt went back to the kitchen table and took out his laptop then a small plastic object with a connecting cord he plugged it into the laptop then turned it on you can look at them here joe asked and store them in the laptop matt said damata handed him the evidence bag matt took the flash memory cartridge from it and saw that damata had initialed it if there were evidentiary photos in the camera a defense attorney could not raise doubts in the jurors minds that the pictures they were being shown had actually come from this camera he put the memory card into the transfer device then copied the jpg images from it to the laptops hard disk theres eight images matt said lets see what they are the first picture was obviously evidentiary it showed cheryl tied to the bed staring with horror at the camera damata went to the door and called harry slayberg matt waited until slayberg came then displayed the other seven pictures this critter is a real psychopath slayberg said softly you can see in the first one damata said that the phones still on the bedside table and both of her wristsrun the last couple back again please matt so im sureare still tied to the headboard slayberg said matt displayed the entire series of pictures again so what might have happened was that she got one wrist free slayberg said and he struggled with her damata picked up and thats when the camera got knocked under the bed or matt offered he went into the bathroom to take a leak or clean himself up and while he was in there she got the hand loose and tried to call and dudley doright came out and caught her slayberg picked up hit herprobably harder than he intendedand jerked the phone out of the wall and threw it at the mirror he was probably scared or in a rage or both damata said and didnt think that throwing the phone at the mirror was going to make a lot of noise matt picked up the camera its an expensive camera he said kodak i gave one almost like it to my sister for her birthday which triggers a couple of thoughts dudley doright is either wellheeled or he stole the camera slayberg said they are serially numbered matt said and come with a program that if it wont work or you break it you call them and they fedex you a new one overnight i think we should be able to find out who bought this with a lot of luck it will be the doer but even if he stole it he might have stolen it while doing another rape that might tell us something i dont think so matt damata said dudleys a very careful guy and i suspect smart smart enough not to take anything that could tie him to one of his escapades and the second thought is that id like to show these pictures to my sister did you just say what i thought i heard you say slayberg asked the sister at dave pekachs party damata laughed one and the same he said shes a shrink harry a very good one i didnt know slayberg said thats a thought but the book says a department shrink andor special victims not a civilian maybe that rule could be bent damata said smiling i heard dr payne call commissioner coughlin uncle denny and inspector wohl honey that was at the party matt said chuckling and subject to change but shes worked with us before harry i dont think there would be a problem what i think we should do now damata said is seek the wise guidance of the black buddha hes a white shirt they get paid to make decisions matt caused the screen of his laptop to go blank then took out his cell phone and held down the number that caused the phone to automatically dial the cell phone of lieutenant jason washington washington payne sir i was just about to call you sergeant payne yes sir where are you matthew at the scene sir stay there and make sure damata and slayberg stay there commissioner coughlin chief lowenstein captain quaire and i will be there shortly to exhort you visavis the rapid solution of that case yes sir washington turned off his cell phone nine one matt pushed the end button on his cellular washingtons on his way here he announced and so are coughlin lowenstein and quaire whats that all about damata asked matt shrugged he wants the three of us here was he in the office damata asked he didnt say then we have to go on the premise that hetheymay be two minutes away damata said jesus is coming look busy how can we best do that i dont know about you two but im going back to doing the scene slayberg said and walked out of the kitchen emperors and people like that like to be welcomed when they go someplace damata said matt why dont you and i go outside and wait they left the apartment by the rear door there was a uniform standing at the foot of the stairway and other uniforms were standing just inside the police line do not cross tape on the other side of the tape there were not only more spectators than matt expectedcheryl williamsons body had been taken away the show was overbut more than a dozen representatives of the print radio and television press he didnt see mickey ohara and wondered where he was mickey was usually the first press guy at the scene of a murder the answer to that came whenignoring questions several of the journalists called outthey walked around the end of the building to the front there behind the yellowand black police line tape were even more spectators and representatives of the press and mickey ohara was among them to make sure they didnt cross the tape two uniforms stood directly in front of the press one male one female both looking as if they had left the academy as long as two weeks ago on the inside of the tape there were a number of police officers in uniform and others with badges visible on their civilian clothing captain alex smith the thirtyfifth district commander and lieutenant lew sawyer were talking to a woman with a badge on her dress whom matt remembered after a moment to be captain helene durwinsky the commanding officer of the special victims unit and a man with a lieutenants badge hanging on his suit jacket he saw detectives domenico and ellis of special victims standing a few feet from the white shirts with several other detectives matt didnt recognize you got the word captain smith said there was no question what the word was but matt didnt know if smith was speaking to him or joe damata with no explanation sir damata replied it may have something to do withphils philly captain smith said dryly on whichaccording to my wife one of phils most devoted listenersabout fortyfive minutes ago mrs mcgrory spoke at some length about miss williamson being raped and tortured while the police stood not caring outside her door oh shit damata said i just talked to her matt said i used her kitchen to talk to the brother she didnt say anything about talking to that assphils philly phils philly was a very popular radio talk show philadelphians dissatisfied with something in the city of brotherly love could call the number and be reasonably sure both of a sympathetic ear on the part of phil donaldson and that mr donaldson would then callon the airwhoever had wronged the caller to indignantly demand an explanation an apology and immediate corrective action well she did captain smith went on my wife said that phils first call was to commissioner mariani and when commissioner mariani was not available to take the call phil called the mayor who made the mistake of taking the call three unmarked cars pulled up shortly thereafter within moments of each other television and still cameras recorded deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin and captain f x hollaran as they walked into the apartment complex ducked under the police line tape and walked up to captain smiths group smith and sawyer who were in uniform saluted the press then recorded the same outofthecarandunder thetape movement of captain henry c quaire and lieutenant jason washington and then turned their attention to chief inspector of detectives matthew lowenstein lowenstein ducked under the tape and then spoke while the cameras rolled to the two young uniformed officers standing in front of the assembled press do you know who i am lowenstein demanded firmly as flashbulbs went off and television cameras followed his movements yes sir both young officers replied in unison most of the ladies and gentlemen of the press will respect this crime scene tape lowenstein said pointing to it that onehe pointed to mickey oharawill more than likely try to sneak under it if he does use whatever force you feel is appropriate like breaking his arms and legs yes sir both young officers said earnestly in unison mickey ohara laughed with delight chief lowenstein then walked up to the group around deputy commissioner coughlin the uniformed officers saluted him i cant believe you did that coughlin said not quite able to restrain a smile what the hell was that about chief lowenstein was one of a tiny group of senior police officers who was not awed by either deputy commissioner coughlins rank or his persona possibly because they had graduated from the police academy together and had been close personal friends ever since you all looked guilty as hell lowenstein said playing right into philadelphia phils hand i decided a little levity was in order i hope mickey doesnt try to get past the tape captain hollaran said that female uniforms got her eye on him deputy commissioner coughlin followed the nod of hollarans head saw a very determined very slight very young female police officer her baton in her hands glowering at mickey ohara who outweighed her by fifty pounds coughlin had a very difficult time not laughing out loud he returned his attention to the group and settled his eyes on matt sergeant he ordered take us someplace where we can talk privately yes sir matt said will you follow me please commissioner he led the procession to the front stairs of the building and up them to cheryl williamsons apartment this was not the time he decided to take further advantage of mrs mcgrorys hospitality he led the procession into cheryl williamsons kitchen it was crowded with all of them in it this will all seem a lot less amusing if that little scene is on the six oclock news and the mayor sees it coughlin said jesus matt id rather have that on the tube lowenstein said than poor smitty here on it trying to explain the law that kept his uniforms from taking the door whenmaybe just maybethe doer was inside raping and murdering the young woman you dont think he was inside when the uniforms were here coughlin asked we dont know denny maybe he was already gone when the uniforms arrived but if smitty says that in addition to explaining the law itll look as if hes loyally covering for his men coughlin grunted if however lowenstein said some very senior officer after half an hour personally investigating the facts went down there and said the same thing you dont mean me coughlin snorted we could almost count on mickey doing a thoughtful piece for thebulletin explaining when the cops can and cannot take a door lowenstein finished and probably getting into how hard were working routinely to get this guy routinely coughlin said matt you werent in the mayors office with the commissioner and me the mayor doesnt want this solved in due time he wants it solved in time for the six oclock news whos the lead detective you joe lowenstein asked yes sir damata said what are the chances for that not good sir damata said lowenstein gestured with both his handsgive me more we have no idea who he is other than hes a fourstar psychopath damata said we have only one thing that might lead us to him which is he left his camera behind and matt payne how do you know its his camera lowenstein interrupted he took pictures of the victim sir how do you know that its a digital camera sir matt payne said i downloaded the images from the flash memory card into my laptop i dont know what the hell youre talking about youre saying you have pictures the doer took of the victim yes sir matt said and pushed his way through everybody jammed into the kitchen and brought the pictures up on the screen of the laptop my god dennis v coughlin said how long have you had these lowenstein demanded not long sir matt said i was calling lieutenant washington to tell him when he said you were all headed here and how can you locate the doer by his camera lowenstein challenged im not sure i can sir but i know that type camera it comes with a program that he stopped trying to think of a way to explain simply the kodak camera replacement program that what the camera has a serial number matt said if we can get kodak to tell us where they shipped it who the hell are you lowenstein demanded nastily interrupting him detective lassiter sir northwest matt turned and saw her standing in the doorway she looked a little stunned by lowensteins greeting and what is so important that you felt you could just barge in here like this i just left the victims mother olivia said she understands why the uniforms couldnt take the door i thought i should tell sergeant payne i heard about philadelphia phil or whatever his name ison my way back here the victims mother understands why the uniforms couldnt take the door dennis v coughlin asked and then before she could answer asked another question what were you doing with the victims mother i sent her with the victims brother when he went to tell the mother matt said matt happened to be looking at washington whose expressive eyebrows rose in surprise yousent her challenged the lieutenant from northwest detectives who had been standing with smith and others when they first had gone outside yes sir you gave one of my detectives orders not now lowenstein said sharply then turned his attention to detective lassiter youre sure the victims mother understands about the door yes sir i told her how that works olivia said she seemed to understand she even calmed the brother down about it all she wants is for us to catch the doer whats in the envelope a picture of the victim sir olivia said and handed it to him i borrowed it from the mother lowenstein looked at it then handed it to coughlin itll come in handy lowenstein said you know about the doers camera no sir you ever been on television detective lowenstein asked no sir well unless im mistaken when commissioner coughlin goes outside in a couple of minutes to tell the press why the officers couldnt take the door hes going to want you to go with him to repeat what you just said about the mother understanding could you handle that id rather not thats not what i asked lowenstein snapped yes sir i can handle that i havent said im going outside to talk to the press coughlin said oh excuse me commissioner i thought you had i just had a brilliant idea chief lowenstein coughlin said since youre so good at it ill reassign you to public relations unless we do something well all look as stupid as the mayor thinks we are lowenstein replied unabashed you got a better idea denny no coughlin said as a matter of fact i was trying to think of a way to thank you that wouldnt go directly to your head youre welcome lowenstein said can i make another suggestion how can i stop you detective lassiter has dealt very well with the mother and the brother we dont know that possible problem has gone away permanently and you want to detail her to homicide for this job so she can sit on them coughlin asked that too but what i was thinking was that you could say detective lassiter who has been detailed to homicide for this investigation has spoken to miss williamsons brother and her mother they have found no fault with police procedures isnt that right detective i dont know coughlin said doubtfully you have any problems with northwest detailing detective lassiter to homicide for this job captain quaire lowenstein asked no sir quaire said lieutenant washington no sir you lieutenant no sir the lieutenant from northwest detectives said okay done lowenstein said he gestured toward the kitchen door youre on commissioner he said coughlin exhaled audibly straightened his shoulders and marched through it captain frank hollaran and detective lassiter followed him theres a tv in the living room damata said theres achannel six live camera out there damata got it turned on and tuned to channel six by the time coughlin hollaran and lassiter appeared on the screen as they came out of the walkway between the two buildings coughlin marched to the massed press with olivia lassiter following him when he stopped just inside the crime scene tape she moved to his side there were shouted questions from a dozen reporters to which coughlin his arms folded on his stomach paid no attention whatever finally almost in confusion the questions died out im deputy commissioner coughlin he said finally i will take a few questions one at a time most of the reporters raised their hands several shouted questions coughlin pointed at one of the reporters who had raised her hand if you can get thesegentlemen to behave ill take your question one of the reporters who had been shouting a question said disgustedly oh for christs sake another voice female very clearly answered her colleague with why dont you shut the fuck up you asshole some of us have deadlines coughlin pointed to a reporter holding a microphone with achannel six live sign on it i dont want to tell you your business he said very politely but i really hope someone bleepedthat question before it got on the air that brought laughter when it died down he pointed to the reporter he had selected before commissioner whats happened here a murder coughlin said of a young woman named cheryl williamson not a rape and murder we dont know that yet the medical examiner will make that determination is it true that somebody called the cops came and then refused to enter the apartment while the murderer was inside a few minutes before two this morning miss williamsons neighbor called reporting that her mirror had fallen off the wall two patrol carsnot just oneof the thirtyfifth district responded and were here in just under four minutes they listened to what the neighbor said that she suspected that something had happened in miss williamsons apartment that had caused her mirror to fall off the wall the officers rang miss williamsons doorbell and knocked at the door they did that at both the front and rear doors and they looked for signs of a forced entry and found none there were no lights on in the apartment and they could hear no sounds they concluded there was no one in the apartment and left and left why didnt they go in the apartment because that would be against the law coughlin said without sufficient cause police have no right to break into anyones home the neighbor said you said that she thought something had happened in the apartment thats not sufficient cause if there had been any sound even any lights burning any indication of forced entry im sure they would have entered the apartment there wasnt and they didnt and how do you think her family will react to that explanation this is detective lassiter coughlin said she can answer that better than i can ive spoken to miss williamsons mother and brother olivia said they both told me they understand why the police did not break into the apartment mrs williamson said all that she wants is for the police to find whoever did this to her daughter before the same sort of thing happens to someone else and what exactly did this guy do to her at this point we dont even know it was a guy olivia said we just started the investigation commissioner may i be excused yes you can detective and i am about to excuse myself coughlin said whenever we learn more we will make it available to the press thank you hes very good at that lowenstein said in the apartment we look a lot better than we did five minutes ago everyone agreed but no one said anything lowenstein looked around and found jason washington you know oharas cell phone number yes sir i think it would be a very good idea for you to meet with him now take payne and lassiter with you yes sir as for the rest of you one or two at a time not all at once get out of here and let the homicide people do their job there were nods of understanding and a few yes sirs chief inspector of detectives lowenstein had two more thoughts if you dont mind a suggestion sergeant payne he said i think that you personally should try to run down connecting the camera with the doer yes sir and i think it might be useful if you asked dr payne to look at those pictures do you think she would be willing to do that im sure she would sir chief captain durwinsky said id like to have copies of those pictures as soon as i can have them we may be dealing with the same doer how can that be done payne all i need is access to a computer with a digital photo program and a color printer matt said weve got one at special victims durwinsky said thats not far okay lowenstein said there it is ohara special victims your sister and running down the doer via the camera got it yes sir matt said ohara first chief captain durwinsky asked yeah helene lowenstein said ohara first i would like to see at least one story in the newspapers that doesnt gleefully point out our many failures and allaround stupidity okay yes sir okay now everybody get to work lowenstein walked out of the apartment two in the hope that it wouldnt be seen michael j ohara of the philadelphia bulletin parked his buick rendezvous behind the oak lane diner at broad and old york road the rendezvous with its array of antennae was known to other members of the philadelphia press corps and some of his colleagues were even bright enough to be able to spot an unmarked car and wonder what ohara was up to with the cops mickey entered the diner and after looking around found lieutenant jason washington sergeant matt payne and that goodlooking detective whod come out of the crime scene with denny coughlin to face the press at a banquette in the rear drinking coffee he walked to them and slid in beside washington well isnt this acoincidence ohara said mind if i sit down i hoped you parked that conspicuous vehicle of yours where it will not attract the attention of the fourth estate washington asked jesus mickey said his tone suggesting that washington should have known the question was unnecessary he smiled at detective lassiter im mickey ohara yes sir i know who you are olivia said mickey shook his head sadly gave out a long sigh and turned to matt youre in luck matthew ohara said this beautythis young beautycalls me sir which means she has decided i am too old to merit her interest as obviously you are washington said then speaking with the wisdom of a senior citizen my beauty let me advise you to beware of this young man while some think of him as the wyatt earp of the main line others more accurately describe him as the casanova of center city thats not funny mick matt flared which part the wyatt earp part matt said as a matter of fact both parts one day my beauty my name is lassiter olivia said one daylassiter my beauty ohara went on not so long ago in an alley of our fair city wyatt earp here put down a very bad guy who was shooting at both of us with a i meant nothing but respect in dubbing him wyatt earp as disassociated as i am from the realities of life washington said i actually thought you would be interested in learning what has transpired at independence iknow what happened at independence a citizen called when she heard strange noises in the next apartment two uniforms responded and they all stood around chatting and not taking the door while the doer worked his wicked way on the victim what else do i need to know you know why they didntcouldnttake the door this is not at all what i expected when you called jason my oversized old pal mickey said excuse me washington said when you summoned me i expected to find you tony harris and that black kid from the roy rogersyou do recall asking if i would mind going over the whole thing from step one once again with the aforementioned thats at five oclock this afternoon thats when you said youd be free and when the kid gets off work washington said then you called again jason twenty minutes ago and asked if i was free to come here now and i said yes and i walk in here and not only do i get wyatt earp and the beauty here instead of the expected aforementioned but you ask me the really dumb question do i know why hyde and cubellis didnt take the victims door howd you know their names olivia blurted i wouldnt want this to get around my beauty but some of my friends are cops and washington asked what youve got are two nice young cops who are sick about maybe being outside doing nothing while this critter was doing what he did to the girlthats their first reaction and second they are naturally a little worried that the mayor is going to hang them out to turn in the wind i dont intend to let that happen im going to do one of my famous think pieces my working slug is a tough call but the right one thanks mick washington said thats what i was hoping to hear it would help if i knew a little about the doer or maybe what he did to her all we really know about him is that he is unquestionably a psychopath washington said isnt that a given with a rapist this guy is sick mick washington said how do you know that washington hesitated just perceptibly not for publication agreed show him the pictures matt washington ordered and added he left his camera behind matt took his laptop from his briefcase and slid it across the table you know how to work photo smart another unnecessary question the pictures are in wilifoto matt said ohara turned the laptop on and started the photo smart program this fellowis a bit odd isnt he mickey said looking at the first picture and then as he ran through the images twice added jesus h christ may i see those olivia asked no mickey said you really dont want to see them im a cop mr ohara she said of that i have no doubt my beauty ohara said as he turned the computer off and closed the lid but you are also indisputably a very nice young woman my sainted mother would never forgive me if i showed those images to a very nice young woman he slid the laptop back across the table you going to get him he asked still off the record washington asked ohara nodded all we have right now is the camera theyre serially numbered and were going to try that good luck ohara said getting to his feet this guy needs bagging and soon ill keep you posted mick washington said im counting on that ohara said he looked at olivia remember what i said about the casanova of center city my beauty oh for christs sake mickey matt said parting is such sweet sorrow ohara proclaimed and walked out of the diner we have a transportation problem washington said i rode out here with captain quaire i have to get back matt reached into his pocket and handed him the keys to his unmarked car ill ride with lassiter he said im going to have to give my car back to northwest she said you are very bright youngsters washington said im sure youll be able to sort this out he slid across the banquette and stood up and added you can have your car back latersometime after i meet with tony ohara and the kid from the roy rogers okay if i leave it at the roundhouse the keys with the uniform in the lobby fine matt said welcome to homicide detective lassiter washington said and i wouldnt worry too much about sergeant payne his lothario reputation is really far darker than the facts justify he walked away from the table after a moment olivia asked special victims im thinking matt said sometimes that takes a little time and id like to see those pictures he didnt reply ill be right back he said she watched as he walked to a pay telephone booth in the front of the diner and looked in the yellow pages telephone book he punched at the keys of his cellular for a moment then returned to the table what olivia asked watch he said and pushed the call button on his cellular phone center city photo i need to talk to someone about kodak digital cameras getting the correct number at kodak from center city photo was like pulling teeth the eastman kodak company in rochester new yorkonce matt had identified himself as sergeant payne of the philadelphia police department homicide unitwas very cooperative it would take them a little time to run the serial number downwas there a number where he could be reached their call came as olivia was pulling up before the special victims building at the frankford arsenal their records indicated that a digital camera with that serial number had been shipped as part of an order for a dozen identical cameras five months before to times square photo amp electronics west fortysecond street new york city that camera comes with an overnight fedex replacement right thats right sergeant it does and i checked to see if that program had been activated for that camera it hadnt oh shit but what did i expect that this critter was going to leave a trail for me but that sometimes happens the lady from kodak went on people sometimes dont activate the program until they have problems with the camera am i going to get lucky you dont have a phone number of times square photo by any chance do you she gave it to him thank you very much sergeant payne said i really appreciate your cooperation the two people at times square photo with whom sergeant payne spoke on his cellular were not nearly so cooperative the first person a male spoke only a few words of english and the second a female he finally managed to get on the line had only a few more words of english than did her male colleague these were sufficient however to make sergeant payne understand that she couldnt do nothing like consult her records of sale for just anybody that she was trying to run a business for christs sake and at that moment she had customers she had to take care of for christs sake did you understand me when i said this is sergeant payne of the homicide unit of the philadelphia police department no shit good for you good luck have a nice day and at that point she hung up sonofabitch matt said then to olivia sorry i have heard the expression before detective lassiter said matt held the key that automatically dialed the office of amelia s payne md he was informed that dr payne was with a patient this is sergeant payne this is official police business get her on the phone please dr payne came on the line thirty seconds later matt this had better really be police business it is im working a murder not the one where the cops stood around outside her apartment shooting the breeze while the girl was murdered and raped i didnt know you listened to philadelphia phil amy my secretary does and itsphils philly thats not exactly the way it happened amy of course not she said sarcastically are you scrapping with peter again or is there some other reason youre being such a bitch what do you want matthew the doer left his digital camera at the scene with pictures of the act chief lowenstein wants you to look at them just chief lowenstein me too amy okay okay bring them by ill take a look im about to print them ill be there in thirty thirtyfive minutes okay amy said and hung up three the special victims unit did not have a color printer the quality of the one mickey ohara had had thebulletin buy for him it was slow there were eight images and matt made what he quickly realized was an error when he pushed the button that caused the printer to make three prints of each image he needed a set for amy of course and the price of using their printer was a set for special victims and a third set was necessary for jason washington both for his edification and to make sure there was no screwup when the forensics lab finally got the flash memory card and made the official prints the result of this was that it took thirtysix minutes for the printer to do the job and as they came slowly out of the printer detectives lassiter and domenico had the opportunity to take good long looks at all of them matt didnt give a damn about domenico but he was made uneasy by detective lassiters reaction her face made it evident that she was trying and failing to examine the photographs with calm professionalism when they were finally outside in detective lassiters more than a little beatup unmarked car she looked at him for orders were a little pressed for timewhat do i call you olivia all right fine sergeant were a little pressed for time olivia i think you should meet my sister youll probably have to see her again so well go to the university first then since washington grabbed my car well go to my place so i can pick up my car im going to new york then i want you to drop a set of pictures off at homicide if lieutenant washington is thereor captain quairegive them to one of them if not seal the envelope and give it to the man on the wheel for washington then i think youd better go call on the williamsons again get their statements what do i do about getting this car back to northwest detectives well deal with that later matt said the priorities right now i think are to see if i can run this critter down through the camera store and to keep the williamsons happy happy she asked sarcastically you know what i mean four well what did you think of my sister matt asked when they were back in the unmarked car outside the university of pennsylvania hospital shes nice olivia said and shes a professor of psychiatry too young you mean matt asked and olivia nodded she got her md at twentyfour i wouldnt want you to quote me but shes smart as hell and she really can get into the minds of psychopaths this isnt the first time shes helped shell probably give us a pretty good picture of how this guy thinks where to now olivia asked the delaware valley cancer society building south rittenhouse square what are we going to do there i live there matt said and waited for her curiosity to overwhelm him it didnt when she pulled to the curb in front of the cancer society building matt said youve got my cellular number and youve got mine olivia said see you later matt said right olivia said he got the porsche out of the basement garage and headed for new york when he was out of center city trafficon i northhe slipped his cellular into a dashmounted rack which permitted handsoff operation and punched in joe damatas number damata payne im on my way to new york unless you need me there theres not much you can do here damata said the crime lab folks are just about finished slaybergs done the scene we got statements from both mcgrorys what id like to do is get the williamsons statements i got a statement from the brother matt said then just the mother then olivias on her way to the roundhouse to deliver the pictures to washington hes not there damata interrupted he called to say if i needed him if we needed him hes going to take another look at the roy rogers hes going to meet with ohara harris and the black kid witness at five oclock to start all over again so he told me olivias going from the roundhouse to see the williamsons olivia is is she fuck you joe i think thats what they call verbal abuse of a subordinate sergeant youll be hearing from the fop then fuck you twice joe matt said damata laughed you have the williamson mothers address matt asked no but i probably can get it from detective lassiter ive got her cell number you need it yeah matt gave it to him then said tell her that i said i want her to introduce you to the williamsons as the lead detective on the case maybe senior homicide investigator would be better there was a pause while damata considered that lassiters got them calmed down and we want to show them how hard were working right yeah make sense to you yeah thatphilly phil asshole business is still dangerous my wife called and asked me what the hell was wrong with the uniforms they didnt take the door well lets keep the williamsons stroked consider it done damata said if anything comes up ill call you same here that digital cameras a long shot matt but lets hope we get lucky amen brother five sergeant zachary hobbs a stocky ruddyfaced fortyfouryear old was holding down the desk in homicide when detective lassiter walked through the outer door detective kenneth j summers who should have been working the desk was meeting a lengthy call of nature which he blamed on something he must have eaten at the church supper of st pauls lutheran church the previous evening can i help you hobbs asked he was not immune to detective lassiters looks lieutenant washington im sorry hes not here captain quaire hes not here either can i do something for you would you give whichever of them comes in first this envelope please she handed it to him sure he weighed it in his hands what is it its from sergeant payne olivia said hobbs looked at her waiting for her to go on after a moments hesitation she did its photographs of the victim in the independence street job sergeant hobbs immediately tore the envelope open and looked at the eight photographs where the hell did payne get these hobbs asked the doer forgot his digital camera at the scene sergeant payne downloaded the images to his laptop and special victims printed them for us next question who are you detective how did you get them my name is lassiter olivia said northwest ive been detailed to homicide sergeant payne told me to bring them here detailed by who chief lowenstein olivia said well so long as youre with us detective youre certainly going to bring a little class to the premises hobbs said wheres the camera detective damata has it olivia said okay as soon as either the boss or the black buddha comes in ill see they get these they may want to talk to you ill give you my cell phone number she said and did where will you be im going to take the victims mothers statement she said sergeant payne told you to yes he did he looked at her a moment then said welcome welcome would you be offended if i said youre the bestlooking detective to come in here in my memory not at all olivia said and smiled at him thanks my pleasure hobbs said see you around in the best of all possible worlds olivia thought as she left homicide and the roundhouse and got in her unmarked car the encounter between herself and sergeant hobbs of homicide would have been entirely professional and genderneutral but the philadelphia police department was not the best of all possible worlds and sergeant hobbs had made it clear that he found her to be an attractive member of the female gender so what was wrong with that he wondered who the hell i was which was natural and he really wondered which was even more natural who haddetailed me even temporarily to homicide once i told him lowenstein that was the end of it it really couldnt have gone any better when olivia lassiter then just shy of her twentyfirst birthday and a junior at temple university majoring in mass market communications had told her parents that she had taken and passed the entrance application for the philadelphia police department and that she intended to drop out of college to enter the police academy their reaction had been the opposite of unbridled joy her father a midlevel executive with an insurance company had spoken his mind youre crazy you have gone over the edge you should be locked up for your own protection her mother a buyer for john wanamaker amp company had said more or less the same thing then tried tears approaching hysteria and said she was throwing her life and the advantages daddy and i have given to you away olivia had dropped out of temple and entered the police academy and graduated and did a year working a van in the ninth district and then a second year in the central city business district truth to tell she hadnt liked either job and there had been a strong temptation to accept her fathers offer to go back to college get her degree and make something of herself but that would have been admitting shed made a mistake and she hadnt been quite prepared to do that she had been on the job just over a year when a detectives examination was announced she took it and passed it ranking just high enough to get promotedamong the last few promoted from that listeighteen months later that had put her in northwest detectives from the first day shed liked being a detective even though she was aware she was conducting a lot of investigationsof recovered stolen automobiles in particularthat none of her new colleagues on the squad wanted to do it took her several years to pay off her car note and the furniture note but that happened too about the time she realized she was no longer regarded by the squad as the rookie broad but as one of them she knew that she was not very popular with some of the wives and girlfriends of the guys on the squadthey seemed to suspect that the first order of business every day was to jump detective lassiters bonesbut there was nothing she could do about that even if it was unfair as hell and untrue she had no interest that way in any of the guys she had taken the sergeants exam placing so low on the list that her chances of promotion were about as good as those of her being taken bodily into heaven her ego had been a little damagedshe hadnt thought she would dothat badlybut it really hadnt bothered her she liked the squad she liked northwest detectives and a promotion would have meant not only leaving the detective bureau but almost certainly being put back in uniform since she had been on the job she had compiled a long list of uniform sergeants jobs she really would have hated the bottom line there was that she liked what she was doing and had no reason to feel sorry for herself she had wondered idly about going someplace else as a detective and had snooped around special victims and major crimes and intelligence enough to know that she was better off with northwest detectives the district attorneys squad was a possibility to think of and so was special operations and for that matter even homicide olivia thought of herself as a realist and understood that her chances of getting assigned to homicideeven in ten yearswere practically nonexistent but now this had been dumped in her lap this detail however long it lastedto homicide there was no question at all that opportunity had knocked but there was a big question about how to deal with it if she played it right there was a chanceslim but a chancethat it would help her get into homicide maybe not now but later and if she screwed up somehow in any way she knew she could kiss any chances of getting into homicide farewell forever olivia had just turned onto north broad street when her cell phone buzzed she fumbled in her purse for it and finally pushed answer lassiter damata you know who i am yeah sure i want you to start thinking of me as the senior homicide investigator on this case damata said not just some ordinary homicide schmuck okay you want to tell me why because when i told our beloved leader sergeant payne that i wanted to go with you to take the williamson mothers statement he said sure but tell her to introduce you as the senior homicide investigator on the case he say why our orders detective lassiter are to keep the williamsons stroked i think its a good idea our leader is as smart as a whip okay whatever you say im on north broad six blocks from city hall en route to mother williamsons you need the address yeah rockland its just south of roosevelt boulevard i know where it is ill meet you there on the street either i wait or you wait okay payne wants us together see you there olivia pushed the end button and dropped the phone back into her purse sergeant matthew payne she thought was very likely going to cause some sort of problems for her visavis making the best of her opportunity to try to get into homicide she had known who detective payne was before he walked into cheryl williamsons living room she had seen him on television when there had been the shooting in doylestown covered with that poor girls blood tears running down his cheeks it had made her cry and purely as a matter of female curiosity when she finally got her hands on the new sergeants list she had looked to see who had scored well detective payne of special operations had scored number one the first time she had seen him in the flesh was when he walked into cheryl williamsons living room the first thing shed thought was that he was even better looking than hed looked on television and the second thing waschrist not now i have never before been physically attracted to anyone on the job not now please god and not a hotshot like this one the one thing i could do for sure that would screw up my chances of getting into homicide would be for me to get involved with their fairhaired boy and i will not not not ten one matt more or less obeyed the speed limits crossing new jersey it was a temptation not to but he was driving the porsche and from painful experience he had come to believe that so far as the new jersey state police were concerned ticketing a porsche often was the high point of their tour giving them great joy and satisfaction as he came out of the lincoln tunnel he looked at his watch it was half past two which explained why his stomach was telling him he was hungry he turned uptown and ten minutes later turned onto west fortysecond street toward times square just before he got there he saw times square photo now the question was finding someplace to park someplace where the parking attendants might not find great joy and satisfaction in seeing how deeply they could scratch the glistening silver paint of a porsche he moved through the crowded streets and a few minutes later found himself entering times square again from the north the only parking places he had found had sorry full signs in front of them he noticed at first idly and then with great interest an automobilea somewhat battered black ford crown victoriaparked on the right curb between fortythird and fortyfourth streets right beside a sign reading no parking no stopping at any time there were several antennae mounted on it and it rode on black heavyduty tires the fenders were battered and there were no wheel covers if thats not an unmarked car my name is not sherlock holmes matt pulled the porsche to the curb in front of the ford then backed up until their bumpers almost touched the fords horn blew imperiously and the driver put his arm out the window and gestured for him to move on matt instead got out of the car now he could see the driver and the man sitting beside him the driver was heavyset and looked to be in his forties his ample abdomen held his tweed sports coat apart and strained the buttons of his shirt the man beside him was younger he was wearing a leather jacket and a black turtleneck sweater matt thought he was in his midtwenties matt found his leather wallet with the badge and photo id and took it out he decided that standing on the sidewalk and speaking to the young man in the passenger seat would be safer than speaking to the driver and went to that side of the car the other choice would most likely have seen him rolled through times square under the wheels of a bus the young man rolled the window down im sergeant payne and get in the older man said pointing to the rear seat matt got in let me see that the older man said and matt handed him his badge and photo id what can we do for you sergeant payne the older man said and then passed the id to the younger one im on the job working a homicide matt said youre not trying to tell me theykill people in the city of brotherly love the younger one said the older one chuckled the doer left his camera at the scene matt said kodak tells me they shipped it to times square photo take the next right its right around the corner the older one said i called them before i came here matt said they spoke just enough english to make it clear they are not very cooperative welcome to new york the younger one said only a few of us speak english and even fewer are cooperative the older one chuckled the doer by doer you mean the suspected perpetrator the younger one interrupted right hes a real sicko by which you mean hes psychiatrically challenged right the younger one asked has difficulty accepting the common concept of right and wrong as themodus operandi for his life yeah you could put it that way matt said i want to get this guy before he does it to another young woman a noble thought the young one said how could we be of assistance it would help me a hell of a lot if one of you would go into the store with me i really need to have a look at their sales records presumably sergeant the young one said this fishing expedition of yours has been cleared by the new york police departments office of interagency cooperation oh shit no i havent cleared anything with anybody i just got in my car and drove here this happened early today and right now this is our best lead i just acted on my urge the young man considered this a moment charley take us out of service for ten minutes im going to take a little walk with sergeant payne right lieutenant the older one said reaching for an underthedash microphone lieutenant the young one got out of the passenger seat then opened the rear door and motioned matt out then he walked to the porsche and got in matt carefully watched the traffic and then quickly got behind the wheel do all the sergeants in philadelphia get wheels like this the young man asked before matt could reply he ordered two blocks down and make a right matt got into the flow of traffic i usually say its something we took away from the drug industry matt said but the truth is its mine they must pay better one way or another in philadelphia the young man said my lieutenant borrowed my brandnew unmarked car matt said so i drove this instead of taking the train if one of my sergeants had a brandnew unmarked id do the same the young man said theres a parking garage on the left okay that makes you a lieutenant whats a lieutenant doing sitting in an unmarked in the middle of times square it says full some of us can read the young man said although i will admit we do have a number of people on the job who are literacychallenged matt pulled into the parking lot nose to nose with a mercedes there was no room he was blocking half the sidewalk the attendant came out waving his hands no he was wearing a beard and a turban i think sign language is going to be necessary the young lieutenant said and not because this fellow isaurally challenged he got out of the porsche took his badge from his pocket and held it two inches from the bearded mans face then he signaled with arm gestures that the attendant was to move the mercedes elsewhere so the porsche could take its space the attendant waved his arms excitedly for a few moments but then got into the mercedes the lieutenant signaled like a traffic officer for matt to back the porsche up far enough to give the mercedes room to pass the mercedes went around him onto the street and the lieutenant signaled for matt to pull in then he stood on the sidewalk waiting for matt to get out of the car they walked back up broadway to west fortysecond street and into times square photo three peopletwo of them bearded and in turbans the third a stout young woman whose flowing anklelength dress and gaudily painted wooden bead jewelry made matt think of gypsiesdescended smiling broadly on them what they lacked in language skills they made up for with enthusiasm offering matt and the lieutenant cameras tape recorders and other items for sale cheap get whatshisname the lieutenant ordered the three looked at him without comprehension get whatshisname the lieutenant ordered considerably louder still no comprehension showed on the faces of the trio the lieutenant put his fingers in his mouth and whistled shrilly almost immediately another man in a neat turban and immaculately trimmed beard appeared his suit and shirt were wellfitting and he also wore a red vest with embroidered ducks in flight pattern he hurried up to them lieutenant lacey he said in britishaccented english what a pleasant surprise how may i be of service to you or this gentleman tell him lieutenant lacey said to matt five months ago you received a shipment of a dozen cameras from kodak matt began we receive shipments from kodak virtually weekly the man said they make a splendid product and because we sell so many of them we are in a position to offer them at the lowest possible prices and in your case of course as a friend of lieutenant lacey there will be a substantial additional discount permit me to show you i dont want to buy a camera i want to know who you sold it to matt said aware that lieutenant lacey was smiling at him i will make you an offer you cannot refuse i have the serial number matt said i gather this is an official visit lieutenant lacey the man asked lacey nodded sergeant payne needs to know to whom you sold a particular camera we are of course willingill say eagerto cooperate with the police in every way is there a problem lieutenant lacey asked the man looked at matt you say the camera was shipped to us five months ago matt nodded you know the model goddamn it i dont its a rather expensive digital matt said that only narrows the field down a smidgen i fear the man said if i saw one id know it that sort of item is updated as often as the sun rises the man said i rather doubt if it would still be in our inventory you did say you have the serial number yes i do then it will be a simple matter to go through our sales records and find it we assiduously record the serial numbers of all our better merchandise then we have no problem here lieutenant lacey asked none whatever i am delighted to be of service i will return momentarily he headed for the back of the store good luck sergeant lacey said thanks very much lieutenant matt said no thanks are required i wasnt in here with you i never ever saw you i would never act in a case like this without the full authorityin writingof the new york police departments office of interagency cooperation to do so he turned and walked out the door the turbaned man who spoke the queens english returned to where matt stood a few minutes later trailed by two turbaned men each of whom held two large cardboard boxes in his arms he gestured rather imperiously for the men to place the boxes on a glass display case the sales records are filed sergeant to comply with irs requirements sequentially or perhaps i should say chronologically i have brought you the records for the last six months if there is anything else i can do for you please do not hesitate to ask not quite an hour and a half later sergeant payne found the sales slip he was looking for near the top of the left stack of sales slips in box three the sales slips had been stored in the manner in which they had come out of the sales registry machinesthat is to say fanfolded each stack contained sales slips they had been placed in the storage boxes eight stacks high six stacks to a box by the time matt found what he was looking for his feet hurt from standing his stomach was in audible protest for being unfed and his eyes watered and what he found wasnt much a kodak digital science dc serial number ekk had been sold for cash three and a half months previously to mr h ford lincoln lane detroit michigan mr fords signature at the bottom acknowledging receipt of the camera in good working condition was barely legible he then had a very hard time making the previously charming englishspeaking proprietor understand that he would like at the very least a photocopy of the sales slip and would really like to have the sales slip itself then he had an inspiration what i really would like to have are several digital images of you first in the act of separating that sales slip from the fanfold matt said and then another of you initialing the sales slip and you have a camera no but i thought if i bought one how interesting i just happen to have a splendid latestmodel stateoftheart kodaka dc with fastcharge lithium batteriesthat i could let you have at a substantial discount the pictures you understand would be useless to me unless i had the actual sales slip itself you do have a credit card of course of course you do and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to cooperate with the police in this investigation a total of and fifteen minutes later matt put a ziploc bag in his briefcase it held the original sales slip and a flash memory card holding images of the proprietor tearing the sales slip free from the others in the fanfold stack initialing the sales slip of himself initialing the sales slip of himself and the proprietor each holding a corner of the sales slip and a final shot of himself putting the sales slip in the ziploc bag counsel for the defense he thought would considering the pictures have a hard time raising doubt in the minds of a jury that he had acquired the real sales slip and he could give the kodak dc with fastcharge lithium batteries to his mother she had expressed admiration for the camera he had given amy and it seemed only just that his mother get one that cost twice as much as amys now all he had to do was find mr h ford of lincoln lane detroit michigan he walked back down through times square to the parking lot and got into the porsche on his cellular telephone he established contact with a detroit directory assistance operator who regretted to inform him they had no listing for a mr h ford at lincoln lane in detroit matt had been prepared to be disappointed have you got a special listing for the homicide bureau maybe homicide unit something like that of the detroit police department just the basic police department number give me that please homicide sergeant whaley sergeant my name is payne im a sergeant in homicide in philadelphia what can we do for philadelphia im working a job where the doer left his camera at the scene i traced it to the store where it was sold according to their records it was sold to a mr h ford of lincoln road in detroit and youre beginning to suspect there is maybe something a little fishy about the name and address right to tell you the truth yes i am okay so maybe he once went to detroit matt said have you got any open cases of murder or rape or murderrape where the doer tied the victim to a bed and then cut the victims clothes off with a large knife nice fellow huh that all you got this happened last night you do know about the ncic in philadelphia we have inside plumbing and everything matt said and i dont mean to in any way undermine your faith in the fbi but sometimes we suspect they dont give us everything out of their databases including stuff weve put in i cant think of any job like that offhand sergeant whaley said but ill ask around you said your name was payne matt spelled it for him and gave him jason washingtons unlisted private number in the roundhouse ill ask around and if i turn up anything ill give you a call thank you very much matt said he pushed the end button put the key in the ignition and started to drive out of the parking lot the attendant jumped in front of the car waving his arms it was necessary for matt to dig out the credit card again and sign a sales slip for worth of parking before he could put the porsche in gear and head downtown toward the lincoln tunnel he looked at his watch it was quarter past five when he came out of the new jersey exit of the lincoln tunnel it looked very familiar and he wondered why he rarely went to new york city and when he did he almost never drove preferring the metroliner a really comfortable train on which one did not have to keep one eye open for the new jersey state police for being in violation of speeding andor drinking laws it was a moment before he understood he saw it at least once a week on television the opening shot onthe sopranos was from the inside of new jersey mob boss tony sopranos gmc suburban as he came out of the tunnel another segment of the tv show came to his mind a new jersey detective on the pad from the mob got caught at it and jumped off a bridge that made him think of captain patrick cassidy whose sudden affluenceincluding his new suburbanhe had found to be completely legitimate if it had gone the other way would cassidy have taken a dive off the benjamin franklin bridge and would i have been at least tangentially responsible his reverie was interrupted by the tinkling of his cell phone payne where are you matthew lieutenant jason washingtons deep rich voice demanded i just came out of the lincoln tunnel on my way back and what developed in new york the camera was sold to an h ford of lincoln road in detroit matt said well one never knows there is a credible legend that jack the ripper was the kings brother so i have heard ive got the original sales slip with a signature on it in a ziploc how did you get that i explained how important it was to the proprietor and then bought a ninehundreddollar camera after which he gave it to me theres a slim chance if he signed it we might get a print yeah shit i didnt even think about that oh jesus if there are prints on there theyll be the proprietors and mine theres no excuse for such stupidity youre going to have to come to the office anyway to get a property receipt for the sales slip so ill leave the keys to your car in the fop mug on my desk washington said you mean im getting it back you had doubts im your lieutenant matthew you can trust me washington said and added im driving marthas car less because of spousal generosity than because she wanted to ensure my presence at a cultural event at the fine arts at seventhirty have fun if fortune smiles upon me i may even be afforded the privilege of physical proximity to our beloved mayor matt chuckled i am at the moment en route to meet with tony mickey and the witness from the roy rogers washington went on if there are developments call me between now and seventhirty yes sir otherwise after ten call me to report your progress or lack thereof but do not call me while i am at the fine arts unless what you have to say is really important yes sir and drive carefully always adhering to the posted speed limits of the garden state matthew yes sir the line went dead two detective tony harris amal al zaid and michael j ohara were sitting in the rearmost banquette of the roy rogers restaurant at broad and snyder streets when amal saw an automobile pull to the curb outside get those wheels he blurted in something close to awe thats an sl whats an sl tony harris asked looking you mean the mercedes v engine amal al zaid said six liters a large black man in a dinner jacket got out of the mercedes sl v tony asked no shit whats one of those worth v amal al zaid confirmed thats worth at least a hundred thousand bucks jesus tony said more like a hundred and a quarter kid mickey ohara said well i guess thats his comingout present to himself excuse me amal al zaid asked what did he get tony ten to fifteen mickey asked tony harris shrugged or was it fifteen to twenty mickey mused well whatever hes out obviously who said crime doesnt pay tony harris raised his eyebrows but said nothing amal al zaid nearly turned around on the banquette to follow the guy in the tuxedo who had gotten out of the mercedesbenz sl it looks like hes coming in here amal al zaid said why would a heavy hitter hood like that come in a dump like this ohara asked rhetorically lieutenant jason washington walked through the restaurant slid onto the banquette seat beside ohara quickly shook hands with ohara and harris and then smiled cordially at amal al zaid thank you for coming he said i really appreciate your time amal al zaid said nothing im lieutenant washington jason said oozing charm he had told tony harris to ask the witness to meet them in the roy rogers in the belief he would be more comfortable there than he would have been for example in the homicide unit in the roundhouse amal al zaid said nothing actually im detective harrisstonyssupervisor youre a cop amal al zaid asked incredulously i realize that dressed like thisim going to sort of a party with my wife he paused and then asked what did mr ohara tell you about me he said you just got out amal al zaid said actually sir tony harris said the phrases mr ohara used were fifteen to twenty and heavy hitter hood washington came out with his badge and photo id and showed it to amal al zaid mr ohara is an old friend he said despite a wellearned reputation for a really weird sense of humor im weird ohara asked youre the first man in recorded history to walk into a roy rogers in a waiter suit its not a waiter suit you ignoramus it looks like a waiter suit to me mickey said what about youdoublea zee amal al zaid giggled and nodded his head in agreement are you going to take our order or is there something else doublea zee and i can do for the cops mickey asked amal al zaid giggled again do you mind if he calls you that washington asked amal al zaid shook his head no can i call you that sure thank you washington said okay doublea zee let me tell you where we are in finding the people who murdered mrs martinez and officer charlton he paused amal al zaid looked at him expectantly just about nowhere washington said finally how come amal al zaid asked washington shrugged weve doneand are still doingeverything we can think of were going to get them eventually but the sooner we do the sooner we can get them off the streets the sooner they wont be able to do the same sort of thing again we dont want any more people to die amal al zaid nodded his understanding an investigation is something like taking an automobile trip washington said you can make a wrong turn and wind up in hoboken when you really want to be in harrisburg im beginning to suspect that weve made a wrong turn early on and this is what this is all about what we have here where this trip began are the only two witnesses who seem to know what theyre talking about the only two who kept their cool in terrifying circumstances i was scared shitless amal al zaid corrected him make that two of us ohara said amal al zaid looked at him with gratitude who kept their cool in terrifying circumstances washington repeated the proof of which doublea zee is your behavior in this from the beginning and mr oharas attempt to take a photograph when they came out of the restaurant attempts the right word mickey said all i got is an artsy fartsy silhouette washington ignored the comment so what were going to do now he went on is start from the beginning once again to see where we took the wrong turn were going to do this very slowly to see where what you saw agrees with what mickey saw or where it disagrees detective harrishe pointed to a huge salesmans case on the banquette seat beside harrishas brought with him records and reports that he and others have compiled that he thinks will be useful were going to see if what you and mickey saw agrees or disagrees with what other people saw or thought they saw and if it disagrees how it disagrees you still with me doublea zee yeah i got it if either you or mickey thinks of somethinganything or if you have a question while were doing this speak up ill do the same okay ohara and amal al zaid nodded their understanding lets get some more coffee washington said waving for the attention of the shift manager who was hovering nearby to see what he could see and then tony can begin tony harris took a sheaf of paper from the salesmans case took off a paper clip and divided it into four this is the chronology as i understand it he said as he slid copies to washington ohara and amal al zaid we know for sure that mrs martinez called at eleventwenty pm we have that from police radio and we know that at eleventwentyone police radio dispatched officer charlton so i sort of guessed the time of the events before that he waited until the shift manager had delivered a tray with coffee if i getany of these details wrong doublea zee even if it doesnt seem important harris said speak up same for you mickey both nodded again okay sequence of events harris said doublea zee was standing therehe pointedmopping the floor when he saw the doers come into the restaurant how long had you been there doublea zee when they came in a couple of minutes a couple is two maybe several i keep the mop bucket right inside the kitchen door amal al zaid said what happened was when i cleaned the table this table harris interrupted yeah i see that the people whod left had knocked a cup of coffeewhat was left of oneon the floor so i went in the kitchen got the mop and bucket and come back it wasnt a big spill but it was right in front of the kitchen door the one on the left harris interrupted yeah the out one they come through with full trays and they couldnt see the spill i understand harris said so i figured i better clean it up quick and i did and youd been there a couple like two minutes and the doers came in right why did you notice doublea zee washington asked excuse me you were mopping the floor paying attention to doing that why did you notice these two amal al zaid thought that over carefully before replying i looked at the clock over the door they was standing under it and why did you pay attention to them washington asked softly i could tell they was bad news amal al zaid said how the way they was standing looking around nervous you know and the i dunno i just didnt like the look of them okay so then what happened then they split up the one stayed in front and the short fat guy came toward the back toward here that was funny you had finished mopping the spill by then harris asked yeah right so i pushed the bucket back into the kitchen and then i looked through the window and saw the window in the right door the in door harris asked pointing yeah amal al zaid said and i saw him take off his shade his glasses harris interrupted doublea zee i dont remember you saying anything before about him wearing glasses not glasses hisshade when he saw the lack of understanding on harriss face amal al zaid explained patiently almost tolerantly you know like a baseball cap without a top oh harris said understanding the shade part was in the back amal al zaid went on he pointed at his neck i guess it got in his way how was that washington asked softly the wall amal al zaid said he was sitting where you are that cushion is against the wall he pointed i guess when he sat down his shade bumped into the wall anyway he took it off okay harris said im a little dense then what happened tony would you hand me mickeys pictures washington asked any particular one better let me have all of them i thought amal al zaid said the last time youtold me he took only one picture of these guys there was only one image doublea zee washington explained but they made a number of different prints trying to see if they could come up with something useful you know they blew up different parts of the picture oh yeah amal al zaid said i tried that myself ohara said and got nowhere what are you looking for jason harris asked i want to see if this fellow left the scene wearing his shade washington said maybe mickeys pictures will at least show that tony harris rummaged through the salesmans case and came out with a manila envelope stuffed with prints there were in all about twenty prints of the one digital image mickey ohara had made as he walked up to the roy rogers restaurant most were eight by ten inches and most of them concentrated on the heads and shoulders of the doers although the process had failed to overcome the bad quality and bring out more details than in the original print washington began to examine each print carefully after looking at perhaps ten of them he set one aside you got something mickey asked washington didnt reply after a moment mickey took the pictures washington was finished with and started looking at them as he finished the first one he slid it across the table to amal al zaid who looked at it and slid it to harris when washington finished he had set two more prints aside he slid the rest to mickey then patiently waited until they were all through before handing mickey the three prints he had set aside so far as i can determine from these washington said neither of these gentlemen was wearing anything on his cranium as they left the scene i dont think a jury would fall in love with these mickey said but i do see silhouetted heads and there aint nothing on either of them washington again waited until both amal al zaid and tony harris had examined all three prints so what amal al zaid asked this poses the question doublea zee washington said if this fellow came into the restaurant wearing a shade where is it now harris went back into the salesmans case he came out with a typewritten list here it is he said on the unclaimed property list number fifteen one black sun visor make unknown gray cottoncovered visor plastic headband they found it under the table so far as prints are concerned one partially smudged print possibly index finger on rear of headband that wont be enough will it ohara asked oh ye of little faith washington said he took out his cellular telephone and pushed an autodial key has captain quaire gone for the day he asked and then a moment later would you switch me to him please there was a brief pause lieutenant washington sir he said with a request there was another pause on the list of unclaimed property found in the roy rogers as item fifteen there is one black sun visor make unknown gray cottoncovered visor plastic headband we have reason to believe it was left behind by one of the doers the lab reports one partially smudged print possibly index finger i would like to inspire them to greater effort this might be possible if you took the item down there personally sir there was another brief pause thank you very much and may i suggest that you tell them i will be in later tonight to check on their progress pause thanks henry its all that we have right now he pushed the end key and turned to amal al zaid doublea zee i think were at the point where the doer took off his shade what happened next three at twenty after six just as he turned onto i south matts cellular rang payne sergeant this is lassiter i have a surfeit of bad news detective lassiter with that caveat you may proceed he thought he heard her giggle and found it charming no bad news i just left the williamsons and everythings under control their minister is there i dont think shes going to change her mind about the uniforms being right in not taking the door and im going back in the morningshe asked me to you get a gold star to take home to mommy detective lassiter matt said sergeant she said a tone of exasperation in her voice northwest wants their car back thats one thing the second thing is mrs williamson told me cheryl used to hang out in a bar called halligans pub id like a look but thought id better check with you first do they serve food in halligans pub i dont know i suppose so matt looked at his watch ill meet you at northwest in twentyfive thirty minutes he said you can give them their car back where is this halligans pub in flourtown okay then we will go together to halligans pub and after that well see washington called i can pick up my car at the roundhouse fine she said anything else call joe damata and tell him were going to check out the saloon right a uniform sergeant put out his hand to stop the silver porsche as it rolled into the police vehicles only parking lot at the thirtyfifth district building except for a few rooms used by the inspector for the north police division northwest detectives occupied most of the second floor of the building the driver of the porsche rolled down the window i think itll be all right officer he said im just here to pick up my date he pointed toward detective olivia lassiter who was leaning against the wall by the entrance the uniform sergeant whistled shrilly attracting detective lassiters attention you know this guy lassiter she looked and then nodded yeah she walked to the porsche next time find some other place to park the sergeant said yes sir matt said olivia got in the porsche where the hell did he get this car a porsche on a detectives pay have a good time lassiter the sergeant said matt grinned but didnt say anything as he turned the porsche around what was that all about have a good time olivia asked matt shrugged what did you say to him olivia challenged nothing matt said the hell you didnt youre really a smartass you get a gold star for mommy jesus did you get anything from the williamsons besides the name of this saloon matt asked the names of half a dozen guys cheryl dated she said and of a couple of her girlfriends youll have to give them to joe i already did where exactly is this saloon its called halligans pub at bethlehem pike and college avenue in flourtown ive been there sort of a neighborhood bar for the young and unattached spend a lot of time in places like that do you matt asked innocently looking for a little action you sonofabitch she glared at him but said nothing if he thinks im looking for action and so much as lays a hand on my hand ill knock him into next week hey im kidding matt said i havent been amused olivia snapped look this is my first time matt said first time for what working with a female detective you mean yeah or at least a goodlooking one can we keep this professional i worked a couple of jobs with an intelligence detective a female matt said but she was old enough to be my mother we got to be friends so i asked herwe were having a couple of drinkshow i should behave with a younger female cop and she said treat her like you would treat any other cop thats what i was doing making a little joke why do i believe him what kind of a little joke were you making with sergeant pinski the uniform in the parking lot yeah what did you say to him i told him i was just picking up my date you thought that was funny he believed it and my other choice was to tell him i was on the job and show him my badge thirty minutes later every uniform in the thirtyfifth and all your pals in northwest detectives would have heard about the homicide sergeant driving a porsche picking up northwests goodlooking detective lassiter hes right thats exactly what would have happened where did you get this car anyway when i finished college it was my graduation present it looks brandnew its five years old i take pretty good care of it its beautiful she said in genuine appreciation that was dumb whats the matter with me theyre nice matt said look lets spell this out i was not making a pass at you i will not make a pass at you i just got promoted and i just transferred to homicide the last thing i want is for somebody to say payne walked in hung up his hat and started hitting on lassiter thats the truth okay just so we understand each other so what were you doing in halligans pub looking for a little action you sonofabitch olivia said but she laughed and they found themselves looking at each other and both looked quickly away what can i get you the bartender at halligans pub asked when they had taken stools at the bar i dont know about mother but i would like a famous grouse on the rocks and a menu you want to eat at the bar the bartender asked i want to talk to you and youre here matt said and what for you honey the bartender asked i will not ask what a famous whatever is the same please olivia said youve been in here before right indeed she has matt said mother tells me this is where the action is presumably there will be a shills fee for her the bartender chuckled then turned to make their drinks he put them on the bar and then laid two plastic covered menus on it olivia picked up her glass and sipped it scotch probably one of those very chic very in single malts or whatever they call them that the in people drink hot roast beef sandwich please matt ordered after a tensecond perusal of the menu french fries green beans what about you mother what the hell is that mother business damn it a hot roast beef sandwich sounds good but ill sound like his echo to hell with it the same hold the fries olivia said coming right up the bartender said and walked down the bar to a computer matt picked up his glass and raised it to olivia mud in your eye mother whats with mother olivia asked even the casanova of center city does not make a pass at a mother matt replied oh jesus olivia said im just ensuring that i will not get carried away matt said i wont let that happen olivia said good i invariably falter in the face of temptation youre out of your mind you know that you sound just like my sister mother she shook her head but she smiled this is nice booze she said im afraid to ask what it costs fear not mother that was my round but actually its not very expensive not like twelveyearold or single malts i found it in scotland it was the bar whiskey in scotland my father and i and my fathers buddy and hissonmybuddy were shooting driven birds over there what the hell does that mean i dont know what that means olivia confessed they raise pheasants matt explained and charge people to shoot them they call it a drive the shooters form a line and then the beaters drive the birdshence driven birdstoward the line of shooters great shooting it sounds barbaric olivia said youre a vegetarian no where do you think your roast beef came from a steer that died of old age olivia didnt reply the pheasants are raised to be eaten just like chickens and turkey i suppose you could argue that wringing their necks would be kinder than shooting them but i dont see the difference and three hours after theyre shot theyre cleaned plucked packed in ice and on the way to a gourmet restaurant and you get your kicks by slaughtering the pheasants right you get a real kick out of killing things right you got it mother matt said once you understand that everything falls in place she could tell by both the bitter tone of his voice and his eyes that she had really angered him he shook his head in disgust turned away and picked up his glass what made him so angry oh god when mickey ohara called him wyatt earp he blew up and then ohara told me about the bad guy matt put down by which he meant killed i didnt mean to suggest he liked killing people but i guess it sounded like i did so what do i do now apologize the waiter slid plates holding hot roast beef sandwiches across the bar to them i think you probably have just saved my life matt said sniffing appreciatively and picking up a french fry but just to make sure youd better give me another of these olivia saw that he had drained his glass the bartender chuckled and looked at olivia why not she said matt looked at her in surprise im sorry she said sorry for what mother i was out of line she said matt met her eyes it made her uncomfortable but she couldnt look away after a long moment he said i guess that makes us even and then he looked away and unwrapped his knife and fork from its napkin wrap and attacked the sandwich olivia took a healthy swallow of her drink and when the bartender delivered the second round emptied what was left of hers into the new glass she was astonished at the speed with which matt emptied his plate of the roast beef the potatoes and the beans she had taken only her third bite when she saw him lay his knife and fork on the empty plate and slide it across the bar toward the bartender very nice matt said glad you liked it did you know cheryl williamson matt asked the bartender i guess you heard the bartender replied matt nodded goddamned cops the bartender said i guess you heard what those bastards did or didnt do pardon the french what did you say your name was matt asked charley the bartender said mother show charley your badge matt said she looked at him in surprise detective lassiter show charley your badge matt ordered olivia pulled her oversweater far enough to one side so the bartender could see her badge which she had pinned to the waistband of her skirt sorry i didnt know charley the bartender said uncomfortably no problem matt said the reason we dont wear uniforms is so people cant spot us as cops right off by the way im sergeant payne my friends call me matt he extended his hand across the bar until charley the bartender took it tell me charley matt said as he slipped back onto his stool have you made up your mind for all eternity or would you be interested in the facts about what those goddamned bastard cops did or didnt do hey sergeant i said i was sorry if were going to be friends call me matt matt said and that wasnt the question charley are you interested in the facts or have you made up your mind and dont want the facts to get in the way okay lets have the facts charley said mother give charley the facts matt said is that your name charley blurted i call her that to remind myself not to make a pass at her matt said really really matt said tell charley what really happened mother okay from the top olivia began so at the end what you have are two decent young cops who feel guilty as hell for not breaking into her apartment olivia finished even though they did exactly what they were supposed to do jesus charley the bartender said and turned away to return in a moment with the bottle of famous grouse on me he said as he started pouring not on the house on me i feel bad about what i said before thats absolutely unnecessary and we shouldnt matt said but we will are they going to catch this guy charley asked were going to get him matt said the question is when the sooner they get him the sooner theyll be able to be sure he wont be able to do something like this to somebody else maybe i get this from the movies charley said but those homicide detectives seem to know what theyre doing i know two that dont matt said charley looked at him in surprise these two matt finished youre homicide matt nodded and thats what were doing here trying to run this guy down we understand cheryl used to come in here who told you that charley asked her mother olivia said and she gave me a list of people cheryl hung out with she handed him the list do you know any of these people most of them charley reported after a minute any of them in here right now charley looked down the bar then looked through the doors of two adjacent rooms and came back to report that none of them were well well run them down matt said it would help if you could tell us anything about cheryl olivia said what kind of a girl was she let me say something unpleasant matt said its okay to say unkind things about the dead if the purpose is to find out who killed them charley considered that a moment i take the point he said okay so far as i know she was really a nice girl if she were a bimbo id say so okay you want my gut feeling please olivia said i think she came in here hoping that mr right the guy on the white horse you know what i mean would walk in and make eyes at her and i dont think he ever did she was goodlooking guys hit on her but she wasnt looking for a onenight stand and i never saw her leave here with a guy sometimes when she was in here with her girlfriends a couple of them would leave together with a couple of guys never alone you know what i mean i get the picture matt said matts cell phone went off payne damata matt where are you halligans pub yeah lassiter said youd be going there she with you yeah you eat yet just finished im in liberties damata said i figured you might want to compare notes hes taking care of me thats nice okay the black buddhas going to want to know whats going on and hell be finished with that artsy thing pretty soon if you dont want to come to center city i could meet you someplace ill come there ive got to pick up my car at the roundhouse anyway thirty minutes thirty minutes damata said and hung up matt looked at olivia we have to meet damata mother he said she nodded can i ask you a favor matt asked the bartender name it im going to give you a carda bunch of cardswith my number on it if any of the people on the list mother gave you come in would you hand them one and ask them to call sure give one to anybody who might have an idea matt said okay you got it matt took a small stuffedtocapacity card case from his pocket these are old matt said they say special operations but the number i write on them will be homicide okay okay tell them to ask for me or detective lassiter but if neither of us is there to talk to any homicide detective and leave a phone number and an address got it it took matt and olivia about five minutes to write her name and the homicide number on all of the cards then matt asked for the check on me charley the bartender said no matt said firmly handing over his american express card the one drinkbetween friendswell take with thanks the rest we pay for charley shrugged but took the card matt signed the receipt looked at it and said mother your half comes to fifteenfifty with tip she dug in her purse and came up with a five and a ten and handed it to him i owe you fifty cents ill remember he said he put out his hand to charley thanks a lot he said youve been more helpful than i think you understand ill probably come by again tomorrow or mother will okay any time charley said what well do mother is go by the roundhouse ive got to get a property receipt for the sales slip i got in new york and i want to pick up my car matt said when they were in the porsche you can take it home after we meet with joe damata im not so sure thats a good idea olivia said why not because im not sure i should be driving im not used to three drinks of scotch in fortyfive minutes and that third drink was really a double he looked at her and smiled mother are you plastered he asked amused tiddly not plastered olivia said and im not your mother his eyebrows rose i didnt mean that the way it sounded she said and he saw that she was blushing in vino veritas matt said softly what the hell does that mean it doesnt matter matt said and moved his head the six or eight inches necessary to kiss her she didnt pull away i really didnt want that to happen she said softly a moment later are you sorry just drive the goddamn car will you please he put the porsche in gear and started off eleven one as matt approached liberties bar on north second street he saw martha washingtons mercedes parked in front beside peter wohls jaguar and a halfdozen unmarked cars well so much for joe damatas noble attempt to bring me up to speed before washington asks what ive been doing on my first day as a homicide sergeant he pulled the porsche to the curb beside one of the unmarked cars turned off the key and turned to olivia you all right mother he asked of course im all right she snapped hey youre the one who admitted she was too tiddly to drive youre an arrogant sonofabitch you know that he looked at her a moment i owe you that one he said but that ends it i am not going to burn for my sin through all eternity you could have turned your head you bastard what im doing right nowfully aware that no good deed ever goes unpunishedis trying to be a nice guy how she asked thickly sarcastic you go in there and they see youre plastered and bitchy youll be back at northwest in the morning whos they why cant i keep my mouth shut why did i have to call him an arrogant sonofabitch and a bastard because im bitchy and plastered thats why shit the mercedes belongs to lieutenant washingtonor his wife same thingand the jaguar to inspector wohl theres a new unmarked which probably means captain quaire you getting the picture got it olivia said thanks just sit there pay attention and speak only when spoken to smile and lay off the booze got it got it matt got out of the car and stood impatiently waiting for olivia to figure out the seat belt and get out of it he did not hold the door to the bar open for her but once he was through it he did hold it open long enough so that it didnt close in her face matt walked to the table holding jason washington peter wohl joe damata harry slayberg andsurprising him deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin and captain francis x hollaran the new unmarked car was the commissioners matt stood there sort of waiting for permission to sit down coughlin smiled at detective lassiter matt been keeping you busy detective yes sir good work with the williamsons detective coughlin said i thinkbetween you and the story mickey ohara had in the paperthat fires now under control thank you sir sit down and help yourself coughlin ordered nodding at the bottles on the table you too matt could i get a diet coke olivia called to the bartender you dont drink coughlin asked making it a statement sorry sometimes sir not now joe tells me you got the sales slip for the camera in new york coughlin asked matt yes sir henry ford of detroit michigan himself bought it you might call out there and see if they have something similar maybe there is a detroit connection ive already done that sir matt said and added to washington i gave a homicide sergeant there your number i didnt have any other direct homicide number washington nodded how did you do at halligans pub he asked the bartender said she was looking for mr right to come riding in on a white horse matt replied that so far as he knew she didnt play around we left him cards to pass out to anybody who might know anything specifically including the names of the guys mother got from mrs williamson mother coughlin asked i call detective lassiter that to remind myself this beautiful femaleis detective lassiter and that sergeants arent supposed to notice the beautiful part there was laughter and chuckles good thinking sergeant coughlin said smiling broadly goddamn him does he really think im beautiful what were doing now lassiter wohl said is waiting for another beautiful woman youll notice he used the word beautiful coughlin interrupted which suggeststhat war of the sexes is in the armistice mode wohl flashed him an angry look the others chuckled dr payne wohl continued who has graciously agreed to provide her take on the williamson doer where is she matt said where else matt at the hospital we were on our way here when her phone buzzed whats going on here is inspector wohl in a relationship with matts sister they had a fight and everybody knows about it that maybe they fight all the time what did amy give you so far matt asked why dont we wait and get it from her wohl said in the meantime washington said wemay have using the term lead in the broadest possible sense finally come up with a lead in the roy rogers job jason looked under the rock under the rock again coughlin said approvingly the witness neglected to tell us washington went on that the miscreant presently known for lack of more precise information as the fat guy was wearing a visora crownless baseball cap so to speakwhen he sat down at the booth by the kitchen door he was not wearing it when he left the scene how do we know that olivia asked washingtons look showed that he did not like to be interrupted and matt told me to keep my mouth shut while oharas digital image does not show the faces of the malefactors mother it does offer rather sharp silhouettes of their heads no visorthe witness said he was wearing the visor to the rear over his neckwas visible fore or aft he called me mother goddamn it now everybody will i didnt mean to interrupt you sir olivia said apology noted washington went on we have such a visor cap among the unclaimed items at the crime scene on it the lab on its first look found a rather poor print of what may be an index finger detective harris has gone to the lab asking them to exert greater effort i have visited the lab myself with the same purpose i am going to drop by again on my way home tonight would i do any good do you think jason coughlin asked with all due respect commissioner i think that would be counterproductive is that so coughlin challenged on the other hand if captain hollaran could find a moment in his busy schedule to drop by the lab washington replied that would suggest great interest in their activities by someone in a high position without invoking the terror a visit by you personally would generate terror coughlin chuckled your call jason when jason hollaran asked to preserve what little is left of my oncehappy marriage i am going homevia the labjust as soon as we hear from doctor payne washington said how about immediately after you see the commissioner home done hollaran said our finding a useful print is what the wagering fraternity would term a long shot washington went on but at the moment its all we have just before i came here matt damata said i checked the results of the doortodoor interviews zero nobody saw or heard a thing so harry and i are going to try that again in the morning there was the sound of tortured metal as if a bumper had scraped the curbstone wohl looked at matt they smiled she must have missed the fire hydrant matt said one of her good days wohl said amy came through the door a moment later holding a lined pad a stethoscope stuck out of the side pocket of her suit jacket everybodys here she said she bent over coughlin to kiss his cheek slid into a chair beside wohl and smiled at the people around the table what did you just hit wohl asked she looked at him in genuine surprise nothing she said why do you ask theyre all smiling she really must be a lousy driver olivia thought and she really doesnt look old enough to be a doctor and she doesnt look at all like matt i appreciate your help sweetheart coughlin said its important to us sweetheart whats that all about what have you got for us honey wohl asked im not your honey peter she said im doing this as a concerned citizen good for you okay concerned citizen wohl replied smiling what have you got for us can we get you a drink sweetheart coughlin asked god knows i earned one she said yes thank you uncle denny uncle denny whats that all about are they related what coughlin asked amy looked at olivia what are you having diet coke thats not going to do it amy said ill have a bushmills martini what the hell is a bushmills martini jerry coughlin called to the bartender one of the doctors irish specials please coming right up he knows what she means which means she comes in here often as wohls what girlfriend more than that but with him not alone not like that poor williamson girl who went to halligans pub alone looking for mr right to ride in on a white horse and make eyes at her poor williamson girl who am i kidding when charley the bartender told us that cheryl wasnt looking for a onenight stand that he never saw her leave the place with any of the guys who hit on her i thought i understand that description fits me thats how i spend my spare evenings going to mannys where i dont think they know im a cop which is important because if mr right ever rides into mannys on his white horse and makes eyes at me i know he will gallop right out again the moment he hears the whispered words shes a cop from the bartender but what if mr right has just ridden into my life in a silver porsche at least you take irish whiskey commissioner coughlin said hes talking to me and you put it in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake it well and then you pour it into a martini glass that way you dont dilute the whiskey as the ice melts very interesting olivia said ive never heard of that theyre really pretty good amy payne said you want to try one coughlin asked you really earned a drink today with the williamsons why not olivia said jerry coughlin called two doctors irish specials two doctors specials coming up jerry called back olivia looked at matt he was rolling his eyes and shaking his head yeah i know lay off the booze fuck you youre not my father you dont tell me when not to drink how dare you be exasperated disgusted whatever with me did you get a chance to talk to dr mitchell amy washington asked cause of death was a broken neck amy said matteroffactly there are contusions on the right side of the face suggesting that she was thrown or forced against the bedside table with such force as to break the neck she jerked her head violently to one side in demonstration big guy huh doc slayberg asked amy nodded were sure its a male olivia asked detective lassiter saw that sergeant payne was rolling his eyes again why now why was that a stupid question oh god the sperm on her breast that was a stupid question keep your mouth shut there was sperm on the body amy said sergeant payne was now shaking his head on the body amy went on on her breast and face none in the vagina anus or mouth the bartender set a martini glass before each of the women amy took a sip olivia reached for the glass and picked it up she glanced at sergeant payne he was holding both his hands palms outward the gesture was cleari wash my hands of you fuck you again i will drink this drink and i will keep my mouth shut the drink had a strange heavy but not unpleasant taste something like a martini what do you think lassiter coughlin asked interesting olivia said dont take more than two at one sitting wohl said i wont i presume there were sufficient quantities of that bodily fluid for dna washington said plenty sergeant payne and detective damata said at the same time i asked dr mitchell to see if there was any saliva amy said you think he licked her doc slayberg asked was that a bona fide question or homicide humor i think he may have spat on her amy said if so that would confirm my first guess about this man which is washington asked softly that he gets his satisfaction from the humiliation of his victims victims plural wohl asked you think hes done this before i think he has for one thing with the exception of killing the victim which may have beenprobably wasaccidental i think things went as he wanted them to go as he planned them to go why do you say that wohl asked those plastic things he used to tie her to the bed that and the knife people dont usually carry things like that around he brought them to the apartment intending to use them wohl grunted agreement let me put it this way amy said psychologically this guy is the opposite of isaac fort festung who the hell is that fort festung coughlin asked visibly surprised whats his connection with this bear with me uncle denny amy said your show sweetheart coughlin said handle it any way you want when i was at martha pekachs party she told me that david was upset because hed gotten another postcard from festung i guess hes been in my mind since then hes another interesting character psychologically speaking harry damata said chuckling interesting character psychologically speaking is doctor talk for miserable slimeball wohl chuckled amy smiled at damata why do i know that if inspector wohl had said that amy would have snapped his head off how joe and why did festung kill that girl amy asked mary elizabeth shattack coughlin furnished he beat her to death damata said with his fists why he didnt like her wohl asked mock serious screw you peter amy said she left him damata said he couldnt take that she was his possession amy said and when she misbehavedannouncing she had found someone elsethat was unacceptable behavior and he punished her like you whack a dog with a newspaper when he poops on the carpet sweetheart coughlin said youre losing me and then he stuffed her body in a trunk and just left it there wohl said where are you going with this amy i believe the phrase you policemen use ismodus operandi amy said theyre different here explain that to me im a little dense this time of night wohl said let me have a shot if i may amy washington said you are saying that festung regarded miss shattack as something worthless that he could deal within this case discardin any way that pleased him at the moment an empty cigarette package so to speak right amy said and the williamson girl matt asked amy ignored him which suggests to me that festung has an enormous ego she said which would also explain the postcards wohl said festung is making the point with his postcards that he can do whatever he wants to do and theres nothing we can do about it we being the police representing society she ignored him too are you suggesting amy washington asked that the williamson girl was in some way important to her killer i think that as festung had this pathologically enormous ego the man who killed the williamson girl has a pathologically inadequate ego which he has to buttress i dont think he intended to kill her or possibly even rape her what he wanted what he was driven to do was humiliate her he had to prove to himself that she was in his power no one responded rape generally speaking amy went on is rarely to attain sexual gratification the satisfaction comes from having the victim in your power terrifying them forcing them to do something they really dont want to do something that will humiliate them the sperm on the victims face and breasts wohl said precisely peter amy said breasts he exposed by cutting away her clothing with that enormous knife suggesting he masturbated ejaculating on her face for the purpose of humiliation amy finished for him i can think of nothing more humiliating for a young woman who was not a bimbo olivia said he believed to be a quote nice girl unquote amy said olivia had a quick mental image of herself tied naked to a bed while some sicko did that in her face she felt a chill she picked up her doctors irish special and took a deep swallow without knowing she had done so until the whiskey began to warm her body she sensed matts eyes on her and glanced at him this time she thought she saw understandingmaybe even a little sympathyin his eyes youre saying this guy is a real sicko damata said i mean we know hes sick to start with but this man is driven joe amy said and from the what do i saypracticed manner in which he did thisthe plastic ties the knife the camera to capture the victim in her humiliationi would be very surprised if this was his first victim and you feel certain there will be others washington asked that opens another unpleasant avenue of thought amy said his reaction to her death i dont think he intended to kill her but he did the question then becomes whether the knowledge that he has taken a life is going to frighten him possibly to the point where he will at least try not to let something like that happen again or whether killing the williamson girl gave him greater satisfaction than the previous incidents of humiliation ever gave him and thus make him want to do it again jesus christ slayberg said so who do we look for concerned citizen wohl asked how do we find this guy i dont think he knew her amy said i mean i dont think youre going to find him by finding a rejected suitor he may have known about her as detective lassiter said she paused and looked and smiled at olivia sorry ive forgotten your first name olivia asolivia said the williamson girl was not a bimbo maybe thats why this man selected her as his next victim he may be a customer at some bar she went to halligans pub matt furnished or someone at work at church i was about to say car wash grocery store but i dont think so i think this man is intelligent which would tend to eliminate minimumwage people for that matter he may be from podunk south dakota just passing through so i have no idea where to look for him has anyone thought to ask special victims if they have jobs like this coughlin asked i did olivia said when sergeant payne and i were there printing the photographs no sir they have had nothing like this accepting for the moment washington said the doctors premise that this is not the first time this fellow has done something like this and i think shes right and sex crimes special victims jason wohl interrupted to be surespecial victims washington said his voice dripping with sarcasm thank you inspector for the correction the proper terminology is now burned indelibly in my memory may i proceed as long as you get the terminology right wohl said smiling unabashed correct terminology as you have so often pointed out to me in the past is very nearly as important as turning over the stone under the stone coughlin chuckled hollaran damata slayberg and matt smiled a serpents tooth causes no greater pain than an ungrateful child washington said solemnly or a once barely adequate homicide detective who realizing his inadequacies left homicide for the far less challenging arena of supervision and then mocks his mentor commissioner wohl said i think hes talking about you i thought he was talking about frank coughlin said now the suppressed laughter could not be contained is there no one at this table except for olivia and myself over the mental age of fourteen amy demanded angrily probably not doctor washington said but i will nevertheless continue he waited until everyone was looking at him despite serious doubts that any or all of you has the mental capacity to follow this reasoning i submit the following possible scenario in the presumption that this fellow a is everything dr payne believes him to be and b has done something like thispossibly probably without fatal resultsseveral times before and inasmuch as we have no record of a similar modus operandi here were they positive about having nothing similar at special victims olivia yes sir he called me by my first name the reasonable inference may be drawn that the previous incidents were in another large city why large city jason coughlin asked i have added to amys hypothesis a he is intelligent and b he was probably not known to the victim that he stalked so to speak miss williamson because she represented the type of nice young female he wished to humiliate his pool of potential victims would obviously be in proportion to the population of a city and he would not be known incould hide easier ina large city not his hometown wohl interjected perhaps you did learn something from your mentor after all peter washington said say thank you thank you peter said yes id love another he signaled to the bartender for another round of drinks i will not rise to that washington said you are not very bright but you knew precisely what i meant i want somebody here to be sober enough coughlin said to check the ncic database tonight and maybe to send wires to every large ive already checked with the fbi denny washington said they have nothing and i have very little faith in the efficacy of a teletype message to other police departments they probably pay as little attention to them as we pay to theirs he met coughlins eyes for a moment and then when coughlin said nothing turned to matt sergeant payne i suggest that starting first thing in the morning whenever she is not occupied with the williamson family you have detective lassiter make two telephone calls to every major city police department in the country one to their homicide bureau and the second to whatever they have elected to dub their sex crimes unit yes sir while youre at it olivia amy said get their fax numbers and tell them youre going to fax them the dna makeup of this guy if they have any unidentified rapists where the only positive identification factor is the dna they can run theirs against ours to see if there is a match i didnt know that really worked olivia said we can really do that sure amy said dna markers are a series of unique really unique identifiers according to scientific standards used around the world no two are alike theyre much more difficultalmost impossibleto challenge in court and as my contribution to the general fund of knowledge washington said let me add that two months ago in federal court right here in philadelphia a defense lawyer successfully challenged the scientific validity of fingerprintsthe admission thereof as evidencearguing that the standards for fingerprint identification vary from state to state and even other countries im really glad amy brought that up good thinking honey coughlin said thats my big sister matt said with mock pride and as for you sergeant payne washington said quickly to keep amy from replying to the sarcasm whenever you can tear yourself from the supervision of the other detectives working this investigation it would be useful for you to lend detective lassiter a hand in that endeavor perhaps fortune will smile on us yes sir what hes saying matt decided is that the two people leastlikely to make any other substantial contribution to this investigation mother and me will spend all day tomorrow or for however long it takes with a telephone stuck in our ears well what the hell sergeant or not i am the rookie in homicide and thats what rookies do whatever jobs will release someone who knows what hes doing to do it olivia thoughtwell however politely put that was a kick in the teeth wasnt it sergeant hotshot you and the temporary employee from northwest get to work the telephones while the real detectives do their thing and you really deserved a kick in the teeth to bring you down to size so why do i feel sorry for you the bartender began distributing drinks starting with doctors specials for dr payne and detective lassiter she was surprised that the first martini glass was empty she looked at the fresh one i dont need that i dont want that im going to make a fool of myself how are you going to get home olivia amy asked im riding with matt sergeant payne like just now are you all right to drive matt amy asked hey fight with peter all you want but lay off me i was thinking of olivia amy replied and what makes you think im fighting with peter your claws are showing washington stood up holding his glass i am leaving before these adorable loving siblings enter the violent stage he said but not before i take aboard sufficient liquid courage to face the unsheathed claws i fear i will myself find at home he took a healthy swallow of his drink you will drop by the lab frank just as soon as i drop the boss off hollaran said i was going to say frank could take lassiter home coughlin said but his going by the lab is important he looked at matt you drive very carefully matt i dont want to hear onphils philly that you ran into a school bus im all right uncle denny matt said okay frank coughlin said lets call it a night he stood up finished his drink and walked to the door hollaran followed him washington finished his drink and followed them what slayberg and i are going to do tomorrow matt damata said is run down the known acquaintances and ring some doorbells if anything turns up well let you know fine matt said that was really nice of him olivia thought he picked up on matt getting kicked in the teeth and was trying to make him feel better damata and slayberg left you want to go mother matt asked she stood up picked up her glass met his eyes and drained it he shook his head in resignation and gestured toward the door you were lucky in there mother matt said when they were in the porsche im not your mother goddamn it you were lucky mother matt went on that your mouth didnt run away with you any more than it did nobody likes a drunken woman last warning fuck you with the additional warning to never say that to me again the conversation is closed detective lassiter matt said now where do you live take me to city hall ill take a taxi commissioner coughlin ordered me to take you home answer the question detective lassiter the block of orchard lane she said icily after a moment its east of the north philadelphia airport take i and get i know where the north philadelphia airport is matt put the porsche in gear and backed away from the curb two take the next left onto knights road olivia said as they were headed down woodhaven road it was the first thing either of them had said since leaving liberties matt wordlessly made the turn two minutes later olivia said pointing across the median orchards over there you can make a uturn at the stoplight matt saw that the stoplight at the intersection of knights road and red lion road was green and that a dodge caravan headed his way on the other side of the median was the only traffic it had just passed the stoplight he touched the brake flicked the turn signal lever downshifted and prepared to make the uturn at the intersection after the caravan a pontiac grand am came out of nowhere down red lion ran the red light flashed past the nose of the porsche and then slammed into the side of the dodge caravan slammed hard into it there was the sound of tearing metal as the dodge was knocked mostly sideward across the street coming to rest at an angle against the curb that sonofabitch ran the light matt said he braked sharply stopped turned on his flashers and opened his door call radio he ordered handing his cellular to olivia the drivers door of the grand am opened and the driver got out he was a young tall white male you stupid sonofabitch matt muttered this is detective lassiter badge we are at red lion and knights road we have a vehicular accident autoauto possible injuries start in fire rescue and a sector car there was a moments hesitation then olivia added no we are not involved thank god matt thought neither one of us could pass a breathalyzer test right now the young tall white male looked first at the caravan and then at the porsche stopped on knights road with its warning flashers blinking then he sort of shrugged and took off at a lope down orchard lane check on the people in the van matt ordered and jumped out of the porsche and ran after the young tall white male now its leaving the scene of an accident you dumb sonofabitch and that grand am is probably stolen stop he shouted i am a police officer the young tall white male kept running matt saw him turn off the street into a driveway when matt reached the lawn of the next house he cut across it diagonally and at a full run encountered with his foot a wire supporting an ornamental tree on the lawn he flew through the air and landed flat on the concrete driveway he felt his face scrape against the concrete and a stinging in both hands where they had struck the concrete he shook his head and got to his knees the young tall white male was running around the side of a garage matt ran after him when he turned the corner of the garage he saw the young tall white male about to top a fivefoot hurricane fence stop police officer matt shouted the young tall white male looked right at him and then dropped to the ground on the far side of the fence im going to get you you sonofabitch matt shouted and ran toward the fence it was his intention to leap the fence gracefully by vaulting over it with the use of his left hand on the parallel pipe at the top of the fence two problems arose first the parallel pipe at the top of the fence was perhaps an inch below the top of the fence itself second the uppermost joints of the twisted wire of the fence were above it one of them penetrated the heel of matts hand which he had planned to use for leverage this caused a matts passage over the fence to be considerably less graceful than he intended b a puncture wound in the heel of matts hand and c matts trousers to be torn from just below the knee almost to the cuff as they became ensnared in the twisted wire at the top of the fence sonofabitch matt cried and got to his feet he saw that he was between two lines of hurricane fence running behind the houses the young tall white male was running between them matt ran after him at the end of the parallel lines of hurricane fence there were a dozen garbage cans the young tall white male leapt nimbly over the first two cans but then his foot slipped between two of them and he sprawled onto the ground amid toppled garbage cans matt breathing heavily shoved the garbage cans to one side then fell to his knees beside the young tall white male and pulled his arm behind his back then he put his knee on the small of the young tall white males back he tried to catch his breath he became aware that blood was dripping from his chin onto the white sweatshirt of the young tall white male he heard the wail of a siren and then the wail of a second siren matt felt the small of his own back for his handcuffs i left the fucking things in the goddamn car you gonna let me up now the young tall white male asked shut your fucking mouth the sound of one of the sirens died and then the other after what seemed like two and a half years matt saw the beam of a sweeping flashlight over here he tried to shout which told him he had not fully recovered his breath the flashlight beam came closer my god what happened to you detective lassiter asked you got cuffs detective lassiter sort of squatted on the ground put her small flashlight in her mouth opened her purse and took from it a set of handcuffs she moved to place the handcuffs on the wrist matt was holding the young tall white male realizing what was happening resisted before he was adequately restrained again detective lassiters flashlight had been knocked from her mouth and had fallen to the ground in such a position that it shone directly on the junction of her legs which covered with pale blue panties was now due to the displacement of her skirt fully exposed he heard the sound of a third siren dying thanks sergeant payne said happy to be of help detective lassiter said put your foot on his neck sergeant payne ordered detective lassiter complied and sergeant payne got to his feet youre bleeding detective lassiter said my arent we observant matt said and took a handkerchief from his pocket and mopped at his face matt started to pull the young tall white man to his feet keeping in mind that there is nothing i would rather do right now than rub your face in the garbage get up and behave matt said not quite make my day olivia said but not bad sergeant ill be a sonofabitch shes laughing at me another flashlight beam appeared and a moment later another one was held by a uniform the other by a highway patrol sergeant the latter flickered across matts face payne what the hell happened to you what the hell does it look like matt snapped he pointed to the uniform put this gentleman in a car he ordered he has not been mirandized what did he do the highway sergeant said as he stepped closer to matt as if he thought he was going to need some help then when his back was to the uniform and he could not be seen he put something into matts hand matt saw what it was three round pellets of a very strong brand of english mints chew those slowly and try not to breathe on anybody i already gave some to your friend thanks matt said i owe you so what did this critter do for openers first running a red light and then leaving the scene of an accident matt said give me thirty seconds and i can think of a lot more i wouldnt be surprised if the grand am is hot you sure youre all right you look like hell the highway sergeant said there were four city vehicles on knights road a highway car a patrol car a sergeants car from the eighth district and a fire department fire rescue vehicle two paramedics were loading the passengers of the caravan into the fire rescue truck i think the little boys got a broken arm the eighth district sergeant said youre detective lassiter shes lassiter my name is payne youre on the job no you stupid fuck im a concerned citizen who gets his rocks off chasing tall young white males through peoples backyards sergeant homicide matt said you want to go in with them or in your own car go where you look pretty beat up sergeant the eighth district sergeant said you better have a doctor look at your face im all right matt said i scraped it thats all no youre not detective lassiter said let the medics look at it it was the paramedics professional judgment that while he had really done a job on his cheek there wasnt much that could be done for it except clean it up and get some antiseptic on it i live right around the corner detective lassiter said and ive got alcohol and hydrogen peroxide thatll do it the paramedic said matt met olivias eyes for a long moment thank you he said youre welcome can we find out if the grand am is hot matt asked hes running it now the eighth district sergeant said nodding toward a uniform in a patrol car less than a minute later the uniform got out of the car and announced that the grand am had been reported stolen can you take him and hold him on that matt asked ill come by later and do the paper the district sergeant shook his head no you know better than that sergeant youre the arresting officer and you need to make the statement to the detective at northeast the highway sergeant stepped between them ill get all of sergeant paynes necessary information and make sure the detective has it sergeant besides we helped him to make the pinch back there and i want to make sure highway gets in on the paperwork you know how it is the eighth district sergeant looked at him for a moment then walked away the highway sergeant turned to matt let me have your badge and payroll numbers and i better have hers too tell me what happened and how you hurt yourself so the northeast detective can document it if you need to go out iodand make sure you touch base with the assigned detective so you agree with the statement before he puts it on the thanks a lot matt said i owe you two now you better let me drive olivia said why it looks like you scratched your hand too youll get blood all over your pretty leather gear shifter he walked around the rear and got in the passenger seat of the porsche detective lassiter opened the door of her secondfloor apartment reached inside flicked on the lights and then motioned sergeant payne inside ahead of her the first aid stuffs in the bathroom she said the bedrooms just the other side of the living room he walked across the living room to the bedroom noticing as he passed through it to the bathroom that it was not messy and that a white comforter covered her bed intimate feminine apparel was hanging from the shower curtain rod when she came into the bathroom she snatched it off and threw it behind the shower curtain she took bandages swabs mercurochrome and bottles of hydrogen peroxide and alcohol from a cabinet and then turned to him and started cleaning his face thats pretty nasty she said you sure you dont want to go to the emergency room im sure he said three minutes later his scraped face had been cleaned with both hydrogen peroxide and alcohol he had manfully tried and failed not to wince when the alcohol stung painfully lets look at the leg she said whats wrong with the leg the fence got that too i guess in the car i saw it its all bloody three minutes after that his leg had been treated with alcohol and hydrogen peroxide and painted with mercurochrome but not bandaged your trousers are ruined olivia said i noticed and let me see what you did to your hand i guess i scratched it the same place i tore my pants going over the fence she took his left hand in both of hers thats a puncture wound she said he didnt reply you just cant leave it like that she said he didnt reply she looked up at him their eyes met what she asked you know goddamn well what mother im not your goddamn mother i know he said softly your move she had not taken her eyes from his she took her left hand from his and raised it to his unmarked cheek oh god she said ninety seconds later atop the white comforter on her bed while still partially clothed detective lassiter and sergeant payne came to know each other in the biblical sense of the term and in the next half hour now completely devoid of clothing and between the sheets detective lassiter and sergeant payne twice came to know each other even better twelve one matt payne awoke at five minutes to six for a moment he wondered why so damned earlyhe had two alarm clocks to make sure he was awakened at sevenand then he remembered some of what had happened the night before and thought that might have something to do with it jesus christ he said in wonderment then went to his bathroom which his father had described as being somewhat smaller than those found on old pullman railroad cars he examined himself in the mirror over the toilet what the hell happened to my face he remembered sliding along the concrete driveway in hot pursuit of the critter in the hot car whod run the red light and slammed into the caravan nevertheless sir minor facial blemishes aside you look like the welllaid man of fame and legend he said aloud he smiled at the memories of other of the previous evenings activities however a moment later when in an habitual act he reached inside the shower stall to open the faucet that would long moments later bring hot water all the way from the basement to the garret apartment his hand really hurt him shit the goddamn what did she say puncture wound when he came out of the shower the damned thing still hurt and it looked angry shit he had two thoughts one after the other maybe olivia would know what to do with it do i put a bandage on it soak it in hot water what maybe if i called she might say ill come by on my way to work and have a look at it thats a very interesting prospect he went naked and dripping into his bedroomwhich his father also compared unfavorably to a sleeping compartment on an old pullman carand picked up his cellular from the bedside table where it lay beside his colt officers model twenty seconds later a sleepy female voice said lassiter good morning oh god i was calling to inquire whether your schedule is free for breakfast oh god what time is it a little after six there was no immediate response for reasons i cant imagine im ravenous matt said i dont even want to think about breakfast olivia said my god matt my god what olivia i havent even had time to think and you want breakfast think about what oh for gods sake everything what is there to think about you know i didnt want that to happen oh shit do i detect a slight tone of regret i didnt say that matt olivia said oh god may i infer then that it was not an entirely disappointing experience for you olivia giggled not entirely she said my god you keep saying my god i keep remembering what happened she said my god i cant believe i behaved like that for my part it was an entirely delightful experience was it couldnt you tell oh matt what are we going to do that brings us back to breakfast no for one thing im not hungry and for another i dont want anyone to see us together why not you know why not i dont give a damn who sees us together anyway were working together i do i want to stay in homicide oh i need time to think and if i see you i wont be able to think clearly she paused matt will you do me a big favor name it forget what happened last night how the hell am i supposed to do that it happened and at the risk of repeating myself i found it to be an entirely delightful experience im not saying it wasnt she said my god couldnt you tell what im saying is that i dont want anybody even to guess about it until i can think about it really think about it will you do that for me whatever you say mother thank you i suppose your having a look at my hand is entirely out of the question whats wrong with your hand she asked thats genuine concern in her voice i believe you described it as a puncture wound and i also told you to stop at an emergency room on your way home you mean you didnt i seem to have forgotten that instruction i must have had something else on my mind bleeding to death didnt seem important at the time youre bleeding now more genuine concern he looked at his hand no but it looks unhealthy matt go to an emergency room please right now ill see you at work how about doing me a favor if you want me to come there i will she said after a moment what i want you to do is tell me now if youre trying to let me down gently oh god if i was trying to dump you kindly or otherwise i would not have offered to come there you mean that you think last night was a onenight stand for me oh god i hope not he said and laughed whats funny i seem to have acquired your penchant for oh god are you all right to drive with your hand sure then go to an emergency room and ill see you at work okay okay and we wont look in each others eyes agreed with great reluctance oh god she said and then there was the hiss that told him she had pressed the end key on her cellular two matt pulled the porsche into the emergency trauma center of hahnemann hospital on north broad street and parked beside a sixth district wagon in the area with the sign police and emergency vehicles only a man of about his age wearing hospital greens and what looked like twentyfour hours of beard growth stopped him as he was walking toward the hospital entrance he pointed wordlessly at the sign im on the job matt said and pushed his jacket away from the badge on his belt with his sore hand what did you do to the hand fell over a fence matt said the man waved his hand in a signal for matt to follow him inside youre a doctor matt asked no i wear this stuff because i like pastel colors the paperwork didnt take long the doctor was waiting for him in a treatment room thats nasty the doctor said puncture wounds can be bad news howd you do it going over a fence matt said the top of the fence the twisted ends of the wire the doctor nodded your tetanus up to date i suppose so suppose doesnt count the doctor said as he opened a glass door in a white cabinet this is going to hurt the doctor said it did and so did the injection of an antibiotic as a precaution in the other buttock i hope you can shoot righthanded sherlock the doctor said for the next three four days that paw is going to be tender im righthanded you going to put a bandage on it youwant a bandage what i dont want is people asking what did you do to your hand it looksghastly i could paint the area with some lovely lavender antiseptic just a simple large bandaid please okay why not thank you you mind if i ask a couple of questions sherlock shoot why were you jumping over a fence i was chasing a guy who drove a stolen car through a red light and clobbered a family in a minivan you get him matt nodded good for you you said two questions why did the cops stand around with their thumbs up their ass while that girl was being raped and murdered three matts gluteus maximus began to ache as he got on the roundhouse elevator the doctor had said that both the tetanus booster and the antibiotic would probably cause mild discomfort the mild discomfort left his mind when he walked into homicide and found that detective lassiter had already reported for duty she was sitting at a desk with a telephone to her ear she was wearing a skirt and a double sweater it didnt matter her naked form was engraved forever in matts mind she looked at him then away already at it mother he said she looked at him nodded and then quickly looked away again captain wants to see you sergeant detective alonzo kramer a stocky ruddyfaced fortythreeyearold said pointing to captain quaires office matt could see through the glass enclosure that lieutenant gerry mcguire the commanding officer of dignitary protection was with quaire i wonder what thats about oh shit stan colt i forgot all about that quaire saw matt coming and waved him into his office good morning matt said politely what happened to your face quaire asked i took a slide on a concrete driveway last night chasing a guy quaire gesturedgive me more with both hands i almost had lassiter home from where quaire asked smiling from liberties lieutenant washington had us meet him there and afterward i took her home she had to give her unmarked back to northwest and what happened detective lassiter didnt do that to your face did she sergeant captain quaire asked mock seriously he looked to see if lieutenant mcguire shared his sense of humor from his smile it was obvious that he did no sir matt said as we came down knights road off woodhaven a fellow in a stolen grand am ran the red lion stoplight rammed into a dodge caravan and took off running i saw that in the overnights mcguire said i thought highway bagged that guy you got involved in that i saw it i had to quaire made anothergive me more gesture with his hands it happened right in front of us lassiter called it in then checked the people in the van and i started chasing the guy and he gave you trouble quaire asked now seriously the face no sir while i was chasing him i took a dive over a wire and scraped my face on a driveway then i tried going over a fence and bruised my hand but you got the guy yes sir eighth district locked him up but im going to have to go to northeast detectives to give a detective coleman a full statement he only got the initial details for the affidavitlast night why didnt you give your statement last night quaire asked i wanted to get some antiseptic on my face so why didnt you do the paperwork last night after you went to the emergency room and got some antiseptic on your face i didnt go to the emergency room last night i went to hahnemann this morning quaire nodded consider yourself as of right now on temporary assignment to dignitary protection he said and added to mcguire getting sergeant payne to northeast detectives division to give his statement is now your responsibility lieutenant thanks a lot mcguire said captain cant i get out of that matt asked ask lieutenant mcguire quaire said you are now working for him im working the williamson job matt said you are now working the stan colt job sergeant payne mcguire said mr colt who will arrive at approximately threefifteen told monsignor schneider who told the cardinal who told the commissioner who told me that hes really looking forward to working with you what does that mean quaire and mcguire smiled at each other i think mcguire explained smiling broadly that when the monsignorwho apparently is one of your biggest fans spoke with mr colt he told him about your many heroic exploits i think mr colt heard that when harrison ford was preparing to make the moviewitness he came here to spend time with a real live philadelphia homicide detective jesus christ matt said and has apparently decided that what was good enough for harrison ford is good enough for him harrison ford is an actor colt is a goddamn joke dont let the monsignor hear you say that quaire said much less the commissioner and for that matter i have one day on the job in homicide i am hardly an experienced lie down shut up and take this like a man matt quaire said youre dead the commissioner has spoken its a dirty job sergeant but someone has to do it mcguire said smiling broadly quaire chuckled matt glared at mcguire who didnt seem to notice mr colt mcguire went on will arrive by private jet at north philadelphia airport at threefifteen he will be met by the commissioneror possibly the mayor if he can get free or bothmonsignor schneider myself four highway patrol bikes two of my people representatives of the media and of course you following what that goodlooking press agent whats her name terry davis matt furnished automatically jesus terry she certainly dropped off my radar screen in a hurry after olivia didnt she what missterry davis mcguire went on refers to as a photo op mr colt and party will proceedescorted by the highway bikesto the office of the cardinal where there will be another photo op as the cardinal welcomes mr colt back to philadelphia hes just a movie actor matt said shaking his head a lousy movie actor who is about to raise several million dollars for west catholic high school captain quaire said which pleases the cardinal and whatever pleases the cardinal pleases the commissioner following which mcguire went on we will proceed to the ritzcarlton highways responsibilitythe bikes will end there theyll provide bikes to escort his limo to the events but aside from that its up to me to protect mr colt from his hordes of fans and you to keep him happy what makes him happy is young girls matt said excuse me sergeant quaire asked coldly mr colt apparently likes young girls matt said very young girls did you get that from one of the magazines in a supermarket checkout lane or do you have another source of information quaire asked sarcastically terry davis told me matt said i think she wants us to be prepared for that oh god quaire said she wasnt pulling your leg matt no sir im sure she was serious that should make this interesting for you gerry quaire said i dont know how to handle something like that matt said well just have to sit on him around the clock mcguire said if something like that gets in the papers well be held responsible he wants to see how real cops work quaire said show him everything from school crossing guards up keep him busy hes going to want to see what he thinks is interesting matt said narcotics major crimes homicide vice mcguire said chuckling i wouldnt be laughing if i were you gerry quaire said and i dont want him around here with all respect sir how do i tell him no matt said quaire thought that over before replying if it happens matt it happens you know how i feel about it yes sir were going to get some help from special operations matt asked mcguire nodded sure do we know who somebody special you wanted detectives mcfadden and martinez matt said mutt and jeff quaire asked dignitary protection isnt quite their specialty is it detective jesus martinez who was of puerto rican ancestry and who was five feet eight inches tall and weighed just over one hundred thirty pounds and detective charles t mcfadden who was six feet two and outweighed martinez by a hundred pounds had been partners since they had graduated from the police academy the first assignment for nearly all academy graduates was to a district and almost always to a district wagon where for their first year or so on the job they learned the nuts and bolts of being a police officer on the street by responding with the wagon to assist other officers in everything from hauling aunt alice to the hospital after shed fallen in her bathtub to hauling drunks and other violators of the peace and dignity of the city of brotherly love to the district lockup almost routinely however two brandnew police officers were assigned to work undercover in the narcotics division mcfadden and martinez were chosen for the assignment in the hope that few drug dealers would suspect either the small intense latino or the large openfaced south philadelphia irishman of being police officers when they tried to make a buy of controlled substances mcfadden and martinez quickly proved themselves to be very adept at what they were assigned to do but their superiors realized it was only going to be a matter of time until they became known to the drug trade generallyin other words their appearance in court to testify against the drug dealers and would lose their usefulness at this point it was expected the young officers would be assigned to a district and start driving the district wagon something else happened mcfadden and martinez had on their own offdutyjoined the citywide search for the junkie who had shot captain dutch moffitt of highway patrol to death in the belief that gerald vincent gallagher would be somewhere in the area they staked out the bridge and pratt street terminal of the subway when gallagher had finally shown up he refused to obey their order to halt and had run off down the subway tracks mcfadden and martinezalready known as mutt and jeff after the cartoon charactershad chased him ignoring the danger down the tracks until gallagher fell against the third rail and then got himself run over by a subway train in the movies or in copsandrobbers programs on tv with the mayor and assorted big shots beaming in the background the commissioner would have handed them detective badges and congratulations for a job well done but this was real life and promotions to detective in the philadelphia police department came only after you had taken and passed the civil service examination martinez and mcfadden hadnt been on the job long enough even to be eligible to take the examination and their sudden celebritytheir faces had been on the front pages of every newspaper in philadelphia and on every tv screenhad of course completely destroyed their usefulness as undercover narcotics officers it had looked as if their reward for catching the junkie whod shot captain dutch moffittsomething the rest of the police department hadnt been able to do for an embarrassingly long periodwas going to be reassignment to driving a wagon in a district it didnt seem fair but who said a cops life was fair lifes a bitch and then you die at the same time cadet matthew m payne captain moffitts nephew had been about to graduate from the police academy in the opinion of thenchief of patrol chief inspector dennis v coughlin the chances that matt payne would last six months on the jobmuch less that the police department would be his careerranged from zero to zilch coughlin believed that mattwhom he had known from the day of his birthhad reacted to a the death of his uncle and b his failure of the us marine corps precommissioning physical examination by applying for the police department to a avenge his uncle and b prove his manhood it was understandable of course but the bottom line was that asumma cum laude graduate of the university of pennsylvania who had been raised not only in wealth but as the adopted son of a philadelphia brahmin was very unlikely to find happiness walking a police beat worse he was liable to get hurt sergeant dennis v coughlin had knocked at the door of his best friends pregnant wife to tell her that sergeant jack moffitt had been killed responding to a silent alarm at a gas station in west philadelphia chief inspector coughlin had no intention of knocking at the door of mrs patricia moffitt payne to tell her that her sonjacks son his godsonmatt had been killed in the line of duty and all of this had coincided with the formation at the suggestion of the thenmayor of the city of philadelphia the hon jerome h jerry carlucci of the special operations division of the police department mayor carlucci who boasted that he had held every rank in the philadelphia police department except for policewoman had not been at all bashful about making suggestions about the department to thenpolice commissioner taddeus czernich mayor carlucci had also suggested to commissioner czernich that he consider staff inspector peter f wohl then assigned to internal affairs to be the commanding officer of the new special operations division commissioner czernich had immediately seen the wisdom of the suggestions and issued the appropriate orders peter wohl was then the youngest staff inspectorever in the department it was wellknown that his father chief inspector retired august wohl had been jerry carluccis rabbi as the mayor had risen through the ranks but it was also wellknown that peter wohl was a hell of a good cop an absolutely straight arrow and smarter than hell so the cries of nepotism were not as loud as they might have been coughlin the thenchief inspector had solved the problem of what to do with officers martinez mcfadden and payne by ordering their assignment to special operations in a private chat with thenstaff inspector wohl he suggested that in his new command wohl would probably be able to find places where officers martinez and mcfadden could be useful in plainclothes and that officer payne could probably make himself useful as wohls administrative assistant until he realized the mistake he had made by coming on the job and quit and got on with his life wohl had accepted coughlins suggestions with as much alacrity as the commissioner had accepted the mayors suggestions he was wise enough to know that he had very little choice in the matter his rabbi had spoken finding useful employment for martinez and mcfadden had posed no problem wohl had been pleasantly surprised how well they had performed in interviews with suspects between them they had seemed to know when they were not being told the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and then one or the other of them had been able to get it when they played good copbad cop martinez had been very effective as the frightening arm of the law and mcfadden despite his size as the kindly young irishman who understood what had happened and wanted only to help officer payne had not surprising wohl been an efficient administrative assistantsort of a male secretaryfrom the first day wohl who agreed with chief coughlin that payne would leave the job just as soon as he realized that he really belonged in law school as the next step on the ladder to an eventual partnership in mawson payne stockton mcadoo amp lester arguably philadelphias most prestigious law firm was surprised to realize that he was actually going to miss him when he was gone when a serial rapist began to operate in the northwest and northwest detectives had difficulty finding himand this difficulty was gleefully reported daily in the pressmayor carlucci had been very unhappy when the rapist killed one of his victims triggering even more scornful journalistic comment mayor carlucci called a press conference and announced that henceforth the investigation would be handled by the newly formed special operations division it was good press but the reality was that wohls special operations division was less qualified to conduct the investigation than homicide was and wohl who had been a homicide detective knew it homicide had assigned the two best homicide detectives jason washington and his partner tony harris to the job wohl with the assistance of chief coughlin arrangedover their bitter objectionsthe transfer of washington and harris to special operations once they had reported for duty wohl assigned officer payne to the job payne was told that his duties were to relieve washington and harris of as many administrative details as possible and to report to wohl at least once a daymore often if necessaryof how the investigation was proceeding it was wohl thought a really useful thing for payne to be doing before he left the job it never occurred to wohl washington or harris that payne would do anything but run errands everyone understood that despite the badge on his belt and the detectives special snubnosed revolver in his shoulder holster he wasnt really on the job he was a really nice college boy and denny coughlins godson and coughlin had given him to peter wohl to sit on out of harms way until he realized he wasnt cut out to be a cop when wohl told coughlin that he had given payne to washington and harris as a gofer coughlin had smiled twenty years from now he will fondly remember his days as a homicide officer coughlin said four days after officer payne went to work as washingtons and harriss gofer the following story appeared on page one of the philadelphiabulletin northwest serial rapistmurderer killed by handsome special operations cop as he rescues kidnapped woman by michael j ohara bulletin staff writer officer matthew payne in what mayor jerry carlucci described as an act of great personal heroism rescued mrs naomi schneider of the block of norwood street in chestnut hill minutes after she had been abducted at knifepoint from her home by a man the mayor said he is positive is the man dubbed the northwest serial rapist the man tentatively identified as warren k fletcher of germantown had according to mrs schneider broken into her luxury apartment as she was preparing for bed mrs schneider said he was masked and armed with a large butcher knife she said he forced her to disrobe then draped her in a blanket and forced her into the rear of his ford van and covered her with a tarpaulin the next thing i knew mrs schneider said there was shots and then breaking glass and then the van crashed then this handsome young cop was looking down at me and smiling and telling me everything was all right he was a police officer moments before officer payne shot the kidnapper and believed rapistmurderer according to mayor carlucci the man had attempted to run payne down with the van slightly injuring payne and doing several thousand dollars worth of damage to paynes personal automobile payne then reluctantly mayor carlucci said concluded there was no choice but for him to use deadly force and he proceeded to do so mrs schneiders life was in grave danger and he knew it im proud of him mayor carlucci whose limousine is equipped with police shortwave radios was en route to his chestnut hill home from a sons of italy dinner in south philadelphia when the rescue occurred we were the first car to respond to the shots fired call the mayor said officer payne was still helping mrs schneider out of the wrecked van when we got there payne who is special assistant to staff inspector peter wohl commanding officer of the newly formed special operations division had spent most of the day in bucks county where the mutilated body of miss elizabeth woodham of east mermaid lane roxborough had been discovered by state police in a summer country cottage miss woodham was abducted from her apartment three days ago by a masked knifewielding man a bucks county mail carrier had described a man meeting mr warren k fletchers description and driving a maroon ford van identical to the one in which mrs schneider was abducted as being at the cottage where her body was discovered police all over the delaware valley were looking for a similar van payne who had been assigned to work as liaison between ace homicide detectives jason washington and anthony harris and the special operations division had gone with washington to the torturemurder scene in bucks county he spotted the van in the early hours of this morning as he drove to the chestnut hill residence of inspector wohl to make his report before going off duty he carefully appraised the situation before acting and decided mrs schneiders very life depended on his acting right then and alone mayor carlucci said she rather clearly owes her life to him i like to think that officer payne is typical of the intelligent welleducated young officers with which commissioner czernich and i intend to staff the special operations division payne who is a bachelor recently graduated from the university of pennsylvania he declined to answer questions from the press after that chief coughlin was no longer quite so sure that officer payne would soon resign from the police department and he didnt captain sergeant payne said now those two can do anything theyre asked to do he looked at lieutenant mcguire id really like to have them wohl said anything we think we need mcguire said lets see if he meant it he asked permission with his eyes to use captain quaires telephone quaire nodded mcguire punched in numbers lieutenant mcguire for inspector wohl please then he reached to quaires phone and pushed the speaker button peter wohls voice came somewhat metallically over the speaker hey gerry what can i do for you inspector you said i could ask for anything for the stan colt job my toothbrush excepted ask away mutt and jeff they on something that wont wait when and where do you want them gerry north philadelphia airport at three tell them to report to sergeant payne theyll be there thank you sir any time the line went dead why dont you take lassiter to northeast detectives now and get that over with quaire said yes sir and then ill see you at the airport at three mcguire said yes sir four matt stood patiently by olivias desk and waited until she finished talking on the telephone i really appreciate that lieutenant she said we really want to get this guy she put the handset in its cradle and looked up at matt cincinnati homicide she said nice guy nothing that he can think of offhand but hes going to check around for me whats up lets go out to northeast and get our statements out of the way matt said she didnt reply but stood up and took her purse from the desk drawer and then waited for him to lead the way out of the office in the elevator she asked what was going on in the captains office that was lieutenant mcguire of dignitary protection matt said hes about to protect stan colt from his horde of fans and im going to help him matt said whats that all about the elevator door opened onto the lobby ill tell you later he said and held the keys to the porsche out to her follow me to my place and ill dump the car there it seemed for a moment as if she was going to object but she finally took the keys without comment matt drove the unmarked crown victoria into the basement garage first pulled it into one of his slots and got quickly out to show her where to park the porsche when she opened the door he was standing there when she got to her feet they were so close that he could feel her breath on his face he resisted the impulse to put his arms around her but bent slightly far enough down to kiss her oh god she said i should have trusted my instincts about what about what you had in mind when you handed me the keys what i had in mind was getting the porsche out of the roundhouse lot before it got ticketed or boosted he said her face told him she did not believe this at all all the way here i thought of reasons why i shouldnt let you kiss me which are i cant remember she said and they kissed again she looked into his eyes what are you thinking she asked which question would get the desired response matt said one would you like to see my etchings or two you want to come upstairs for a minute you really have etchings she asked he nodded if we go to your apartment you know what will happen i hope i know what will happen i mean it will take longer than a minute the way i feel right now im not sure itll take as long as a minute oh god olivia said olivia came out of matts bathroom wearing his terrycloth robe he thought she looked adorable well now we know dont we she asked know what that just beneath my nice girl surface there is a lewd lascivious and shameless slut come on she walked to the door and began picking her clothing up from the floor i dont suppose youd believe me if i said i never have behaved like this in my life yeah i would he said i dont believe you but thank you anyway matts cellular buzzed dont answer it olivia ordered matt picked it up payne he said then a moment later hold one he shoved the telephone under a pillow on the bed i asked you not to answer that olivia said it was more like an order but i have worked for peter wohl for five years and have developed an uncontrollable pavlovian response to my phone ringing answer it immediately thats inspector wohl no its my regular girlfriend he could tell by her face that she could not quite make up her mind whether to believe him or not you want me to go in the bathroom and give you a little privacy no come and eavesdrop he said youll probably find it interesting she headed for the bathroom hey matt called here he pointed to the bed she didnt move he took the cellular out detective mcfadden he said it warms the cockles of my heart to hear your voice he pointed to the bed again and olivia came and sat gingerly on the edge he moved the cellular away from his ear so that she could hear matt what the fucks going on detective mcfadden demanded you mean right now yeah im in bed with a beautiful almost naked woman olivia pinched matt painfully on his inner thigh i wouldnt put it past you you bastard mcfadden chuckled i mean dignitary protection at the north philly airport at three oclock wohl just told me matt responded to the pinch of his thigh by reaching into olivias robe and taking her nipple between his fingers you wouldnt dare she whispered furiously you and man mountain martinez have been selected to assist lieutenant mcguire and his staff and me in the protection of mr stan colt the movie star what mcfadden challenged incredulously matt let go of olivias nipple then kissed the fingers that had held it with appreciation olivia shook her head in resignation with particular emphasis on protecting mr colt from himself what the hell does that mean he likes very young girls charley we are going to see that he doesnt get any while hes in town youre not pulling my chain are you mcfadden asked seriously no if there is an incident we are all up that famous creek without a paddle how the hell did you get involved in this matt started to push his robe from olivias shoulders she stiffened but then relaxed and then shrugged out of it colt is here to raise money for west catholic high i saw that in the paper mcfadden interrupted matt raised his head and kissed olivias nipple she sighed when he lay back down she shook her head tolerantly monsignor schneider whos the cardinals man for the visit is a cop groupie when colt told him he would like to see real cops at work schneider thought of me and went to the commissioner and i got stuck with it but why you schneider thinks i was a real heroic cop in doylestown matt said after a perceptible pause oh shit mcfadden said sympathetically susan reynoldss sightless eyes came to matts mind shit matt said what mcfadden asked olivia looked at him with concern then touched his cheek to turn his head so that she could look in his eyes her eyes asked what nothing matt said charley i have to go the naked broads horny absolutely ill see you and hayzus at the airport at three yeah detective mcfadden said and hung up matt tossed the telephone aside and looked up at olivia a lot of people thought you acted heroically in doylestown she said thats a joke i didnt even do the job right if i had susan would still be alive susan you were friends more than friends matt said i saw you crying on tv she said i wondered he looked at her but didnt say anything you know what i feel like doing to you right now she said im yours and i love your imagination i feel like putting my arms around you and holding you and telling you that everythings going to be all right that isnt exactly what i thought you had in mind can i olivia asked yeah he said after a moment she leaned toward him and he half sat up and she put her arms around him and held him to her breast they stayed that way for perhaps three minutes and then olivia glanced down at the sheet covering his groin you horny sonofabitch she said wonderingly is that a complaint she pushed him away from her breast and back onto the bed and looked down at him for a moment before shaking her head no fifteen minutes later they got into the unmarked crown victoria and rode out to the northeast detectives division and gave their statements thirteen one j richard candelle a squat grayhaired fiftyyearold black man who wore his frameless spectacles low on his nose looked over them at detective tony harris backed against a laboratory table shook his head and announced tony im sorry thats the best i can do theres just not enough points the reality of identification through fingerprints is not nearly as simple or as easy as a thousand copsandrobbers movies have made the publicand in fact a surprising number of law enforcement officersthink it is fingerprints are identifiedand compared with others through a system of point location and the classification of these points the more points on a print the better the more printsprints of more than one finger of the heel of the hand or ten fingers and both heelsand the more classified points on each print the easier it is to find similarly classified prints in the files presupposing havingboth to compare comparing the print found on the visor hat left behind by the doer at the roy rogers restaurant with the print of the doer himself would be relatively simple and would just about positively identify the suspect but establishing the identity of the doer by finding a match of his indexfinger print among the hundreds of thousands of indexfinger prints in the files of the philadelphia police department or the millions in the fbis files was a practical impossibility except if a print could be obtained with many good points that could be point classified j richard candelle philadelphias fingerprint expert had just not been able to detect enough points on the single index finger print he had to offer even a slight chance of matching it with a print in the files fuck thats not good enough harris said bitterly i will elect not to consider that a personal criticism and under these circumstances forgive your vulgarity candelle whose forensic laboratory skills were legendary was a dignified man befitting his parttime status as an adjunct professor of chemistry at temple university it wasnt a shot at you dick and you know it harris said candelle waited until he saw what he thought was a genuine look of regret on harriss face and then went on i was here all fucking night tony i had two fucking doughnuts for breakfast my fucking feet hurt and i have had every fucking white shirt in the roundhouse in here making sure i was really doing my fucking best harris looked at him well in that case you fucking overworked old fart i guess i better buy you some fucking lunch before you fucking expire of starvation old age and selfpity right here in the fucking lab i think that would be an appropriate gesture of your gratitude candelle replied smiled and started to replace his laboratory coat with a sports coat using tweezers candelle picked up the crownless visor cap the doer had left behind in the roy rogers and replaced it in the plastic evidence bag you want me to hang on to this tony no give it to me maybe ill take it to a psychic candelle chuckled i really am sorry tony he said harris punched him affectionately on the arm we both are dick he said what do you feel like eating they went to dinics in the reading terminal market on twelfth street and sat on stools at a counter both ordered roast pork sandwiches with sharp provolone cheese and roasted hot peppers and washed them down with beer i hate to reopen a wound candelle said but i just had another unpleasant thought which is its really a shame luther stecker retired whos he the state police guy in harrisburg lieutenant oh yeah i dont think he could have done anything you couldnt harris said i hadnt heard hed retired candelle looked at his watch today he said i was invited to his retirement party tonight i decided harrisburg was too far to drive for free beer what makes you think he could have helped hes got a new machine afis it stands for automated fingerprint identification system and its supposed to be able to get points off a weekold print on a dry falling leaf in a high wind youre serious candelle nodded harrisburg here i come tony said i told you steckers retiring today well there ought to be somebody else out there who knows how to operate this wonder machine tony if i thought there was id suggest you go out there well wont the fbi have one harris asked as a last desperate move im going to send the goddamn hat to them they probably have a halfdozen of them but whether they have anybody who knows how to use one get all that it is capable of from it is another question he paused then added theres a question of experience even art in this so were dead huh candelle shrugged it looks that way im sorry so what are you going to do now were down to showing the artists sketches to everybody again and we both know thats not going to work everybody in the place saw somebody else at the risk of repeating myself tony im really sorry i couldnt do more maybe the fbill be able to youre sure nobody in the state police could do us any good whos taking steckers place i met the gentleman candelle said he left me with the impression he would have trouble finding his posterior with both hands great harris drove his crown victoria to the rear door of the roundhouse youre not coming in candelle asked no im going to go somewhere to try to figure out what to tell the black buddha he said ill do that for you tony candelle said before i go home i dont want him calling me at the house to have one more shot at it turn over the stone under the stone were out of stones on this hat tony candelle said and i think the black buddhas more likely to accept that from me than you good luck harris said he held out his hand to candelle thanks a lot dick i really appreciate all the effort im just sorry it didnt get us anywhere candelle said nodded closed the car door and walked toward the roundhouse entrance tony started to drive out of the parking lot but at the last moment pulled into a vacant space took out his cellular telephone and punched the key that automatically dialed directory information what city please fuck it tony said and punched the end key he backed out of the parking space then left the parking lot wondering what was the best way to get onto interstate this time of day jason he said aloud if you want the last goddamn stone under the stone turned over ill damned well turn the sonofabitch over ten minutes later just as he turned onto i west his cellular buzzed harris presumably you are aware of professor candelles lieutenant jason washingtons unmistakable dulcet voice said i was there and what are your plans now im thinking jason and may i inquire about what no not now may i dare to hope that when you feel comfortable in telling me you will call dont hold your breath jason this is probably one more blind alley sometimes at the end of a blind alley one finds a stone washington began thank you for sharing that with me lieutenant tony interrupted ill write it down so that i wont forget it good afternoon detective harris washington said and the hiss that followed told harris washington had hung up he tossed the cellular onto the seat so hes a little pissed that i wont tell him better that than to tell him get his hopes up and then get kicked in the teeth again when this doesnt work two matt arrived at the north philadelphia airport at half past two to find that he was ahead of lieutenant mcguire but not of the eighth district captain who was supervising more than a dozen of his uniforms in setting up barriers to keep what looked like sixty or seventymaybe moreof stan colts fans under control matt looked closer and saw that there were two barriers one for the fansa surprising number of whom were grayhaired adultsand a second for the press he was wondering if he should at least identify himself to the eighth district captain when lieutenant mcguire arrived got out of his car waved at matt and then went to talk to the captain four highway bikes arrived next in a roar of engines under a sergeant mcguire pointed out where they should park and when they had the highway sergeant took off his helmet and hung it on his handlebar matt then recognized him as the sergeant who had been on knights road the night before the night before that seems like two weeks ago he walked over to matt hows the face he asked its sore and i went to hahnemann this morning and they gave me shots and now my ass hurts the sergeant chuckled you did get to see detective coleman at northeast right just came from there i appreciate the help last night all of it i know guys on the job wouldnt have done what you did the sergeant said theyd say fuck it ive had a couple of drinks why take the chance of getting my ass in a crack i wasnt being noble i just did it you were being a good cop the sergeant said good cops take care of each other detective charley mcfadden walked up to them what happened to your face he asked wheres man mountain martinez matt asked ignoring the question he took a dive onto a concrete driveway running down the guy in the hot grand am who smacked the van on knights road the highway sergeant offered helpfully that was you charley asked wheres martinez matt asked again hell be here in a minute what have mutt and jeff got to do with this nonsense the highway sergeant asked sergeant charley said thats what ive been trying to get sergeant payne to explain a white lincoln stretch limousine rolled up mcguire signaled to the driver to put it behind the highway bikes our heros chariot i guess the highway sergeant said thats a classic livery limo matt said i wonder if we should tell our hero hes being ferried around by the mob the highway sergeant and mcfadden who knew that classic livery was one of philadelphia mob boss vincenzo savareses legitimate businesses chuckled a black cadillac a black crown victoria and a black buick park avenue rolled onto the tarmac the mayor and the commissioner the highway sergeant said i think thats one of the cardinals cars but theres no one in it that mystery was immediately explained when both the hon alvin w martin mayor of the city of philadelphia and monsignor schneider climbed out of the cadillac police commissioner ralph j mariani got quickly out of the passengers front seat of the crown victoria and walked up to them i guess i better start looking busy the highway sergeant said and started to walk back to the highway bikes as he passed the mayor and party he saluted commissioner mariani waved him over a moment later the highway sergeant pointed to matt and a moment after that started to walk quicklyalmost trotback to where matt and mcfadden were standing the commissioner wants to see you the highway sergeant said oh shit matt muttered and walked over good morning mr mayor commissioner monsignor matt said my goodness monsignor schneider said what happened to your face i lost my footing chasing a fellow last night monsignor how was that sergeant the mayor asked i was chasing a car thief sir the one on knights road commissioner mariani asked yes sir correct me if im wrong sergeant the commissioner said but it was a little more than that wasnt it the fellow ran a light slammed into a family in a van and sent them all to the hospital and then left the scene yes sir i saw that in the paper the mayor said did you catch him monsignor schneider asked yes sir you really do get around dont you sergeant the monsignor said admiringly whats with the hand the commissioner asked i bruised it on the driveway sir and still managed to catch this fellow the monsignor asked yes sir what did you do walk up on it sergeant mariani asked yes sir i was taking a detectivewe were working on the williamson jobhome and it happened right in front of us and how is that going schneider asked the williamson job i think you said well sir we have a pretty good psychological profile of the doer that should help us find him and we have some pretty good evidence to put him away once we do for example the monsignor interrupted with all respect monsignor im not supposed to talk about details of an ongoing investigation and thats a good rule and im pleased to see youre paying attention to it commissioner mariani said but id like to know and i think the mayor would and neither the mayor nor me is about to ask monsignor schneider to give us a moment alone im sure he understands why my lips are sealed sergeant the monsignor said yes sir matt said there was sperm at the scene sir they are already doing the dna once we catch this fellow get another dna sample from him and match it itll prove conclusively that he was at the scene the certainty of a dna match is on the order of several million to one monsignor commissioner mariani pronounced absolutely fascinating the monsignor said i was just telling the commissioner and the mayor sergeant that when i last spoke with stan he made it pretty clear that while hes hereand we dont have him occupiedhed like to spend some time watching the policespecifically you sergeant at work i confess i hadnt thought about what you just said about your having to be closemouthed about details of an ongoing investigation i dont think that would be any problem with mr colt the mayor said do you commissioner the problem mr mayor mariani replied would be making sure that mr colt understood that whatever he saw or heard when he was with sergeant payne couldnt go any further i dont think that would be a problem at all monsignor schneider said im sure stan would understand after all hes played a detective on the screen so often the commissioner smiled a little wanly matt thought a traffic unit sergeant walked up to them saluted and said commissioner mr colts airplanes about to land three lieutenant ross j mueller of the forensic laboratory of the pennsylvania state police in harrisburg rose to his feet and extended his hand when tony harris was shown into his office what can we do for you detective he asked smiling cordially mueller was a very large muscular man who wore a tightfitting uniform and his hair in a crew cut tony remembered what dick candelle had said about him probably having trouble finding his ass with both hands thank you for seeing me sir tony said but i really hoped i could see lieutenant stecker mueller looked at his watch at the end of this tourin other words in an hour and five minuteslieutenant stecker will hang up his uniform hat for the last time and enter a welldeserved retirement im taking his place now how can headquarters help philadelphia sir im working a homicide in what capacity sir as the lead detective one of the investigators in what capacity im the lead detective on the job sir and youre here officially yes sir im here officially i thought perhaps that was the case i dont recall hearing that you were coming sir i just got in the car and came out here you didnt check with your supervisor so that he could make an appointment for you no sir i did not and who is your supervisor lieutenant jason washington sir i dont believe ive had the pleasure lieutenant mueller said writing washingtons name on a lined pad if you dont know who jason washington is herr storm trooper you really cant find your ass with both hands could you give me his phone number please lieutenant mueller asked tony gave him from memory the number of the commanding officer of the k unit of the philadelphia police department it was in his memory because he had noticed that it was identical except for the last two digits which were reversed to that of the homicide unit he had made the quick judgment that despite his implied offer to help lieutenant mueller was going to be part of the problem not a solution im going to call your lieutenant and introduce myself lieutenant mueller said and suggest the next time he thinks we can help philadelphia he call and set up an appointment yes sir sir i wasnt aware that was necessary and i dont think lieutenant washington is either probably not mueller said smiling but youve heard im sure detective harris was it yes sir that a new broom sweeps clean yes sir ive heard that im the new broom around here yes sir but youre here so how may we be of assistance sir as i said im working a homicide we have a visor hat like a baseball cap without a crown that the doer left at the scene our lab specifically mr richard candelle has been able to lift only a partial thats probably an index finger candelle you say yes sir i believe i have met your mr candelle africanamerican isnt he yes sir he is go on detective harris i was hoping that you could have a look at it and see if you couldnt find more than we have we have as you might not be aware an automated fingerprint identification system yes sir ive heard that its stateoftheart technology in the hands of an expert ive been certified in its use myselfit sometimes can do remarkable things yes sir well well have a look at it for you detective and get word back to you within possibly seventytwo hours sir id sort of hoped to stick around until you take a hotel room you mean well if thats all right with your supervisor its fine with me as i say were talking about three days if things go well i meant today sir thats out of the question im afraid you just leave the evidence item with me and well get to it as soon as possible the thing is lieutenant my supervisor lieutenant washingtonyoure sure you dont know him quite sure id remember a name like that well sir lieutenant washington wants to ship the hat theevidence itemto the fbi lab first thing in the morning well that solves our problem then doesnt it the fbi really knows how to handle this sort of thing thank you for seeing me sir and im sorry i didnt have an appointment just dont do it again in the future detective no sir i wont four the airplane a cessna citation came in from over bucks county touched down smoothly and began to taxi to the terminal nesfoods international had a citation either identical to this one or very nearly identical to it matts father had told him he had to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to convince the internal revenue service that when the nesbitts father andor son and their families rode it to kentucky or florida the purpose was business not to watch the kentucky derby or lie on the sands of palm beach the citation stopped two hundred feet from them and ground handlers went quickly to it to chock the wheels the mayor the commissioner and the monsignor started to walk toward it the commissioner turned and signaled for matt to come with them the door rotated open revealing stairs as theyand a gaggle of photographers and reporters holding microphones approached the airplane matt saw what looked like a fat woman sporting a dirty blonde pageboy haircut and wearing pajamas come quickly out of the door and down the stairsthen noticed the goatee the man held one mm camera with an enormous lens in his hands and another with a slightly smaller lens hung from his neck he knelt to the right and aimed his camera at the door stan colt appeared in the doorway smiling and ducking his head go down a couple of steps the fat photographer ordered colt obeyed he carefully went down two steps then waved and flashed a wide smile he was wearing blue jeans a knit polo shirt and a philadelphia ers jacket his fans applauded some whistled colt came down the rest of the stairs and walked to monsignor schneider who enthusiastically shook his hand and introduced him to the mayor and the commissioner who both enthusiastically shook his hand jesus hes a hell of a lot smaller and shorter than he looks in the movies photographs were taken and the momentous occasion was both recorded on videotape and flashed via satellite to at least two of philadelphias tv stations which interrupted their regular programming to bringliveto their viewers images of mr colts arrival matt saw that a young man his age and a prematurely grayhaired woman matt guessed was probably in her late thirties had begun to take luggage from both the cabin and the baggage compartment both were stylishly dressed matt had no idea who they were but presumed they had been on the airplane when they had all the luggage off the plane they began to carry it to a black gmc yukon xl on the doors of which was a neat sign reading classic livery the side windows of the truck were covered with dark translucent plastic matt knew that the truckthere were several just like itwas usually used to move cadavers from hospitals to funeral homes that rented their funeral limousines from classic livery he wondered if the truck was going to be able to haul all the luggage the commissioner indicated the white limousine colt nodded then sort of trotted over to the fans behind their barriers shook hands kissed two of the younger females and then waving sort of trotted to the white limousine and ducked inside the fat photographer got in the front seat the mayor and the commissioner got in the back hi terry davis said he hadnt seen her get off the citation jesus she looks good hi youre going wherever they go from here im afraid so he said got room for me absolutely he saw that she had two large pieces of what he thought of as limp luggage and a squarish item he thought was probably a makeup kit plus an enormous purse my cars over there he said gesturing in the general direction will all this stuff fit in a porsche thecitys car he said its a ford when he picked up her limp luggage his left hand hurt what did you do to your face terry asked as she picked up her own bag i fell down matt said as he started to walk to the crown victoria he saw that detective jesus martinez had finally shown up he was standing with mcfadden and they did he thought indeed look like mutt and jeff you better follow me matt said and his voice was drowned out by the roar of the highway bikes starting up you better follow me matt repeated his hand hurt again when he loaded terrys luggage into the backseat by the time terryd gotten in and hed gotten the engine started mcfadden and martinez had pulled their identical unmarked crown victorias in behind him and the convoy had left he could see the gmc and four assorted vehicles bearing the press bringing up the end of it disappearing around the corner of the administration building discretion forbade racing to catch up with the convoy he knew where it was going he could probably catch up with it on i but when he reached the airport exit it was barred by a line of cars stopped by two eighth district uniforms and a sergeant apparently charged with seeing that mr colts fans did not join the convoy matt drove to the side of the line of cars and when he reached the head of it reached under the dash and pushed the button that caused the blue lights under the grille to flash and the siren to start to growl the uniform sergeant waved the first fans car through the gate then waved matt through the space he had occupied with mcfadden and martinez following so tell me about the face terry said when he had caught up with the convoy and was driving a stately fiftyfive miles per hour down i at the end of it i was trying to stop a homicidal maniac from detonating an atom bomb and ending life as we know it on our planet terry giggled it was an accurate synopsis of stan colts last opus and in so doing i fell down and landed on your face correct but you caught the bad guy yeah what did he do stole a car ran a red light and slammed into a family in their van thats awful but what did it have to do with you i saw the crash that made it my business stan will love that story terry said please dont tell him matt said she looked at him strangely okay if you dont want me to five lieutenant luther stecker of the pennsylvania state police had obviously just finished shaving when his doorbell rang for he answered the door in a sleeveless undershirt with a towel hanging from his neck and with vestiges of shaving cream under his chin and near his left ear he was a small and wiry man who wore what was left of his gray hair in a crew cut he waited wordlessly for his caller to announce his purpose lieutenant stecker tony harris asked stecker nodded sir im detective harris from philadelphia homicide stecker nodded and waited for harris to go on im working a job and i really need your help this is my last day on the job whyd you come here i went by the lab sir and saw lieutenant mueller and again stecker waited expressionlessly for him to go on lieutenant dick candelle said if anybody can come up with enough points from what ive got its you you know candelle yes sir we go back a while and he couldnt develop enough points from what youve got no sir but all he had to work with was a partial sir probably an index finger a plump pleasantlooking woman appeared behind stecker what she asked this is detective harris from homicide in philadelphia did you tell him this is your last day on the job and that she looked at her watch in an hour and ten minutes youre having your retirement party at the pennharris tell me about the job stecker said two black guys held up a roy rogers harris said they killed a puerto rican lady thats terrible the gray haired lady said sucking in her breath and then when a uniforma friend of mine nice guy kenny charlton eighteen years on the job two kids responded to the robbery in progress one of the doerswho was wearing the visor hat cap ive gotstuck a under his vest and blew him away stecker didnt say anything the only tie we have to these critters is this tony said he held up the plastic evidence bag containing the crownless visor cap thats all no witnesses nothings worked grace why dont you get detective harris a cup of coffee and a piece of cake while i put my shirt on luther your party starts in an hour and ten minutes you told me lieutenant stecker said six the chancellery of the archdiocese of philadelphia was prepared for the photo op presented by mr stan colt paying a courtesy call upon the cardinal the cardinal just happened to be on the ground floor of the chancellery as the highway bikes lieutenant mcguires unmarked car the white lincoln limousine and the mayoral cadillac limo rolled up it that permitted the recording for posterity of images of the cardinal warmly greeting mr colt as he got out of the limo the hon alvin w martin had to move quickly to get in that shot but he made it the cardinal the mayor and mr colt preceded by the fat photographer in the pageboy haircut then entered the building lieutenant mcguire trotted after them turned at the door spotted matt getting out of his car and signaled for him to come along are you going in there matt asked terry davis thats what i get paid for she said when they reached the cardinals office there was a delegation of faculty from west catholic high school lined up to shake mr colts hand and to welcome him back to his alma mater the mayor didnt manage to get in that shot but he did manage to get in another shot in front of the cardinals desk of the cardinal the principal of west catholic monsignor schneider and mr colt then after shaking hands a final time mr colt again preceded by the fat photographer moving backward and frantically snapping pictures left the cardinals office mr colt stopped when he saw terry davis wheres the homicide detective he demanded terry pointed at matt mr colts eyebrows rose in surprise or disbelief and then he moved on as the procession went back through the lobby matt heard the engines of the highway bikes roar to life the mayor of philadelphia shook mr colts hand a final time said he looked forward to seeing him a little later and then walked back to the mayoral limousine mr colt paused as he was about to enter the limousine spotted terry davis and called hes going to be at the hotel right right stan terry called back mr colt nodded then got in the white limousine the fans who had somehow learned that mr colt would be staying at the ritzcarlton and had waited there in hopes of seeing him and perhaps even getting his autograph touching him or perhaps coming away with a piece of his clothing were disappointed all they got was a smile and a wave aspreceded yet again by the fat photographer running backwardcolt went quickly into the hotel and through the lobby to a waiting elevator stan colt was sprawled on a couch in the sitting room of his suite taking a pull from a bottle of beer from the dock street brewery when lieutenant mcguire sergeant payne and miss terry davis were ushered into his presence by the grayhaired stylishly dressed woman matt had seen carrying luggage from the citation the stylishly dressed young man from the airport was talking on a telephone on a sideboard with that out of the way terry whats next stan colt greeted them theres a cocktail party at the bellvuestratfordits right around the corner i know where it is sweetheart im from here at sixthirty black tie the limo will be here at sixfifteen where the hell did that virginal white one come from you want another color terry asked colt pointed to the young man on the telephone thats what lex is doing he said getting a black one the cocktail party will be over at seventhirty which leaves the question of dinner open i think you can count on at least one invitation let me think about that he said he recognized lieutenant mcguire for the first time youre the security guy right im lieutenant mcguire of dignitary protection mr colt mr colts somewhat contemptuous shrug indicated he considered that a distinction without a difference and youre the homicide detective right im sergeant payne but homicide right youre the guy that was in the gun battle in doylestown monsignor schneider told me about matt nodded no offense but you dont look the part perhaps thats because im not an actor matt said you lookand for that matter sound likeyoure a wasp from the main line do i really maybe thats because i am indeed a white anglosaxon protestant who was raised in wallingford thats not the main line but i take your point matt saw that lieutenant mcguire was being made very uncomfortable by the exchange why am i getting the feeling sergeant colt asked that you would rather be somewhere else youre perceptive colt chuckled you want to tell me what youd rather be doing i was working a homicide before the commissioner assigned me to sit on you sit on me that sounds a little erotic kinky you know it means that my orders are to see that you dont do anything while youre here that will embarrass in any way anybody connected with this charitable gesture of yours for example payne lieutenant mcguire said warningly let me put it this way mr colt matt said as long as youre in philadelphia the virtue of chastity will have to be its own reward for you terry davis giggled you telling me i think that i dont get to fool around colt asked thats right not even a little not even a little you understand who i am thats why you dont get to fool around even a little colt turned to terry davis you think this is funny dont you youre the one who said you wanted to hang out with a real live homicide cop and i do i do and i really like this guy this is better than i hoped for he turned to matt i am going to get to watch you work right the commissioner said i was to show you as much about how homicide works as i think i can which means what i will show you everything i can so long as doing so doesnt interfere with an investigation and you make that call right and what if i complain to him colt asked pointing to mcguire hes a lieutenant right and youre a sergeant the lieutenants job is to protect you matt said mine is to ensure your chastity colt was now smiling that may be harder than you think he said you think you can stay awake twentyfour hours a day no but theres two detectives in the corridor whove also been assigned to the chastity detail colt glanced at the stylishly dressed young man who had just hung up the telephone well he asked curtly youll have a black limo in the morning stan but not tonight its the best i could do not good enough alex colt snapped call somebody else for christs sake i dont want to arrive at this place looking like tinkerbell then he had another thought you going to the cocktail party sergeant payne matt looked at mcguire who nodded and then nodded himself you must have a police car any reason i cant ride with you no will there be room for everybody alex asked whos everybody matt asked me jeanette terry and eddie jeanette matt decided must be the grayhaired woman eddies the character with the pageboy he asked my personal photographer colt furnished no matt said eddie goes everywhere with me colt said they all do they dont go everywhere with you when youre with me matt said your call mr colt youre a real hardass payne colt said admiringly im going with payne the rest of you can go in the wedding limo he turned to matt and after this party thing youll show me stuff right if you like matt said seven were here sergeant payne said to mr colt after they had rolled up to the broad street entrance of the bellvuestratford hotel third in line behind lieutenant mcguires unmarked and the white lincoln limo behind them were three unmarked cars one belonging to dignitary protection and the other two to detectives martinez and mcfadden matt had taken a leaf from the uniforms who had kept colts fans from leaving the north philadelphia airport and had ordered mcfadden and martinez to keep eddie the photographer and anybody else from following matts car when it left the hotel dont get your balls in an uproar im waiting for eddie to get out of the limo eddie the photographer got quickly out of the limo sort of knelt and prepared to photograph mr colts arrival at the bellvuestratford come on payne colt said ill catch up with you inside matt said ive got to park the car no first you let eddie take our picture and then you park the car i dont think so matt said if you dont let him take our picture now ill tell him i changed my mind and he gets to go with us when we leave here thatll be hard to do after mcfadden handcuffs him to that brass rail hey its matt right right im meeting you halfway matt hes shot two hundred pictures since we got here and the only one thatll do me any good is this one excuse me the real press doesnt give a shit about one more picture of me shaking hands with a mayor or even a cardinal but stan colt with areal homicide sergeant thats news come on get out and smile i dont want my picture in the goddamn newspapers tough shit either now or he follows us around all night he paused then did a very creditable mimicry of matt your call sergeant payne matt got out of the car look serious but think of pussy mr colt whispered to sergeant payne as following eddie the photographers hand signals he moved matt where eddie wanted them inside the grand ballroom of the bellvuestratford sergeant payne hurried to answer commissioner marianis summons a crooked finger yes sir colt just told the mayor how grateful he is for the opportunity to quote hang out unquote with you yes sir what are you going to do with him i thought id show him liberties bar and if nobody from homicide is there take him to homicide and if somebody from homicide is in liberties hope i can get them talking about closed cases commissioner mariani nodded when they saw that sergeant payne and mr colt had gotten into the crown victoria two whitecapped traffic unit uniforms stopped traffic moving in both directions on south broad street and then one of them gestured to sergeant payne who then made a uturn that saw him headed toward city hall the traffic uniforms then blew their whistles and gestured restoring traffic to its normal flow and incidentally effectively preventing anyone from following matts unmarked car thanks guys detective mcfadden called to the uniforms and gave a thumbsup gesture detectives mcfadden and martinez then got into their unmarked cars and drove off the members of the press who were cleverly prepared to follow them did so they followed martinez to the ritzcarlton front door where he parked his car and went inside to await the return of sergeant payne and mr colt or the arrival at midnight of detective mcfadden whichever came first the members of the press who followed detective mcfadden drove deep into south philadelphia where he pulled the unmarked half onto the curb in front of a row house on fitzgerald street then went inside to catch a couple of hours sleep before relieving hayzus at the ritzcarlton arent i going to stand out like a sore thumb in this mr colt inquired of sergeant payne indicating his dinner jacket maybe we could stop by the hotel and let me change not at all matt said were going to liberties bar and the last time i was there my boss was there dressed just like that youre bullshitting me right boy scouts honor matt said were you a boy scout yes as a matter of fact i was me too colt said well what the hell he pulled open his black bow tie there were no members of the homicide division in liberties bar we can wait a couple of minutes and see if somebody shows up matt said i will have one of three drinks i allow myself a day colt said this will be number two i had a beer at the hotel youallow yourself three drinks a day matt asked if i have more than that i get in trouble colt said sometimes i have four if like i have one at lunch and a beer in the afternoon then i might have two at night but never any more than that they had a drink matt ordered a scotch on the rocks coltat matts suggestiona bushmills martini aka an irish doctors special when the bartender delivered them he looked closely at colt anybody ever tell you you look a lot like stan colt yeah lots of people any of the guys from homicide been in matt asked earlier the bartender said colt looked at matt you get stuck with the tab he said alex has my dough and you didnt want him to come matt laid a bill on the bar ill get that back to you my pleasure matt said alex is not here colt took a sip of his drink i like this he said good so whats the plan now you sit on me here nobody from homicide shows up eventually i get sleepy and finish your drink well take a run past homicide matt said good stan colt said nice stan colt said visavis detective olivia lassiter who was sitting at a desk with a phone to her ear very matt agreed he saw that captain quaire and lieutenant jason washington were in quaires office detective lassiter this is mr colt matt said olivia gave him her hand and a smile but didnt say anything whats going on in there matt asked olivia shrugged they both came in about an hour ago she started to add something to that but then directed her attention to the telephone good evening lieutenant thank you for taking my call my name is lassiter philadelphia homicide and im working a job matt took colts arm and propelled him toward the coffee machine and shes a homicide detective too colt asked matt nodded shes been on that phone most of day matt said calling every police department in the country looking for a similar job to one were working on here the one you were working on before you were told to sit on me matt nodded its a rape murder real sicko ties young women up cuts off their clothes with a large knife and then jerks off onto them jesus and then takes their picture this time he killed the victim and you dont know who he is we havent a clue if we ever find himthats what lassiter is doing on the phone other detectives are looking down other streetswe can probably get a conviction but first we have to find him colts face was serious as he absorbed this i have to check in with my boss matt said pointing at quaires glasswalled office ill be right back ill talk to her colt said take your time and then he saw something on matts face do i detect that your interest in the lady detective is not entirely professional ill be right back matt said and walked to captain quaires office and knocked on the door quaire waved him in ive got stan colt out there sir i can see now can you get him out of here ill try tony went to harrisburg washington explained and talked lieutenant stecker their print expert into going late to his retirement party he and tony are still at the state police lab running the print through the afis presuming the doers prints are on file and we get a match from the machine tony will contact us so get mr colt out of here and the sooner the better captain quaire ordered if theres a match everybody and his brother will be in here and he shouldnt he seems to be stricken with detective lassiter washington said may i suggest you take both of them someplace while she at great length explains how we are working the williamson job can i send her in here so you can tell her that make it quick quaire said yes sir matt walked to olivia and told her the boss wanted to see her when she was out of earshot colt asked what was that all about i just got permission from the captain for her to tell you whats going on with the williamson job thats the guy who colt asked moving his hand in a pumping motion cheryl ann williamson is the victim matt said but yeah olivia came out of quaires office looking more than a little unhappy where are we going to do this could we do it over dinner stan colt asked in his most charming manner you mean in a restaurant i was thinking of my place colt said at the ritzcarlton we could be alone and get room service you were planning to come along sergeant olivia asked absolutely matt said i havent had my dinner olivia said then its settled stan colt said he punched matt affectionately on the shoulder i really appreciate this matt fourteen one it was either a light rain or a heavy drizzle and deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin holding an umbrella over his head with his right hand stood at the gas charcoal grill in the backyard of jeanes street in northwest philadelphia wondering if he could trust the brandnew stateoftheart electronic thermometer stuck in one of the two rolledandtied tenderloins of beef on the grill it indicated that the interior temperature of the meat was degrees fahrenheit which in turn meant according to the instruction manual that when permitted to rest for five minutes the meat should be just a little more done than rare denny coughlin didnt think so it didnt look nearly that done to him to hell with it coughlin muttered and reached for the very longhandled stainlesssteel knife part of a master grillers kitknife fork and grillscraperthat had been another gift from coughlin to chief inspector retired august and mrs olga wohl at whose grill he was standing when he tried to cut the loin that was not electronically connected to the interior temperature gauge the perfectly tiedandrolled meat rolled across the grill but remained uncut shit chief inspector coughlin muttered laid the umbrella upside down on the grass picked up the extralonghandled fork from the master grillers kit impaled the tenderloin with the sensor in it sliced it halfway through and examined it carefully ill be damned he said the thermometer was telling the truth he looked up in annoyance at the sky it had suddenly begun to rain harder much harder he looked back at the tenderloins the flexible metal cord connecting the sensor impaled precisely in the center of one of them would have to be removed before he could move the meat to the platter he touched it gingerly and it didnt seem to bethat hot he got a decent grip on it and gave it a tug it remained impaled he picked up the fork again and using the fork to hold the meat in place tugged harder the sensor came free suddenly which caused coughlin in the moment in which he realized the goddamn thing was burning his fingers and let go of it to throw both the sensor the metal cord and the stainless steel easytoread dishwashersafe interior temperature indicating device into the grass of chief wohls backyard there were cheers whistles and applause from chief wohls back porch where chief wohl chief inspector of detectives matthew lowenstein inspector peter wohl captain frank hollaran and mr michael j ohara were standing out of the rainwatching the master chef at work after glancing momentarily at the porch commissioner coughlin impaled the tenderloins one after the other and placed them on the plattera stainlesssteel plate with blood grooves resting in a depression in a wooden plate with handles yet another culinary gift to the wohls then he balanced the platter on his right hand like a waiter and sort of squatted to pick up the umbrella then he marched toward the porch under the umbrella and somewhat unsteadily climbed the stairs to further whistles cheers and applause from the men standing on it you can all kiss my royal irish ass commissioner coughlin announced five minutes later commissioner coughlin fresh from drying his face and hair sat down to table with everybody which now included mrs olga wohl mrs sarah lowenstein and mrs barbara hollaran at a table heavily laden with what else they were going to eat ive got to get one of those little digital cameras and carry it with me chief lowenstein said id love to have pictures of the master chef at work i already told you what you can do coughlin said and yes augie thank you for asking i will have a glass of that wine ive got mine mickey ohara said holding up his camera but ive seen that angry irishman look in his eyes before and didnt think id better twenty minutes after that as sarah lowenstein poured coffee and appropriate comments of approval were being offered visavis the chocolate cake barbara hollaran had prepared for the nearly ritual onceeveryotherweek supper at the wohls commissioner coughlins cellular phone buzzed he took it from his shirt pocket said hold one before his caller had a chance to say anything and handed the cellular to hollaran who quickly went into the kitchen hollaran returned almost immediately commissioner its captain quaire he said formally coughlin nodded and reached for the phone whats up he asked listened and said ill get right back to you dont do anything until i do he pushed the end button and holding the cellular in his palm looked thoughtfully at it a moment mickey this is out of school okay sure ohara said what is it denny chief wohl asked weve identified one of the doers in the roy rogers job he said tony harris went to the state police fingerprint guy lieutenant stecker who worked some kind of magic with their new afis machine and was able to get enough points to let us run them and he stopped in midsentence and forestalled any other questions by punching his way through the stored numbers on the cellular until he found what he wanted and then pressing call ben denny coughlin i apologize for calling you at home he stopped and laughed what denny chief wohl asked ben solomon told me to take two aspirin and call him in the morning coughlin said and then his voice suddenly grew serious as mrs solomon aka the district attorney of philadelphia came on the line eileen weve identified one of the doers in the roy rogers homicide and now have a pretty good idea who the other one is he said i thought id better let you know there was a pause and then he continued tony harris got the state police using some kind of a new machine they have to get enough printspointsfrom a hat a visor one of them left at the scene pause yeah thats it eileen but once we arrest them im pretty sure some of the witnesses will be able to pick them out of a lineup pause no henry quaires getting the warrant as we speak pause whatever you say eileen is unger there you want me to send a car pause okay thirty minutes in my office pause matts here were at augie wohls house pause thirty minutes thanks eileen he took the phone from his ear and pushed end the district attorney says she wants to make sure this is done right shes going to meet us in my office in thirty minutes just you two peter wohl asked thats what she said what are you driving at the last i heard this job was given to a special operations task force jesus i forgot about that coughlin said peter why dont you just happen to be in homicide in case eileen wants to see you peter wohl nodded yes sir mickey you didnt hear any of this coughlin said when do i hear any of this ill let you know what happens when we meet with eileen but thatll probably still be off the record if youve identified these crumbs whats all this about in the words of our beloved district attorney we want to make goddamn sure these critters dont walk out of the courtroom because we did something stupid now that we finally know who they are coughlin said he rose to his feet eat barbaras cake and drink your coffee first olga wohl ordered firmly five minutes one way or the others not going to matter five minutes later the first radio call was made when frank hollaran took the microphone from beneath the dash and spoke into it radio c en route to the roundhouse from chief wohls residence immediately after that there were two more calls as dl chief inspector of detectives lowenstein and sl inspector wohl special operations reported that they too were on their way from chief wohls house to the roundhouse two i dont know what im doing here eileen police commissioner ralph j mariani said as he walked into deputy commissioner coughlins conference room youre the police commissioner ralph the hon eileen mcnamara solomon replied matteroffactly i thought you ought to be on this so i asked al unger to call you there were several shadings to their relationship the most important was that commissioner mariani served at the pleasure of the hon alvin w martin mayor of the city of philadelphia the mayor is one of the two senior officials in philadelphia who have no one to answer to but the law and the voters the other is the district attorney almost as important both the police commissioner and the district attorney felteven if they never articulated this beliefthat the burden of protecting the citizens of the city of brotherly love from the barbarians hung primarily from hisher shoulders alone and that the function of the other was to assist them in this noble pursuit as a practical matter both realized there had to be sort of a partnership arrangement to effectively keep the barbarians at the gate since neither could issue orders to the other in the relationship between district attorneys and police commissioners there were also the factors of respect trust and admiration in the past district attorneys and police commissioners had sometimes not respected trusted or admired each other at all eileen solomon and ralph mariani not only held each other in high professional regard but were also friends but in this case the truth was that eileen hadnt even thought of ralph when she asked denny to meet her in the roundhouse until she had called al unger to tell him she needed a ride and he had brought the subject up detective albert unger was the senior of the two members of the district attorneys squad who served as driverbodyguard for the da so far as heand otherswere concerned the da needed roundtheclock protection threats against her life had been made by a number of people he thought were perfectly capable of trying to whack her the da however firmly said she didnt want a cop in the lobby of her apartment building twentyfour hours a day much less hanging around in her apartment so a deal was struck a word was spoken into the ear of wachenhut security who provided the unarmed doorman conciergesecurity guard in the lobby of the luxury apartment building on the parkway in which dr and mrs solomon resided four new employees all of them retired philadelphia police officers were shortly afterward engaged to work the lobby of the apartment building all of them were licensed to carry firearms and all of them shared al ungers belief that there were critters who would like to whack the da whom all of the retired police officers held in very high regard the second part of the deal was a solemn promise by the dawhat would you like me to do al put one hand on a bible and swear to god she had asked in exasperation that she would never leave the apartment unless he knew where she was going and why this meant that ungeror somebody else from the squadwould either drive the da or follow her in an unmarked car whether she was riding in the doctors caddy or jogging along the parkway on her thriceweekly hourlong jaunts to keep her hips and thighs under control when the da had called al unger to say that she was sorry but she had to go to the roundhouse and right now he had naturally asked why and she had told him i didnt hear marianis name mentioned boss you think he should be there i think he ought to be asked if i dont ask him eileen had decided when he hears about it ralph will get his macho italian ego bruised and maybe decide denny went behind his back okay ask him she said ill be waiting downstairs in ten minutes detective unger had en route to the apartment made a radio call da to c go can you tell the commissioner that da is en route to the roundhouse and would like him to be there if he has the time there was a thirtysecond delay which detective unger had correctly presumed was how long it took to relay the message to the commissioner in the backseat and get a response da the commissioner will be there in thirty minutes commissioner mariani nodded at deputy commissioner coughlin and chief of detectives lowenstein and sat down in coughlins chair left vacant for him at the head of the table i didnt hear anything on the radio he said whats going on weve positively identified one of the doers in the roy rogers job coughlin said and have a pretty good idea who the other one is he fits the description hes the other guys cousin and hes been in trouble with the doer before good you could have told me that on the telephone who are they two young guys from the paschall homes housing project coughlin said you know seventysecond and elmwood in southwest philly mariani nodded lawrence john porter twenty the doer the one weve been calling the fat guy and ralph david williams nineteen coughlin went on neither has ever been in bad trouble before howd you find them tony harris went to harrisburg the state policeve got a new machine and they could lift more points from the print than candelle could here lowenstein said good points it wouldnt matter if they were ralph eileen said excuse me a federal judge refused to admit fingerprints in a triala trial herea couple of months back i heard something about that im not saying itll happen but we do have judges here who like to make law by following federal precedent if the prints are inadmissible all youve got is witnesses something wrong with that eileen all the defense has to do is create reasonable doubt in the mind of one juror she said and we all know the jury pool always contains a number of people who are simply unable to believe that any black kid ever did anything wrong youre not trying to tell me you think these two copkillers are going to walk im trying to tell you ralph that its a possibility which will become a certainty if we make any mistakes from here on in god damn it thats the bad news ralph coughlin said the good news might i say might be that we can find the murder weapon its a revolver and we have a bullet and can tie the weapon to either one of these two eileen interjected credibly tie it to either one of them or really get lucky and once theyre arrested they confess theyre just a couple of young punks coughlin went on which any public defender six months out of law school will contend was obtained by mental duress eileen said jesus lowenstein said or worse and i dont think we can count on these two being defended by an incompetent from the public defenders office this is murder two and they will assign the best man theyve got or worse than that some really competent defense lawyer will take itpro bono because this trials going to be all over the papers and tv youve got their sheets mariani asked lowenstein shoved a folder across the conference table to him theres not much he said a couple of shoplifting charges car burglaries that sort of thing mariani read the records of previous encounters with the law of the two suspects shrugged and then looked at eileen solomon okay eileen what do you think we should do i dont think we should rush to arrest these two until we have a better case matt told me he was concerned that these two having gotten away so far with the roy rogers job and knowing you can only be executed once might do the same sort of thing again just as soon as they spend what they took from the roy rogers mariani said but it was a question thats a valid concern and i share it eileen said so youre suggesting we just sit on these two until we can make a really tight case he asked she nodded now that we know who they are maybe we can get something from snitches lowenstein said for example whether or not they still have the mariani nodded and we could run their mug shots before some of the witnesses and see if it jogs their memory coughlin said taking great care with that so the defense cant claim we suggested whom the witnesses should pick out eileen said how soon could you start surveillance of these two mariani asked i can have detectives from southwest outside their door in however long it takes them to get there id rather use undercover cars which means i would have to have your permission to take a couplefive or six would be betterundercover cars away from the impact unit or internal affairs with a little luck i could have them in place in probably under an hour lowenstein said youve got my permission of course mariani said then had a second thought no you dont because you dont need it peter wohls already got the authority the mayor ordered the formation of a special operations task force for this job remember i remember lowenstein said thats right coughlin said hes already got authority to request support from everybody right mariani asked coughlin and lowenstein nodded the mayor gave wohl the job mariani said let him do it you better put the arm out for him hes downstairs in homicide with quaire and washington lowenstein said you already called him mariani asked i didnt have to we were all having dinner at augie wohls house when quaire called me coughlin said okay then denny mariani said and then his voice changed as he added formally under your supervision commissioner coughlin the special operations task force paying cognizance to the suggestions of the district attorney will proceed with the investigation so inform inspector wohl yes sir coughlin said then thats it mariani said eileen we all appreciate your support lets do this right eileen said we need to get those two off the street permanently three when the district attorney of philadelphia started to get off the roundhouse elevator at the first floor where the homicide division had its headquarters she saw the surprise on the faces of deputy commissioner coughlin and chief inspector lowenstein why not she asked im here and the last i heard i was welcome in homicide the last i heard there was no place in the department where you are not more than welcome at any time coughlin said and waved her off the elevator but i thought i detected a tone of annoyance in bens voice we have a deal she said i keep my mouth shut when the hospital calls ben and he keeps his shut when i have to work she chuckled what lowenstein asked one time when the hospital called i said oh hell ben not now and he replied you knew what you were getting into when you married a doctor coughlin looked confused isnt that what you cops tell your wives when they complain about the odd hours you have to keep the da asked lowenstein chuckled i dont have a wife i wouldnt know coughlin said they got off the elevator and walked down the corridor to homicide coughlin was not surprised that a lot of people would be in homicide but he was surprised at how many were actually there the suite of offices was crowded with a number of nonhomicide white shirts detectives and uniforms in or standing around the doorway of captain quaires office were quaire inspector peter wohl lieutenant jason washington detective tony harris captains frank hollaran and mike sabarawohls deputyboth in plainclothes captain stuart jenkins the commanding officer of the twelfth district which covered the paschall homes housing project where according to the addresses on their last arrest sheets both lawrence john porter and ralph david williams lived and captain dave pekach the highway patrol commander jenkins and pekach were in uniform in or standing around the doorway of the lieutenants officethe three homicide lieutenants who were rarely on duty at the same time shared an officewere lieutenant robert natali who was the tour lieutenant and sergeants zachary hobbs and ed mccarthy scattered aroundin some cases sitting onthe desks in the main area were detective al unger sergeant harry mcelroy chief lowensteins driver sergeant jerry odowd pekachs driver sergeant charley lomax sabaras driver and sergeant paul kittinger captain jenkinss driver kittinger and odowd were in uniform the term driver is somewhat misleading although all of these people did actually drive the cars assigned to their superiors they were far more than chauffeurs their official job was to relieve their bosses of what administrative details they could in addition to driving them around but it was actually more than that they had all been recognized as having both the ambition and the ability to rise higher in the police hierarchy and their assignment as drivers gave them a chance to see how their supervisors recognized and dealt with the problems that came their way in many waysexcept they never passed canapesdrivers were the police version of military aidesdecamp coughlin marched across the outer office to quaires office and stood for a moment in the doorway it looks he said smiling as if everybodys here but homicides newest sergeant wheres payne he was here commissioner captain quaire said with stan colt oh god coughlin said so i ran him off with the girl from northwest she isi told her to do it thoroughly and slowlybringing him up to speed on the williamson job clever coughlin said approvingly give us a minute alone with inspector wohl will you please everybody filed out of quaires office when only coughlin lowenstein solomon and wohl were left coughlin closed the door ive got a suggestion eileen he said shoot you tell peter what your concerns are ill tell him what his orders from the commissioner are and then the three of us leave she didnt reply and waited for him to go on the point will be made to everybody out there that theres a lot of interest in whats going on from us thats all thats really necessary and if we hang around it will look like were all going to be looking over his shoulder i dont want any question in anybodys mind about who has the responsibility and the authority in this the district attorney considered that for a full thirty seconds which seemed longer peter she said finally i dont want these two to walk because we get enthusiastic or careless and do something stupid before we arrest them i want a damned tight case against them i dont think we can safely rely on their fingerprintsor for that matter a confession now that defense attorneys have got their foot in the door with the successful challenges to fingerprints and confessions we need to add to what we have now tying them positively to the murder weapon for example would be nice wohl nodded his understanding ill pass the word that you get what you want when you want it chief lowenstein said yes sir wohl said thank you ive got an idea about that too coughlin said everybody out there is wondering what the hell were talking about in here so lets give them a little show matt you open the door and tell sergeant mcelroy to call southwest detectives and get captain calmon down here now to report to inspector wohl youre serious about that arent you denny eileen asked yes im serious i want to make sure everybody knows whos in charge lowenstein left the office called his driver over and told him what coughlin had told him to tell him then he went back into the office eileen started for the door where are you going eileen im going out there and tell al unger to call steve cohen and tell him to get right down here to advise peter she said she turned to wohl steves pretty bright and i think hell be useful if he gets in your way call me i know steve we get along but thanks eileen steven j cohen was one of the best of the more than two hundred assistant district attorneys of philadelphia eileen mcnamara solomon left quaires office spoke with detective al unger and then came back in deputy commissioner coughlin then left the office called captain hollaran over and told him to call the internal affairs division and the impact unit in his name ordering them to get a senior officer to homicide immediately to report to inspector wohl then he went back into the office can we go now denny eileen asked one more thing coughlin said inspector wohl your orders from the commissioner are the special operations task force paying cognizance to the suggestions of the district attorney will proceed with the investigation yes sir did i get that right eileen verbatim eileen said and paying cognizance to my suggestions inspector means before you arrest either of these two critters you check with me steve cohen wont do with me inspector yes maam wohl said dont maam me peter im not old enough to be your mother the district attorney said and left quaires office a moment later coughlin and lowenstein followed her four even as he was pulling the unmarked crown victoria into one of the spaces reserved for the hotel limousine and other important carsover the indignant both arms waving objections of the ritzcarlton doormanmatt saw eight ten maybe more members of the press start to rush toward it brandishing cameras and microphones do they always follow you around like this matt asked it is the price of celebrity stan colt said solemnly resignedly and then added in a normal voice and let me tell you buddy it gets to be a real pain in the ass the cars arrival stan colt in the front seat and the movement of the press had also been seen by sergeant al nevins of dignitary protection who had apparently stationed himself and two uniforms just inside the hotels door the three of them walked quickly to the car nevins opened the door and when colt got out the three of them made a wedge and escorted colt into the hotel once he was through the door the uniforms barred the press from following him matt and olivia got out of the car and went into the hotel nevins was standing by an open elevator door matt made the introductions sergeant nevins detective lassiter how are you nevins said but his surprise that olivia was a cop was evident on his face stan colt was in a rear corner of the elevator hiding himself as best he could matt and olivia got on the elevator and the door closed detective jesus martinez was sitting on a chair outside the double doors of the benjamin franklin suite reading the philadelphiadaily news when he saw them he stood up and knocked on the door what the hell are you doing out here matt asked this is where the guy inside told me to wait jesus said you had your dinner martinez shook his head no the suite door opened a crack and alex peered out then saw colt and opened the door all the way matt signaled for jesus to follow him into the room detective martinez is not a rentacop matt announced he doesnt sit in the corridor clear alex looked at colt what the hell is the matter with you alex colt snapped sorry stan alex said stan this is jesus martinez a detective from special operations im pleased to meet you colt said sounding as if he meant it hes half of your chastity squad matt said the other half will relieve him at midnight colt chuckled and held out his hand to martinez if you can get rid of these two he said ive got some phone numbers and we could have a party matt shook his head hayzus he said this is olivia lassiter from northwest they briefly shook hands it was obvious from the surprise on alexs face that he had taken one look at olivia and assumed stan colts trolling for companionship had been successful eddie the photographer and jeannette the secretary were in the room have you made a decision about dinner jeanette asked yeah here youre not invited colt said just me and the detectives youve got a menu she went to a sideboard and returned with a menu and handed it to him he handed it to olivia does jesus get to stay colt asked yes he does matt said good okay thank you thats all ill see you in the morning colt said they all filed out of the suite matt noticed that they had notexcept for the surprise on alexs faceacknowledged the presence of him hayzus or olivia at all theyre necessary colt said when they were gone and they do what theyre supposed to do well but sometimes having them around my neck all the time is worse than the goddamn press colt lay down on the couch and gestured for the others to sit down i was about to ask you if they have a cheese steak sandwich on there olivia but it has now occurred to me that if they do itll be a ritzcarlton cheese steak not a real one like from dallesandros on henry avenue i cant believe these prices olivia said well dont worry about them everythings on the studio colt said i wonder could we send out for a cheese steak it would be cold by the time it got here matt said well maybe later on colt said olivia handed the menu to matt inspire me she said i think you already do baby colt said give me the menu matt handed him the menu he glanced at it quickly anybody doesnt like shrimp cocktails no one spoke anybody morally or intellectually opposed to filet mignon no one spoke anyone determined to ruin a good steak by cooking it well done no one spoke but matt and olivia chuckled well that wasnt hard was it colt said and walked to the sideboard and picked up the telephone this is mr colt in i have no idea where i am but ill bet you can find out what we need right away is four shrimp cocktails four filet mignons medium rare all the appropriate side dishes and a couple of nice bottles of cabernet sauvignon thank you very much he hung up okay he said you can start now pause while they set up the table and then continue okay detective lassiter fine olivia said can i call you olivia or will your boyfriend here think im making a pass at you im not her boyfriend matt said hes not my boyfriend olivia said simultaneously methinks thou dost protest too much colt said in a surprisingly creditable british shakespearean accent hayzus matt said quickly the commissioner wants mr colt to see how hey i thought we were friends whats this mr colt shit the commissioner wantsstan to see how homicide works a job matt went on lassiter was next up on the wheel at northwest when the thirtyfifth uniform called in what turned out to be the williamson homicide for a couple of reasons shes been detailed to homicide for the job and captain quaire told her to bring stan up to speed on the job i wondered what was going on martinez said im still wondering colt said you want to say that again please slowly in english whats the wheel for example when room service delivered the dinnertwo rolling carts of itin what matt thought was an amazingly short time matt had just about finished explaining what the wheel was and how olivia and then homicide had become involved he interrupted his explanation as long as he couldthe object of the exercise was to keep colt out of the way of whatever was happening with the doers of the roy rogers joband then when colt insisted halfway through the steaks that he keep talking this is the sort of stuff i really want to hear he explained everything in minute detail hoping that olivia would follow his lead when she began to relate what had happened when she had first gone to the williamson apartment she did but even stretching it and even with hayzus kicking in with detailed explanations of why things were done and done in certain ways there was only so much to relate and when olivia had finished it was far too early to hope that colt would have had enough and want to go to bed he didnt have enoughdespite his having asked a number of intelligent questions that had required long explanationsand he didnt want to go to bed you know what id like to do now colt asked rhetorically and went on without waiting for a reply its only a little after ten id like to take a ride maybe go back to that bar you took me to before maybe go by this special operations place where hayzus works maybe take a quick look at that warehouse where you said they keep the undercover cars and go out to dallesandros for a real cheese steak you just finished eating olivia blurted i didnt eat much he said and i really want a cheese steak we can get the cheese steak last before we call it a night after we see the other stuff although he sensed it was going to be futile matt offered objections theres a couple of problems with that stan he began like what colt replied with a smile but in a tone of voice that made it clear he was used to getting whatever he asked for well for one thing well have to run the gauntlet of the press waiting for you downstairs the other security guys can handle that colt said stan the people downstairs are police officers members of the dignitary protection unit not security guys security guys are rentacops no offense thats very interesting good to know and i wont make that mistake again what else we cant go into the iad warehouse if we go there in my unmarked car but we could drive by it right if we didnt stop yes we could okay that solves that what the hell if i went inside all id see is a bunch of cars right right anything else if we go to dallesandros youre probably going to be recognized and likely mobbed by your fans sergeant payne colt said switching voices again i have a deep one might say profound trust that you and detective lassiter can shield me from the enthusiasm of my fans anything else not that i can think of stan olivia said im not working dignitary protection i have to do one of two things go back to the phone in homicide or go home so i can start off first thing in the morning youve already put a lot of hours in today matt said well take you home and then he had a second thought why dont we drop you at homicide and you see what the captain or washington wants you to do it took her a moment to understand what he really meant if anything interesting has come up i could call you she said great idea colt said hayzus you got the number of the sergeant downstairs matt asked martinez took out his telephone punched in numbers and handed the phone to him sergeant nevins matt payne matt said mr colt wants to ride around town a little is that going to pose any problems for you you want to take a couple of uniforms with you no i was thinking about the press they still there yeah we can handle them just give a couple of minutes notice well be down in five minutes matt said i really appreciate this buddy stan colt said five when officers commanding for example the impact unit and internal affairs get an order directly from the first deputy commissioner they tend to drop whatever they might have been doing and start to comply with the order the same is true when the commanding officer of a detective division gets any kind of an order from the chief inspector of detectives this being the case inspector wohl had been more than a little surprised that the first person to respond to the summons issued was steven j cohen esq head of the district attorneys homicide unit a dapper tanned welldressed fortyyearold that was quick steve wohl greeted him thank you i would say i heard my mistresss voice but that would be subject to misinterpretation cohen said i was in center city please dont ask me why why were you in center city steve wohl asked would you believe my wife is a stan colt fan andor that i paid a hundred dollars each for two tickets entitling us to stand in a long line in the bellvuestratford to shake his hand and two very watery drinks and that when al called me i was in the bar of the ritzcarlton where he is staying and where my wife hoped he would appear i believe you wohl said if you cant believe a lawyer who can you believe cohen gave him the finger whats up peter weve identified one of the doers in the roy rogers job peter began he had just about finished when inspector michael weisbach of internal affairs walked into homicide weisbach was a slightly built man who wore mock tortoiseframe glasses and always managed to look rumpled weisbach and wohl were longtime friends he nodded at cohen and looked expectantly at wohl but didnt say anything so hows by you michael wohl asked finally in a creditable mockyiddish accent cohen chuckled what the hell is this all about peter weisbach asked not able to resist a smile i would deeply appreciate your patience inspector until captain mikkles of impact and captain calmon of southwest detectives get here wohl said ive just explained the whole thing to the shyster here and id rather do it only once more when everybody is here how come the shyster gets special treatment because i like him wohl said oh christ weisbach groaned cohen pointed toward the door to homicide captain michael j mikkles who commanded the impact task force a special antidrug unithad just come in he was a tall very thin baldheaded man in his fifties he was halfway to captain quaires office when captain calmon entered homicide when he was in the office and they had all shaken hands all around wohl closed the door first things first he said i need six undercover vehicles for an indefinite period said vehicles suitable for a roundthe clock surveillance at the paschall homes housing project and i need them right now who are we going to weisbach started to ask indulge me mike wohl interrupted ill explain everything in a minute right now i want two undercover vehicles at special operations two more within a couple of hours and a total of six by morning you two decide between you where theyre coming from youre just asking for vehicles right you dont want any of my detectives captain calmon asked just the vehicles well use special operations and homicide detectives for surveillance until we run out of people inspector captain mikkles said i dont have any undercover cars to spare the only way i could give you vehicles is to take them off jobs then thats the way itll have to be wohl said unless inspector weisbach can give me two right now weisbach took out his cellular and punched an autodial number this is weisbach he announced how many covert carsanything suitable for surveillance in a projectcan i get out of the warehouse right now the internal affairs division which is engaged primarily in investigating policemen had a fairly large fleet of bona fide civilian cars and other vehicles because very few policemen cannot spot an unmarked car in the first glance the vehicles many of them forfeitures in drug caseswere kept in a warehouse several blocks from the iad offices on dungan road he waited and listened and then turned to wohl ive got two pretty beatup vans and a chrysler almost new you can have right now maybe tomorrow we can do better theyre in the warehouse wohl asked weisbach nodded then we have to figure a way to get them out to special operations im here in my car weisbach said i could run a couple of people by the warehouse the iad warehouse had no identifying signs on it and iad tried to preserve its anonymity by never going near it in marked or unmarked cars can you carry four people wohl asked weisbach nodded then well do that wohl said do i get an explanation of whats going on weisbach asked id kind of like to know well if youre going to be difficult wohl said and turned to captain mikkles mick im going to have to have two more cars in say two hours if that means you have to call off a surveillance so be it yes sir mikkles said it was obvious he did not like the order okay wohl said then lets go out there and ill explain for what i really hope is the last time whats going on just about everybody in the outer office stopped talking and directed their attention toward captain quaires office as wohl and the others filed out of it six for you inspector captain michael j sabara said handing wohl one of the phones on captain quaires desk its mickey ohara sabara was sitting in quaires chair peter wohl and jason washington were sitting on wooden chairswashington with his legs sprawled in front of him wohl sitting in his chair backward quaire had left five minutes earlier at wohls pointed suggestion that since everybody had a lot to do in the morning and he could think of nothing else they could do tonight it might be a good idea to get some rest it was already almost eleven sabara wohl had just told him was going to be responsible for providing what detectives washingtonto whom wohl had given responsibility for the paschall homes housing projectdecided he needed and to make sure there were highway patrol cars always no farther than five minutes away from the surveillance site and how is my alltime favorite journalist wohl said into the phone pissed is how i am ohara said suspecting as i do that i am about to get another runaround another implying you have already been run around by whom the master chef ohara said you were there peter denny coughlin promised to keep me informed he didnt and when i called him just now he told me to call you and youd fill me in fill you in about what wohl said innocently i knew it i knew it be advised inspector that my promise to have seen and heard nothing is now null and void where are you mick liberties washington and i will be there in five minutes were just finishing up here ill trust you that far peter but not sixty seconds longer well be there inabout five minutes were leaving right now okay you have ten minutes old pal of mine ohara said and the line went dead washingtons cellular buzzed as he and inspector peter wohl walked out of the roundhouse into the parking lot joe damata lieutenant dont tell me please joseph that you have encountered a problem at the warehouse i want that car in the project right now its an old chevy van not a car and i dont know if its a problem or not but i thought i should tell you please do the suspense is too much for my tired old heart when i came out of the warehouse just now there was a ford parked halfway up the street lights out but people in it when i got closer i saw payne was sitting in it you refer to our sergeant payne washington asked the question caught wohls attention yeah and sitting beside him was either stan colt or somebody who looks a hell of a lot like stan colt is there something i dont know what were they doing washington asked looking at the warehouse damata said with their lights out with their lights out joseph washington said looking at wohl i have no explanation whatever for sergeant payne and stan colt being outside the iad warehouse in an unmarked car with the lights out but i will make inquiries and advise you thank you for bringing this to my attention washington pushed the end button and looked at wohl wohl took out his cellular and pushed an autodial number matt is mr colt with you yes sir meet me at liberties now do not go inside yes sir inspector wohl lieutenant washington and sergeant payne arrived at liberties within thirty seconds of one another lieutenant washington went inside liberties mr michael j ohara was sitting alone at the bar you better be about to tell me that peters right on your heels ohara greeted him peters right on my heels you want to tell me whats going on weve identified one of the miscreants in the roy rogers job and have a good idea who the other one is i heard that much at augie wohls mrs solomon is very concerned that unless we exercise great care the malefactors may slip through the cracks in the floor of the criminal justice system which means what exactly that an arrest will not be made until such time as mrs solomon feels there is a stronger case than what we have now which is identification of one of them by fingerprints inspector wohl went to matts unmarked crown victoria and got in the backseat mr colt im inspector wohl wohl said stan colt reached over the back of the seat and enthusiastically shook wohls hand hey great how are you matts been telling me all about you you were seen outside the iad warehouse sergeant payne wohl said you want to tell me what that was all about mr colt wanted to see it so i showed it to him okay is there anything else mr colt wants to see tonight were going to dallesandros for a cheese steak matt said and wed love to have you come along stan colt said thats very kind but its been a long day and what im going to do is have a nightcap with lieutenant washington and go home tell you what inspector colt said why dont we all go in there and have a nightcap then matt and i will go to dallesandros and then well all go home mr colt put action to his words by getting out of the car walking quickly to the door of liberties motioning cheerfully for matt and wohl to follow him and disappearing inside jesus christ wohl said mickeys in there waiting for me to tell him whats going on i saw the pressmobile matt said this isnt funny goddamn it what are you going to do matt asked goddamn movie actor actually hes not really such a bad sort matt said he sort of grows on you fifteen one i may have had more of these than i remember mickey ohara said interrupting washington and holding up his old bushmills on the rocks because the guy in the door looks just like stan colt yes he does doesnt he washington agreed mr colt smiling his hand extended marched up to them hi he said youre matts boss arent you lieutenant washington yes i am washington said and unless i err you are mr stan colt right im very pleased to meet you mr colt washington said adding this is mr michael j ohara of the bulletin no shit mr colt exclaimed youre mickey ohara goddamn youre a goddamn legend he enthusiastically pumped mickeys hand mr ohara is indeed one of our more prominent journalists washington said as wohl trailed by matt came into the bar when you and bull bolinski got caught running numbers for frankie the gut you took the fall for him got expelled and the bull got to graduate got to be allamerican you know the bull told me all about you you know casimir mickey asked hell yeah i know the bull we west catholic guys got to stick together you know he always stays with me when hes on the coast ill be damned mickey said i heard you were in town raising money for west catholic but i didnt know you went there you probably wouldnt remember me i used to be stanley coleman i was a freshman and you and the bull were juniors when you got shitcanned but i sure remember you ill be damned mickey said and now returned mr colts enthusiastic handpumping wohl walked up smiling a little lamely well i see youve met mr ohara mr colt he said met him shit we go way back we both got kicked out of west catholic jesus im glad you brought me in here me too mickey said hey bartender mr colt called and when he had his attention made a circling motion with his hand which the bartender correctly interpreted to mean that he should bring liquid refreshment to one and all the usual inspector the bartender asked wohl nodded detective hey hes a sergeant mr colt corrected him give us both one of those irish martinis and if i dont want an irish martini matt asked smiling drink it anyway youre an outnumbered wasp colt said and then frowned remembering hey i still dont have any money ill pay you back sure thebulletin will pay mickey announced why dont we get a table they took a table the bartender delivered a round of drinks you hang out with these guys right mickey mr colt inquired yeah what i want to know is what youre doing with them matts showing me around the police department and doing a goddamn good job of it for a wasp mickey said mattys a pretty good cop i owe him big time how come a couple of years back we were in an alley and a really bad guy comes down it shooting at us with a jesus mickey matt protested and matty put him down ohara went on took a bullet in the leg but the bottom line was one dead bad guy no shit we call him the wyatt earp of the main line my friends dont call me that matt said coldly or sometimes the casanova of center city ohara went blithely on yeah i like his taste in women mr colt said you should have seen the one he had with him tonight curiosity overwhelms me washington said to whom does mr colt refer matthew captain quaire assigned detective lassiter to explain the williamson job to him matt said you got something going with her matty ohara asked no i dont mr colt winked broadly held up his balled first with the thumb extended and said right washington and wohl smiled so whats going on in here mr colt inquired youre just hanging out or what ohara looked at wohl you tell him peter he said wohls smile vanished he looked thoughtful for a moment then shrugged mr colt he began i cant get you to call me stan stan just about everybody in the department trusts mickey to keep his mouth shut when he knows something we dont want to be public knowledge wohl said theres usually a little youscratchmybackandillscratch yours in the deal stan mickey said you asked before if what were doing here is hanging out no what im doing is waiting to see if or how well the inspector is going to scratch my back under the circumstances stan im going to have to ask you not to repeat to anyone what im about to tell mickey and you you got it my lips are sealed mr colt said he looked at matt held up his right hand with the three center fingers extended and added boy scouts honor tony harris went to harrisburg wohl said the state police were able to get a hit from the print on the visor cap using the afis im terribly sorry to interrupt old sport mr colt interrupted in his british accent but i havent the foggiest fucking idea what you are talking about wohl turned his head to look at colt and for a moment matt thought colt was about to be either frozen with a wohl glance or perhaps even treated to an example of wohl sarcasm but wohl surprised him by smiling well dear boy we certainly cant have that now can we wohl said in a british accent very nearly as good as the actors then he dropped the accent and added there was a double homicide in connection with an armed robbery of a roy rogers restaurant on south broad the guys who did it got away and we just found out using a fingerprint we previously thought was useless who they are you got a match mickey asked i thought the lab candelle himselfsaid there wasnt enough weve identified one of them the fat guy and in known associates on his sheet is a guy who lives two doors away from him in the paschall homes project in southwest philly who fits the description of the other one he stopped and looked at washington you brought the pictures for mick washington nodded and went into his suit jacket coming out with two philadelphia police mug shots he handed them to ohara can you make either of them mick wohl asked ohara looked carefully at both and then shook his head as much as id like to no ohara said it was dark and as you may recall the bastards took a shot at me no shit mr colt inquired awe in his voice anyway the da doesnt think what we have is enough to convict them for sure we need morethe weapon for example so were not going to arrest them right now instead were going to keep them under surveillance until we can develop more thats the reason that jason and i were still in homicide when you called we had everybody and his brother in there setting up the surveillance and thats why i was ever so politely booted out of there right mr colt inquired excuse me wohl asked when that captain sent matts girlfriend to explain that other job to me he paused and made a pumping motion with his fist that was to get me out of homicide right i think one could reasonably draw that assumption mr colt washington said i would have been in the way right and been privy to things we would rather not be known to the public washington replied well what the hell we had a nice dinner right mr colt said very nice matt said can i ask you a question mickey mr colt inquired and then went on without waiting for an answer how come you were at this roy rogers just a coincidence you went there for a hamburger or whatever no i responded to a possible armedrobberyinprogress call and i got there just as these bastards were leaving explain that youve got a police scanner right he has a battery of police scanners washington said with which he eavesdrops on police communications in the tristate area you may have noticed all the antennae that buick whatchamacallit outside is yours i saw all the antennas its a rendezvous mickey said yeah thats mine if you want to really see the police department at work mr colt washington said perhaps mr ohara would be good enough to let you ride around with him he responds to every interesting call which usually means a call where violence is likely to be found be glad to have you stan mickey said jeez id like that then well do it mickey said theres a problem there wohl said we really have to make sure you have a police officer with you stan why and whats wrong with matt because the commissioner says so wohl said and whats wrong with matt is that hes been on the job all day and its getting close to midnight what about the other detective mr colt asked the little one he held out his hand to indicate detective martinezs diminutive stature whos he talking about wohl asked matt hayzus matt said mcfadden relieves him at midnight another mick stan ohara said good guy youll like him inspector i would venture to suggest that mr colt would be safe in the capable gaelic hands of detective mcfadden washington said you mind if i ask if you always talk like that mr colt asked always im afraid wohl said chuckling he looked at his watch put the arm out for him matt have him meet us here have him meet us at dallesandros mr colt said this drink is my third and last one for the day and im determined to have a cheese steak youre all invited of course washington and wohl looked at each other far be it from me to reject mr colts generous invitation washington said and not only because it will afford me a splendid answer to marthas inevitable question when i finally get home where the hell have you been what have you been doing and with whom wohl asked actually my precious i was having a cheese steak at dallesandros with mr stan colt the movie star that should for once strike her dumb two at five past one mr stanley colt having had his cheese steak and having been transferred into the capable hands of detective charles mcfadden matt got in his unmarked crown victoria and started home he smiled at the memory of mr colts response to inspector wohls instructions to detective mcfadden he is not to get out of mickeys car without your permission if he gives you any trouble cuff him and turn him over to dignitary protection at the ritzcarlton trouble is defined to include any gesture toward a member of the opposite sex beyond a friendly smile thats not going to be a problem i can get laid anytime but doing this wow he had just turned onto walnut street and was headed west toward rittenhouse square when his cellular went off jesus now what payne can you talk detective olivia lassiter inquired yeah they have a positive id on one of the doers in the roy rogers job i heard matt interrupted and theyre running an aroundtheclock surveillance which is why they threw us out of homicide there was a silence hows your hand olivia asked after a long moment he looked at it fine he said i had just about forgotten about it oh another silence i thought maybe you needed the bandage changed she said finally no it looks fine oh jesus christ matthew you are the dumbest sonofabitch in philadelphia where are you mother im not your mother where are you not my mother in the starbucks at twelfth and market what are you doing there i thought you went to homicide i hung around homicide for a while made a few more calls then i came here and waited until i thought youd probably put colt to bed then i called im at nineteenth and walnut ill be there in ten minutes no for christs sake ill take you home if you come here somebody who knows one or both of us will see us then go stand in the dark around the corner on twelfth and filbert ill pick you up there and take you home there was a long pause again before she asked if i took a cab to rittenhouse square how could i get in the building this time of night another pause this one on matts part and shorter when you get out of the cab ill be waiting for you in the lobby and one final pause before she said the way you were talking before i thought you didnt want me to come over there oh baby three the chiefs of police of daphne and fairhope alabama were privately not at all happy with the jacksons oak citizens community watch inc daphne and fairhope are small prosperous primarily residential communities in baldwin county on mobile bay in south alabama they lie across mobile bay from the city of mobile and about thirty miles from the gulf of mexico baldwin county which is larger than the state of rhode island is similarly prosperous both because of its fertile fields and its seashore on the gulf of mexicoknown despite the valiant efforts of the local chambers of commerce as the redneck rivierawhich is famous for its spectacular snowwhite beaches and which attracts affluent tourists throughout the year there is not much crimecertainly not as that term is interpreted in philadelphiain baldwin county or in daphne or fairhope but to fight what there is there is a nice tax base to support law enforcement and the various fire departments the police cruisers of the daphne and fairhope police departments are stateoftheart vehicles equipped with the latest communication systems video recorders computers and speeddetection radar they are generally replaced annually and the old vehicles sold to less prosperous communities the daphne chief of police was not happy with the jacksons oak citizens community watch inc because he thought it was unnecessary potentially dangerous and enjoyed the opposite of respect from his sworn officers the fairhope chief of police was not happy with joccwi sometimes referred to privately within the law enforcement community as jabberwocky because he feared it would be contagious and fairhope would get one like it joccwi had been formed by a group of concerned citizens as their response to what they regarded as the daphne police departments inability to rid the community of drug addicts petty thieves peeping toms and other disturbers of the domestic tranquillity there was a thread of justification in their complaints so far as the chief knew if there were those in daphne using hard drugs they did so in their homes and purchased them elsewhere if a stranger appeared in either fairhope or daphne who looked remotely as if he might be usingmuch less sellinghard drugs a cop trailed him until a search of hisher person was legally justified or heshe left town whichever came first there was cannabis sativa of course and on any given pleasant evening the chief knew the young and sometimes notsoyoung might go to the beach and smoke a joint or two or they might go outside the clubhouse of the lake forest golf and country club and take a couple of puffs if his officers saw them they were arrested there was more validity to the pettytheft charge there were more than two hundred boats power and sail in the marina of the lake forest yacht club just about every one of them had something aboardfrom radar sets and depth meters or fish finders on a fortyfoot hatteras to oars in a rowboatthat was both quickly removable and easily sold no questions asked in any one of a hundred places from biloxi mississippi in the west to pensacola florida in the east most of these thefts could be prevented by the boats owners taking reasonable measures and the only way to stop the thefts completely would be to station officers not only at the marina but in boats guarding access to it that was out of the question easily removable things from radar detectors to hubcaps to entire wheels were stolen from cars too as the founders of joccwi contended and sometimes expensive lawn furnitureor even a new garden hosebought from home depot would vanish from a back lawn overnight sometimes the thieves were caught sometimes they were not it was obviously impossible for the police to be everywhere all the time the peeping tom allegation also had some merit there were a lot of goodlooking young women married and not in the condominiums adjacent to the yacht club and on the fringes of lake forest a huge area of small to mediumsized homes it was not a gated community it was easily possible for someone with an interest in watching young women undress to go into lake forest and hide behind one of its many trees with binoculars and hard as hell to catch them at it among the other disturbers of the peace joccwi wished to control were high school kids racing around in popsor their owncar in the middle of the night the chief had his officers spend a lot of time trying to stop thathe had had more than his fill of picking up dead kids whod missed a turn and hit a treebut he knew he hadnt stopped it all on the surface having a number of responsible citizens roaming through the area at night in their own cars looking for something amiss and when finding it reporting it to the police by cell phone seemed at firsteven to the chiefto be not so bad an idea and among the founders of joccwi were the pillars of the community they were lawyers executives schoolteachers businessmen dentists and retired members of the armed forces including two full colonels three lieutenant colonels one of them a former green beret a number of other commissioned officers and nearly a dozen retired master chief petty officers sergeants major and other highranking former noncoms they showed the chief what they intended to do and how they intended to do it and he frankly had felt more than a little admiration for their plan the night the concerned citizens went into action the chief and the mayor went to their headquarters a rented former concession stand at the yacht club to wish them well they learned that the organization now had a name jacksons oak citizens community watch it was taken from jacksons oak a tree in daphne under which andrew jackson had allegedly stood shortly before moving west to fight the battle of new orleans thats when the chief and the mayor saw that the retired green beret who would serve as watch commander that night had a colt semiautomatic pistol in the small of his back and so did dr smiley the dentist who would command the first fourhour tour other members of joccw without the i for incorporated were also armed with everything from pistols to shotguns as tactfully as he could the chief had suggested to the retired green beret that perhaps firearms werent really such a good idea all that joccw was supposed to do was keep an eye open and call the police if they saw something that looked suspicious how the hell can you go on guard without a weapon jesus christ charley the next morning the mayor the chief the parttime municipal judge and the parttime city attorney conferred visavis the armed members of joccw patrolling the city legally there didnt seem much that could be done about it under the laws of alabama any lawabiding citizen over twentyone could apply to the baldwin county sheriff for a permit to carry a handgun concealed about the person on or in a vehicle the permit could not be denied without good cause they agreed that the sheriff of baldwin county who is an elected official and wished to be reelectedad infinitum was not about to tell the pillars of the community who had organized joccw that hed changed his mind and they could no longer go about armed the laws regarding longarms were similarly not very comforting to the mayor et al no licenses were required to own longarms citizens had to pass a firearms safety program to get a hunting license unless they were veterans of an armed force or over the age of sixtyfive many perhaps percent of the members of joccw met both of the latter two requirements finally the city attorney suggested that since the members of joccw were all reasonable men if they were aware of the legal ramificationsprimarily tort lawsuits for hundreds of thousands of dollarsfor shooting someone without full justification they might lose their enthusiasm for carrying weapons this was brought tactfully to the attention of one of the two retired full colonelsa marine whod fought all over the orient from guadalcanal to khe sanhwho listened attentively thanked the city attorney for his interest and said it wasnt a problem that potential difficulty occurred to bob skinner the colonel said j robert skinner esq one of the founders of joccw was an attorney specializing in corporate liability we expected to be incorporated within the week if somebody sues joccwii for incorporatedthe corporation treasury will be empty or nearly so the chief therefore was concerned but not surprised when his bedside telephone rang at am am philadelphia time and the police dispatcher somewhat excitedly told him chief we just got a call from jabberwocky request assistance at the yacht club condominiums shots fired im on my way call the mayor christ it was inevitable im only surprised that it didnt happen long before this dear jesus please dont let them have shot some kid or some guy trying to sneak into his own house when the chief turned off highway into the drive of the lake forest yacht club he saw that three daphne police cruisers and one each from the fairhope police department the baldwin county sheriffs patrol and the alabama state troopers had beat him to the scene when he got out of the car the wail of sirens he heard told him that additional law enforcement vehicles were on the way then he saw there had been a vehicular collision just inside the brick gate posts a chevrolet impala on its way out of the complex had slammed into the side of a mercedes sports utility vehicle sitting sideward in the road he recognized the mercedes to be that of chambers d galloway retired chief executive officer of galloway carpets inc and a founding member of joccwi who lived in one of the big houses overlooking the beach and mobile bay the chief shouldered his way through the spectators and law enforcement officers who was shot he demanded before he saw a very large man wearing black coveralls lying facedown on the ground his wrists handcuffed behind him nobody was shot the retired green beret said just a little condescendingly i was told shots fired i didnt try tohit him charley at that distance i could have easily popped him but i knew that galloway could intercept him at the gateid already alerted him and others but i figured what the hell if i let off a couple of rounds into the air he might give up back there he pointed into the condominium complex why what did he do to attract your attention he had a ski mask on and he was trying to pry open a window with a knife great big sonofabitch its still in his cari looked for some reason i got a little suspicious so i alerted the shift told them to block the entrances and then i shined my light on this clown and asked him excuse me sir may i ask what youre doing at that point he took off running chambers galloway stopped him the chief asked just a little incredulously and then the chief saw chambers galloway the tall ascetic septuagenarian was standing beside the state trooper chatting pleasantly looking more than a little pleased with himself mr galloway was wearing a tweed jacket with leather patches on the elbows and shoulder and a matching brimmed cap he held a twelvebore belgian browning overandunder shotgun the action open crooked over his right arm he could have been standing in a scottish field waiting for the beaters to start the pheasants flying as the chief looked a flashbulb went off and then a second and a third the chief saw charley whelan of themobile register standing atop his jeep cherokee in such a position that he could get mr chambers d galloway the prone handcuffed man in black coveralls and most of the police officers and their vehicles in his shot in a sense mr whelan was mobiles mickey ohara he was considerably younger and far less well paid but he was the crime reporter for theregister and he had a police frequency scanner both on his desk in the city room of theregister and in his cherokee he had been in the city roomthe register had just gone to bed when he heard the call announcing that shots had been fired at the lake forest yacht club he almost didnt go to the scene no matter what he found at the yacht club it was too late to get it in the mornings paper but on the other hand it might be an interesting story shots were rarely fired on the eastern shore of mobile bay which was not true of other areas in mobile so he got in the cherokee and raced across the i bridge which connects mobile with the eastern shore and when he saw what was happening he was glad hed come this was hilarious half the cops on the eastern shore had gathered at the scene of a captured peeping tom and the actual capture of this dangerous lunatic had been made by an old fart with a shotgun who looked as if he was about to bag a couple of quail charley whelan got off the roof of his cherokee tried and failed to get the peeping toms name from the chief got the old farts name and another picture of him and then drove back to mobile this time exceeding the speed limit by only fifteen miles per hour the city editor was still there and charley made quick prints of the images in his digital camera and showed them to him well its too late for todays rag the city editor said put it on the atlanta wire those big papers close later than we do well run it tomorrow charley sat down at his computer terminal and quickly typed daphne al possible peeping tom bagged by community watcher shown here with his shotgun and his as yet unidentified quarry handcuffed on the ground is retired business executive chambers d galloway a member of daphnes jackson oak citizens community watch inc who made a middleofthenight citizens arrest of the man after he was seen peeping into the windows of a resident of the lake forest yacht club condominiums whom police declined to identify four daphne police cars two fairhope police cars a baldwin county deputy sheriff and an alabama state trooper converged on the scene to take the suspect off mr galloways hands the accused peeper will be held in the daphne police jail while the investigation continues mobile register photos by charles e whelan when the pictures and the story reached the associated press in atlanta the night man there also thought the yarnand especially the pictures of the old guy with the shotgunwas funny good human interest and pushed the national button this caused the photos and story to be instantly sent to newspapers all over the united states which of course included those in philadelphia four the device that electronically chimed be it ever so humble when the doorbell of the residence of sergeant matthew payne was pushed had two controls one provided a selection of the numbers of bars of music to be played from six to all and the other was a volume control detective payne who had few visitors to his home and used the device primarily as a backup alarm clock had set both controls to the maximum choices offered a full rendition of be it ever so humble played at maximum volume in the small confines of the apartment had so far never failed to wake sergeant payne from the deepest sleep and so it did the following morning at am when the wachenhut security guard a retired police officer who both liked the young cop in the attic and was grateful for the bottle of wild turkey hed been given for christmas rode the elevator up laid a copy of the just deliveredbulletin on the floor outside the door to the attic and pushed the doorbell half awake sergeant payne had just identified the sound glanced through halfopened eyes at the time displayed on the ceiling and decided he had a good half hour to get leisurely out of bed when a female voice quite close to him brought him suddenly to full wakefulness what thehell is that detective olivia lassiter had asked as much in alarm as curiosity matt opened his eyes fully olivia had been so startled by the music that she had suddenly sat up on the bed and not thought about pulling the sheet up to modestly cover her exposed bosom jesus she has beautiful breasts thats the newspaper he said thenewspaper the security guy rings the doorbell when he brings the paper up matt explained olivia saw where his eyes were directed and pulled the sheet up over her chest the cow so to speak is already out of the barn matt said what time is it olivia asked ignoring him matt pointed at the ceiling after a moments confusion olivia looked at the ceiling my god ive got to get out of here she said why because i have to go home and change my clothes she said something i didnt think about last night okay ill take you and we can get some breakfast someplace im going to take a cab she said i should have taken one last night and gone home so we wont be seen together and someone will suspect whats going on exactly that cow i have to tell you is really out of the barn what does that mean mr colt somehow got the ideayou saw thatthat you and i have become something more than professional associates and and decided to share this perception with mickey ohara peter wohl and jason washington my god i hope you denied it of course matt said whereupon stan showed his acceptance of my denial in the following manner he winked broadly mimicking colt and demonstrated the balledfist thumbup gesture colt had used that sonofabitch honey he thought he was being funny his being funny blew my chances of getting in homicide she said bitterly realistically honey there doesnt seem to be much chance of that matt said thanks a lot well there doesnt he insisted at least right now im going to take a shower she snapped and then a cab he watched her enter the bathroom after a moment he reluctantly concluded thathowever delightful an idea it was on the surfacethere was not room in the shower for the both of them and besides shes already pissed that our shameful secret has become public knowledge he swung his legs out of bed got fresh underwear and went down the stairs to get the newspaper he started to read it as he climbed the stairs back to his apartment and just as he reached the top he saw that the picture that eddie the photographer had taken of him and stan colt outside the bellvuestratford was on page one of the bulletin there was a rather lengthy caption stan colt movie detective in philadelphia to raise money for west catholic high found time in his busy schedule to meet with the real thing he is shown here arriving at the mayors reception at the bellvuestratford with sergeant m m payne of the phila pd homicide unit payne will be showing colt what police work is really like whenever colt has a spare minute the full schedule of the colt fundraising visit can be found on page of section four of todaysbulletin matt remembered that colt had said that the picture was the only one that would get printed olivia was toweling herself by the side of the bed which he found to be an interesting sight im famous he said showing her the newspaper olivia glanced at it very quickly put your clothes on you can drive me home she said oh thank you thank you i have three choices putting on wet underwear getting in a cab without my underwear or you with or without underwear my god get dressed five the swedish philosophertheologian emmanuel swedenborg believed that there is sometimes an unspoken communication between loved ones that one loved person knows what the other loved one is thinking this may or may not have had anything to do with what detective olivia lassiter said to sergeant matthew payne when he pulled to the curb in front of her apartment you wait in the car i know what youre thinking sergeant payne had in fact been thinking all the way from rittenhouse square that there was something wonderfully erotic having olivia sitting beside him with nothing beneath her dress but olivia and that with just a little bit of luck he might get lucky when they got to her apartment and they went inside while she changed clothing what am i going to do out here he asked thats up to you youre not coming in detective lassiter said and got out of the car he watched her enter the apartment shrugged and then reached for thephiladelphia bulletin which had his picture on the front page and which he had dropped onto the floor when he saw the picture he smiled remembering what stan colt had said when he got out of the car to pose for eddie the photographer look serious but think of pussy then he started looking through the rest of thebulletin ten minutes later on page of section three living today he saw a picture of an old geezer with an overandunder crooked over his arm standing with a bunch of cops and with half a dozen patrol cars of various law enforcement agencies in the background then he read the caption and then looked very carefully at the picture again at the handcuffed man in black coveralls on the ground jesus christ he said aloud and reached for his cellular police department a female voice with a thick southern accent announced id like to speak to whoevers handling the case of that peeping tom you bagged last night so would everybody else from new orleans to destin the woman replied my name is matthew payne im a sergeant in homicide in philadelphia yeah i bet you are excuse me how do i know that because i just told you now get me some supervisor on the phone and right now you dont have to bite my head off a male voice with an equally heavy accent next came on the line can i help you with whom am i speaking please im sergeant kenny sergeant im sergeant payne philadelphia homicide so barbaraanne said how can i help you that peeping tom you bagged last night was there a knife involved a great big knife there was no response hello matt asked after what seemed like a long time what can i do for you a new southernaccented male voice inquired was i just talking to you no you were talking to sergeant kenny im the chief how can i help you chief my name is payne im a philadelphia homicide sergeant so sergeant kenny said what can we do for you sergeant this a long shot chief but that peeping tom you bagged last night may be a man were looking for in connection with a homicide here you dont say can you tell me if there was a knife involved did your guy have a great big knife sergeant i dont know for sure youre who you say you are and even if i did im not sure if i could answer that question this is an ongoing investigation and theres some things we dont want to get out you understand which means of course that he did have a knife otherwise you would have said no how about a camera a digital camera could you tell me that what part of imnotgoingtoansweranyquestionsabout thisinvestigation dont you understand sergeant the chief asked certainly chief i understand but if you dont think it would interfere with your investigation could you tell me if the window he was peeping through was that of a young woman and was he just looking or maybe trying to open the window there was a long pause no i dont think id better get into that the chief said finally this sonofabitch isnt going to tell me a goddamn thing chief ill probably be in touch with you again matt said politely in the meantime if youll give me your police teletype address ill have the department confirm who i am that sounds like a good idea sergeant the chief said and gave it to him ill get that out as soon as i get to the round police headquarters matt said and thank you for taking the time to talk to me chief i can imagine how busy you are my pleasure the chief said and hung up six you dont look so happy boss captain frank hollaran said as deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin slipped beside him into the front seat of the car have you seen thebulletin coughlin asked yes sir and mattys picture on the front page with stan colt coughlin asked and then went on without waiting for a reply i dont like it frank i understand why mattys showing that guy around and from the perspective of mariani and the mayor it may be a great idea but i dont think it belongs in the newspapers i guess you havent seen theledger hollaran asked same picture and worse hollaran said and indicated the newspaper on the seat between them the editorial page commissioner commissioner the editorial page that sounds ominous coughlin said as he flipped through the paper looking for the editorial page ten seconds later he said oh shit and ten seconds after that those bastards no wonder murderers remain free this newspaper received a publicity photo below of movie star stan colt and homicide sergeant m m payne getting out of a police car at the mayors reception for colt at the bellvuestratford last night the press release went on to say that while colt is in town raising money for west catholic high school his alma mater sergeant payne is showing him how things really are in the philadelphia police department the way things really are in the police department are that there are two open unsolved recent cases of brutal murder and one can only guess how many old unsolved murders on the books one of the new open cases is that of a young woman who very probably was raped and murdered in her apartment while police officers chatted with her neighbors the second is that of a single mother of three who was murdered in a fastfood restaurant during a robbery when the police finally responded to that call for help the murderers killed the responding officer at last report the philadelphia police department doesnt have a clue as to the identity of the murderers perhaps they would if sergeant payne were spending his time doing what the taxpayers hired him to do investigate homicides rather than spending it showing a movie star how things really are and its not only sergeant payne earlier yesterday payne was seen taking into colts hotel an attractive young woman later identified as detective olivia lassiter presumably she was showing colt how things really are in the philadelphia police department and its not only the junior officers at midnight inspector peter wohl commanding officer of the special operations division who is supposed to be heading up the mayors task force to solve the murders at the fastfood restaurant and homicide lieutenant jason washington were seen showing how things really are in the philadelphia police department by feeding stan colt beer and cheese steak sandwiches at dallesandros but maybe thats the way things really are in the police department and maybe its time for a change in the police department starting at the top with the commissioner who permits this sort of thing to happen or maybe in city hall itself after all one of the primary responsibilities of mayor alvin w martin is the supervision of the police department and ten seconds after that the radio went off c go halloran said to his microphone c meet the commissioner at the roundhouse radio we are en route estimate ten minutes i guess somebody else has been reading the mornings papers deputy commissioner coughlin said sixteen one the editorial in thephiladelphia ledger was brought to mayor alvin w martins attention by mr philip donaldson who decided the editorial was worth finally playing one of his aces in the hole this one the mayors unlisted and carefully guarded home telephone number after this call phil was sure the number would go unanswered until another unlisted number could be obtained and the original one taken out of service yeah the mayor said somewhat less than charmingly into his kitchen telephone am i mistaken or did the honorable alvin w martin our mayor answer his phone himself the voice was familiar but the mayor could not quite place it this is alvin martin he said now far more pleasantly who not only answers his own phone but whom you caught in the midst of making his own breakfast the little woman didnt make it for you mr mayor no she didnt who is this phil donaldson mr mayor ofphils philly and youre on the air how the hell did you get this number just in time the mayor stopped himself from asking that thought aloud instead mustering what charm he could under the circumstances he said well good morning phil and good morning to you mr mayor what can i do for you phil so early in the morning just a question or two mr mayor and then you can go back to making your own breakfast do you always make your own breakfast what business is that of yours is that one of your two questions maybe it will be three questions but what about breakfast i try like every other husband i suppose to pitch in whenever my wife is tied up tied up you flip sonofabitch a figure of speech phil of course the questions phil if i ever find out who gave this bastard my number have you seen this morningsledger mr mayor i was just about to after you finished your breakfast you mean i thought id have a glance at it while i was eating my breakfast thats probably a good idea mr mayor theledger has some pretty startling even unkind things to say in an editorial about the police department generally and you specifically oh shit oh really yes they do im sorry to tell you and iand all the good folks out there listening inphils phillywould like to get your reaction to them what the hells in this goddamn editorial an editorial you say phil thats right mr mayor they just about called for you to resignafter you fire police commissioner mariani goddamn it what the hell is the ledger onto now did they say why phil or are they just still sore that i won the election no its a little more serious than that im afraid mr mayor now i dont want to put you on a spot mr mayor the hell you dont thats your stockintrade you slimeball and if you havent read theledger so you read the bulletin first did you you prick actually phil i read both every day before i go to center city in no particular order but i just havent had a chance to look at either so far today well what id like to do mr mayor if youre willing anything within reason phil how about i call you at the office at eleven mr donaldson asked reasonably by then youll have had plenty of time to read the editorial this is the last fucking time youre ever going to get me on the phone how stupid do you think i am i may not be in the office at eleven phil well then where will you be at eleven someplace without a telephone i thought they were all over these days like inside plumbing i really dont know right now phil where ill be at eleven you have to understand you wouldnt be trying to give meand all the good folks out there listening inphils phillythe runaround would you mr mayor now phil why would you say something like that because thats what it sounds like mr mayor you sonofabitch you got me you call my office at eleven phil and ill be happy to take your call cross your heart and hope to die i give you my word phil i asked you to cross your heart and hope to die phil said paused and added just a little joke ill take you at your word mr mayor of course and well look forward to talking to you at eleven i look forward to it myself phil its always a pleasure have a nice breakfast mr mayor mr donaldson said he broke the connection and leaned into his microphone well you heard it folks the mayor gave his word that hed take my callwhich means hell takeour callat eleven that should be an interesting conversation make sure you tell all your friends to be tuned in and now a word from the friendly folks at dick golden ford on the baltimore pike be right back afterward he turned off his microphone gotcha you bastard he said two lieutenant jason washington was in the lieutenants office in homicide when matt and olivia walked in matt was surprised it was quarter to eight and washington usually showed up at ten or later as matt walked toward the lieutenants office washington looked up saw them and motioned for them to come in good morning detective lassiter he said good morning sir olivia said is there some reason you chose to answer neither your radio nor your cellular matthew or you detective your cellular washington asked i turned the radio off when i was ferrying colt around matt said or he would have wanted to respond to anything that came over it and obviously i didnt turn it back on this morning he took his cellular from his pocket and the battery is dead in this and you detective olivia had her cellular in her hand i guess i didnt turn it on this morning sir she said need i say that i would be both disappointed and more than a little annoyed if this everthe operative word is everhappened again no sir they said almost in unison then the incident is closed washington said have you seen thebulletin this morning lieutenant matt asked with your image adorning page one indeed i have and so i daresay has most of the population of philadelphia i wasnt talking about my picture matt said i meant this he laid section three of thebulletin living today open to page four on the desk then you stand out like a cork bobbing in the middle of the atlantic ocean for everyone else in philadelphia is talking of nothing else what am i being shown look at the guy on the ground in the picture matt said washington looked you can doubtless imagine the odds against that fellow being our critter he said after a moment but if you wish to turn over the stone under the stone why dont you give them a call i already have washington looked at him with interest they wouldnt tell me whether or not this guy had a knife matt said or whether he was just peeping in windows or trying to break in or whether the window belonged to a young woman and you have concluded obviously that this proves he did indeed have a knife with which he was trying to break into the apartment of a young woman i think the possibility exists matt said a little lamely one of the telephones on the desk rang and washington had it to his ear before it could ring again homicide lieutenant washington he said and a moment later yes sir and a moment later yes sir they are both here with me and a final moment later yes sir were on our way he put the handset in its cradle detective lassiter it is said that god takes care of fools and drunks while you are certainly not a drunk sergeant payne qualifies on both counts and you have apparently been taken under his protective mantle sir olivia asked the reason i attemptedand failed and we now know why dont weto communicate with the both of you this morning was to relay the order of deputy commissioner coughlin to get you both in here immediately and keep you here until i had additional instructions from him i dont understand matt said is he pissed about the picture olivia had nothing to do with that washington ignored the reply those were the additional instructions promised we are to report to commissioner mariani forthwith he stood up and gestured for them to precede him out of the office youre not going to tell me whats going on matt asked obviously you havent had time to read the editorial page of theledger have you no whats on the editorial page among many other things your photograph commissioner mariani was sitting behind his desk deputy commissioner coughlin and inspector wohl were sitting side by side on a couch and captain quaire was sitting on a straightbacked wooden chair just inside the door good morning gentlemen washington said matt and olivia said nothing i presume everyone has seen theledger commissioner mariani asked no sir matt and olivia said in duet mariani gestured impatiently to captain quaire to hand the newspaper to them matt took it and olivia stepped close to him and read it over his shoulder my god olivia said im sure you will understand why i have to ask this question detective mariani said did anything improper or anything that could be construed as impropersay by philadelphia philhappen while you were in mr colts hotel room no sir olivia replied visibly shocked by the question were you ever alone with mr colt at any time for even a brief period no sir matt sergeant payne was there all the time and so was detective whats his name matt detective hayzus martinez matt furnished im not surprised but i had to ask mariani said and what you did was onlyacting on orders from captain quaire explain to mr colt your involvement in the williamson murder yes sir and there was absolutely nothing social about your visit to mr colt he bought us dinner sir mariani thought that over it was obvious he hadnt liked to hear that philadelphia phil somehow got the mayors unlisted home number coughlin said he called him and asked him to respond to theledger editorial the mayor said he hadnt read it philadelphia phil will call him at his office at eleven the mayors going to have to take that call all of philadelphia phils earlymorning listeners heard him promise to take it and so far according to lieutenant pearson of northwest detectives mr philadelphia phil mariani began the bastards name is donaldson coughlin furnished phil donaldson mrdonaldson has called twice there asking to speak to detective lassiter mariani went on and twice to homicide according to captain quaire where he asked to speak to either her or payne mariani let that sink in for a moment then went on mrdonaldson as we all know is a skilled interviewer moreover it has been suggested to me that he is more than a little annoyed with lassiter for her having gotten mrs williamson to say she understood why the uniforms couldnt take the williamson girls door after he had painted the uniforms as we all know what he said commissioner may i go off at a tangent washington asked mariani glared at him but nodded make it quick jason just before we were all summoned here sir i was about to order sergeant payne and detective lassiter to immediately proceed to daphne mississippi to run down a lead in the williamson case sir thats daphne alabama matt said daphne alabama mariani parroted incredulously yes sir i believe its on the gulf of mexico washington said tell me about the lead jason coughlin said why dont you explain to the commissioner what you think you may have sergeant payne washington said yes sir sir last night the daphne policeactually it was a civilian from one of those community watch things apprehended a man in what looked like the act of prying open the window of a young womans apartment so what quaire snorted youre not suggesting its the williamson doer let the sergeant continue please captain peter wohl said softly he added wonderingly daphne alabama thats a long way from here isnt it yes sir matt said when i heard about this how did you hear about this mariani asked it was in the newspaper sir thebulletin go on sergeant wohl said i called down there sir and from what i learned there is enough of a similarity ofmodus operandi to merit further investigation over the years i have come to appreciate lieutenant washingtons belief that the stone under the stone sometimes has to be turned over wohl said even if that stone is as far away as where is this place daphne alabama sir matt said as far away as daphne alabama and that turning the stone over might take three four days perhaps even longer i think that lieutenant washington was right in deciding to send sergeant payne and detective lassiter all the way down to daphne alabama for four or five days to run this lead down wouldnt you agree captain quaire deputy commissioner coughlin said yes sir i certainly would captain quaire having just realized the allaround wisdom of getting sergeant payne and detective lassiter out of town for four or five days quickly agreed and under the circumstances wohl went on that sending them immediately without waiting for the ordinary administrative procedures to take place would be justified would you agree commissioner mariani thought that over for two seconds yes i would agree inspector he said have you got any cash matt wohl asked some and ive got credit cards matt said is there any compelling reason detective lassiter why you cant leave right now to pursue this investigation wherever it takes you id have to pack olivia said practically there might not be time for that wohl said perhaps you could pick up whatever you need when you get there yes sir detective lassiter said in that case i suggest that you and sergeant payne leave for the airport immediately inspector wohl said leave your car with the airport unit im sure lieutenant washington will arrange to have someone pick it up indeed i will lieutenant washington said bon chasse sergeant payne three we want to go to daphnealabama not florida sergeant payne said to the lady at the delta ticket counter in the philadelphia international airport according to the computer daphne alabama is served by both mobile alabama and pensacola florida the ticket agent said i can get youfirst class onlyon a flight connecting at eleventwentyfive to pensacola in atlanta leaving in thirtyfive minutes if you want to go to mobile youll have to wait until fivefortyfive in atlanta matt handed her his american express card i never leave home without it matt said to the ticket agent oh god olivia said oh shit the guns matt said the ticket agent looked at him with great interest were police officers matt said which caused the ticket agent to look at him with even greater interest olivia produced her badge and photo identification which caused the ticket agent to look at her with great interest youll have to pack any firearms unloaded in your luggage the ticket agent said we dont have any luggage matt said the supervisory ticket agent was consulted two metal lockboxes were produced olivias glock and matts colt were produced which caused the people in line to look at them with great interest the guns were then unloaded to the satisfaction of the supervisory ticket agent the cartridges placed in small ziploc plastic bags and the bags in padding placed in one of the lockboxes then the pistols were put in ziploc bags and with packing placed in the other lockbox matt filled out an orange unloaded firearm declaration card it was placed inside with the pistols then the boxes locked and placed on the baggage belt youre not the first the supervisory ticket agent said handing matt the keys and the claim checks to the boxes have a nice flight can i get you a cup of coffee or something else the stewardess inquired of the cute young couple in seats a and b no champagne sergeant payne replied i thought you got champagne in first class oh god olivia said were celebrating matt said to the stewardess just married maybe the stewardess asked matt grabbed olivias hand with his left hand and held the index finger of his right over his lips dont ask he said ill get your champagne the stewardess said smiling warmly youre insane olivia said when the stewardess had gone youre absolutely bonkers but she was smiling and she did not attempt to free her hand matt moved his champagne glass out of the way took the inflight telephone from its holder between the seats fed it with some difficultyhis american express card and then made two calls the first was to the homicide unit where he left a message for either captain quaire or lieutenant washington that he and detective lassiter were airborne the second was to the law offices of mawson payne stockton mcadoo amp lester where he asked to be connected with mrs craig mrs irene craig a tall silverhaired svelte lady in her fifties was executive secretary to mr brewster cortland payne ii a founding partner of the firm your dads on his way in matty mrs craig greeted him i dont know if hes seen theledger or not but the colonels already in the library reading up on libel the colonel was colonel j dunlop mawson another founding partner of the firm whom matts father sometimes described as the firms resident pit bull thats not

youre telling me mr mayorcorrect me if im wrongis that no one out there inphils philly is going to hear what went on in stan colts hotel room until sergeant payne and the beautiful lady detective come

captain told her to tell him i see phil said and what youre telling mecorrect me if im wrongis that all that happened in stan colts hotel room was that detective lassiter told him about the williamson

paused a moment just tell me the first thing that pops into your mind jesus please he said do you think assigning police officers to protect mr colt is a good investment of the time of yourself and other detectives like you hell yes christ he comes to town to raise money for west catholic it wouldnt be right if we let his fans get at him theyre nutty what they would like to do is tear his clothes off for souvenirs thank you for calling phil the mayor of philadelphia said its always a pleasure thank you for taking my call mr mayor the mayor put his phone in the cradle and signaled for martinez to do the same thing gotcha you bastard the mayor said and extended his hand to detective martinez thank you very much detective you did very well yes sir in the studio mr donaldson turned off his microphone shit he said aloud and then he had a second thought shit i forgot to ask him about wohl and washington in dallesandros five a pensacola florida police officer watched the carousel delivering baggage and then stepped up to matt when he saw him take the metal lockboxes which he recognized from previous use that looks too small for a couple of shotguns he said pleasantly if thats handguns why dont you wait until youre out of the airport before you open the box sure matt said you use the term on the job down here sure were on the job from philadelphia had to leave in a hurry what we need is someplace where we can buy clothing for a couple of days and some nice place for lunch leave the airport take a left at the second light youll see a shopping mall on the left then when you leave there get back on the same street go the same way as far as you can then make another left mcguires irish pub best place in town thanks and then were headed for daphne alabama when you leave mcguires youll have to turn right get on i until you hit i turn west its about forty miles you get the car matt olivia said i have to right the other side of the stairs the officer said pointing when olivia had walked away the officer said her too detective olivia lassiter nice yeah matt agreed hertz had a car waiting for them a ford mustang convertible and the clerk drew a magic marker route on a map showing how to reach the marriott in point clear alabama matt saw that point clear was next to fairhope and fairhope was next to daphne which was right on interstate they found the shopping malla large onewithout trouble and went inside just what were looking for matt said happily pointing to the entrance to victorias secret im not going in there with you olivia said im not going in there period you told me on the plane you maxed out your credit card matt said i have you in my power little maiden you sonofabitch ill wait outside matt said see what they have in translucent black while he was waiting for olivia matt found an atm and withdrew a thousand dollars when she appeared at the door to motion him in to sign the credit card charge he handed her five hundred dollars thanks she said ill give you a check when we get back to philly he said itll take months for the city to write a check you know that you have an honest face i can wait an hour later having bought enough clothing and other necessities of life to last them four days and suitcases to carry it in they got back into the mustang and went looking for mcguires irish pub i cant believe you ate the whole thing olivia said to matt making reference to the assorted sausage plate he had ordered for lunch it looked to her more than adequate for the both of them but by the time she had seen it the waitress had delivered her irish stew which looked like it too had been intended for at least two people i have to keep up my strength he said and looked around for the waitress to get the bill then he looked at her you know he said seriously theres only one person in the department who thinks this peeper may be our doer olivia shook her head no two she said why ive got a gut feeling matt olivia said you know yeah he said washington says you should listen to your gut whats next she asked ive been thinking about that he said before we go to the police station or wherever they have this guy id like to know more than we read in the paper how are you going to get that i think im going to start with the civilianfrom the citizens watch or whatever the hell its calledwho saw him by the window how are you going to find him when we get to the hotel the first thing im going to do is plug in my brandnew cellular battery charger then ill ask look in the phone book whatever she nodded the waitress delivered the bill matt handed his credit card to the waitress and said please add fifteen percent for yourself great meal olivia shook her head as the waitress walked away what you didnt even look at that check she said and god knows how much we spent in the shopping center and you got a lot of money from the atm dont you worry about maxing out your card no i dont matt said and i took the money from my bank if you get money on a credit card they charge you some outrageous interest so you are rich i heard something imcomfortable olivia so what it must be nice it is it took them a little over an hour to drive from mcguires irish pub to the marriott in point clear alabama their route took them first through daphne there olivia touched his arm and pointed out a sign identifying the entrance to the lake forest yacht club amp condominiums a mile or so away they saw the joseph hall criminal justice center which was obviously the police station an attractive brick building that looked as if it had been built last year as they went through fairhope they saw the fairhope police station another clean attractive building that looked even newer the hotel was several miles the other side of fairhope down a treelined road along the shore of mobile bay there were half a dozen fairsized sailboats bobbing along in the bay i dont know what i expected but it wasnt this matt said neither was the hotel what matt had expected to find after mrs craig had told him shed reserved two rooms in his name at the marriott it turned out to be more of a luxury resort than a hotel ancient oaks lined the drive to the entrance there were signs indicating the direction of a golf course and he could see both an enormous swimming pool and the masts of a fleet of sailboats a grayjacketed bellman pulled their luggage from the backseat of the roofdown mustang and said welcome to the grand hotel there were two pleasant young men behind the reception desk my name is payne matt said as he handed one of them his american express card im supposed to have a reservation the young man consulted his computer yes sir he said two nice singles is what was requested we think our bayside rooms are nice and weve put you into two of those im afraid theyre not adjacent thats fine detective lassiter said at per day will that be satisfactory mr payne thats fine matt said they were handed brochures outlining all the hotel had to offer and electronic keys to the rooms two bellmen appeared call me when youre settled matt said im going to get on the phone you want me to come there olivia asked probably a good idea matt said following the bellmen they marched off through the lobby toward the elevators the young man who had handled their reservation turned to the other what would you like to bet me that only one set of sheets will be mussed tonight he asked six police department a female voice with a thick southern accent announced good afternoon detective olivia lassiter said im hoping you can help me be happy to try maam do you happen to have a phone number where i could call the jacksons oak citizens community watch you mind if i ask why you want to call them well we just moved into the area and my husband wanted to ask about volunteering would you believe youre the sixth call weve had today saying the same thing is that so you got a pencil handy yes i do the best person to call is colonel lacey richards jr the daphne police operator said hes the one who really runs jabberwocky he lives on captain oneal drive pause damn i had his number here somewhere there was another pause here it is the daphne police operator said and recited it another female with a thick southern accent answered sergeant paynes call and said that she was sorry but the colonels out playing golf he should be back about five thank you very much sergeant payne replied ill call again then he put the telephone down leaned against the headboard of the kingsized bed and looked across the room at detective olivia lassiter who was sitting in an armchair hes playing golf but will be back at five i still think we should see what he has to say before we talk to the cops so do i olivia said on the other hand if all theyve got him on is a peeping tom charge which is a misdemeanor he may post bail and be long gone they wont let him post bail without knowing who he is we can find him great minds run in similar paths matt said he looked at his watch we have a little over an hour what do you want to do detective lassiter looked at him for a long moment then stood up and then looked at him a long moment again then she reached down for the hem of the light blue cotton dress shed bought in the shopping mall in pensacola and pulled it off over her head jesus christ matt said well you said to see what they had in translucent black olivia said hello colonel richards right colonel my name is matthew payne has this got something to do with the jacksons oak citizens community watch yes sir it does ill tell you what im going to do im going to give you my office number you call there in the morning and ask my secretary to mail you an application colonel im a sergeant with the homicide unit of the philadelphia police department youre calling from philadelphia no sir im in the grand hotel in point clear you came all the way down here about that pervert i bagged last night hey you said homicide didnt you yes sir i did i knew that sonofabitch was up to more than peeping through windows colonel richards said colonel id like to talk to you sure when at your earliest convenience sir how about right now let me tell you how to get here thank you very much sir seventeen one it took some time for sergeant payne and detective lassiter to find the home of lieutenant colonel lacey richards jr on captain oneal drive in daphne captain oneal drive was a winding road in a heavily wooded area and the house numbers were hardor impossibleto find but they finally found it a large home sitting under massive oaks between captain oneal drive and mobile bay colonel richards a short totally bald barrelchested man wearing a yellow polo shirt and khaki pants opened the door himself youre the homicide guy from philadelphia he asked yes sir payne right yes sir sergeant matt payne you didnt tell me you were bringing the little lady a pleasure to meet you maam this is detective lassiter colonel matt said ill be damned colonel richards said well come on and tell me what you want to know can i offer you a little taste i was about to have one myself thats very kind of you sir matt said i didnt catch your name richards said to olivia lassiter sir i meant your first name olivia sir can i offer you a little something olivia yes thank you he led them through the house to a patio in the rear there was a row of upholstered desk chairs and a wellstocked wet bar youre just in time for sunset he announced pointing at the sun setting across the bay i like to come out here and watch and have a little taste its very nice olivia said a tanned grayhaired woman at least a foot taller than richards came onto the patio im not sure you should be here baby richards said i live here lacey she said matteroffactly hi im bev richards this is sort of official honey did he offer you something to drink she said ignoring him yes maam sir i have no objection to mrs richards hearing what i have to ask matt said i surrender richards said this is olivia lassiter detective olivia lassiterand this is sergeant payne they shook hands my husband said you were here about that pervert he caught last night bev richards said yes maam all the way from philadelphia yes maam i really want to hear about this she said but will it wait until i make you something to drink yes maam matt said whatll it be richards asked whatever youre having will be fine sir you may want to reconsider bev said what he drinks is something he calls a scotch martini matt and olivia looked at each other and smiled he saw that richards had seen the smile and didnt like it you make a martini except no vermouth and with scotch matt asked right that would be fine with us sir i just taught oliv detective lassiter to drink those except with irish see wiseass colonel richards said to his wife theyre the drink of choice at a bar where we go matt said you mean you and her or the other homicide cops richards asked she and me and the other homicide cops matt said oh god ill never hear the end of that bev richards said you want me to make enough for you or are you going to continue to be difficult make the damn scotch martinis bev richards said i cant wait to hear what hes going to ask you i can make the drinks and talk at the same time just like i can chew gum and walk at the same time what do you want to know sergeant actually sir id like to ask you what happened and if you dont mind id like to get our conversation on my tape recorder richards frowned and for a moment matt thought he might say no what the hell why not richards said and began to pour scotch into a glass martini shaker full of ice he looked over his shoulder at matt where should i begin he asked when was the first time you saw this fellow matt asked well just before the whole thing went down was the first time i saw him richards said i was checking the guard so to speak im not sure i follow you sir well we run three roving patrols some of our guys are getting a little long in the tooth and in the wee hours they sort of pull off and catch a few winks you can get yourself shot in the service for that but this isnt the service and all i can do is roam around and try to catch them and then all i can do is wag my finger in their faces and tell them theyre letting the side down i understand matt said colonel richards interrupted himself to vigorously shake the martini mixer for a full sixty seconds and then with the precision of a chemist dealing with a known poisonous substance to pour the mixture into oversized martini glasses welcome to our home bev said raising her glass thank you matt and olivia said in duet the colonel took an appreciative sip and then went on well i saw this guyor thought i didi saw what looked like somebody running between trees you know what i mean yes sir so i figured if i stopped hed see that so i drove a couple of blocks away and parked and then came back on foot my night visions not what it used to be but i can still move pretty good through the dark i was in special forces for a long time were you really olivia asked yes maam i was richards said so i see him doing this again moving from one tree to another stopping a minute and then running to the next by the time hed done that three four times i had a pretty good idea where he was running to and while he was hiding behind a tree i ran and a little faster and pretty soon i was ahead of him interesting matt said and i was right about where he was going richards said building i got down on the ground when i saw him coming and i saw him pull a maska black ski mask over his head did i say he was wearing black coveralls no sir you did not what about the mask youve seen them one of our guysi mean one of the delta force guys not the guys in jabberwockycame up with the idea of using themall they are is regular ski masks except black and without all that cutesypoo reindeer stuff you see on some ski masksfor their psychological effect when youre hitting an objective they scare hell out of people they think theyre being attacked by darth vader i understand matt said so the first thing i thought was that i didnt have to be sherlock holmes to figure out that somebody running around dressed up like that wasnt selling bibles doortodoor and what i should do was shove my up his left nostril but you always think twice or should and i did then i thought maybe this was just some clown trying to scare his wife or girlfriend or for that matter boyfriendyoud be surprised at the weirdos that collect in those condominiums the things weve seen in jabberwocky disgusting bev richards chimed in absolutely disgusting anyway so i decided i better be sure this guy wasnt some kind of pervertor if he was a pervert he was playing with his own squeezebefore i did anything so i kept him under surveillance then he goes to the kitchen window of b theres two apartments to a floor in the condo buildings four apartments to each one b is the ground floor one to the left if youre facing it from the frontand whips out this knife sword is more like it it looks like something the bad guys carry in a stan colt movie a great big sonofabitch watch your mouth colonel bev richards said this gentleman then begins to attempt to pry the kitchen window open with this knife the blade of which i would estimate to be at least fourteen inches in length as much as four inches in breadth at the widest point and highly polished perhaps even chromium plated the colonel said paused and inquired better much better bev said in other words sergeant a great big sonofabitch the colonel went on visibly pleased with himself yousaw him colonel olivia asked attempt to pry open the window youre sure thats what he was doing well he could have been attacking a column of ants with that sword but it looked to me like what he was doing with it was trying to pry the window open yes sir thank you well i got out the ol cellular alerted the team told them what was going down and to block the exits unless you want to swim theres only two ways out of there then i got up put a round in the chamber turned the flashlight on him and said excuse me sir may i ask what youre doing those were your exact words matt asked those were my exact words colonel richards said and then what happened for a moment i thought he was going to attack me with the sword and i hoped he wouldnt because i never was any good at taking sharp objects away from people and i didnt want to have to put him down with the because that would really have opened a large can of worms and then he just turned and ran off still wearing the mask matt asked i dunno i suppose so anyway i called halt or ill fire and let off a couple of rounds in the general direction of the moon thinking that might scare him into stopping it didnt so i called the team and told them to block the exits and to be careful because this guy had a knife then i called the cops then i started for my car i saw headlights go on and heard an engine start and tires squealing so i got in my car when i got to the highway exit i saw that hed run into chambers galloways branddamnednew mercedes truck thing and that the old guy had him spreadeagled on the ground with a twelvebore shotgun pointed at him did he have the mask on then matt asked no but i looked into his car just before the cops came and it was in the car that and the knife did the police find out who he is olivia asked not right away the colonel said and looked at his wife at first he wouldnt say anything and he wasnt carrying any identification not even a drivers license so charley tossed him in the slam charley olivia asked charley yancey the chief of police and a pretty good one the colonel explained and then went on i think charley charged him with leaving the scene of an accident which is heavier than being a peeping tom which is like spitting on the sidewalk anyway once he had him locked up charley began to try to identify him through the car and did he not until about ten oclock this morning the colonel said the car had illinois plates but when charley called out there they said the plates were not for the car this guy was driving and they didnt have the vin the vehicle identification number yes sir im familiar with the term matt said in their data bank so charley checked with montgomerythats the state capital where our data bank isand neither did they nor did florida or mississippi interesting matt said so charley finally decided to make sure he was using the right vin and when he went out to the impound yard he finally saw the gambino motor cars chrome thing on the trunk you know what i mean im not sure sir next to where it says chevrolet impala or whatever the dealers put their own name yes sir now i understand colonel can i ask you how you know all this the question made colonel richards uncomfortable the minute i started to tell you i was afraid youd ask that question he said would you be satisfied if i told you i have a source inside the police department i do and i dont want him getting in trouble with charley because hes keeping me up to speed on this youre talking about a police officer no im talking about the guy who goes there once a week to wax the floors colonel i cant see any reason why i should tell the chief of police that i even know who you are i was just curious thats probably a good idea dont tell him you talked to me all right sir i wont you were saying something about the car dealer fats gambino great big fat italian guy he takes a lot of heat with a name like that as you can imagine yes sir anywayhes a friend of mine by the wayfats has the mercedes franchise and the porsche franchise and others volvo for one and he deals in classy cars exotic cars is that what they call them rolls royces old packards stuff like that exotic cars yes sir i understand and he also does things like buy fleets of cars from people like hertz and dollar and alamo i think they get rid of them after forty thousand miles or a year something like that anyway gambino buys them up north brings them here cleans them up and puts them on his usedcar lot thats where the peeper got his car he bought it from gambino no he borrowed it from gambino it turns out this guy is in the exoticcar business he was in town to try to sell fats a rolls royce and something else i forget what and to try to make a deal with gambino for a couple of porsches im a little confused here colonel olivia asked youre saying this fellow drove here from someplace in a rolls royce and then borrowed a chevrolet from mr gambino no he drove here in a great big tractortrailer rig with three four really fancy cars in it then he borrowed the chevy from gambino told him he was going to biloxi to play blackjack fats is one pissedoff guy let me tell you there goes your mouth again mrs richards said mr gambino is apparently distressed at the prospect that his name will be associated in the publics mind with that of a chap charged by the police as a peeping tom better sometimes lacey let me see if i can get this in sequence colonel matt said when the chief of police couldnt identify the car by its vin he did so by tracing it to the gambino dealership a little after ten this morning gambino goes to work late when he finally came in he said yeah he owned a car like that he owned a dozen cars like that and he had loaned one to a friend of his to go to biloxi bingo mr peeper is identified okay i think ive got it straight matt said thank you and now are you going to tell me why youre interested in this guy interested enough to come all the way down here from philadelphia pa colonel youve been very helpful and im really grateful but i would be in deep trouble if it ever got out i told you anything that could possibly jeopardize our investigation okay i had twentyseven years in uniform and for most of that time i had a topsecret clearance but okay would you be satisfied if i told you colonel that from what youve told me the way this peeping tom operates is unusually like the way a man were looking for in connection with a homicide in philadelphia operates your guy is a pervert too colonel richards asked yes colonel olivia said he is if our guy turns out to be your guy will i have to read about it in the newspaper or will you tell me first youll hear about it long before it gets into the papers matt said i promise two it was ten to seven when matt pulled the rented mustang into the joseph hall criminal justice center in daphne there was a large parking lot and it was full matt wondered why at this time of day im getting hungry again he said to olivia after all you had for lunch i cant believe it i dont know i must have done something to work up an appetite i cant imagine what olivia said when are you going to call lieutenant washington i dont have anything to tell him yet matt argued and if he had something to say to us he would have called inside a double glass door was a barren room with shiny tile walls there were several metal doors and a small window in the walls next to the window was a buzzer button and a sign reading ring bell for service matt pushed the button there was a buzzing sound and a moment later the small door opened inward and the face of a plump middleaged woman appeared in the opening she had what looked like a police uniform on but matt saw neither badge nor weapon can i help you good evening matt said and showed her his identification im sergeant payne this is detective lassiter and wed like to see chief yancey please cant right now hes in court she pointed to her left to a single door in the shiny tile wall well then may i please speak to the supervisor on duty thatd be sergeant paul do you think i can see sergeant paul you want tosee him or just speak to him id really like to speak to him in person matt said hes on patrol ill give him a call thank you very much ninety seconds later her face appeared again hes still working a dui says it will take him fifteen minutes to get here thank you should we wait here if you went in the courtroom you could sit down she said ill tell him where you are thank you very much matt opened the single steel door in the tiled wall for olivia then followed her in they found themselves at the head end of a fairly large courtroom right by the judge who sitting on his bench a few feet above them looked down at them in what was certainly curiosity and possibly annoyance go along the wall matt quickly ordered olivia and he followed her past a railing dividing the bench areawhich had tables for the accused and their counselfrom the spectator area which was furnished with benches not unlike church pews behind the last row of benches was an open area fairly crowded with peoplematt thought they looked like the accused and their counseland behind that a set of double doors they found seats in the nexttothelast row and tried to look inconspicuous there were a number of police officers in the courtroom most of them on the bench side of the barrier two of them stood out one was a short trim man in a neat white shirt uniform on each of his collar points was a colonels eagle in the philadelphia police department that was the uniform insignia of a chief inspector inspector peter wohl on those rare occasions when he wore a uniform wore a silver leaf the same insignia as that of a lieutenant colonel when the man wearing the colonels eagles looked at them with unabashed curiosity matt decided he had to be chief yancey and had the unkind thought that the homicide unit of the philadelphia police department probably outnumbered the daphne police department and that captain quaire only got to wear the insignia of a captain the second police officer who stood out looked matt thought as if he could be jason washingtons younger brother he was an enormous very black sergeant he was quietly talking on a cellular phone which almost disappeared in his massive hand it didnt take either matt or olivia long to figure out what was going on this was municipal court primarily occupied with misdemeanor level violations of the law primarily traffic offenses and it was a smoothrunning operation the clerk called a case number the accused sometimes accompanied by his counsel or his mother andor father approached the bench one of the uniforms then detached himself from the knot of fellow police officers and stood facing the bench the clerk read the charges and the judge asked how the defendant pled if the defendant pled guilty sentence was immediately dispensed if the defendant pled not guilty the arresting officer testified the defendant or his counsel but not matt noted with a smile his mother andor father was permitted to crossexamine the uniform and when that was done the judge immediately decided guilt or innocence and handed out the sentence then the next case was called a hand tapped matts shoulder he looked around and saw a middleaged man he instantly decided was a lawyer the lawyer was pointing to the crackedopen double doors of the courtroom matt saw the enormous sergeant beckoning to him he and olivia made their way through the standees in the rear of the courtroom and out the door youre the cop from philadelphia the enormous sergeant asked in a thick southern accent matt saw that he had a highly polished name badge reading sgt d kenny pinned to his crisply pressed shirt this is the guy i talked to when i called from outside olivias apartment cops from philadelphia matt said this is detective lassiter and my name is payne im a sergeant the sergeant stopped matt from producing his identification with a wave of his huge hand the chief says that sergeant paul doesnt know anything about the peeper that court will probably last until about tenthirty maybe later and that you can wait for him if you want but that hed much rather talk to you in the morning about eight can i ask you two questions sergeant you can ask is your peeper going to make bail and walk out of here tonight no matt took his laptop out of his case the enormous sergeant watched silently and without expression as matt turned it on id really be grateful sergeant if you could tell me if this knife looks familiar to you matt turned the laptops screen so the sergeant could see it it was one of the digital images matt had taken from the camera the doer had left in cheryl williamsons apartment it showed a visibly terrified young woman lying on a bed tied to the headboard with plastic binders her breasts were exposed lying between them was a large knife its tip almost touching the soft skin under her chin there were several thumbnailsized drops of a thick milky white fluid on the highly polished blade the enormous sergeant looked at the image then at matt and then back at the computer screen then he handed the laptop back to matt wait he said in two minutes he was back with the chief matt wordlessly raised the almost closed laptop screen and extended it to the chief whered you get this the chief asked our doer forgot his camera when he left the scene matt said possibly because by then he knew hed killed miss williamson and was a little frightened sonofabitch the chief said instantly adding excuse me maam olivia made a gesture indicating she understood the chief taking care that olivia could not see the screen returned the laptop to matt youre the sergeant who talked to me and sergeant kenny this morning right yes sir im sergeant payne and this is detective lassiter let me tell you how it is sergeant sometime tonight in there a man is going to appear before the judge to have both the suspension of his dui sentence and the suspension of the revocation of his drivers license challenged by me i personally got him again for dui two nights ago and one of my nottoosmart officers let him go on his own recognizance after hed had time to sober up hes a lawyer and hes got a damned good lawyer and nothing would make either of them happier than for them to show up only to hear that im not there i think theyre sitting in a car someplace waiting for some other lawyer to call telling them ive gone you follow me yes sir another continuance and you dont want that to happen no i dont i understand sir i was a little concerned that your peeper would get out on bail thats not going to happen not tonight the chief said kenny you bring these officers up to date on what happened last night we can do that much and later tonight if youd like or in the morningwhich would be better for mewe can talk about what were going to do about this peeping tom jabberwocky caught yes sir chief sergeant kenny said and tell the people in the lockup that the only person who can let mr homer c daniels out of his cell is me yes sir chief sergeant kenny led them through a corridor then a locked door into what was obviously the administrative department of the daphne police department it was a fairly large room with several rows of desks offices opened off it and matt saw signs identifying those of the chief the deputy chief and thenjust as they reached it one reading sgt kenny he waved them inside closed the door and gestured for them to sit down okay i dont know how much you know not much matt said i dont know how manydetails you have so if i start telling you something you already know stop me sure i dont think the chiefdislikes colonel richards sergeant kenny said but the chief doesnt know what a fine officer the colonel was when he was in special forces i do and does the chief know that you know i dont think thats ever come up in conversation come to think of it i understand good sergeant kenny said he met matts eyes for a long minute okay i wasnt there at the yacht club but the dispatcher called me at the house and told me what had gone down so i came here and while they were booking him a concerned citizen who didnt identify himself called me and said he smelled that this peeper was more than a peeper interesting well after they booked him on what peeping its a misdemeanor matt nodded our detective sergeant and the chief interviewed him i got to listen your detective sergeant olivia asked yes maam we have two a detective and a detective sergeant i see this was three oclock in the morning and this guy said he wasnt going to say anything even give us his name without a lawyer hed been mirandized sure well hell i thought that was a little strange this wasnt even serious not even like dui this was peeping we catch peepers every couple of weeks the judge fines them two hundred dollars and court costs and threatens them with having to register as a sex offender if they get caught again i cant recall any peeper ever going to jail i understand then the chief tried to identify this guy through the car and got nowhere that made him a little more suspicious so he charged him with leaving the scene of an accident which is either depending on the circumstances either a firstclass misdemeanorthirty days in our jail max or a felony anyway they just left him in a cell to think things over i guess he did because in the morningjust before you calledwhen the chief got him a lawyer hed changed his tune now he was all remorse he was ashamed and was going to be embarrassed when all this came out and all he wanted to do was take his punishment had you identified him by then he gave us his name and said he was from las vegas and that hed borrowed the car from fats gambino in mobile said he was doing business with gambino told us gambino would confirm that and practically begged us not to tell gambinowhy hed been arrested and then you had to wait for gambino to come to work yeah and while we were waiting for that you called and asked about the knife okay anyway fats confirmed what he had told us and said hed loaned him the car to go to biloxi to play blackjack and offered to get his bail and we told him bail hadnt been set that he hadnt been arraigned and then an hour after that fats called back said hed just got the new orleans newspaper thetimespicayune it had the picture of old mr galloway standing over him in it and fats wanted to know if the guy on the ground was the one who was driving his car and the chief said yes it was and fats threw a fit he wasnt going to make bail for a pervert et cetera et cetera and asked was there any way he could get his car back without his name being connected with it the chief told him hed see what he could do but couldnt make no promises sergeant kenny let this sink in for a moment then went on by this time the chiefwhos a nice manis starting to feel sorry for this guy and the mayor says that enough people have been laughing at daphne and jabberwocky and that if he had his druthers the municipal judge would set bail high enough to hurt him when he jumped it but not too high that he couldnt afford to make it or jump itsomething on the order of a thousand dollars maybe lessand that would be the end of it the chief was willing to go along there was your phone call but you told the chief you were going to send a telex saying who you were and you didnt so he thought it was likely you were some wiseass reporter i completely forgot about that matt said when i showed my lieutenant the newspaper the next thing i knew olivia and i were on the way to the airport im sorry and then you showed up here sergeant kenny said and that changed things were really anxious to bag our doer sergeant olivia said dr p the psychiatrist who did a profile said that the doer was going to be really frightened when he realized he had killed someone and do one of two thingsgo underground for a long time or keep doing this sort of thing knowing that he could only be executed once if this is our doer he obviously wasnt frightened into going underground sergeant kenny considered that for a moment can i ask how you got involved in this maam just curious i was next up on the wheel at northwest detectives when the brother found the victim olivia said so i got involved that way you know what she means sergeant no but im guessing she was the first detective on the scene and then you got involved because it was a homicide right so why do you two think this guy is your man because of the knife that would be incriminating if its the same one in the pictures we have olivia said but we have more well lets see if it is kenny said he got up walked to a steel door and unlocked two locks he came out with a jim bowie replica knife wrapped in plastic film we got the mobile police lab to take prints off it this afternoon he said theyre better equipped to do that than we are theyre also having their expert see if theres a match between mr danielss prints and the ones they took off this he unwrapped the jim bowie replica as matt opened his laptop and turned it on well what you have here is a big knife that looks just like the big knife in the picture sergeant kenny said i dont suppose they made more than five or ten thousand knives just like this in the photo sergeant olivia said those spots i suppose is the word on the blade are sperm we can make a dna comparison he looked at her for a long moment but said nothing was there a camera sergeant olivia asked yes there was looked like brandnew one of those digitals our doer left a digital camera at the scene we took those photographs from it matt said and a mask a black ski mask what we believe and what the psychiatric profiler believes sergeant olivia said is that our doer has previously done what he did in this case that is stalk a young woman until he feels comfortable in breaking into her home he then ties her to her bed with plastic ties kenny turned and went to the closet returning with a ziploc bag full of plastic ties like these like those matt said and when she is terrified sufficiently and her clothing has been cut off olivia went on he humiliates her sexually and takes photographs of various stages of the assault and then kills them no we dont think so matt said we think he didnt mean to kill our victim it just happened would you agree sergeant olivia asked that there is a similarity in themodus operandi of our doer and what this man was apparently about to do last night i think you could reasonably conclude something like that kenny said so what do we do now i dont know matt confessed i have no idea what the legal procedure is but i know theres enough here to tell my lieutenant about it sergeant kenny pointed to the telephone on his desk matt started to reach for it then stopped would it be possible for us to have a look at this man he asked i dont mean interview him i just have a feeling i ought to have a look at him olivia looked at him in surprise and disapproval kenny considered matts request a moment then nodded stood up and nodded again this time toward the door if youve got weapons he said as he unholstered his pistol and laid it on his desk itd be better to leave them in here matt and olivia laid their pistols on his desk which gave matt a chance to take a closer look at kennys shiny revolver it was matt saw more than a little surprised a smith amp wesson model in magnum caliber identical except for the fiveinch barrel on this one to the weapon clint eastwood had made famous in the movies well hell why not as big as kenny is he probably doesnt even feel the recoil sergeant paynes experience with jails was limited to those in philadelphia and a cell in the spring lake new jersey jail in which at sixteen he and mr chadwick t nesbitt iv also sixteen had been confined overnight charged with disturbing the peace of that seashore community by taking a midnight swim in the atlantic without bathing attire the daphne jail was like none in his experience it reminded matt more of a hospital than a jail it was spotless the walls were of white tile the bars on the six cells were white the incell toilets were of stainless steel and there was no graffiti on the walls the first cell was empty sergeant kenny pointed to the second it held a large crewcutted man wearing white coveralls on the chest of which was embroidered daphne jail in red matt stepped in front of the cell and looked in olivia stepped up beside him homer c daniels as if he was trying to be friendly at first smiledif a little uneasilyat the young couple standing with sergeant kenny looking into his cell then the smile vanished who are you he asked and when there no response angrily demanded sergeant who the fuck are these people watch your mouth mr daniels sergeant kenny said you see the lady im sergeant payne mr daniels matt said and this is detective lassiter were from the homicide unit of the philadelphia police department what do you want with me daniels asked im sorry sir but thats about all i can say to you without your attorney being present he turned and walked toward the door through which he had entered the cell block he stopped just inside out of sight of the cell and gestured almost frantically for kenny to follow him but kenny waited until olivia had turned away from the cell and started for the door they both looked at matt in bewilderment matt frantically silently mouthed something to sergeant kenny he had to do it three times before kenny understood thought it over shrugged and then dutifully repeated what matt had mouthed you think thats your man sergeant he said speaking a little more loudly than he normally did no question about it matt boomed confidently thats him it all fits the knife the mask the digital camera same modus operandi all well have to do is match the dna and theres no challenging dna ill start the extradition paperwork tonight olivia shook her head in disbelief matt gestured for olivia and kenny to go through the door when they had he closed it now we call the black buddha he said to olivia olivia rolled her eyes oh shit there goes my automatic mouth again the black buddha is what we call my lieutenant matt said who is an africanamerican gentleman slightly larger than you sergeant and generally regarded as the best homicide investigator between bangor maine and key west florida bigger than me kenny asked bigger than you sergeant olivia said kenny smiled how do you start the extradition paperwork i havent a clue matt confessed ill ask lieutenant washington what was that business in there kenny asked when i saw that sonofabitch the idea of him getting a good nights sleep thinking he was going to bail himself out of here tomorrow annoyed me and then i remembered what washington told me the black buddha kenny interrupted matt nodded about the likelihood of a suspect who has a time to reflect on his sins and b not had much sleep telling you a lot more than he would if he had had neither youre not actually thinking of interviewing him olivia asked ill do exactly what washington tells me to do matt said hello a female voice said matt recognized it to be that of martha washington matt martha matt said martha washington sergeant kenny asked smiling matt smiled hes in the shower matt and you i understand are in the deep south about as deep as you can get matt said standing here with a sergeant who looks like your husbands twin brother i really have to talk to him when should i call back ill just hand him the cellular she said hold on im already annoyed with you for not having checked in earlier washingtons voice came over the line and i dislike being interrupted when i am in the midst of my ablutions that said you may proceed this is our doer jason you will forgive me for asking matthew but do you believe this because of something more than your intuition sergeant kenny showed me the knife he had its a twin of the one in the pictures he had a digital cameraa new oneand a package of plastic ties he was trying to pry open a window in a young womans apartment when the citizens watch guy caught him who is he his name is homer c daniels white male six feet one inch two hundred pounds midthirties hes a dealer in exotic cars from las vegas and he drives all over the country doing business on what charges are theypresumably the daphne policeholding him peeping a misdemeanor and leaving the scene of an accident which is a little heavier is there a chance however slight that he might be allowed to post bail not tonight there was a thirtysecond pause i will be calling you back shortly matthew may i presume your cell phone battery is fully charged you may so presume splendid washington said and the line went dead matt hung up the telephone on sergeant kennys desk hes going to call me back matt said you want to wait here i think maybe id better we keep a pot of coffee going sergeant kenny said matts cellular buzzed fifteen minutes later i have just spoken with mrs solomon washington said placing what i truly hope is justified confidence in your analysis of the situation she is dispatching an assistant district attorneyprobably if she decides peter wohl will just have to do without his services for a day or two steven cohen esq as we speak a teletype message is being prepared asking the daphne authorities to hold mr daniels travel arrangements similarly are under way you will be advised of the details yes sir matt said i devoutly hope this is not premature good job matt thank you sir please share that with detective lassiter yes sir eighteen one were going to have to check out of the hotel olivia said almost as soon as they got into the mustang we never should have gone in there in the first place the alternative would seem to be sleeping on the beach matt said the alternative was any of the motels we saw when we turned off the interstate into daphne every time i stay in a motel off an interstate i am invariably denied sleep by the sounds of unbridled passion a crying baby or a barking dogoften all of the abovecoming from the next cubicle whats wrong with where we are an assistant da is coming tomorrow she said i dont want him going back to philadelphia and saying when i got down there payne has got his squeeze in a plush hotel i hadnt thought about that matt confessed and the cold fact seems to be that i do seem to have my squeeze in a plush hotel youre right we better get out of there before our shameful secret becomes public knowledge but in the morning not tonight matt looked at olivia expecting a smile she was not smiling is that how you think of me as your squeeze that was your term mother not mine neither said anything else for the next ten minutes until they were off fourlane us and driving through fairhope hey look at that matt said cheerfully pointing trattoria what she asked i wouldnt be a bit surprised if that was an italian restaurant he said it doesnt sound polish how about it squeeze a little linguini a nice bottle of red maybe even candles romantically flickering in a bottle covered with dripping wax dont ever call me that again she said coldly sorry matt said i was about to add then we can go to the hotel and fool around does that interest you at all detective lassiter just go to the hotel please you want to tell me what ive done wrong from your perspective probably nothing and from yours ive been thinking about what us what about us this afternoonchrist from the time i first laid eyes on youi thought us was nice and dared to think the feeling was reciprocal its happening too fast she said and youre dangerous how the hell am i dangerous you dont think thats your problem she said give me a for example mother you never should have talked to the doer without permission were you there when i said i cant talk to you without your lawyer being present or words to that effect when she didnt reply he asked anything else ive done dangerously when you chased the guy in philadelphia you were drunk i wasnt drunk and you will recall i caught him after you fell down twice i fell over a goddamn wire she snorted and the highway sergeant gave you mints he saw you were drunk isnt that what they call the pot calling the kettle black at least i admit it okay i admit it i was drunk happy and we never should have gone to the hotel in the first place you should have thought what it would mean to me if it ever got out i wasnt aware that our going to a hotelin which by the way we have separate roomswas going to see you branded forever with a scarlet a on your forehead it would damned sure keep me from staying in homicide olivia said look you better be prepared oliviachrist youre naivefor all sorts of clever remarks from the guys in homicide about our vacation in alabama whether we move into some dump of a motel or not there are going to be suggestions that we fooled around what theyre going to think is a i walked into homicide and b took one look at the hotshot sergeant who calls the first deputy commissioner uncle denny and c jumped into his bed and you know it and you know thatll keep me from staying in homicide and you dont care as much as i would like it to be otherwise i think you have absolutely no chance of staying in homicide is that so thats so the only reason im in homicide is because mariani had that brainstorm about giving the topfive guys on the sergeants exam their choice of assignment it had nothing to do right with your uncle denny coughlin no goddamn it it didnt he tried to talk me out of it as a matter of fact she snorted again and he was probably right there is no one more aware of my limitations as a homicide investigator than i am amazing thats the first modest thing ive ever heard you say oh screw you fat chance the doorman of the grand hotel opened the door for olivia olivia would you like to have dinner with me i think ill have a sandwich in my room but thank you just the same she smiled at the doorman and walked into the hotel two matt drove back into fairhope and had linguini with italian sausage and a bottle of merlotall of a bottle of merlotin la trattoria while considering the differences of the mental processes of the opposite sexes and then he drove very carefully back to the grand hotel asked for any messagesthere were noneand then went into the hotels bird cage lounge where he sat all by himself in an upholstered chair at a table and had the first of five drinks of famous grouse on the rocks the prospect of a scotchor even an irishmartini did not have much appeal between drinks three and four he used the house phone on the bar to call miss olivia lassiter the hotel operator said she was sorry but miss lassiter had left word that she didnt wish to take any more calls tonight between drinks four and five his cellular buzzed it was detective joe damata the black buddha said to call matt meet delta at the mobile airport mobile thats what he said mobile arriving at twelvethirtyfive they pronounced that mowbeel not mow bile by the way no shit tell him ill be at the mowbeel airport whos mrs solomon sending down did she make up her mind i dunno joe said this is the doer huh it sure looks like it joe good for you matt having a good time absolutely joe yeah i bet you are damata said chuckled and hung up after drink five matt signaled for the waitress and signed the bill ive had all the fun i can stand for one night he said to her he left a call for half past seven and went to bed he woke with a hangover and a clammy undershirt he wondered about that and sniffed and when he first encountered a really foul odor remembered he had had a nightmare i always smell like death warmed over when i have one and this was one of the better ones a ford van driven by warren k fletcher white male five feet ten thirtyone of germantown was backing up toward him with the obvious intention of squashing him between the van and the porsche first he couldnt get the snubnose out of its holster no matter how hard he tried and then when he finally got it out he couldnt make it fire no matter how hard he pulled on the trigger and then when he finally got it to fire he fired five times and missed all five times hed seen the movie before and when he missed with the last shot and the van was about to squash him he usually woke up but i dont remember waking up last night probably the booze and fletcher as the star of my nightmare usually its susan is there some significance in fletcher showing up again the sweat soaked tshirt smelled so foul that he didnt want to pack it with the rest of his clothing he took it instead into the shower with him and started to wash it to hell with this ill just buy another tshirt he tossed the tshirt into a trash can and then took a long shower considered again the gross injustices of the world as he found it then had an inspiration screw her he said aloud and when he got out of the shower he walked still naked and dripping to the bedside telephone and called the concierge the concierge said the pro shop of the lakewood country club would have clubs to rent and golf shoes for sale and how about a tee time as early as possible well perhaps tomorrow sir the rainll probably stop in time for the course to be playable tomorrow shall i reserve a tee time for you then ill be gone im sorry thank you very much having the telephone in his hand reminded him of two calls he had to make and he made them first he called colonel richards and told him he thought the peeper was the man they were looking for and that an assistant district attorney was en route from philadelphia and then he called sergeant kenny and told him that he would be meeting whoever was coming from philadelphia at the mobile airport a little after noon i think whoevers coming will want to see the chief right away is he going to be available then as soon as i can get from the airport to the station hell be here then im sure if he needs to talk to me youve got my cellular number right kenny said mind telling me what youll be doing until that moment matt had no ideasince golf was out and it was raininghow he was going to spend the morning but it came to him im going to take statements from the colonel the old guy mr chambers galloway kenny furnished ill give you his number and anybody else maybe fats gambino if i have time on the way to the airport kenny chuckled deep in his throat reminding matt of jason washington thatll make ol fatss day his place is right on airport boulevard a couple of miles short of the airport you cant miss it i wouldnt suggest you tell him youre coming and anybody else you think would be a good idea ill think on it and tell you when you come in thanks kenny my pleasure matt considered for a moment having a roomservice breakfast but decided against it but not because of the thought he had on the way to the dining room which was that after he ate a leisurely breakfast he would call detective lassiter and suggest that if she was now awake they had work to do he would then meet her in the lobby and she could have a mcmuffin and canned orange juice for breakfast at the mcdonalds on their way to daphne she came into the dining room a minute after he took a table even before the waiter had brought coffee jesus thats a goodlooking woman good morning matt said good morning sergeant olivia said may i she asked indicating a chair of course he smiled at her she smiled back but her smile was a momentary curl of her lips completely devoid of anything resembling warmth okay if thats the way you want to play it screw you olivia sat down what were going to do this morning is take statements from colonel richards and mr galloway matt said and then without waiting for a reply devoted his entire attention to the breakfast menu three detective payne had just about finished his belgian waffles with strawberries and cream which he had ordered to accompany his chipped beef over toast with poached eggs and glanced to see if detective lassiter was finished with her wholewheat toast when he thought he heard his name being spoken he looked toward the headwaiters table in time to see the woman behind it nod in his direction the nod guiding a young man in a business suit toward him sergeant payne the young man asked matt nodded my name is roswell bernhardt sergeant im an attorney specifically im mr homer c danielss attorney i dont mean to be rude counselor but i dont think i should be talking to you matt said i understand bernhardt said certainly but what i was hoping you could do is give me the name of someone in your district attorneys office with whom i could speak i wouldnt know what name to give you counselor in the das office except for that of the da herself thats mrs eileen mcnamara solomon i understood someones on the way here bernhardt said then added sergeant kenny told me that if kenny told this guy my name and where to find me and that somebodys coming he must like him what the hell im going to meet someone from the das office at the airport mr bernhardt someone with the authority to discuss a plea bargain at half past twelve matt went on i dont know who or what authority he or she might have but if youd like if you give me your card ill pass it on and tell whoever it is youd like to speak with himher bernhardt produced a card gave it to matt thanked him profusely and left i wonder what that was all about olivia asked i really have no idea matt said are you about finished with your breakfast she stood up and walked away and waited by the headwaiters table until he had settled the bill if youll give me the keys to the car please ill put my luggage into it she said he wordlessly handed her the keys then went to his room packed and then settled the bill he made no attempt to rush when he got into the mustang she didnt speak jesus shes goodlooking is she going to stay pissed all day for good that seems a distinct possibility well if that bitchy irrational behavior last night was an indicator of the future maybe thats not such an allaround bad thing tis better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all as they say you dont believe that for a minute and you know it just keep your mouth shut and maybe shell cool off or warm up a familiar face came through the revolving doors into the personsmeetingpassengers area but it was not that of steven cohen esq but rather that of michael j ohara sherlock goddamn holmes in the flesh mickey greeted them and the beauty with the beast i wont ask what brings you to the redneck riviera mickey matt began what did you say the redneck riviera matt nodded thats what they call it great im going to do a long piece and thats great color but frankly matt went on i was expecting steve cohen or somebody else from the das office theyre in the cheap seats mickey said theyll be off in a minute he turned to olivia stanley said to tell you hes sorry as hell about theledger and that phil donaldson asshole and that hell try to make it up stanley stanley coleman aka thats very kind of mr colt but not necessary olivia said whos they mick as in theyll be off matt asked ohara turned and pointed steven cohen esq and lieutenant jason washington were about halfway down a long column of arriving economyclass passengers i didnt expect the boss matt said they dont want any mistakes made with this one for your sake matty i really hope this guy is the one youre looking for he is mick im sure how did you find out a little irish bird named denny told me welcome to the redneck riviera boss matt said hello mr cohen by calling me mister matt are you implying im not welcome in the what did you sayredneck riviera cohen replied putting out his hand i am really delighted to see you and yeah thats what its called theyve got a really spectacular seashore oldetective lassiter and i saw it when we drove over from pensacola cohen offered his hand to olivia matt says hes sure this is the doer mickey said i really hope so cohen said well let us go see this fellow washington said mick has reserved a car the chief of police will be available matt said perhapsafter we check into the hotel washington said micks made reservations for us at the marriott is that where you are no sir matt said looking smugly at olivia were in the eight dollar motel right in daphne detective lassiter thought the marriott was a little too rich for us actually its the nine dollar inn sergeant detective lassiter corrected him actually its the motel after you pay up front and they give you the aaa discount matt said but what the hell they collected their luggage and went to the hertz counter where a lincoln town car awaited mr michael j ohara i think the best way to handle this detective washington said would be for sergeant payne to drive us in mr oharas car en route he can fill us in on what we should know in the meantime you could go to the police station advise them of our arrival and tell them we are anxious to speak with the chief at his earliest convenience yes sir detective lassiter said matt handed her the keys to the mustang thank you she said with a somewhat brittle smile the mustang stayed on the tail of the lincoln all the way from the airport through mobile across the i bridge over mobile bay and into daphne where it turned off us at the joseph hall criminal justice center en route as washington intended he should matt told them everything he thought they should know he pointed out the gambino motor mall and told them he had spoken with the proprietor and that fats had shown him the peterbilt truck mr daniels had driven into mobile i called the chief and he said he just got a search warrant for the truck from a judge in mobile but he thought hed wait until i could go along before he had a look you didnt enter the vehicle washington asked no good cohen said he certainly had to fuel the truck somewhere washington said thoughtfully if he did so in philadelphia and used a credit card that would establish his presence there on his way down here as careful as we must presume he is he probably paid cash but he may not have had that much cash and he may have used a card its worth looking into yes sir matt said ive got to have a picture of that truck mickey said how do i find my way back here after we have accepted the chiefs kind invitation to witness his search of the vehicle i will arrange something with detective lassiter to get you back here washington said id like a picture of you two searching the truck mickey said sergeant payne and i have had quite enough personal publicity lately thank you just the same michael there is good publicity and bad publicity jason mickey said and you two could certainly use some of the good kind if youll pardon me michael what i am trying to do is develop a variety of good reasons that will suggest to mr daniels that denial of his participation is no longer one of his options that may be easier than you think jason you will remembersergeant to address me as lieutenant when we are about our official business yes sir oh beware beware mickey said what we have here is the black buddha in a bad mood cheap seats a little too small for you in the beam were theylieutenant cohen laughed washington ignored the remark why will i find it less difficult to reason with mr daniels visavis confessing all that youwith your vast experience in these mattersthink will be the case because he sent his lawyer to see me visavis copping a plea matt said try to behave steve were in the company of the only two cops in philadelphia who say things like visavis in normal conversation ohara said shut up mick i want to hear about this lawyer cohen said what did you say to him matt i told him i would give youwhoever mrs solomon sent down herehis card thats absolutely all thats absolutely all no suggestions anything that i would be interested in a plea bargain nothing and the only reason i said id pass on his card was because sergeant kenny told him where to find me and sergeant kenny is who local cop a good one been very helpful and when and where did this conversation take place cohen asked at breakfast if he ran matt down at the nine dollar no tell motel ohara said he must be really interested in copping a plea actually it was in the marriott we stayed there last night and got out before somebody arrived from philadelphia who would wonder what you were doing in the grand hotel and might talk the grand hotel washington asked marriotts grand hotel one of the stars in the galaxy of marriott resorts when i told stanley i was coming down here he said to stay there he said its great i have to ask matthew you havent behaved inappropriately with detective lassiter down here have you washington said two rooms she slept in her bed i slept in mine thats the truth admittedly not all of it but the truth but you do have something going with her right mickey asked go to hell mick answer mr oharas question please washington said i thought for a while there might be something but if there was there aint no more while i confess i find this discussion of matts sex life absolutely enthralling cohen said can we get back to this guys lawyer you said youve got his card matt matt found it and handed it to cohen in the backseat do philadelphia cell phones work down here he asked mine does matt said and handed cohen his cellular telephone four when matt saw sergeant kenny standing beside a thirtyish man in a business suit in the tilewalled outer room of the daphne police department he was surprised to see how they resembled each other i got to get a picture of that guy with you jason ohara said sergeant payne kenny said this gentleman would like a word with you and the other people from philadelphia the man with kenny smiled stuck out his hand and marched up to matt sergeant im special agent bendick of the federal bureau he said federal bureau of what matts mouth on automatic asked innocently investigation of course thefbi how can i help the fbi matt asked its how the fbi can help you sergeant special agent bendick said a telephone call would have saved you a trip all the way down here but no real harm done well handle it from here jesus christ mickey ohara said you guys really have no shame at all do you i beg your pardon you heard me j edgar junior anything to get the fbi favorable notice in the papers right you can already see the headline right fbi apprehends philadelphia murderer who are you sir special agent bendick asked oharas my name and are you some sort of law enforcement officer mickey shook his head no i couldnt get on the cops my parents were married mickey said he took out his digital camera and aimed it at special agent bendick sergeant payne and lieutenant washington id rather not have my photograph taken if you dont mind special agent bendick said holding his hand out in a vain hopemickey nimbly dodged around itof covering the lens so that a photograph would be impossible jesus didnt they tell you about the freedom of the press at the quantico school for boys mickey asked sir washington said if we feel that any assistance from the fbi would be useful to us in this investigation i will seek same through the appropriate channels and you are special agent bendick demanded my name is jason washington im a lieutenant with the homicide unit of the philadelphia police department im special agent bendick of the mobile office of the fbi lieutenant so you said and inasmuch as this case crosses state lines the fbi i dont believe this case meets the necessary criteria for the unsolicited involvement of the fbi mr bendick steve cohen said and may i ask who you are my name is steven cohen im an assistant district attorney in philadelphia i dont really understand your attitude special agent bendick began theyre understandably a little pissed j edgar junior that you tried to steal their pinch for the glory of the fbi unfortunately you picked the wrong guys mickey said he quickly snapped another photograph if you will excuse us mr bendick washington said we have an appointment with the chief right this way lieutenant sergeant kenny said waving them toward one of the steel doors mr ohara washington said this is official police business to which unfortunately i cannot make you privy at this time perhaps youd like to stay here and continue your conversation with mr bendick sergeant kenny waited until cohen and matt had gone through the steel door then followed them through it special agent bendick looked at the closed door then at mickey ohara who was again raising his camera and then mustering what dignity he could marched out of the building i have a confession to make washington said i was not overjoyed when commissioner coughlin told me mickey was coming with us but now he was magnificent cohen said what did mickey call him j edgar jr matt asked laughing i dont think weve heard the last of him cohen said fuck him washington said coldly matt was surprised washington very rarely used vulgar language washington turned to sergeant kenny and offered his hand my name is washington sergeant he said how are you kenny said payne said you were about as big as me and this is mr cohen an assistant district attorney they shook hands detective lassiter was supposed to tell you we would be here as soon as we got ourselves settled shes in with the chief come on ill take you in thank you you got any kin down this way lieutenant kenny asked not so far as i know but a first glance at the genetic evidence does seem to make that a distinct possibility doesnt it five mr walter davis a tall wellbuilt welldressedin a gray pinstriped threepiece suitman in his middle forties who was the special agent in charge the sac of the philadelphia office of the federal bureau of investigation sensed his secretarys presence at his office door and raised his eyes to her from the documents on his desk yes helen he asked a slight tone of impatience in his voice he had asked not to be disturbed if at all possible i know i know but its burton white the sac in mobile put him through thank you helen walter davis had known burton white since they had been at the fbi academy in quantico virginia and they had crossed paths often since they had risen through the ranks together not quite as high together as philadelphia was a more important post than mobile it is always pleasant davis thought as he waited for the light on his telephone to illuminate to touch base with a peer who has not risen quite as far as oneself the light came on and davis grabbed the phone burton you old sonofabitch how are you buddy hows things down there in the sunny south its raining and this is the heart of dixie walt it says so on our license plates well its good to hear your voice buddy what can philadelphia do for our outpost in the heart of dixie im having a little problem with the local copsyour local cops i thought you might be able to help methe bureau out on this do whatever i can you know that my local cops what are they doing way down there you had a murder up there we have a lot of murders up here this one was of a young woman raped and murdered in her apartment it was on the ncic looking for a similar modus operandi that one made the front pages it seems like the cops were actually on the scene but couldnt take the door because there was no sign of forced entry they took a beating for a while in the press well one of my agents heard about the case and then there was a similarmodus operandi in a little village across the bay from here and he went to check it out and it was the man the locals here are looking for good for you walt a little favorable publicity never hurts the bureau does it youre sure youve got the right man when he got over there your locals were already there you dont say thats odd i had lunch with the commissionercommissioner ralph j marianiyesterday and he didnt say anything to me the sonofabitch theres no way philadelphia cops would go all the way to alabama without mariani knowing all about it and he didnt say a goddamn word there were philadelphia homicide cops there plus an assistant da well your man took over didnt he burton he ran into a stone wall walt i was hoping you could speak to somebody up there you didnt get any names by chance there was a lieutenant washington a sergeant payne and a female detectivei dont have a name on heran assistant da named cohen and some wiseass of a reporter named ohara who accused my agent of shamelessly trying to steal the arrest do you think you could say a word in the appropriate ear up there of course i could and then mariani would shove it down my throat with great joy no i dont think i could burton no just like that no let me tell you about the locals youre dealing with burton davis said starting with the sergeant you remember a couple of months ago when one of my people had to put down a terrorist the guy with the machine gun a real ok corral shootout thats the case well he had with him a local cop who it has been reliably reported to me said some of my best friends are fbi agents but i wouldnt want my sister to marry one a real wiseass eh whose father is a senior partner in what is probably our most important law firm thats the sergeant the lieutenant is probably jason washington is he a great big black fellow thats the man my agent says hes enormous who is married to a lady who moves in the same exalted arty circles as our mayor and incidentally is the best homicide investigator ive ever known i see mr cohen is one of our twohundredodd assistant district attorneys he specializes in the prosecution of homicides he is generally held in high esteemon a scale ranging upward from one to two hundred he would be mighty close to two hundred in other wordsby those who know him including me well they didnt behave with anything like professional courtesy no matter who they are they stood right there while this belligerent reporter and that would be mr michael j ohara burton the pulitzer prizewinning reporter of thephiladelphia bulletin davis interrupted whom i have been assiduously attempting to cultivate since they made me the sac here without conspicuous success i can only hope your agent didnt antagonize him there was silence on the line for a long moment before davis continued so for the reasons mentioned burton no i cannot say a word in the appropriate ear here my advice for what its worth is to stay awayfar awayfrom these people unless they ask for your assistance in which case i suggest you be the spirit of cooperation six chief yancey jason washington said i would be very grateful if there were someplace private where i could confer with mr cohen and sergeant payne for a few minutes before we talk to mr daniels youre welcome to use this the chief said you are very kind sir washington said and waited for the others to leave whats this jason cohen asked the moment the door closed with the caveat that what i suggest would have to have your approvalnot implied approval and certainly not grudging approvali am going to suggest a scenario for the initial interview shoot sergeant kenny will handcuff and shackle mr daniels in his cell and bring him here i suppose inasmuch as they do not have an interview room as such would be as good a place as any and i think the chief would make it available to usand handcuff him to a heavy and it is to be hoped uncomfortable chair if such can be located here for ten minutes he will waitwith sergeant kenny standing out of his sight behind his chairwhile absolutely nothing happens it will i think in his frame of mind seem like much longer it is possible that he will feel the call of nature and i hope this indeed happens because it will give sergeant kenny the opportunity to lead himafter he takes say five minutes getting permission to do so while another silent officer stands behind the chairback to his cell and then back here all the time in handcuffs and shackles the tenminute time clock will start again if this happens on his return here i think his only experience with being either handcuffed or shackled was when he was first detained by the concerned citizens there is a feeling of both helplessness and humiliation when one is shackled and handcuffed you dont want to go too far with that jason cohen said handcuffs and shackles are a normal security precaution nothing will take place that could possibly be construed as a threat of physical violence his attorney will next appear mr daniels will almost certainly ask him whats going on to which mr bernhardt will give the only reply he knows that they are waiting for the policei hope the word homicide is usedand another ten minutes will pass then sergeant payne will enter the room and prepare to begin the first interview sergeant payne cohen asked incredulously and where am i pray indulge me i will be grateful for any objections or suggestions you might have but let me finish please first go ahead payne will unlimber a recording device not hurrying at all one with two microphones would be good and if we can find one with four that would be even better a little theater jason washington nodded when the recording device is set up matt will respectfully summon you from the corridor when you come in matt will say mr daniels this is mr cohen an assistant district attorney for philadelphia who specializes in prosecution of those charged with murder and then he will turn on the tape recorder and go through the routine there this interview of mr homer c daniels in connection with the murder of cheryl williamson et cetera you both know the routine both nodded and then matt will say mr daniels i understand that you have been advised of your rights as established by the united states supreme court commonly called the miranda decision but just to make sure that you are fully aware of your constitutional rights in this situation im going to go over them again with you in the presence of your attorney and remirandaize him cohen said he was now smiling washington nodded and then matt will say something to this effect mr daniels im sergeant matthew payne badge number of the homicide unit of the philadelphia wont he have already said that cohen interrupted possibly but redundancy is sometimes useful washington said and went on and what i am going to do now is tell you why we believe beyond any reasonable doubt that in taking the life of miss cheryl williamson you are in violation of paragraph b of the criminal code of pennsylvania that in other words you are guilty of murder of the second degree at this point i really hope mr daniels will think he sees a slight glimmer of hope second degree that cant be as bad as first maybe im not going to be executed after all i think i see where youre going jason cohen said at this point steve you will disabuse him of this hope by interrupting matt and handing mr bernhardt a xerox of page thirtyfour of the crime codes and saying one lawyer to another i didnt know if this was readily available to you counselor you might want to look it over and when he has had a moment to do so you will add collegially youll see that the only difference between murder of the first degree and of the second is that the first is premeditated and second while the accused was engaged in the perpetration of a felony a little farther down the page youll see thatperpetration of a felony is defined as engaging in or being an accomplice in the commission of cohen picked up quoting from memory or an attempt to commit or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery rape or deviate sexual intercourse by force or threat of force arson burglary or kidnapping so by now he understands hes really in trouble matt said which understanding you will then buttress washington said by proceeding something like this mr daniels im not going to be asking you right now many questions because frankly i dont have to what im going to do is run through what we know right now and then give you the opportunity to confer with your attorney and after that you and he and mr cohen can confer if you like and then i go down what we do have matt said starting with what i would suggest the camera we have the camera you left at the scene mr daniels and the images it contained we know that you bought the camera at times square photo and electronics on do you have the date its in here matt said indicating his laptop washington nodded and we have your signature on the sales slip among the images in the camera are those of the knife you used and which the police took away from you here one of the images shows sperm on the blade of the knife we think its reasonable to believe its yours and that we can convince a judge there is sufficient cause for him to issue a search warrant which will give us a sample of your tissue so that a dna comparison can be made i get the picture matt said overconfidence is dangerous as ive tried to point out to you before washington said that is especially true of someone like you who has an abundance of confidence in himself that is not entirely justified matt looked at him but didnt say anything does this scenario have any appeal at all to you counselor washington said it might even work jason cohen said i will accept that as meaning it has your full approval washington said but it was more a question than a statement cohen thought this over for a moment then nodded matt you go someplace quietmickeys car perhaps with your laptop and refresh your memory about the details your performance will be more effective if you can readily recite from memory for example the date he bought the camera yes sir i dont have to tell you do i not to have your laptop with you i dont want it subpoenaed no sir refreshing your memory should take no more than ten minutes and during that time i will set the stage in here and give sergeant kenny an understanding of his roleand how important it isin our theatrical production yes sir matt said cohen waited until he was gone and the door had closed behind him jason you and i have marched down this path together for a long time he said and you know ill go to the wire and beyond for you but will you tell me why youre sending matt to do this hes a nice kid and i really like him but primarily steve for the educational aspects of it this is his first homicide job and if he blows it i dont think he will hes smart he can think on his feet et cetera but if he does then we will bothmatt and i i meanknow he doesnt belong in homicide wont we then its sink or swim time right i shall have to make note of that phrase washington said it is so profound what about daniels if matt blows it then psychologically guided interrogation having proven ineffective i fear i shall be forced to revert to the rubber hose system cohen chuckled thats really not so funny washington said i really would like to work that walking obscenity over with a rubber hose nineteen one when sergeant kenny led homer c daniels from what the daphne police department called the detention area into the administrative area and toward the chiefs office daniels was even more firmly cuffed and shackled than jason washington thought he would be the chief of police had gone into his supply room and come out with a white canvas bag labeled prisoner restraint system it held three belts made of thick saddle leather and heavy canvas a yshaped chain and some other accessories the system looked as if it was rarely used if it ever had been washington could now see how it worked when installed the waist belt buckled in the back on the front connected to it with heavy chains were handcuffs daniels could move his cuffed wrists no more than a few inches danielss ankles had smaller versions of the waist belt around them a short length of chain connected the two ankle restraints together so that he had to walk with small steps another chain ran up his back split into two then went over his shoulders and connected with the waist belt his ability to bend was severely restricted washington wondered how he was going to sit down in the restraint when sergeant kenny led his shuffling prisoner through the door of the chiefs office washington said time and punched one of the buttons on his tag heuer chronograph i never saw anyone actually push the buttons on one of those fancy watches before steve cohen said in mock wonderment washington held his wrist up so that cohen could see the dial it is also extremely useful when preparing softboiled eggs steve one neednt make wild guesses about whether three and a half minutes have passed or not im impressed and well you should be three minutes and forty seconds later sergeant kenny came through the door a very large daphne police officer went in and then kenny walked to his office he wants to take a leak kenny said time washington said punched several buttons on his watch and then said splendid precisely five minutes later washington said sergeant kenny will you please escort mr daniels back to his cell so that he may relieve the pressure on his bladder the more i think about how that guy gets his kicks the more id rather have him piss his pants kenny said that while a very interesting thought would almost certainly as mr cohen would quickly tell us violate mr danielss civil rights washington said let him have his leak kenny cohen said it took seven minutes and twenty seconds for mr daniels to be shuffled back and forth to his cell time washington called as daniels shuffled through the door into the chiefs office not quite ten minutes later washington said matt go tell the chief that if mr bernhardt wishes to consult with his client yes sir matt said and left kennys office jason what does your screenplay have to say about daniels wanting to talk privately with his lawyer i dont think he will washington replied but if he does it can only accrue to our advantage i dont think hes seen him since the chief got the search warrants he would tell him that im sure roswell bernhardt esq came into the room the large daphne police officer standing outside the chiefs office opened the door for him and he went inside time washington said and pushed buttons on his watch matt appeared a minute or so later you are prepared i presume sergeant payne youre on in eight minutes and fifteen seconds yes sir eight minutes later washington said good luck matt matt carrying a tape recorder and two microphones walked across the room waited for the daphne uniform to open the door then walked into the chiefs office and four minutes after that came out again youre on steve washington said yeah but im not going to get canned if i give a lousy performance cohen said and walked across the room five minutes after that chief of police charles yancey came into sergeant kennys office am i going to be in the way here of course not washington said and it gives me the opportunity to tell you again how appreciative we all are for all your assistance this isnt my first murder yancey said but ive never been around a sleazeball murdering pervert like this before or seen bigcity cops at work we work exactly the same way as you do the hell you do kenny told me what you didare doing is it going to work sometimes it does and sometimes it doesnt it largely depends on the interrogator and that young sergeant is that good we are about to determine that washington said kenny told me about the runin you had with the fbi does that happen all the time i dont know aboutall the time but it happens far too frequently im afraid they seem to be very concerned with their image they alwaysbetween you and me a couple of cops seem to look down their noses at us odd washington said i seem to have heard that before somewhere yancey smiled at him you want to go get a cup of coffee while youre waiting youre very kind but id rather stay here hell ill get it yancey said he hadnt made it out of the administrative area when the door to his office opened and matt paynecarrying the tape recorder and microphonesand steve cohen came out cohen walked to washington mr daniels asked to confer with counsel privately he said how did it go steve matt did a hell of a good job and im not saying that for any reason but giving credit where due i expected nothing less washington said what are they going to talk about would you think probably my refusal to offer more of a deal than life without the possibility of parole you didnt tell me about that you didnt ask cohen said the boss wants this guy off the streets permanently i told her i had the feeling that there are unsolved rapes maybe even murderrapes all over the country that are going to surface now that weve caught this guy detective lassiter spent fruitless hours on the telephone calling bigcity departments i dont think she would have gotten around to daphne anytime soon i grant your point well anyway eileen said we couldnt count on that and she decided we have enough to go with here with no deal except life without parole eileens tough washington said admiringly personally id like to see the sonofabitch strapped to the gurney cohen said but thats emotional the interests of the people are best served by ensuring that hes behind bars permanently rather than taking a chance that hell walk or get out in ten years isaac fort festung washington said he was sentenced to life and hes walking around france eating grapes yeah any developments there the goddamn french are still dragging their heels i think it has more to do with giving us the finger than anything else anyone but eileen would have probably given up washington said shes as tenacious as she is tough he smiled whats funny cohen asked i just remembered appealing to a higher jurisdiction washington said cohen laughed when the hon eileen mcnamara solomon had been on the bench a justconvicted felon facing a long prison term had jumped up from his seat in her courtroom run to a window crashed through it and jumped to his death in the interior courtyard of city hall when asked by the press how she felt about this lamentable incident judge solomon had replied i can only presume he was appealing to a higher jurisdiction matt came into kennys office i forgot one thing before i went in there he said the minute i opened my mouth my back teeth began to float cohen laughed that happens to me he said usually ten minutes into a thirtyminute concluding statement your bladder problem aside matthew washington said how would you assess your chat with mr daniels i dont know matt said you dont know washington asked incredulously i think he knows we have him matt said but what his reaction to that will be i have no idea he may decide to take his chances what has he got to lose washington grunted noncommittally three minutes later roswell bernhardt esq came out of the chiefs office and said that in exchange for a written guarantee that the city of philadelphia would not seek the death penalty his client was prepared to make a full statement cooperate fully with the investigation and waive extradition two at fivethirtyfive mr walter davis walked up the marble steps of the rittenhouse club and entered the building through its revolving door he stopped long enough to check the members board and to see that the brass nameplate reading mariani r had been slid to the left so that it was now under the in heading he found commissioner mariani in the paneled bar with first deputy commissioner coughlin which didnt surprise him but with them at one of the round tables was brewster cortland payne ii esq which did mariani waved davis over the men shook hands davis sat down a waiter appeared and davis ordered a scotch rocks the others held up their hands in a silent gesture meaning they didnt need another one just now thank you davis wondered how long they had been here he sensed that the drinks on the table were not the first round were having a little celebration walter mariani said im glad you were free to join us i didnt give you much notice its always a pleasure you know that what are we celebrating as if i didnt know mr homer c daniels has agreed to waive extradition and he is as if you dont know you dont know im not sure davis said hes the man who tied the williamson girl to her bed with plastic ties committed obscenities on her body and then killed her and youve got him the daphne alabama police have him he was apprehended by one of those civilian neighborhood watch outfits apparently in the act of trying to break into some other young womans apartment hes a dealer in fancy cars from las vegas i wouldnt be at all surprised walter coughlin said if hes been doing this sort of thing all over the country a civilian neighborhood watch outfit if this wasnt so serious that would be almost funny youre sure hes the doer ralph were sure we sent sergeant payne down there to check him out payne said everything fit but just to make sure i sent jason washington down there and eileen solomon sent steve cohen not only does everything fit but he gave payne a statement and as i said has agreed to waive extradition washington and cohen are in alabama davis asked i thought you would have heard ralph mariani said innocently washington said the fbi had been there to offer their assistance davis shook his head no but whatever assistance we can provide ralph he said all you have to do is ask thanks walter mariani said we appreciate that he smiled at davis and went on so whatim celebrating is that an hour ago eileen solomon called to tell me that she had just spoken with the attorney general of alabama who told herin case daniels changes his mind about waiving extraditionthat the governor of alabama would authorize his extradition just as soon as we place the request before him and just a few minutes ago the homicide detective joe damata i think you know him yes indeed called denny from the airport to say he and the others including several lab people are indeed going to be aboard the fivefifty flight to alabama joes carrying the requestforextradition packet with him in case its needed you apparently have this pretty well sewed up davis said it looks that way walter and what denny and brewster are celebrating is young paynes faultless performance starting with his finding this fellow down there on his first time out as a homicide supervisor mr daviss scotch rocks was served he raised his glass to brewster cortland payne ii to sergeant payne he said and at the risk of making denny angry brewster you know how much i would like to have your son working for the bureau and the offer is still open so is mawson payne stockton mcadoo and lesters walter but the police department seems to have him firmly in its clutches three before steve and matt get into the wine and become incoherent washington said i think an analysis of where we are and where we have to go would be in order mr cohen gave lieutenant washington the finger they were sitting in upholstered chairs around two tables pushed together in the bird cage lounge at the grand hotel perhaps understandably they were the object of some curiosity on the part of other guests there were two enormous black men who looked like brothers one of them in police uniform there was a second uniformed police officer a small man there was an attractive young woman in the otherwise allmale ensemble but she seemed to be sitting as far away as was possible in the circumstances from the only young man in the group and finally there was a dignified man in a doublebreasted gray suit and finely figured necktie sitting beside a man with wildly unruly red hair who was wearing an opencollared yellow polo shirt and a yellowandred plaid jacket where do we stand legally steve washington asked joe damatas in the air right now cohen said hes got the warrant for danielss arrest and the requestforextradition packet in case daniels changes his mind about waiving extradition and if he does washington interrupted eileen has talked to the alabama attorney general cohen replied he told her the governor will sign the extradition order as soon as he gets it if we have to go that route ill have to go to montgomery which raises the question how do i get there mr cohen chief yancey said if you have to go we can get you there in probably a little less than three hours its a straight shot up i the troopers would be happy to carry you the state troopers yancey nodded we do it all the time we call it a handoff a car would pick you up here then go as far as he usually patrols up i another trooper car would meet you there and maybe another one before you got to montgomery but theyll get you there and be happy to do it well that would really solve that problem cohen said but lets hope it doesnt prove necessary kenny the chief asked ill set it up in case we need it sergeant kenny said okay that settles that cohen said now where was i okay with joe on the airplane are two lab technicians we dont know who yet and two detectives ditto theyre going to change planes in atlanta fly to pensacola pick up a rental car probably two rental cars and then drive here to the worldfamous notell motel where matt and olivia are staying i had a call from peter wohl steve washington said we know who the detectives are mutt and jeff really matt asked what are they going to do when they get here and what about stan colt all i know is inspector wohl said thats who hes sending and what theyre going to do is sit on danielss truck as long as its here and when we locate a truck or trucks large enough to haul danielss truckwith contentsback to philadelphia theyre going to ride back with it when are you going to search the truck chief yancey asked where we are legally with that chief cohen said is that matt has statements from fats gambino and you fatss stating that he saw daniels lock the truck and trailer in his locked and guarded lot and the truck has been there under guard since then yours states that the keys in your possession believed to be those to the truck and trailer were taken from daniels at the time of his arrest and have never left police possession since that time tomorrow the lab technicians will make an examination to see if anyone has forced any locks and be prepared to testify they saw no evidence of such i dont know for sure but what they will do then is probably see what prints and whatever they can get from the exterior of the truckstuff that might get lost between here and philadelphiaand then conduct a cursory search of the interiors of the truck and tractor if they dont find a bodywhich is not entirely out of the question hereor something else spectacular they will seal both tractor and trailer as well as they can and supervise the loading of it onto whatever we finally get to haul it back to philadelphia that seems like a hell of a lot of work yancey said taking everything to philadelphia it is cohen agreed my boss is concernedand so am iabout preserving the chain of evidence weve got three jurisdictions here philadelphia daphnebaldwin county and because the truck is in mobile alabamamobile county but i think its under control legally the search will be executed by the mobile police using the search warrant the mobile county judge issued matt and iand to cover all the bases mutt and jeff toowill be there and if you can send somebody i think sergeant kenny and i can find time to be there yancey interjected then any of us or all of us can testify under oath that philadelphia police and daphne police witnessed the search and had control of the evidencefrom the time the mobile police exercised their search warrantand put danielss keys in the locks kenny and i will be there yancey repeated and then asked how are you going to get him to philadelphia thats yet to be determined washington said i have given sergeant payne a list of other people from whom he and detective damata should take statements which should keep them gainfully occupied for the next day or two detective lassiter and i have reservations for a flight leaving mobile at onefifteen tomorrow afternoon that may or may not provide time for me to speak with detective damata im going back tomorrow olivia asked at onefifteen washington said she was obviously surprised at the announcement so was matt but when he looked at her there was no mistaking what the coldly furious glint in her eyes meant she thinks i knew all about it hell she thinks i asked washington to send her home but inasmuch as mr cohen and detective damata will have three hours together in a car coming back here i dont see that as a problem do you sergeant payne no sir in that case our business having been completed you may summon a waiter and you and steve can begin to drink yourselves into oblivion if thats all sir may i be excused olivia asked olivia i hope you understand that was an attempt at humor were going to have a very few drinks and then dinner i have a headache sir im sorry is there anything i can do no thank you i just dont feel i understand washington said as ever the gentleman he rose to his feet im sure youll feel better by morning would you like me to take you to the motel olivia matt asked ill get a cab thank you just the same i dont know if they have cabs matt said and really hope they dont we have the next best thing chief yancey said kenny kenny spoke to the microphone pinned to his shirt barbaraanne send whichever car is closest to the grand hotel to give detective lassiter a ride to her motel shell be outside the front door thank you very much detective lassiter said they watched her walk out of the bird cage lounge didnt want to ride with you huh mickey ohara asked is that what they call a lovers quarrel go to hell mickey matt snapped what is bothering her matt washington asked something obviously is i think she thinks i arranged for her to be sent back matt said i can quickly straighten that out if youd like she wants to stay in homicide matt said is there any chance she can shes a pretty good cop your loyalty is commendable is that what it is loyalty mickey said mickey washington said coldly angry sometimes as now you dont know when to stop he turned to matt as for her staying in homicide that im afraid is selfevidently out of the question and you should know it is matt couldnt think of a reply and i just thought of something else washington said when i spoke with commissioner coughlin he suggested that your father might like you to call and i had the feeling that the commissioner would not consider a call from you to be an unwelcome intrusion on his time well i guess id better do that right now matt said before i become incoherent he got up from the table and went through a plateglass door to an area between the hotel building and the bay they could see him taking out his cellular i think what we have here is raging testosterone cohen said and im not making fun of him for that reason i was deaf to his insolence washington said he looked between chief yancey and sergeant kenny i think a word of explanation is in order sergeant payne is carrying his fathers badge shortly before matt was born his father was killed on duty answering a silent alarm deputy commissioner coughlin was his fathers best friend he is matts godfather being a cops in his blood huh sergeant kenny said prefacing this by saying i amperhaps too obviously fond of our young sergeant i sometimes wonder if hes not flying a little too high for his experience he did a good job with daniels jason steve cohen said absolutely professional and now he knows it thats my point steve our matty is not burdened with overmodesty and hes going to be money in the bank on the stand cohen pursued if were taking a poll id say matt is a hell of a good cop i associate myself with the shyster ohara said now can we get something to drink for christs sake four the nesbitt residence the nesbitt butler answered the call brewster payne porter is mr nesbitt available im sure he will be at home for you mr payne one moment please several moments later chadwick thomas nesbitt iii chairman of the executive committee of nesfoods international inc who had been practicing with a new putter on the practice green behind the left wing of his home came on the line if you werent my lawyer id be happy to hear from you whats the bad news you really hate to have to tell me this time irs or something else actually tom this does have a certain irs connection oh god now what your assets have been seized and you may have to go to prison i dont think thats funny i had drinks with denny coughlin at the rittenhouse just before i started home jesus i didnt even say the appropriate things about matty did i it was all over the tv you must be proud as hell of him hell we all are i am i just spoke to him he confirmed what denny coughlin told me theres no doubt this is the fellow who killed the williamson girl and now what happens to him he pleads he had an unhappy childhood and they award him damages i dont think thats going to happen as a matter of fact the only thing denny seemed worried about is how to get him back to philadelphia hes going to fight extradition do we have diplomatic relations with alabama the problem is one of transportation tom bringing him back on the airlines poses a number of problems as you can well imagine the press for one the restrictions on even policemen carrying firearms on airplanes for another cut to the chase brewster your pal denny coughlin would like to use nesfoodss citation to bring this character back here right and suggested you call me no he did not i really dont think using your airplane has ever entered his mind this is your idea which i had moments ago just before i called after drink number what four possibly five youre my legal counsel counsel me why should i well for one thing all expenses would be fully deductible as you have so often pointed out to me you have to spend money before you can claim it was spent for business purposes and is thus deductible from income you know how much it costs to operate that airplane it would have undeniable good public relations aspects tom and your pal denny had nothing to do with this idea of yours right i told you he didnt tom payne said there was a chill in his tone so you did and im still listening my thought is that there would be benefits to both parties if you were to telephone alvin martin and say it has come to your attentionyou may use my name if you likethat the police are having a problem transporting this fellow back here and that nesfoods international as concerned good corporate citizens of our fair community and you just happen to have the mayors unlisted number right no but i have one he gave me in case i ever wanted to get in touch with him day or night lets have it five homer c daniels looked up as the door to his cell slid open a moment later the enormous black sergeant and the nearlyas big white cop who followed him around appeared at the entrance carrying the prisoner restraint system you want to stand up please kenny ordered is all of this necessary daniels asked im cooperating im not going to try to get away its procedure sergeant kenny said gesturing with his finger for him to turn around if i had my way you white trash pervert youd spend the rest of your life in this thing if you have to go to the john do it now kenny ordered you wont have another chance for a while where am i going you agreed to waive extradition to philadelphia right daniels nodded thats where youre going daniels relieved his bladder sergeant kenny and officer andrew terry put the belts on daniels then each put a hand on his arms and led him shuffling out of the detention area down a corridor and through another door they were now outside there was a line of police patrol cars two with daphne police department insignia on their doors two with state trooper lettered largely on their trunks and two black sedansa ford and a mercurywith several antennae on their trunks and roofs but without police insignia there were also incongruously both a red ford mustang convertible and a lincoln town car in the line of cars a flash went off and daniels saw that a redheaded man in a loud sports coat had taken his picture with a digital camera the rear door of the daphne police department car nearest to the door was open and sergeant kenny led him to it taking care that he didnt bump his head and then got in beside him pulled the seat belt over danielss lap and then closed the door the big white cop got behind the wheel when he looked out the window daniels saw the young homicide sergeant from philadelphia the homicide detective whod shown up a couple of days before the assistant district attorney and four other men in civilian clothing who could have been detectives or lawyers as he watched they distributed themselves among the other cars there was another flash and daniels saw that the redheaded man had taken his picture again sergeant kenny spoke to the microphone pinned to his shirt were ready here where are we going daniels asked you have to sign the waiver before a judge kenny said the line of cars began to move in a sweeping circle through the parking lot daniels saw that the lights on the roof of the state trooper car leading the procession were flashing red and blue but only on that car they came out of the joseph hall criminal justice center onto a fourlane highway two more daphne police cars blocked traffic in both directions to permit the convoy to enter the highway the convoy turned left and moved at just under the speed limit out of daphne and toward fairhope several times cars ahead of the convoy spotted the warning lights and thinking it was a funeral procession respectfully pulled left and slowedor stoppedand looked in vain for the hearse and flower car in fairhope at a shopping mall the convoy turned left off us highway and then a halfmile down a twolane macadam road turned left again into a complex of onestory brick buildings daniels saw a sign baldwin county satellite courthouse the car with daniels in it stopped about halfway down the building as kenny got out of the backseat bright lights came on and when daniels got out he saw that he was being videotaped by cameras bearing the logotypes of three different television stations with kenny holding one arm and a state trooper the other daniels shuffled into the building and was led to a small courtroom the courtroom to judge by the signs on the walls was often used as the place where drivers license tests were administered roswell bernhardt esq was sitting at one of two tables facing the judges bench he stood up gave his hand to daniels and then watched as kenny removed the prisoner restraint system and then motioned for him to sit beside bernhardt the philadelphia assistant district attorney and another man who looked like a lawyer sat down at the other table facing the judges bench laid briefcases on it and then checked their contents the young homicide sergeant and others took seats in the first couple of rows of benches a large man in a twotone brown policetype uniformhe had both a badge and a largecaliber revolverlooked into the room pulled his head back and then a moment later stepped inside all rise he ordered everybody stood up a pleasantlooking man wearing a judges robewho looked as if he was no stranger to heavily laden tables entered the room and sat down in a highbacked leather chair the circuit court of baldwin county is now in session the honorable reade w james presiding the man in the brown uniform intoned good morning judge james said please be seated everybody sat down the court recognizes the presence of the attorney general of alabama judge james said and why are we so honored the man sitting beside steve cohen stood up good morning your honor if it pleases the court may i introduce mr steven cohen who is an assistant district attorney of philadelphia commonwealth of pennsylvania good morning mr cohen welcome to

involuntary deviate sexual intercourse robbery theft receiving stolen property aggravated assault simple assault recklessly endangering another person burglary criminal trespass possession of instrument of a crime and abuse of a corpse mr bernhardt judge james said may the court presume that the man beside you is mr homer c daniels and that you are serving as his counsel bernhardt stood up yes your honor mr daniels judge james said and interrupted himself to say would you please rise sir homer c daniels stood up have you any problems with mr bernhardt serving as your counsel no sir are you aware of the nature and specifics of all the charges being brought against you in pennsylvania yes sir and has mr bernhardt explained that should you desire you have the right in the law to ask

will then return you to pennsylvania there to face whatever charges have been laid against you yes sir this court is satisfied that mr daniels is aware of his rights in this matter and is voluntarily waiving same judge james said and made a gesture which steve cohen correctly interpreted to mean that he could now place the appropriate documents before mr daniels he walked to danielss table laid a bound legal folder before daniels and handed him his pen daniels quickly scrawled his signature on them may i approach the bench your honor cohen asked judge james waved him to the bench cohen handed

matthew payne of the homicide unit of the philadelphia police departmentand other philadelphia police officersare present in this court and prepared to take custody of mr daniels within the time prescribed then that would seem to conclude this matter judge james said and stood up all rise the man in the twotone brown uniform ordered everyone stood up judge james left the courtroom sergeant kenny began to place daniels in the prisoner restraint system when he was finished kenny and the state trooper led him shuffling back through the satellite courthouse and put him back in the rear seat of the daphne police car then the convoy left the satellite courthouse complex went back to us highway and turned left onto it three miles farther along it turned left onto a twolane macadam road and half a mile down that turned into the fairhope municipal airport there the convoy drove onto the parking tarmac and up to a cessna citation there was an almost identical citation on the ramp and half a dozen other business aircraft mickey ohara jumped out of the lincoln and ran up the line of cars to be in place when daniels was taken from the daphne police car he was there in plenty of time to see the little ceremony the attorney general of alabama got out of one black mercury and walked toward the daphne car holding daniels the driver and the state troopers moved quickly to stand behind him steve cohen walked up to the car he had ridden with ohara in the lincoln matt payne and joe damata took up positions behind him chief yancey several of his officers and detectives martinez and mcfadden stood to one side at a nod from the man in civilian clothing one of the state troopers opened the door of the police car and helped first sergeant kenny and then mr daniels out mr daniels the man said im baxley williams attorney general of the state of alabama and this is sergeant matthew payne a philadelphia pennsylvania police officer who has a warrant for your arrest daniels did not reply williams turned to matt you may now take custody of the prisoner matt put his hand on danielss arm sergeant kenny took his hand off cohen signaled damata with a finger damata took handcuffs from his belt went to daniels and put them on him sergeant kenny you want to help me with this damata asked kenny began to remove the prisoner restraint system when he had finished damata said come with me please and led daniels toward the cessna citation matt walked quickly to the airplane got there first and went inside when daniels came into the cabin matt showed him where he was to sit the rearmost seat usually occupied by the steward then he took handcuffs from his belt added one cuff to danielss left wrist and snapped the other around the aluminum pipe work of the seat damata watched steve cohen came aboard followed by mickey ohara lets go he said matt walked forward and knocked on the cockpit door a man in a blue shirt with first officer shoulder boards opened it ohara took his picture any time matt said the copilot walked through the cabin and operated the doorclosing mechanism ohara took his picture before the copilot could get back to the cockpit there was the whine of an engine starting joe damata went to homer daniels mickey ohara took their picture the law says you cannot be restrained during takeoff flight or landing damata said the law also says i have the authority to use what force is necessary to ensure that you remain in custody what im going to do now is take those cuffs off you what youre going to do is fasten the seat belt if you even look like youre thinking of getting out of that seat im going to shoot you do we understand each other daniels nodded damata took the cuffs off the citation started to move from where he was sitting matt could see everybody waiting for them to take off he didnt think they could see him through the darkened windows of the citation but he waved anyway the citation taxied down the runway turned around and immediately began the takeoff roll matt could see that at least half the law enforcement officers on the tarmac were waving goodbye at them when he stopped looking out the window mickey ohara took his picture six there werent quite as many people or representatives of the fourth estate on hand to meet the citation at the northeast philadelphia airport as there had been when stan colts citation had arrived but almost the hon alvin w martin was there sitting with a group of prominent officials and citizens at tables in the flatspin restaurant whose windows provided a view of aircraft using the main runway these included police commissioner ralph mariani who was there primarily because he heard over police radio that the mayor was headed for the airportand first deputy commissioner dennis v coughlinwho was there because he wanted to be sitting with them was mr chadwick thomas nesbitt iii chairman of the executive committee of nesfoods international who was there at the invitation of the mayor who intended to thank him publiclythat is before the assembled tv and still cameramenfor his generous publicspirited offering of the airplane beside mr nesbitt iii was mr chadwick thomas nesbitt iv a vice president of nesfoods international who was there because he had called the nesfoods international aviation department and asked to be informed of the arrival of the citation when word was passed that the nesfoods citation had just requested landing and taxi instructions mr nesbitt iv was engaged in conversation with mr stan colt the film actor who had somehow acquired a zipper jacket with the legend philadelphia police department on it also sitting in the vip section of the flatspin so to speak were the proprietor mr fred hagen mr brewster cortland payne ii esq and amelia m payne md the latter two had been informed of the arrival time by commissioner coughlin mr payne was there as a proud parent dr payne was there both because she wanted a look at an interesting example of mental disorder and also because she wanted to see her little brothers moment of triumph the hon eileen mcnamara solomon had also found time in her busy schedule to be in the flatspin primarily because she wanted to have a look at mr daniels with an eye to evaluating how he might be evaluated by a jury should he change his mindwhich she thought was a distinct possibilityabout his confession and claim his right to be judged by a jury of his peers outside the restaurant just inside the airport property where a fourengine b liberator stood permanently parked as a memorial to captain bill benn usaac mr hagens uncle who had gone down flying a b in world war iia small coterie of more junior white shirts and their cars was also waiting for mr daniels captain henry quaire and lieutenant jason washington of homicide stood beside captain david pekach of highway patrol and the captains commanding the eighth police district and northeast detectives between the b and the tarmac in front of the nesfoods international aviation department hangar where the citation would park twenty or so uniformsand their carswaited in front of the hangar itself about three quarters of them deputy commissioner coughlin thought privately had no real business being here all that had to be done was to get daniels off the airplane and into a patrol car and haul him off to the detention room in the roundhouse basement sending a car or even twoto go with the car with daniels in itthere was a slight but real possibility of a flat tire or a vehicular accidentwould seem justified but this was more like a circus than it should be homer c daniels was not the firstby a long shotaccused murderer to require transportation but coughlin knew there was nothing he could do about it even if he had the authority to order them all to go away he understood their curiosity their sense of proprietorship this was a homicide thus quaire and washington northeast philadelphia airport was in the area of responsibility of both the eighth police district and the northeast detectives division thus the presence of both of those captains commanding and highway patrol had citywide authority which is why dave pekach had felt free to come and watch homer c daniels be returned to philadelphia mr michael j ohara who had gotten out of his seat the moment the citations wheels had touched ground to take a final shot of daniels in his seatand had nearly lost his footing when it decelerated rapidlywas the first person off the plane he took up a position to get a shot of daniels getting off the plane very much as eddie colts personal photographer had taken when colt had landed at the northeast airport mr steven cohen got off next followed by detective damata then daniels again wearing handcuffs and finally sergeant payne the eighth district commander and the highway patrol commander walked up to the airplane and a highway car an eighth district car and then another highway car drove up detective damata put daniels in the eighth district car then got in beside him the three cars then drove off leaving mr cohen sergeant payne mr ohara and the two captains standing beside the airplane they want you over there captain pekach said indicating the grouped vips sergeant payne looked carefully around the field he did not see detective lassiter there had not been much for the press to record for posterity it had taken less than a minute to get daniels off the plane and into the eighth district car having nothing else to do something the mayor had counted onthe press turned their attention to him the mayor smiled first at steven cohen esq and shook his hand and then smiled at sergeant payne and shook his hand district attorney solomon also an elected official was photographed shaking mr cohens hand the mayor waved mr nesbitt iii to his side i have a brief statement to make the mayor began a terrible tragedy took place in our city and nothing can ever make that right but i want to take this opportunity to say how proud i am not only of our police department and the office of the district attorney but of our concerned involved citizens as well as soon as it came to his attention that as the result of some really firstclass investigative work by the police department and some really firstclass legal work by mrs solomon and her associates the man charged with this heinous crime was in custody in alabama mr nesbitt of nesfoods international called to offer the use of his corporate aircraftat no cost whatever to the cityto bring the accused murderer to philadelphia to face justice thank you mr nesbitt it seemed the least we at nesfoods could do mr mayor mr nesbitt said nesfoods international likes to think we are responsible corporate citizens of philadelphia and i have to say this the mayor went on there has been some unfortunate and in my judgment unfair comments in some of the press lately to the effect that certain police officers were spending too much time protecting my good friend stan colt from the ardor of his fans when what they should have been doing was trying to apprehend a murderer i think this proves beyond any doubt that our police can do both things at the same time mayor martin did not take questions he turned and ducked quickly into his waiting limousine mr nesbitt iii shook hands with sergeant payne and ducked into his waiting limousine district attorney solomon said good work you guys and got into her unmarked crown victoria commissioner mariani shook sergeant paynes hand and got into his crown victoria captain quaire and lieutenant washington walked up what next boss sergeant payne asked come to work in the morning washington said after you finish your detail with dignitary protection i understand mr colt is leaving at elevenfifteen tomorrow morning i was supposed to leave after the last thing tonight stan colt said but i didnt want to leave without seeing you i want to hear everything that happened theres not much to tell matt said bullshit after this thing tonight im throwing a little thankyou party at la famiglia you mickey your pal nesbitt four terry a handful of others stan i dont know its all laid on you cant say no now i gotta go one more lunchwhich im already late forand this thing tonight and then im done commissioner coughlin nodded which detective payne correctly interpreted to mean was an order to him to attend mr colts little thankyou party tonight and to tell him everything that happened mr colt then punched sergeant payne in the shoulder and got in his limousine highway patrol officers kicked their bikes into life and sirens growling led the way out of the airport if my children brewster c payne said dont mind having lunch with a couple of old men denny and i are about to have ours he doesnt have any choice in the matter dr payne said i want to hear about this guy so do i deputy commissioner coughlin said how about right here at the flatspin they do a really nice mahimahi twenty one there was a telephone in a niche in the low fieldstone wall around the patio of the payne house in wallingford but when it rang patricia payne really didnt want to answer it feeling just a little ashamed of herselfthis has to be prurient interestthe truth was that she was fascinated by the interrogation of her son by her husband and her daughter concerning his encounter with homer c daniels she had known amelia m payne md from before she had taken her first stepsand was in fact the only mother amy had ever knownand she had given birth to matt they were her children and she had taken maternal pride in both amy was a certified genius and while matt wasnt as smart he had graduated summa cum laude from pennsylvania and she knew that her husband was a very good lawyer and amy a highly regarded psychiatrist and matt was carrying his fathers sergeants badge but knowing that hadnt prepared her for sitting with them and listening to them speak of this unspeakable crime and the man who had committed it and his motivations and the legal aspects of the whole sordid series of events as professionals rather than father and son and daughter and it wasnt just an idle conversation they had been at it over an hour ever since brewsters sedate black cadillac had unexpectedly led amys battered suburban and matts unmarked police ford into the drive when he had called from the flatspin restaurant where they had had lunch she had asked what the chances were of having the children home for supper he had said hed see from his tone of voice it had seemed unlikely but then theyd appeared surprising and pleasing her brewster had said matt couldnt come for supper he had to be with stan colt so theyd come now theyd immediately gone out to the patio arranged themselves on the comfortably upholstered lawn furniture and started talking about homer c daniels without being asked mrs newman the payne housekeepera comfortable looking grayhaired woman in her fiftieshad produced a pot of coffee and a tray with toasted rye bread liverwurst mustard and sliced raw onions and then taken a chair by the door patricia was pleased to see mrs newman was as fascinated with mr homer c daniels as she was and then the phone rang and patricia didnt want to talk to anyone and said as much grab that please elizabeth she called and get rid of whoever it is ill call them back mrs newman took her walkaround telephone from a pocket in her dress and spoke into it then she got up and walked to them mrs nesbitt for mr payne she said she wont take no for an answer damn brewster c payne esq said not you mrs newman said young mrs nesbitt for young mr payne shit young mr payne said matty his mother said mrs newman handed him the phone and how is the somewhat careless caretaker of my goddaughter god youre such an asshole matt daffy nesbitt said thank you for sharing that with me ill tell mother what you said but despite that im going to do you a favor oh god i probably really shouldnt tell you this but chad said i should youre in the family way again no goddamn it can we get to the point of this fascinating conversation please were having a few people in here before we make an appearance at the four seasons thing daffy said what people matt asked old friends of ours of yours chad said and i want you to show up in black tie and spare us your usual bad manners daffy said whats in it for me terry chad nesbitt chimed in shes the door prize chad laughed i cant imagine why daffy said but she really likes you she asked if you would be coming now thats interesting detective lassiters cellular phone was reported out of service and messages left on her answering machine and at northwest detectives asking that she call him had brought no response tell me more matt said you could take terry to the colt dinner at the four seasons and then to la famiglia whose idea is that mine daffy said shes not throwing herself at you well i dont know i like it better when they throw themselves at me suit yourself you bastard daffy said what time is this drunken brawl of yours fiveish daffy said what was that all about dr payne inquired asking the question her mother had just reluctantly decided was none of her business and couldnt ask daffy wants me to go by society hill before the colt dinner at the four seasons theyre having people in what i think they really want is for me to entertain one and all by telling them all about homer c daniels thats unkind matt patricia payne said theyre your oldest friends and theyre playing cupid again matt said trying to pair me off with terry davis so youre not going amy asked as mother says chad and i go back a long way matt said realizing as he said it that it sounded transparently lame two at when matt payne left la famigliaan upscale restaurant on south front street just below market street overlooking the delaware riverhe was just about convinced that he was going to get lucky with terry davis everything had gone well from his immediately being able to put his hands on the little box with the studs for his dress shirt when he hastily changed into a dinner jacket at his apartmentthat almost never happenedthrough the drinks at chad and daffys place until now terry had looked very good indeed when he went into the party and she did in fact seem glad to see him and hed even gotten along with the people chad and daffy had in many of them hed known all his life usually however when he saw them socially they gave him the impression that hed done something terrible that had moved him far below the salt like being a cop so he didnt often see them socially when he did he often in daffys words showed his ass and embarrassed everybody tonight there had been none of that with one minor exception i didnt know payne until i saw you on the tube that you were a sergeant j andrew stansfield iii had said coming up to where matt was looking out the windows onto the delaware thats right stansfield matthew m payne chadwick thomas nesbitt iv and j andrew stansfield iii had graduated from episcopal academy together stansfield had gone on to princeton then the harvard school of business administration and then found employment with stansfield amp stansfield commercial realtors im afraid i actually dont know what that means stansfield said it means i make four percent more than i made when i was detective matt said it comes to right over two thousand a year thats all stansfield said genuinely surprised then his face showed that he suspected payne was pulling his leg well there are certain professional privileges matt said for example for example when terry and i leave here for the four seasons my car is parked right outside on the cobblestones of stockton place matt said if you tried to park there stansfield youd be towed yes i know j andrew stansfield had said nodding and seeming a bit confused terry davis had squeezed his arm and when he looked at her her eyes were smiling and terry had smelled very nice indeed in his porsche on the way to the four seasons where he was ablebecause sergeant al nevins of dignitary protection was there awaiting the arrival of stan colt and wanted to talk to himto park very near the door were playing games later nevins said the limo will take colt and the bolinskis bolinski as in the bull matt interrupted nevins nodded the limo will take them back to the ritz where they will go inside get on the elevator go to the basement and out into the alley where they will get into a suburban and go to la famiglia clever matt said with a little luck it will work nevins said casimir bolinski lld esq whom matt had never met before turned out to be a very nice guy who would have been perfectly happy to stay in an anteroom off the dining room with matt and terrywhom he knewduring the banquet had not his wife found him honey were going to la famiglia after this i dont want to eat any of that fancy french food youre going to go in there and sit next to the cardinal and the monsignor youre going to drink only water and when they introduce you youre going to hand him this she handed him an envelope containing a check jesus christ antoinette that much you graduated west catholic mrs bolinski said you owe them they tossed mickey and stan out they dont anyway its deductible mrs bolinski looking not unlike a tugboat easing an aircraft carrier down a river had then escorted her husband into the dining room terry davis again smelled delightfully in the porsche on the way from the four seasons to la famiglia but there he couldnt park the porsche in front and instead had to take it to the adjacent parking lot there were red plastic conesthe kind used to mark lanes on highwaysin the first halfdozen parking places by the entrance but terry held his hand as they walked from where he finally found an empty slot which he decided was more than enough compensation for the inconvenience at dinner he found himself seated beside casimir bolinski esq and across from michael j ohara who sensing they had an appreciative audience in terry davis entertained her with stories of their time at west catholic high school the cardinal had not come to la famiglia but monsignor schneider was there sitting beside stan colt more than once during a meal that began with an enormous antipasto and ended with spumoni onto which a shot of amaretto had been poured miss daviss knee brushed against matts often enough to allow himself to think it wasnt entirely accidental and there was another indication of good things to come at the first of the two goodnight and farewell sessions the first was held inside the restaurant youre just going to have to come to the coast matt stan colt said you make him come terry i will terry had said and squeezed his arm again matt was surprised when they actually left the restaurant that the classic livery body wagon with darkened windows wasnt waiting on the sidewalk for colt and party but then he saw sergeant nevins and half a dozen men he knew to be detectives discreetly lining the path to the parking lot when they got there matt saw that the body wagon mickey oharas buick rendezvous a black oldsmobile and three unmarked cars were in the spaces that had been blocked off by the red lane markers there was a second goodnight and farewell session there monsignor schneider seemed reluctant to say good night making matt wonder how deep the cleric had gone into the wine but finally everybody was loaded into the vehicles and they left terry took matts hand again and then leaned against him suggesting an arm around her shoulders would not be unwelcome they walked through the parking lot toward the porsche the only problem now seemed where to go my apartments a dump to begin with and a mess after that quick shower and jump into the dinner jacket and theres probably something hair lipstick on a towel whatever thatll give away that olivia screw her has been there terrys staying at the ritzcarlton but if we go there she may not want them to know i went to her room and it will be a brief kiss and i had a lovely time can i suggest another hotel screw it the apartment it is he opened the door to the porsche for her then got in and started the engine he saw that the parking slot in front of him was empty if theres not a concrete block in the way i can just drive through there was not and he did he turned leftthe only entranceexit was where he came in and he would have to drive to the end of the line and then out that wayand flicked the headlights onto high what the fuck is that he asked aloud and then he accelerated rapidly and braked as quickly oh my god terry said she had seen what he had there was a man propped up against the rear of one of the parked cars his legs sprawled in front of him a woman was kneeling beside him wiping at his face he was bleeding from the mouth matt jumped out of the car what happened what does it look like the woman snapped we were mugged i gave him my wallet why did they have to do this the man asked and spit what looked like part of a tooth came out of his mouth have you got a cell phone the woman demanded we need an ambulance matt reached for his cell phone my god theyre coming back the man said matt saw where he was looking at the extreme end of the parking lot there were two young men in dark clothes youre sure thats them matt asked thats them thats them thats them the woman said stop right there matt called loudly im a police officer the two started running one of them had what could be a sawedoff shotgun or a softball bat where the hell were you when we needed you the woman asked matt ran back to the porsche and got in he tossed his cellular into terrys lap what the hell are you doing terry asked he had the car moving before the door had closed he wound it up in first and touched the brake only as he reached the end of the lane of cars as he turned left the windshield of the porsche suddenly reflected light all over there was a boom you cocksucker matt said slamming on the brakes the object in the mans hand obviously was not a softball bat there was another boom part of the windshield fell out matt dove out of the car and half rolled half crawled between two parked cars he pulled his colt officers model from the small of his back and worked the action a cartridge flew out hed had one in the chamber that leaves five he ran between the cars dropped to his knees and peered very carefully around the bumper of one the two were climbing the chainlink fence at the end of the parking lot matt stood up held the pistol in both hands and called out thats it just drop to the ground one of them dropped to the ground and one didnt for a moment matt didnt know what to do then the second one dropped to the ground reached into his jacket and came out with a semiautomatic pistol and started firing it wildly and then there was another boom immediately followed by the sound of heavy lead shot striking metal and glass near him matt fired four times taking out the shotgunner first and then the man with the pistol the shotgunner went down and stayed there the man with the pistol didnt he began to scream in agony matt took the spare clip to the from where he had concealed itbehind the white handkerchief in the breast pocket of the dinner jacket ejected the empty clip from the pistol and slipped in the spare then holding the weapon in both hands he carefully walked up to the two men on the ground the one with the shotgun was on his back his head in a pool of blood one of matts shots had struck him straight on in the right cheek the other one was screaming matt saw the pistolat first glance in the dark it looked like a browningand keeping his eye on the man bent over carefully picked it up with two fingers on the grips and then put it in his hip pocket you got anything else he asked and patted the writhing man down to make sure he didnt then he went back and picked up the shotgun on the ground near the body and turned and walked quickly toward the porsche and the victims the first thing he saw was that only one headlight was working and then he saw the pellet holes in the hood and door and windshield frame and what was left of the windshield then he first smelled and then saw gasoline running from under the porsche jesus he said he laid the shotgun on the roof and jerked terrys door open she looked at him without comprehension and then he saw that her face was bleeding are you all right all right she parroted he unfastened her seat belt reached into her lap reclaimed his cellular and then pulled her out of the car there was blood on her dress but when he put his hand to it she pushed him away as if he was taking liberties with her person he led her around the corner and sort of leaned her against a ford van then he went to the victims its over he said everythings going to be all right all right all right the woman snapped at him what the hell is the matter with you are you drunk or

on the job for twentytwo years answered his call on the second ring this is sergeant payne shots fired officer needs assistance mrs carracelli waited for the sergeant to provide greater details when

parking lot next to la famiglia restaurant on south front street are you injured no im fine thank you are you in uniform sergeant oh no im not in uniform matt chuckled mrs carracelli made several quick decisions first that the call was legitimate not someones idea of a joke that there was something wrong with the sergeant his voice was strange and he sounded a little disoriented he might be injured or even wounded she muted the telephone line and pushed the appropriate switches every police radio in philadelphia heard three shrill beeps and then the call assist the officer south front street parking lot by la famiglia restaurant unit block south front street shots fired assist the officer parking lot by la famiglia restaurant unit block south front street shots fired all officers use caution plainclothes police on the scene the three shrill beeps and the call were also heard in the buick rendezvous which was carrying mr and mrs casimir bolinski up market street toward the ritzcarlton hotel shit mr michael j ohara said as he put the rendezvous into a screeching uturn thats where matty is as they followed the black suburban up market street in their unmarked crown victoria lieutenant gerry mcguire and sergeant al nevins heard the same call mcguire found the microphone dan sevenfour and dan sevenfive stay with the assignment he said into it and then he tossed the microphone to nevins as he desperately looked for a hole in the oncoming traffic on market street in which he could make a uturn radio sergeant nevins said to the microphone dan sevenone in on the assist officer on front street be advised there is probably an officer in plainclothes on the scene mrs carracelli opened the telephone line sergeant identify your unit and give conditions my name is

fine they missed me help is on the way i can hear the sirens tell them im deep inside the parking lot help is on the way mrs carracelli said and muted the telephone line again three more shrill beeps

the scene one is inside the parking lot all units be advised the unit block of south front street shots have been fired at police and there are plainclothes officers on the scene one is inside the

said you can hear it what about the man whos screaming cant you do something for him id like to put another round in the sonofabitch is what id like to do my god i cant believe you said that you really are a coldblooded sonofabitch arent you matt decided there was no point in arguing with her there will be help in a minute he said and started walking back toward where hed put the two men down halfway there he pulled his bow tie loose and opened his collar he was sweatsoaked he looked at the cellular and punched in an autodial number three detective paynes call was answered by inspector peter f wohl in his residence in the block of norwood street in chestnut hill in northwest philadelphia when wohls cell phonein a charging cradle on his bedside tablechirped he was not wearing any clothing at all and was engaged in chasing a twentyeightyearold female around his bedroom with the announced intention of divesting her of her sole remaining article of clothing black nylon underpants when the cell phone tinkled wohl said shit and the young womanhaving only moments before decided to let peter work his wicked way with hersoftly said amen amelia alice payne md knew inspector peter wohl well enough to know that not only was he going to answer the phone but that the odds were that it was something that would keep them from ending what had been a delightful evening in what she had thought was going to be a delightful way the look on peters face as he listened to what the caller was saying confirmed her worst fears as did his almost conversational response to what the caller had said was it a good shooting amy had been peter wohls onandoff girlfriend lover and the nextthingtofiancee long enough to have acquired an easy familiarity with police department cant she knew in other words that a good shooting was one in which the police shooter was not only fully justified in having used deadly force in the execution of his duties but in circumstances such that his justification would be obvious to those who would investigate the incident which was officially the internal affairs division of the police department and the office of the district attorney and unofficially philadelphias newspapers radio and television stations and more than a dozen civil rights organizations well you know the drill inspector peter wohl said to his caller theyll take you to internal affairs he clicked the cell phone off and tossed it on the bed then raised his eyes and looked at amy who was still where she had been when the phone tinkled standing on his mattress holding on to the right upper bedpost sorry he said fuck you peter she said furiously maybe we can work that in a little later wohl said but right now i have to go to internal affairs no you fucking well dont amy went on a part of her brainthe psychiatrist parttold her that she had lost her temper which disturbed her while anotherpurely feminine part told her she had every justification in the world for being angry with the male chauvinistic sonofabitch for choosing duty over hankypanky with her particularly at just about the precise moment she had decided to let him catch her he looked at her with a smugly tolerant smile on his lips which added fuel to her anger i fucking well dont he parroted mockingly peter youve got a deputy she said when she thought she had regained sufficient control under you and your deputy there are three captains and probably four times that many lieutenants thats true he said there is a thing known in management as delegation of authority and responsibility dr payne went on reasonably i agree i think what youre asking is why do i as the caesar of my little empire have to personally rush off whenever one of my underlings has need of a friendly face and an encouraging word thats just about it yeah she said ordinarily i would agree with you having given the subject some thought after your last somewhat emotional outburst she felt her temper rising again and with a great effort kept her mouth shut as peter found clean linen and started to put it on only when she was sure that she had herself under control did she go on let me guess this is an exception to the rule right right fuck you peter it will always be this is an exception to the rule that was matt on the phone he said oh god she said her anger instantly replaced with an almost maternal concern oh god not again it looks that way im afraid wohl said what happened matt saidright after the colt partyhe was in the parking lot next to la famiglia restaurant she nodded she knew the restaurant well and he walked up on an armed robbery they shot at him and he shot back and put both of them downone for good why the hell couldnt he have just for once for once looked the other way hes a cop honey wohl said is he all right he sounded all right to me she jumped off the bed and looked around the room where the hell is my damned bra she asked softly more of herself than of him its probably in the living room wohl said she looked at him then picked up her skirt and stepped into it i gather you wont be here when i get back wohl asked im going with you she said i dont think you want to do that he said dont think you know what i want to do please she said what it is is that you dont want me to go with you okay he said i dont and i dont think matt will want to see you right now either she slipped her feet into her shoes then went out of the room returning in a moment in the act of putting her brassiere on she backed up to him fasten it will you please funny he said after fussing with the catch for a moment i didnt have this much trouble opening it she didnt reply until she was sure he had fastened the catch and then she turned and faced him i cant believe that youre as unaffected by this as youre trying to make out she said you know what this is going to do to him im really unhappy about it if thats what you mean he replied but no i dont know what this is going to do to him i hope that it was a good shooting and id like to think hes already worked his way through the questions something like this brings up you mean after the first couple ofgood shootings it gets easier she asked more than a little sarcastically he didnt reply for a moment i hope for matts sake it does he said finally she looked at him for a long moment then walked out of the room again and came back pulling a sweater over her head your call she said we can take two cars or i can go with you he looked at her in the mirrorhe was tying his tiebut didnt say anything until he was finished then he turned around and looked directly at her thank you he said what for you know what for he said he took a tweed sports coat from his closet then followed her out of the bedroom and through the living room to the door his apartment had once been the servants quarters above what had once been the stables and then the fivecar garage of the turnofthecentury mansion now divided into luxury apartments they went down the outside stairs and to his unmarked crown victoria he unlocked her door for her and she reached up and kissed him sorry to have been such a bitch amy said hey i understand he closed the door after her and went around the front and got in the car and drove up to the drive past the mansion to norwood street and turned right no flashing blue lights and screaming siren amy asked well probably get to internal affairs before he does wohl said he reached under the dash and came up with a microphone s he said go ahead s police radiothis time a masculine voicereplied on my way from my home to internal affairs wohl said got it he dropped the microphone on the seat can you get denny coughlin on that amy asked he picked up the microphone radio s have you got a location on commissioner coughlin s hes at methodist hospital whats going on there an officer was shot answering a robbery in progress on south broad and be advised theres a new assist officer shots fired on front street just a couple of minutes ago okay thank you he put the microphone down if the root of your question was does he know the answer is if he doesnt he will in a matter of minutes he does a much better job of telling mother and dad about things like this than i do theyre almost certainly asleep at this hour you really want to wake them up no she said after a moment but theyll be hurt and angry if someone doesnt tell them you really want to wake them up he asked again and went on all youre going to do is upset them youor coughlincan do it in the morning when things have settled down good morning mom she said sarcastically guess what happened again last night he chuckled was it a good shooting peter she asked almost plaintively from the way matt talked it was he said well soon find out four mickey ohara beat the first police unita marked sixth district carand the secondlieutenant gerry mcguires unmarked dignitary protection crown victoriato the parking lot by a good thirty seconds he was well into the parking lot camera at the ready before the uniformed officer mcguire and nevins got of their cars drew their weapons and cautiously entered the lot ohara saw matt payne long before matt payne saw himor perhaps more accurately acknowledged oharas presence matt was standing at the far end of the lot pistol drawn looking down at what after another second or two ohara saw was a man writhing on the ground matt matty you all right ohara decided that the crescendo of sirens was so loud matt couldnt hear him but finally just when ohara was close enough to be able to hear the anguished moans of the man on the ground matt turned and looked at him ohara instantlyand certainly not intentionallyturned from concerned friend to journalist jesus thats a good picture a goodlooking young cop in a tuxedo tie pulled down gun in hand looking down at the bad guy justice fucking triumphant he put the digital camera to his eye and made the shot and three others to make sure he got it what took you so long mickey matt asked what the hell happened matt these two guys he raised the pistol and indicated the second body then he waited patiently while mickey took images of the dead man before going on these two guys mugged a nice middleclass black couple out for dinner the guy gave him his wallet and one of these bastards knocked his teeth out with a gun anyway i walked up on it tried to grab them and they let fly with a sawedoff shotgun and what looks like a browning jesus payne lieutenant mcguire asked what went down here and shot the shit out of my car and almost killed my girlfriend and i put them down matt finished almost conversationally ohara nevins and mcguire looked at him curiously are you all right mcguire asked in concern im fine they missed matt replied the victims are over here sergeant nevins squatted beside the man on the ground who glared hatefully at him it looks like youre off the ballet team he said but youll live fire rescues on the way he stood up they had guns he asked where are they matt carefully took the browning from his hip pocket and held it out mcguire took it i put the shotgun on the roof of my car matt said mickey get the hell out of here mcguire ordered ohara ignored him around here matt he asked just around the corner matt said two angry females the victims wife who wanted to know where i was when i was needed and my girlfriendperhaps exgirlfriend would be more accuratewho just described me as a coldblooded sonofabitch for shooting these two ohara i told you to get the hell out of here mcguire shouted after him i presume the firemen are on their way matt said to mcguire in addition to the other damage they apparently shot out a fuel line theres gas all over the ground or maybe they got the tank mcguire approached him warily why dont you let me have your weapon payne he asked oh yes of course i forgot he handed the colt to mcguire buttfirst as three uniforms and two men who were dressed much like those they hoped to arrest for illegal trafficking in controlled substances ran up to them pistols in hand mcguire removed the clip counted the rounds it held then worked the action and ejected the round in the chamber matt reached into the breast pocket of the dinner jacket came out with another magazine and handed it to mcguire this is the magazine now empty that was in my weapon he said and somewhere over there is a live round i inadvertently ejected when this started the crime scene people will find it mcguire said holding matts pistol carefully by the checkering on the wooden grips he started to put it in the pocket of his suit coat i think youre supposed to give that back to me matt said what regulations state that the first supervisor to reach the scene of an incident like this is to take the weapon used from the officer who used it remove the magazine count the remaining rounds take possession of that magazine then return the weapon to the officer who will then load a fresh magazine into his weapon and return it to his holster sergeant this is evidence mcguire said with all respect sir that is not what the regulations say shut up sergeant mcguire said yes sir sergeant payne said a fire rescue ambulance began backing into the parking lot a sixth district lieutenant a very large man came running up my name is mcguire mcguire said dignitary protection unit im the first supervisor on the scene ive seen you around the sixth district lieutenant said i have relieved sergeant payne of his weapon and am now going to transport him to internal affairs youre the shooter sergeant the lieutenant asked i think all the questions to him are supposed to be asked by internal affairs mcguire said nevins will tell you what we know will you come with me please sergeant payne yes sir lieutenant mcguire put his hand on sergeant paynes arm and walked with him through the parking lot to where the unmarked dignitary protection crown victoria sat its engine running and its headlights and concealed blue flashers still on he put matt in the backseat but didnt close the door nevins came to the car a moment later you drive al mcguire said ill ride in the back with payne they exchanged questioning glances then shrugged and then nevins got behind the wheel and mcguire got in the backseat with matt twentyone one in philadelphia any dischargeeven accidental of a police officers weapon is investigated by the internal affairs unit even if the discharge of the police officers weapon results in a death internal affairs still retains the weapon results in a death internal affairs still retains the responsibility for and authority to conduct the investigation the homicide division assists this policy came into being when various civil rights organizations charged that police shootingsfatal and nonfatalwere being covered up when investigated by homicide or detective divisions and that only internal affairs an elite unit already charged with the investigation of police malfeasance could be trusted to investigate shootings fully and fairly when the first assist officer shots fired call was broadcast to every police vehicle in philadelphia it was received in the crown victoria assigned to inspector michael weisbach of the internal affairs division who was at the time returning to his home from a social event at temple beth emmanuel he did not respond to the call primarily because he was a considerable distance from south front street and realized that by the time he could get there at least twenty and probably more other units would be on the scene but he did turn to his wife and say i really hope no one was hit im really beat by the time he got to his home however other radio traffic had made it clear that he wasnt going to be able to go to bed anytime soon and after hed dropped his wife off and headed for the internal affairs office on dungan road in northeast philadelphia there came several times official confirmation i radio i go we have two suspects down one dead at the assist officer shots fired unit block south front street okay im on my way to iad then his cellular telephone chirped the first bars of rule britannia weisbach inspector this is captain fein sixth district hello jake two suspects down one dead at the assist officer shots fired on south front im on my way to iad thanks for the heads up out of school mike it looks righteous i sure hope so thanks again jake he had just laid the telephone down on the seat when it played rule britannia again weisbach kimberly boss i just got a call from lieutenant mcguire of dignitary protection he was the first supervisor on the scene in the shots fired on south front and hes transporting the shooter here im en route youre not going to like this boss the shooters sergeant matt payne oh hell you want me to call the fop yes please and put payne in an interview room and dont do anything else until i get there yes sir theres more boss let me have it stan colt and his entourage were there the press has hold of it and theyre all over the scene im watching it on the television here in the office they broke into the primetime shows to cover it live its a real cluster fuck out there two under the contract between the city of philadelphia and lodge of the fraternal order of police it is agreed that whenever any police officer regardless of rank is detained for any reason that might result in criminal prosecution the detaining unit will at the same time it notifies senior police officials notify the fraternal order of police the fraternal order of police will then dispatch an attorney to ensure that the rights of the police officer being detained are not violated in any way and to assist him in any way deemed necessary there are lawyers under contract to lodge to provide counsel on call there are other lawyers in philadelphia who provide their professional servicespro bono publico to lodge perhaps the most distinguished of this latter group is armando c giacomo esq a slight lithe dapper italian who once served his country as a marine corps fighter pilot then came home to become either the best and most successful criminal defense attorney in philadelphia or the second best the other contender for that unofficial title being colonel j dunlop mawson esq of mawson payne stockton mcadoo amp lester the difference between the two was essentially in their clientele colonel mawson who often defended individuals accused of stealing misappropriating embezzling taking by fraud or deception or otherwise illegally acquiring huge sums of moneyand was compensated accordinglydeclined to offer his professional services to anyone with any connection however remote to organized crime or the illegal trade in controlled substances arguing that even the most despicable scoundrels were entitled under the united states constitution to the best defense possible armando c giacomo defended very often successfully the most despicable scoundrels alleged to be connected with organized crime andor the illegal traffic in controlled substances and was compensated accordingly mr giacomos understanding with lodge fraternal order of police was that he wished to offer his services only in cases worthy of his talent as the ordinary thug could not afford to avail himself of his services neither should the cop charged with say drunken driving or slapping the wife around have his professional services made available to him pro bono publico he preferred to defend officers charged with violating the civil rights of citizens andabove all officers alleged to have illegally taken life in the execution of their official duties when the official of lodge fraternal order of police was informed by captain daniel kimberly of internal affairs that a sergeant was being detained for investigation of a shooting of two suspects one of them fatal he immediately began searching for mr giacomos unlisted home number in his rolodex and he was not at all surprised despite the hour that mr giacomo said he would go directly to iad and that the fop representative should meet him there three the city editor of thephiladelphia bulletin roscoe g kennedy responded to a computer message from michael j ohara kennedy hold space page one section one for three column pic plus jump for words more pics ohara in several ways the first being annoyance oharas message was very much in the form of an order rather than a request or suggestion no matter how much money and perquisites oharas pal casimir bolinski the footballjockturnedsportsattorney had beat the people upstairs out of in exchange for the services of michael ohara roscoe g kennedy felt that this in no way changed the fact that michael j ohara was a staff writer no more and roscoe g kennedy was the city editor and thus entitled to tell the staff writer what to do and when not the reverse the second cause of annoyance was that in order to see what immortal prose michael j ohara believed was worthy of a threecolumn photograph on page one of section oneplus a jump with more picturesbefore ohara saw fit in his own sweet time to send it to him he would have to go to oharas office this was actually a double irritant mr kennedy did not think a lowly staff writer was entitled to an expensively furnished private officeoharas exotic wood and calfskinupholstered charles eames chair was more salt in the wound herein the first place and to get to it he was going to have to get up from his desk and walk across the city room which meant past a large number of other staff writers all of whom would see that he was calling on ohara rather than the other way around the third irritant was that roscoe g kennedy knew that if ohara thought he had something worthy of space on page one of section one and with a large jump to be placed elsewhere the sonofabitch probably did roscoe g kennedy was honest enough to admitif sometimes through clenched teeththat mickey ohara was really a hell of a good writer and had earned his pulitzer prize so mr kennedy resisted the urge to summon mr ohara to his presence to discuss his latest contribution to thebulletin and instead got up and walked across the city room and knocked politely at the door he saw that mr ohara had guests in his office casimir the bull bolinski and presumably mrs bolinski and he smiled at them what have you got for me mickey mr kennedy asked ohara raised one hand from the keyboard of his computer terminal on which he was typing with great rapidity and pointed to the screen of his personal as opposed to the bulletins computer there was a very clear photograph of a wellknown philadelphia police officer on it this one showing him in a dinner jacket with a cellular phone in one hand and a colt in the other standing just a little triumphantly over a man lying on the ground theres more ohara said the city editor looked at the other images from the parking lot then read mickeys story on the computer screen he didnt speak until ohara had finished and pushed the transmit key then he said great stuff mickey really great the wyatt earp of the main line does it again mickey stood up what did you say he asked for a head how about main line wyatt earp bad guys in shootout at the la famiglia corral you sonofabitch mickey said thats a cop doing his job watch your mouth michael casimir said antoinette a goddamn cop in a tuxedo who obviously likes to shoot people you sonofabitch youre no better than the goddamn ledger dont call me a sonofabitch ohara i wont stand for it then dont make wiseass remarks about a cop liking what he has to do to do his job you arrogant elitist bleedingheart mickey paused searching his memory for the most scalding insult he could think of and then triumphantly concluded missouri school of journalism sonofabitch michael im not going to tell you again casimir said you cant talk to me like that ohara i just did what are you going to do about it mr michael j ohara assumed a fighting crouch and cocked his fists mr roscoe g kennedy rose to the challenge he threw a roundhouse right at mr ohara mr ohara nimbly dodged the punch feinted with his right then punched mr kennedy in the nose with his left and then in the abdomen with his right mr kennedy fell doubled over to the floor taking with him thebulletins computer terminal casimir j bolinski esq erupted from mr oharas charles eames chair rushed across the office wrapped his arms around mr ohara and without much apparent effort carried him across the city roompast many members of thebulletin staffand into an elevator mrs bolinski followed them mr kennedy regained his feet and sort of staggered to the door youre fired you insane shanty irish sonofabitch fired he shouted when im through with you you wont be able to get a job on thenational enquirer mrs bolinski stuck her tongue out at mr kennedy ten minutes later after an application of ice had stopped his nosebleed mr kennedy gave mr oharas latestand as far as he was concerned certainly lastcontribution to the bulletin some serious thought and then he called his assistant and told him to save space on page one section one copy to come for a threecolumn pic plus a fourhundredword jump inside with three or four pics four when inspector weisbach came into the internal affairs unit captain daniel kimberly was talking with lieutenant mcguire and another man he sensed was a police officer he didnt see payne kimberly anticipated his question i put sergeant payne in an interview room and asked him to wait kimberly said nothing else and i called the fop good weisbach said who called back just a moment ago to inform me that mr armando c giacomo is en route here to represent sergeant payne how fortunate for sergeant payne weisbach said inspector this is lieutenant mcguire how are you lieutenant good evening sir or good morning sir and this is sergeant al nevins inspector mcguire said you were the first supervisor on the scene yes sir a uniform got there ahead of you no sir mickey ohara got there firstby about thirty seconds when nevins and i got there he had already taken paynes picture standing over the man payne put down i understood there were two men shot yes sir one fatally payne blew his brains out how do youknow that lieutenant well sir payne told us and we saw the body the bullet struck right about here he pointed at his own face did payne also tell you what happened he said there had been an armed robbery of a couple picking up their car in the lot that hed walked up on it right afterward told the robbers to stop they ran he went after them they fired at him with a shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol and he put both of them down did they hit him weisbach asked no sir mcguire said and hesitated go on lieutenant weisbach said he was a little shaken up sir how shaken up acted odd you know mcguire said no i dont know well there was the business about his weapon mcguire said what about his weapon i took it from him of course mcguire said and pointed to one of the desks in the room there were two ziploc bags on it one of them held matts officers model colt pistol and the other a magazine of course weisbach asked yes sir and he gave me some lip that i was supposed to give it back to him he didnt give me any trouble but he told me i was supposed to give it back to him after i counted the rounds left in the magazine at that time lieutenant did you believe that sergeant payne a posed a danger to others or himself andor b that he had committed a crime of any kind no sir from what i saw it was a good shooting two things lieutenant there is no such thing as a good shooting they are all lamentable some of them are unfortunately necessary but there is no such thing as a good shooting sir i meant secondly lieutenant you might find it valuable to refresh your memory regarding the regulations dealing with taking a weapon from an officer in a situation like this sir the sergeant was right lieutenant absent any reason to believe that the shooting officer poses a danger to himself or others or belief that the officer has committed a felony the regulations state that his weapon will be returned to him by the supervisor after he counts the rounds remaining in the magazine and takes possession of that inspector i thought it was evidence so you implied the point here is that a clever lawyer such as mr giacomo may make the point that your disarming of sergeant payne against regulations is proof of bias jesus i didnt know obviously now was there any other indication of what you considered odd behavior in sergeant payne he was sort of out of it sir distant maybe is the word the telephone on one of the desks rang and captain kimberly went to answer it and the door opened and inspector peter wohl and amelia a payne md came into the room hello mike wohl said he nodded at the others where is he amy asked honey wohl said warningly peter as i understand it sergeant payne is no longer assigned to special operations weisbach said thats right that makes me ask youll understand what youre doing here what were doing here amy flared jesus h christ i want to see my brother is what were doing here and what dr payne is doing here weisbach continued inspector captain kimberly said that was captain hollaran on the phone he and commissioner coughlin are en route here he asked who was the supervisor i told him you were weisbach nodded his understanding unless you can tell me you have official business here peter weisbach said im afraid ill have to ask you and the lady to leave im not alady goddamn it im a physician and i demand to see my brother take it easy honey wohl said mikes just going by the book he has to screw his book screw him i demand to see my brother peter weisbach said inspector weisbach with your permission peter said id like to stay here with the lady until the arrival of commissioner coughlin the door opened again armando c giacomo strode in he was wearing a tweed jacket gray flannel trousers a pajama top and bedroom slippers sorry it took me so long to get here he said hello mike amelia peter what brings you two here they wont let me see my brother amy said tell them they have to do i correctly infer that it is sergeant payne who was allegedly involved in this unfortunate incident weisbach nodded im not sure if they have to give you access to your brother amy giacomo said but i am absolutely sure that i have the right to see the detainee accompanied by the physician of my choice isnt that correct inspector weisbach i think you can have a police physician counselor weisbach said ill have to check about dr payne youre splitting hairs inspector if the police department can seek as they have on several occasions that come readily to both our minds the consultation of dr payne in the investigation of crimes the only reason i can see why you refuse her as my consultant in this matter access to the detainee is that you are personally biased against my client determined to deprive him of his full rights under the constitution or perhaps hes in there counselor weisbach said pointing to the closed door of the interview room amy walked quickly to the door and pulled it open sergeant payne was sitting at a table tears were running down his cheeks he smiled like a child when he saw amy i guess i did it again huh amy he suddenly slammed his left hand on top of his right and stared at it angrily after a moment he took the left hand away and looked at the right the right hand rose trembling from the table he slapped it down again i have no idea whats the matter with it he explained with a shy smile it just keeps doing that jesus christ armando c giacomo said he turned to inspector weisbach who looked almost as horrified and unhappy as he felt inspector i believe that dr payne is about to advise me that in her professional medical opinion sergeant payne having suffered understandable pain fear and anguish as the result of tonights events not only is not able to intelligently respond to any questions posed by anybody but is in urgent need of medical attention would you have problems with that no sir weisbach said ill call an ambulance no goddamn it amy called from the interview room hes had enough sirens and flashing lights for tonight the men looked away in embarrassment doctor payne was holding sergeant payne in her arms stroking his head he was sobbing uncontrollably after a moment peter wohl entered the room take him amy ordered very gently wohl pulled matt from amys arms and took him into his own she went to kimberlys telephone and dialed a number from memory this is dr payne i will require a private room immediately anywhere but in psychiatric i will be there shortly with the patient she hung up but stood there with her hand on the telephone in thought captain frank hollaran and first deputy commissioner coughlin walked into the room amy honey he said when he saw her im not sure you should be here just shut up uncle denny she said levelly nowim taking care of him then she raised her voice get him on his feet peter were going to take him out of here in a moment wohl appeared in the interview room door his arm around matt matt smiled shyly at everybody as wohl led him across the room and out the door but no one spoke or moved five sergeant matthew payne was lying on his side in the hospital bed his arm over his face when the door opened he first looked annoyed and then curious his hand reached out and found the bed control as the back of the bed rose he rolled onto his back then folded his arms over his chest and looked somewhat defensively at the two physicians who entered the room one was his sister the other a short plump somewhat jowly man in his fifties he was aaron stein md the moses and rebecca wertheimer professor of psychiatry at the medical school of the university of pennsylvania and a former president of the american psychiatric association dr stein had surprised many of his peersand annoyed as many morewhen he selected amelia payne md for a psychiatric residency under his mentorship she had then just turned twentytwo years old she had worked under himhe always insisted on saying with himever since and it was widely believed that dr stein had been responsible for dr paynes current position as the joseph l otterby professor of psychiatry i must really be off my rocker if amy called in the heavyduty reinforcements matt said how do you feel matt dr stein asked i feel as if i was drugged matt said i cant imagine why all i gave you was a sleeping pill amy said did it say for elephants on the bottle dr stein chuckled how long have i been here matt asked you slept through yesterday amy said let me guess matt said light began to come through the windows a couple of hours ago this is the morning of the second day yes it is stein said smiling i normally tell time by looking at my watch matt said but that seems to be missing and both the telephone and the tv seem not to be working you needed rest matt dr stein said is that a polite way of telling the lunatic that he was really bouncing off the walls its just what i said stein said you needed rest matt and not only dont we heavyduty psychiatrists use that word anymoreactually it means affected by the moonbut youre not loony bonkers gaga or whatever else youre thinking matt had to smile he remembered what his father said about dr stein he looks and acts like a beardless santa claus then what is wrong with me he asked in laymans terms dr stein said do you know what thoroughbred racehorses and overachiever workaholics like yourself have in common we make a lot of money for other people matt asked innocently after a moment stein laughed you dont know when to stop you dont understand that you have limits like ordinary horses and other human beings he said he turned to dr payne hes all right he said ill talk to him now ill page you when were through and on your way out have them send two breakfasts in here he turned back to matt ive never known you not to be hungry what would you like take advantage of my presence i get whatever i want i am a little hungry matt said send in the ward nurse dr stein said shes getting a little too big for her britches and it will do her good to take our breakfast order okay matt said amys gone that was a very nice breakfast thank you very much and now i hope youre going to tell me whats wrong with me i already told you what i know is wrong with you do you want to hear what your sister thinks is wrong with you im afraid to ask shes been really worried for some time about you and shes been coming to me for some time to tell me why shes worried is that ethical ethical schmethical she loves you shes a pretty good doctor were friends she came to me its doneshe cant undo telling me you want to hear what she thinks okay she has developed quite a theorybasically that you dont know who you really are who does she think i really am essentially the psychological heir of your mother i dont know what she can mean by that that your psychological makeup is gentle kind even intellectual maybe anyway the antithesis of warrior matt threw his hands up to indicate he had no idea what amy was driving at she thinks you have been conditioned all your life by your role models to believe you were destined to be a warrior stein said what role models commissioner coughlin for one the cops cop stein said but primarily the legend of your biological father who died heroically in the line of duty your uncle the cop captain what was his name dutch matt said captain dutch moffitt who similarly died heroically in the line of duty right he had just finished telling some kid to put the gun down he didnt want to have to kill him and some goddamn junkie shot him with a of all goddamn weapons but heroically right i suppose and he died heroically right at the time when the marine corps told you no thanks you dont measure up to our standards right they found something wrong with my ear matt said all of these things combining in the dr amy payne theory of whats wrong with little brother to compel you to join the police force to prove your manhood that youre a warrior jesus and then you met another man who became your mentor inspector peter wohl another warrior role model okay now being as intelligent as you are you could not have been unaware in amys theory that role model one commissioner coughlin had arranged for a job for you that was not really police work you werent walking around dark streets in a uniform with a gun and a nightstick in other words and you subconsciously understood this to mean that coughlin and wohl role model two didnt think of you as a fellow warrior but rather as sort of a wimp who had to be protected she told you all of this matt asked and then you shot the northwest serial rapist trying to prove that you were indeed a warrior and a man i wasnt trying to prove anything i shot that sonofabitch because he was trying to run me over with a van but still even after this warrior act neither coughlin nor wohl was convinced that you were a warrior the proof of this your subconscious believed came on the memorable day when the real cops the real warriors were about to face down the bad people and they sent you a block away to safety allegedly to protect a journalist i must be crazy im starting to think she may be onto something im not finished shes given this a lot of thought go on and again you risked your life to prove you were a man a warrior when a bad guy appeared in the alley and you faced up to him he was shooting at us what was i supposed to do youre an intelligent young man you should have ducked run away you were driven by the need to prove your masculinity my god and going off at somewhat of a tangent dr payne feels that your interest in so many members of the opposite sex is really a manifestation of your need to prove your manhood carnally and that of course is another proof she feels that you doubt your own manhood and all this time i thought she was my friend she spoke to me as one physician to another give her that much matt this was not idle gossip what else did she have to say you next began to prove your manhood by becoming a detective and then a sergeant in the latter case studying obsessively because it was obsessively so important to you that you do wellpreferably better than anyone else on the examination anything else you told her i think that you were having nightmares about what happened in doylestown and ten seconds after i did i realized it was a mistake you ever have them about the other shootings matt what the hell the cows out of the barn yeah most of them are about doylestown but every once in a while i have one about the guy who tried to run me down in the van and now i suppose ill have them about the guy i just shot outside la famiglia you said the guy in the van the guy i just shot but doylestown i didnt shoot anybody in doylestown matt said the guy we were after shot the girl who took us to him thats all she was to you matt thought that over then shrugged no i thought i was in love with her i had to prove my manhood i guess dr stein grunted amy thinks that your weeping over the girl in doylestown was the first manifestation of your impending uncontrollable psychological problems and she feels the nightmares tend to confirm that theory matt looked at him but didnt reply you then were promoted to sergeant and given your choice of assignment and chose homicide primarily because homicide is considered thene plus ultra of warrior assignments in the police department matt shook his head the warriorsamys termare highway the bomb squadnot homicide he said dr stein shrugged but did not respond directly where you were immediately plunged into things beyond your capacity to deal with he went on and to which you applied all of your best efforts that she believes would have so to speak pushed you over the edge in and of itself but then you became involved in this last incident two nights ago and that finally produced the inevitable result you experienced an emotional meltdown so to speak well i guess shes got my number doesnt she she believes she has correctly assessed the situation and what does my allwise sister think i should do about it thats pretty clear to her too she thinks you should face who you really are and that done take the appropriate action which would be for you to resign from the police force go back to law school and assume a more suitable life for someone with your psychological makeup and you agree right i didnt say that are you interested in what i think yes of course i am i dont want you quoting me to her matt id like your word on that sure your sister is a fine psychiatrist and a fine teacher perhaps for that reason i was terribly disappointed in just about everything she had to say and certainly with her theories they werent at all professionalalthough she is so good that some details were validbut rather the near maternal musings of a loving sister furthermore she should have known that and that you should not even think about treating someone you deeply care for it clouds the judgment in this case spectacularly youre saying shes wrong about everything just about everything she makes a lot of sense to me matt said so what do you think is wrong with me i told you when i first came in here youre like a thoroughbred racehorse you think you have a bottomless pit of energy from which to draw strength physical and emotional and that youre unstoppable you dont and you are ive found out that im stoppable dr stein did she tell you how i came apart matt mimed the rising of his trembling hand and slapping it down in detail including how you wept and allowed yourself to be comforted as she held you like a mother in short superman you showed typical symptoms of emotional exhaustion the treatment is basically rest and the admonition dont push yourself so hard from now on thats all i think you ought to see dr michaels a couple of times he said hed be happy to and you wont be the first cop hes talked to about something like this because you are by no means the first cop something like this has happened to six come in doctor aaron stein said to amy payne we have to discuss the patient in and your relationship with the patient what did keyes michaels have to say amy asked dr michaels and i agree the patient was suffering from understandable emotional exhaustion from which hebeing of sound mind and body so to speakwill recover rapidly with no lasting ill effects well i dont agree with that aaron as his attending physician and after consultation with dr michaels i have decided that further hospitalization is not indicated and i have ordered his release without consulting me that brings us to that doctor stein said i beg your pardon youre matts sister amy not his physician you seem to have forgotten that its unethicalnot to mention stupid for a physician to treat anyone with whom the physician has a familial or other emotional connection it clouds the judgment you know that or at least knew it you seem to have forgotten all right she said after a moment i was wrong sorry have you ever heard the phrase physician heal thyself doctor of course i have would you be interested in my advice in how you can do that doctor id be interested to know what you think it is that needs healing doctor amy said growing angry ill tell you what ill do ill give you the formulation i would recommend and from that if youre half the intelligent dedicated psychiatrist i think you are youll be able to deduce what i think is wrong with you please do doctor marry the cop amy have a baby have several babies she looked at him in genuine shock youre serious arent you he nodded youre a young woman of childbearing age do what nature intended for you to do apply your very healthy very normal maternal instincts to your own child not your brother he paused in my judgment that would make you even a better psychiatrist than you already are she met his eyes but didnt reply the formulation you developed for your brother applies to you youre the overachiever workaholic refusing to believe your well of strength can ever go dry and the first symptom of your inevitableunless you do something about it emotional meltdown has been your delusionary relationship with your brother youre not his mother and youre not his doctor marry the cop have babies he nodded again after a moment he added id like your word doctor that insofar as the patient in is concerned you will from this moment regard yourself as his sister not his physician jesus i will interpret that as meaning of course now take your brother home and see if you can get him to take it easy seven you free denny police commissioner ralph j mariani asked from first deputy commissioner coughlins door of course what do you hear about matt his sister just called theyre about to let him out of the hospital shes going to take him out to his parents place in wallingford that was quick wasnt it they say hes all rightthat he was emotionally exhausted is all they say his sister you mean no he was examined by both our psychiatrist dr michaels you know him sure keyes michaels good man comes from a whole family of cops and dr aaron stein whos the head shrink at up medical center im getting the feeling denny that you dont like between us mariani nodded dr michaels is really proud he took his psychiatrist residency under dr aaron stein i would be very surprised if michaels disagreed with stein about anything even if he did meaning you werent at internal affairs when matty came apart coughlin said i was i wanted to cry i have trouble believing hes all right so soon theyre psychiatrists and youre not denny mariani said coughlin shrugged you asked ralph well it was a good shooting mariani asked he laid a folder on coughlins desk thats mike weisbachs initial report payne did everything by the book one of the victimsthe wife of the guy that got pistolwhipped even wants to apologize for what she said to himwhere the hell were you when we needed youwhen he walked up on it she said she was upset and wants to apologize the only thing that wasnt done by the book was when the dignitary protection lieutenant whats his name mcguire took paynes weapon as evidence oh jesus paynes got a legitimate beef about that he wont say anything coughlin said hes a good cop but youre worried about him right im worried about him he needs a rest a long one that poses a problem if dr michaels has pronounced him fit for duty that means coughlin nodded and finished the sentence hes supposed to come to work tomorrow you dont know if hes got any vacation coming something over four hundred hours i just checked his jacket see that he takes thirty days of that denny make it an order coughlin nodded eight patricia payne held both of her sons arms and looked intently up at him are you all right sweetheart amy says i have to wear the straitjacket only when i leave the property matt said she has it in her truck dont be such an ass matt amy said you heard what dr stein said which was patricia payne asked that what matt and a jackass have in common is that they dont know they have limits and matt reached his all he needs is rest he said thoroughbred racehorse matt said and all he needs is rest patricia payne asked thats it mom amy said really can you get some time off patricia payne asked im sure i can matt said well go tell your father hes pacing back and forth on the patio waiting to know whats up matt walked toward the patio and patricia payne led her daughter into the house where she soughtand got confirmation that all that was wrong with her son was that he had been pushed or had pushed himself beyond his limits and that all he needed was rest matt had just finished telling his father this and was about to tell him that amy had another medical theory that he thought had a lot of merit despite what drs stein and michaels said when deputy commissioner dennis v coughlin trailed by captain frank hollaran came onto the patio coughlin was carrying in his hand what looked like a briefcase but was the size of a womans purse matt wondered what it was i just had a talk with dr keyes michaels the department psychiatrist brewster coughlin said good man comes from a family of cops knows cops says the only thing wrong with matty is exhaustion and all he needs is some rest he turned to matt by order of the commissioner you are now on vacation thirty days great matt said coughlin handed him the pursesize leather briefcase this is yours he said what is it your pistol you forgot it at iad oh yeah matt said thank you he laid the purselike thing on the fieldstone wall of the patio matt brewster payne said why dont you go inside and get us something to drink as soon as matt was out of earshot brewster c payne soughtand gotconfirmation from dennis v coughlin that all that was wrong was that matt was emotionally and physically exhausted and all that he needed was rest as matt rolled the bar cart across the fieldstones of the patio armando c giacomo esq arrived he was now his normal sartorially elegant self brewster i realize im barging in nonsense manny you dont need an invitation here actually i came to see my client giacomo said how are you doing matt im fine i have been informed unofficially of course but reliably by both the cops and the das office that nothing you did in the la famiglia parking lot in any way violated any law of the commonwealth of pennsylvania in legal terminology it was a righteous shooting matt and youre off the hook manny we appreciate how quickly brewster c payne began giacomo waved his hand to signal thanks were unnecessary but you will have a taste manny right i thought you would never ask next to arrive were lieutenant jason washington and detective joe damata as matt was pouring their drinks the telephone in the niche in the fieldstone wall rang and brewster c payne answered it it was mr stan colt calling from the coast the monsignor had called him mr colt said and said hed heard that matt was a little under the weather and could i talk to him if hes up to it sergeant payne assured mr colt that he was fine that he had just been a little exhausted and that he would make a real effort to go out to the coast and soon inspector peter wohl appeared next he was intercepted by mrs patricia payne and dr amelia payne as he walked up the now carclogged drive toward the house amy told me what you did for matt the night it happened patricia payne said and i just wanted to say thank you absolutely unnecessary wohl replied i was just glad i was there i think of matti think of all of youas family and we do too peter patricia payne said emotionally dont we amy yeah amy said looking intently at him i guess we all really do her tone was strange and peter looked at her with a raised eyebrow and as if he was about to say something but then he saw something else and smiled instead look whos here he said mutt and jeff detectives charles mcfadden and jesus martinez got out of their unmarked special operations crown victoria and started up the drive they stopped and looked uncomfortable when they saw wohl sir mcfadden said biting the bullet captain sabara said it would be all right if we took the rest of the day off we just took the truck to the impound lotand came out here and saw how sergeant payne was doing wohl nodded hows he doing mcfadden asked he was exhausted really exhausted amy said but hes fine and hell be glad to see you detective martinez unrolled the newspaper he had in his hand and extended it to dr payne my mother saved this for mecharley and me was driving up from alabama when this happened he said i didnt know if pa sergeant payne had seen them or not it was thephiladelphia bulletin with a threecolumn picture of sergeant matthew m payne in a dinner jacket standing pistol in hand over a man on the ground with an effort mrs payne smiled and said no i dont think he has it was very kind of you detective to think of bringing this an hourand several bottles of spiritslater everybody had gone and matt and brewster payne found themselves again alone on the patio well i dont know if that was the rest aaron stein prescribed for you but i dont see how it could have been avoided and in the long run i think it was good for you brewster c payne said im all right dad what are you going to do for thirty days given it any thought aside from getting the porsche fixed its in the impound lot peter told me youre going to have it repaired i dont know there was a lot of damage you have time to decide i may get another car something less ostentatious suitable for a starving law student brewster payne looked at him for a long moment without saying anything when did you decide that he asked finally in the hospital matt said may i comment i sort of expected finally thank god hes come to his senses brewster c payne chuckled then said i would be delighted if thats what you finally decide to do matt but i suggest to you that thats a very important decision to make and important decisions should not he made impulsively okay why dont you go to the cape may house and takefinal tort out of sight of shore and watch the waves go up and down for a couple of days that always helps me to think when i really need to matt thought that over for a moment then nodded youre probably right you usually are but i really think my days as the wyatt earp of the main line are over twentytwo one the theory that usingfinal tort v the payne fiftyeightfoot hatteras as a platform from which as he watched the waves go up and down matt could do some really serious thinkingand his father hoped incidentally get some rest would be an excellent idea did not work out well in practice largely because of her captain her captain retired coast guard chief petty officer al bowman who had been with the paynes since matt was ten when the family boat wasfinal tort ii a much smaller hatteras was on vacation matt had learned smallboat handling from chief bowman and took not a little pride in knowing he had met chief bowmans criteria in that area usually when they went out onfinal tort v together the chief would come to the bridge only to hand matt another beer standing in for him in his absence was another much younger retired coast guard chief petty officer who was visibly nervous when matt went to the control console fired up the engines and asked him to let loose the lines with the obvious intent of taking the vessel to sea with himself at the helm even when matt managed to get thefinal tort v away from the wharf and into the wide atlantic without running her aground the standin captain never got far from matt or the controls what was worse however was that the replacement captain had seen in thebulletin both the photograph of matt getting off the citation with homer c daniels and the photograph of matt pistol in hand in the parking lot near la famiglia and naturally presumed matt would be delighted to tell him all about the murdering rapist exchanging gunfire with a couple of armed robbers and what it was really like to be a reallife stan colt and incidentally whats stan colt really like compounding the problem was that the replacement captain was a really nice guy the sort of man to whom one could not say i wish youd shut the fuck up although that thought did run more than once through matts mind and finally if there were fish in the atlantic none of them showed any interest whatever in the bait supposed to tempt them to any of the four lines matt put in the water at pm matt said i think wed might as well call it a day you want to take her in the replacement captain had been obviously pleased with the request for his professional services matt sitting in a fishing chair with his feet on the stern rail watching the churning water had time for two beers and some private thoughts before he saw that they were nearly at the dock and he would have to go forward and handle the lines he had reached no profound conclusions except that he didnt want to do this again tomorrow when he went forward he saw a familiar vehicle a buick rendezvous with an antennae farm on its roof sitting beside the house michael j ohara himself was sprawled in a lawn chaise on the wharf drinking from the neck of a beer bottle the chair was from the deck of the house there was a portable cooler beside mickey that hed obviously brought with him he waved but rose from the chair only when matt called hey mickey want to grab the line on the third try he managed to do so whereupon he inquired what am i supposed to do with it matt resisted the temptation to tell him the first thing that came to his mind and instead said wrap it twice around that pole and then hang on to it when he saw that mickey had done so he went aft to handle the stern lines i wonder what hes doing here who cares i really am glad to see him you didnt answer your phone mickey said by way of greeting i was about to call the cops on the water you call the coast guard not the cops matt said write that down so why didnt you answer the phone i didnt have it turned on for one thing matt said helping himself to a beer from the cooler and for another i was probably out of range youre not supposed to be ohara said well sorry my profound apologies i meant of this mickey said and patted his shirt pocket which held what looked to matt like a bulky cellular telephone they advertise worldwide service they use satellites then i guess i didnt have my phone turned on i guess not mickey said it occurred to matt that unless they got off the wharf before the reserve captain got offfinal tort v he would probably be joining them for whatever happened next which included a couple of beers for sure and then probably dinner worse that he would probably recognize mickeys name and start asking questions about what it was like being a famous journalist and even worse than that mickey would delight in telling him all i had for lunch was a ham and cheese sandwich matt said lets go get something to eat steamed clams mickey announced i didnt have any lunch at all and steamed clams seems like a splendid idea he picked up the portable cooler and started down the wharf are we going out tomorrow the reserve captain called down from thefinal tort v ill call you matt said in the rendezvous mickey asked you okay matty im fine i heard you came apart for a while i came apart for a while but im fine now mickey handed him his cellular telephone call denny coughlin and tell him hes worried about you he sent you down here to keep me company he told me how to get here ohara said you have to dial zero zero one first zero zero one first thats the united states ohara explained i thought thats where we were thats a worldwide telephone you have to dial the country code first call denny for christs sake matt punched in the numbers including the zero zero one country code then the philadelphia area code and then commissioner coughlins number and was finally connected with him he told him that he was fine thank you that mickey had found him that they were in his car en route to get some steamed clams and that he felt fine thank you nothing has changed in the thirty seconds since you asked me that the first time is mickey going to be in the way matty he really wanted to see you i thought maybe youd like some company so i told him where to find you im glad you did thank you well have a couple of beers but get some rest and give me a call every once in a while okay ill do it matt said and pushed the off button they sat at the bar of the ocean vue bar amp grill and viewed the ocean while eating two dozen steamers and drinking two heinekens each aside from hand me the tabasco please there was not much conversation matt pushed the second tin tray of empty mollusk shells away from him finished his beer signaled for another round and then asked can i ask you a personal question mick shoot have you ever been out of the country no why should i have been then whats with the worldwide dial zero zero one as the country code telephone all about im thinking of going to europe mickey said really what for actually matty thats one of the reasons i came all the way over here the other was to apologize for not coming to see you after doc michaels told me that he let you out of the loony bin i was busy you have been discussing my mental condition with dr michaels i gather he said medical ethics prohibited his discussing your case with me but apropos of nothing whatever there was nothing wrong with you that a little rest wouldnt fix hes a good guy and he suggested you come to see me no mickey said his tone suggesting that even the question surprised him what happened was after i heard that youd been in and out of the loony bin i called your mother and she gave me the runaround about where you were so i called your father ditto and i began to have visions of you in a rubber room somewhere so i went and saw doc michaels and he told me what i told you he told me so i called denny and asked him where you were and he told me so i came tell me about europe i told you i was busy what it was was that i was involved in a contractual dispute with my employers about what i knocked my city editor on his ass mickey said with a bloody nose why it was a matter of journalistic principle mickey said the lawyers for thebulletin said it was justification for my termination unless i apologized to the sonofabitch which i will do the morning after the pope gives birth to triplets so where does the matter stand now matt said smiling casimir responded that in this era of political correctness it is not professionally acceptable behavior for a supervisor before a room full of his fellow employees to call an underling you insane shanty irish sonofabitch he actually called you that matt asked on the edge of laughter mickey nodded smiling and went on obviously quoting bolinski verbatim and to threaten a distinguished pulitzer prizewinning journalist such as mr ohara before the same gathering of his peers with using his influence to ensure that mr ohara would never find employment again even with thenational enquirer a periodical generally held in contempt by responsible journalists he did that as blood dripped down his chin from his bloody nose onto his shirt mickey said what set you two off matt asked thats not important the sonofabitch has never liked me and vice versa it just happened so whats going to happen we have entered a thirtyday coolingoff period during which they hope that i will change my mind about apologizingthey know i wontand the bull hopes kennedy will make a full and public apology for his reprehensible remarks and behavior to mewhich he just might during this period i have withdrawn my professional services from thebulletin i still get paid of course so what can we two rejects of society as we know it do for the next thirty days matt asked thats what i came to talk to you about mickey said whiskey and wild wild women you want to go to atlantic city what about vegas casimir has this nutty ideahas had it for yearsthat i should write a book you told me about that mick and i told you it doesnt sound nutty to me at all the original idea was a collection of stuff that ive done matt and i even started putting stuff together for that i know but what casimir did now was call some publisher and tell him that what they really needed was a book about fort festung and i was just the guy to write it why him casimir said the frogs cant stall much longerhe looked into it i supposeand theyre going to extradite the slimy sonofabitch i agree with the bull matt said if they send festung back itd be national news thatd sell a lot of books and you are just the guy to write it yeah well anyway they threw a lot of money at me which i dont have to give back by the way even if i dont write the book or they dont like itand im going to france to have a look at him hence the worldwide telephone yeah my mother goes bananas in the nursing home unless i call her once a day i think its nine dollars a minute or something when you use it but what the hell the more i think about this its a great idea matt said come with me ohara said what come with me what else have you got to do wow matt said that came out of left field youve been there right you even speak a little frog very little matt said ouvrez la porte de mon oncle that means open the door of my uncle if youre taking notes thats more than i speak come on matt everything on me of course matt didnt reply i already know all i have to know about the sonofabitch so all i have to do is take a quick look at this farmhouse maybe get a couple of pictures of it him and his wife then we can go to paris or wherever drink a lot of wine and cherchez la femme mick if i didnt think this was be nice to poor loony matt time i actually think id go with you i want you to go because i dont want to go by myself okay ohara said jesus he means that mr front page himself the battling brawler of the city room is afraid to leave philadelphia by himself what the hell why not what else have i got to do what the hell mick why not matt said mickey took out the cellular pushed one button and then put the instrument to his ear what happened to the zero zero one routine matt asked the bulls got one of these too they store a hundred numbers of other people with one of them mickey explained then held up his hand to cut matt off antoinette this is michael would it be possible for me to speak with casimir please it took several minutes for mr bolinski to get on the line he explained he was floating around the pool matt says hell go casimir ohara said set it up bolinski said something matt couldnt hear you got a passport is tomorrow night too soon for you mickey asked yes and no matt said thats fine with matt casimir set it up bolinski said something else matt couldnt hear hes fine he was exhausted is all mickey broke the connection after bolinski said something else the bull says hes glad to hear youre okay thats nice of him mickey pushed another button on his worldwide telephone and put it to his ear hi mom he began how you doing he spoke with his mother for five minutes then handed the cellular to matt you want to call your mom not particularly shes your mother for christs sake call her matt called his mother and told her that he was fine thank you and that he was going to paris tomorrow night with mickey ohara two when air france flight deposited them at charles de gaulle international airport in paris the second morning later french customs showed great interest in mr oharas brandnew luggagea lastminute purchase after matt suggested that if they were going to be gone a couple of weeks mickey would need more space than his zipper bag with the philadelphia ers logotype would provideand went through it suspiciously before gesturing they could pass outside customs a man in a chauffeurs cap was waiting for them holding a sign lettered m ohara he drove them in a new mercedes to the george v hotel where they were installed in a twobedroom twobath sitting room suite on a corner of the building from two windows in the sitting room if they looked carefully they could see the champs elysees a block away they unpacked their luggage and then walked over to the champs elysees took a quick look at the arc de triomphe at the other end and went in search of breakfast then they went to the us embassy at the foot of the hill whereafter mickey threatened him with calling pennsylvanias junior senator right then and on his worldwide telephonethe press officer somewhat reluctantly promised to be prepared to give him the latest developments visavis the extradition of isaac festung once a day when mickey called as they left the embassy matt said they were within walking distance of two famous paris landmarks the louvre museum and harrys new york bar lets take a quick look at the museum mickey said just so we can say we saw it and then well go to the bar and hoist a few they went into the museum a few minutes before eleven and left a few minutes more than eight hours later when at closing time three museum guardsimmune to mickeys argument that he was the press for christs sake and entitled to a little considerationescorted them out he immediately announced to matt that they were going to have to come back tomorrow i could spend all goddamn day in there just looking at venus de milo mickey said they called their respective maternal parents while sitting at the bar in harrys when matt told his mother they had spent most of the day in the louvre and had only minutes before arrived at harrys bar she chuckled knowingly have a good time sweetheart she said but get some rest when they left harrys four beers and an hour later and were walking toward the opera where matt remembered a restaurant his father particularly liked mickey offered a philosophicalhistoricalliterary observation did you know thats the joint where hemingway used to hang out he asked i heard did you know that before he became a writer he was a newspaperman i heard that too i dont mean some schmuck on a smalltown rag he worked for theheraldtribune here mickey said he gave a speech one time where he said he thought working on a newspaper was the best training he ever had to become a writer i didnt know that but im sure he was right matt said yeah mickey said thoughtfully he probably was am i in the company of the next tom clancy the next whatshisname the guy who made millions writing about dinosaurs when do you want to go to cognacboeuf mick whats that thats where festung is soon but not right away i told you i want to go back to the louvre you cant see half what they have in that place in one day for christs sake over the next five days they developed a routine on waking while matt ordered their roomservice breakfast and while waiting for it to be delivered mickey first got on the phone to the embassys press officer then would get on the internet with matts laptop go to thebulletins web site and catch up on what was happening in philadelphia after breakfast they took a cab to the louvre matt thus got to see more of the museum than hed seen in his previous more than a dozenvisits to the city of lights once they went out of the museum to lunch but that took too much time for mickey so the other days they had eaten lunch standing up at a museum concession he did manage to get mickey briefly to the top of the eiffel towerto which mickeys reaction was whats the big deal and are you sure its safe its rusty all over and to napoleons tomb but that was about all they called their respective maternal parents daily usually from harrys new york bar after the louvre closed and then they went to dinner and after that twice to jazz places on the east bank matt realized that he was having a good time largely because mickey was what his father described as a good traveling companion on the morning of the sixth day mickey called hey you better take a look at this matt munching a croissant walked to where mickey was at his laptop the screen showed the front page of thebulletin and for a moment matt didnt understand what he was being shown and then in the inside todays bulletin box he saw police arrest two in fastfood restaurant murder page section there wasnt much of a story there even though it had a double byline on it two arrested in fastfood double murder by richard higbee and bettyjo wolff bulletin staff writers philadelphiapolice commissioner ralph j mariani announced the arrest early this morning without incident of lawrence john porter and ralph david williams at their homes in the paschall homes project the two who are cousins have been charged with the double murder of ms maria m fernandez and police officer kenneth j charlton during a robbery of the roy rogers restaurant at south broad and snyder streets earlier this month weve had the two under roundtheclock surveillance for some time commissioner mariani said but delayed arresting them while assembling irrefutable evidence against them mariani said that evidence included the murder weapon acaliber handgun which police divers assisted by the philadelphia treasure hunters club recovered later yesterday from the silt banks of the schuylkill river where it had been thrown mariani cited the involvement of the treasure hunters who joined the police in searching the murky waters of the schuylkill as another example for which i am grateful and proud of civilian cooperation with the police philadelphia mayor alvin w martin in a separate statement said that all philadelphians can and should take pride in the professionalism and dedication of the officers of the special operations division task force which i ordered formed in apprehending these individuals under extremely difficult circumstances jesus what a shitty story ohara said and it took two of them to write it theres not much is there matt said for all the effort that went into that job on the other hand ohara said more charitably it might have been my pal kennedys editing i know the broad shes got talent ohara looked thoughtful for a minute and judging by the look on his face matt was not very surprised at what came next matty unless you really want to go back to the louvre youve been there before a lot right yeah i have how would you feel about making arrangements to getting us to where i forget where you said cognacboeuf matt furnished right where this sleazeball fort festung is sure mick good idea we better rent a car i dont know if we can find one to rent down there see if you can get us a lincoln or a cadillac these frog cars look tiny to me what id really like to have is my rendezvous three the concierge in the lobby of the george v said it would be impossible to provide either a cadillac or a lincolnmuch less a porsche or a buick rendezvousand he would therefore recommend a mercedes unless msieu would like a jaguar tell me about a jaguar matt said he put the jaguar rental on his american express card because every time hed tried to pick up a bill ohara had been adamant that the whole trip was on him put your goddamn money away hed say signing the receipt triggered the memory of what detective olivia lassiter had said to him in alabama about his not even looking at the bill there before he signed it and his first reaction wasscrew her but she stayed in his mind all day and about sixthirty as he sat in the hotel bar in the vain hope that mickey would leave the louvre before they threw him out he remembered that mickey had left his worldwide telephone in the suite and after one more drink he went to the suite dialed zero zero one and after some difficulty was connected with the northwest detectives division of the philadelphia police department detective lassiter please whos calling sergeant payne hello matt how are you im fine i heard im fine olivia thank you for asking i was about to send you one of those having lovely time in gay paree wish you were here postcards but i figured what the hell id call you matt im working can i call you later i dont think that would be a very good idea olivia said and hung up the next morning at ten matthew m payne and michael j ohara both more than a little hungover watched their luggage being loaded into a powder blue jaguar xk cabriolet then they got in and with matt at the wheel drove across avenue george v onto rue pierre charron then turned right onto the champs elysees and headed for french national highway a they stopped for lunch in orleans then drove on this time with mickey at the wheel at seventhirty by which time it was already too dark to take pictures they pulled into the cobblestoned forecourt of le relais in the village of cognacboeuf it looks matt said as if its been here for centuries it looks like a dump mickey said is this the best we can do this is it unless you want to go back to bordeaux mickey wordlessly turned the engine off and got out of the car the only accommodation available was one room it had two single beds and a washbasin the bath and water closet were in separate rooms down a narrow corridor and ill bet you snore too dont you mr ohara inquired their dinnerroast lamb was very good and so was the wine at nine oclock they retired to their room i want to get up early find their house and take a couple of shots mickey announced then hang around for a while to see if i can get a couple of shots of festung and then get the hell out of here they called their respective maternal parents turned off the worldwide telephone because the battery was running low and then got into bed you know what elsebesides forgetting to charge the phone in the caryou made me do when you decided to drink everything in paris last night mr ohara inquired across the dark room i can hardly wait to hear i didnt call that jackass in the embassy you can call the jackass in the embassy in the morning matt said they were both asleep by half past nine four when it is half past nine in cognacboeuf france it is half past three in philadelphia pennsylvania at pm dianna kerrgally executive assistant to the honorable alvin w martin stepped to the mayors door and coughed whats up he inquired ive got eileen solomon on the line dianna said put her through he said she wants to know if there is any reason you cant see her right now see me as opposed to talk to me dianna nodded did she say what she wants dianna shook her head no he shrugged you think i should talk to her i think you should tell me if theres some reason you cant see her right now tell our distinguished district attorney that my door is always open to her the mayor ordered and stall whatevers on the schedule until she shows up the honoable eileen mcnamara solomon trailed by detective al unger appeared ten minutes later in the mayors outer office and was immediately shown into the inner office by dianna kerrgally who stood just inside the door this is between the mayor and me eileen solomon said do you mind mrs kerrgally smiled somewhat thinly and left the office our da is really pissed off about something i wonder what and what does it have to do with me you seem a little upset eileen the mayor said little is an understatement and upset a euphemism she said well lets see what we can do to make things right the mayor said whats happened i had a call just now from walter davis eileen began he told me he was really delighted to be able to tell me that isaac festung would soon be returned to philadelphia well thats certainly good news after all this time specifically that he was reliably informed by the legal attache of our embassy in paris you do know dont you alvin that for reasons i never really understood they call fbi agents assigned to embassies legal attaches no i cant say that i did martin confessed rephrasingthe fbi agent at our embassy has told davis that the french court is about to extradite isaac festung and for some reason i dont understand youre annoyed about that davis said that as soon as the french court orders his extradition the legal attacheread fbi agentsthere will take custody of his person and then they and us marshals will escort him home youre going to have to explain to me im afraid whats wrong with that when i was on the bench alvin after festung jumped bail i spent a lot of effortand a lot of taxpayers money trying to find him after he was convicted inmy court of murder in the second andsurprising me not at allthe fbi had not been able to find him much less bring him back here and lock him up i spent even more effort and taxpayer money trying to find him and bring him back here and the fbi was not very useful in this i gather what they did alvin was notify interpol hey fellas the local cops here are looking for this guy if you stumble over him give us a call huh mayor martin was tempted to smile but wise enough to know that this was not the time to do so and since i became da the da went on my people my fugitive guy and othershave spent a fortune running this sonofabitch down all over europewe found out from the french cops that he waswherever the hell he is in some village in the south of franceand when interpol and the fbi did nothing to get him back i sent two assistant das over thereat the taxpayers expenseto light a fire under them i see alvin w martin said although he really didnt the only thing he knew for sure was that he had never seen the honorable eileen mcnamara solomon so angry before and from which he drew the conclusion that one could anger mrs solomon only at great peril i have no intention of standing there smiling in gratitude when the fbi or the marshals take him off the plane eileen mcnamara solomon declared i understand how you feel eileen he said i want a philadelphia cops handcuffs on him she said i want a philadelphia cop to bring him back i can understand that the mayor said those bastards try this sort of thing all the time they even showed up in alabama trying to steal jason washingtons pinch of homer c daniels i didnt know that the mayor said truthfully is that what its called stealing a pinch that sounds like something that would happen at a high school junior prom it was evident on district attorney solomons face that she did not share mayor martins sense of humor well what can we do about this you and i eileen to make things right what you can do alvin is call ralph mariani and tell him to get a coppreferably one from homicideover to france before the fbi gets away with this is there going to be time to do that there will have to be eileen mcnamara solomon declared five homicide lieutenant washington mariani washington is quaire there no sir he is not come up here please jason right now after he had explained the situation to lieutenant washington commissioner mariani was surprised and a little annoyed at the amused look on washingtons face this is not funny lieutenant we better be able to do something and do it right now as it happens commissioner there does happen to be a man from homicide in france right now how did that happen sergeant paynetwo days ago anywaywas in paris sir i ordered him to take thirty days vacation time yes sir thats what hes doing he and mr ohara sergeant payne told his mother and she told me that mr ohara is quite taken with the artistic treasures of the louvre the commissioner waited for him to go on there is a rumor circulating sir that mr ohara and mr kennedy the city editor of thebulletin i know who he is mariani interjected impatiently exchanged blows in the city room of the newspaper no kidding and that mr ohara is on a thirtyday sabbatical from his duties according to my informationagain via sergeant paynes mothermr ohara is thinking of writing a book about festung anyway sir the two of them are in france how do we get in touch with them they areor werein the george

a persontoperson call to either sergeant matthew payne or mr michael ohara in the george the fifth hotel in paris france he ordered ten minutes later commissioner mariani was informed that both mr ohara and mr payne had checked out of the hotel that morning and left no forwarding address i knew that was too good to be true mariani said what about this aroundtheworld telephone of oharas can you get the number im sure that wont be a problem sir well get it get them on it tell them to call me yes sir and you better see who else has a passport do you its being renewed sir get somebody else started in case we cant get through to payne hell they may be on their way home a half hour later lieutenant washington telephoned commissioner mariani to report that he was having trouble getting oharas number but he was working on it and hoped to have it shortly he also reported that they had made reservations for someone to fly to paris it had yet to be determined who would go but there would be plenty of time to make the decision the next available seat to paris was on a flight leaving new york tomorrow afternoon when he added that only firstclass seats were available he anticipated the commissioners next question it would appear were in the tourist season sir washington concluded in that case i would suggest that you make every effort to get oharas phone number commissioner mariani said keep me advised lieutenant im about to tell the mayor we are making every effort to comply with his wishes yes sir two hours after that lieutenant washington called the commissioner again sir i have the number i had to get it from mr casimir bolinski but when i call it the recording says that its been turned off probably overnight sir ill try again in the morning no commissioner mariani said you or some one you delegate will try that number every thirty minutes until someone answers yes sir six mr michael j ohara rose at first light and without disturbing sergeant payne went down the narrow corridor to the communal bath took one look at it and decided he would just have to remain unwashed until they found a decent hotel thenwith less trouble than he expected to havehe got directions in the form of a handdrawn map to the piaf mill and got in the jaguar and drove there he had a little trouble getting the shots he wanted there were half a dozen french gendarmes guarding the place and when they spotted him they tried to run him off but he finally got what he wanted and even a shot of isaac fort festung standing in the doorway of the ancient mill house then he drove back to le relais with a sense of mission accomplished he had all he needed hed wake matty up theyd get some breakfast and then sayonara cognacboeuf or whatever the hell this place is called he had already stopped the jaguar when he remembered he had forgotten to take the telephone with him he had planned to see how much of a charge it would take plugged into the jaguars cigarette lighter hole he went to their room turned the light on woke matty and told him to get his ass out of bed as soon as they had breakfast they were out of here and took the telephone downthe battery of which was now really dead he having apparently failed to turn it off correctly the night beforeto the jaguar the clever englishmen had designed the interior to frustrate him it took him almost five minutes to find the cigarette lighter hole it was in the ashtray mounted in such a position that it couldnt he seen by the driver unless he bent nearly flat and looked around the gearshift lever matt was just coming into the combined bar and dining room of le relais when mickey finally went in mickey explained that he had had difficulty finding the cigarette lighter holder but that he had finally succeeded and the phone was now being charged maybe not mick matt said sometimes the lighter hole is hot only when the ignition is on shit mickey went back out to the jaguar and immediately discovered that matt had been in error the cigarette lighter hole was hot even with the ignition off the proof was that the once deadasadoornail device was chirping mickey wondered what the hell casimirthe only person who had the numberwanted this time of night it was eightfifteen here which meant that it was am in the states whats up casimir that you mickey yeah whos this jason washington what the hell do you want is matt somewhere around and how is he hes fine were about to have breakfast can i give him a message cant you just give him the phone mick i dont think the battery will last that long mick said this is important nothing wrong with anybody its important mick nothings wrong with anyone hang on ill get him this afternoon huh mickey asked after matt returned from the jaguar and reported the gist of his conversations with lieutenant washington and a somewhat sleepysounding commissioner ralph j mariani its a sure thing so says mariani he says eileen solomon told him she talked to the embassy that bastard in the embassy never said a goddamn word to me possibly because you forgot to call him screw you matty did they say where the palais de justice in bordeaux well we better drive over there after we finish breakfast ohara said actually matt said thoughtfully it makes a pretty good last act the fat lady sings the last act of the wyatt earp of the main line im quitting the job mickey youre not going to bring that crap up again are you again you had a couple of drinkseight or tentoo many the other night pal after you had your little chat with the lady detective and i told you you were somewhat loquacious matty you would never love again and you were quitting the jobad infinitum i dont remember that and thus you dont remember what i told you no i said you were probably lucky detective whatsername dumped youi never liked her shes one of those dames whos never satisfiedand as full of shit as a christmas turkey about quitting the job you could no more do anything else than i could become a ballet dancer youre a cop matty a good one its in your blood the conversation was interrupted by the entrance into the combined bar and dining room of le relais of mr isaac festung he was accompanied by two gendarmes he was wearing what looked like a dirty white poncho and baggy blue cotton trousers and was barefoot in leather sandals he looked around the room and spotted mickey he walked to the table you were at my home this morning he challenged taking pictures yes i was morbid interest or journalistic or is there a difference im a reporter if thats what you mean ohara said well im sorry to tell you that im not granting any interviews right now thats good because im not asking for one then what are you doing here i just rode down here with him ohara said nodding at matt festung turned his attention to matt youre a reporter no im not mr festung matt said im a police officer im here to take you into custody when the court of appeals denies your appeal well then im afraid youve wasted your time too my young friend thats not going to happen well know for sure about that this afternoon in bordeaux wont we and im not your young friend mr festung im sergeant matthew payne badge homicide unit philadelphia police department festung met matts eyes for a long moment and when matt didnt blink apparently lost his appetite for breakfast for he suddenly spun around on his heels and stalked out of le relais with the two gendarmes on his heels that felt good admit it mickey said i dont know about good mick but it felt right lets get the hell out of here mickey said and they left police officers killed in the line of duty are placed in their caskets in full uniform including their weapon the weapon badge and frontispiece are all removed just before the casket is
