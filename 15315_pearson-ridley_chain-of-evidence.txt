ridley pearson chain of evidence prologue he heard her coming before she reached the top of the stairs wild and angry like someone possessed the rage welling up within her from an addiction so powerful that two weeks earlier he had discovered her passed out with a bottle of rubbing alcohol still clutched in her spotted hand she roared at him as she dared to negotiate the stairs suddenly a twohundredpound ballerina one hand counseling the banister one eye held shut to stop the dizzies you bring it to me boy that was her name for him boythe only name she had ever called him they both knew what it was the boy got it from the neighborhood liquor store every dayor the days that she had the money to buy it the old man with the white stubble beard handed him the brown bag out back in the alley and the boy carried it home dutifully to him it was poison to her heaven she hadnt had the money today but she would have forgotten that by now and she would have convinced herself that he was holding out on her and when she became convinced of that then the world became a frightful place for the boy she possessed big powerful hands like paddles and the stern will of a selfappointed tyrant she knew nothing of forgiveness he lied about the bruises in school made things up the school nurse had given up asking questions hearing his inventive tales people knew about his mother this town nestled in the connecticut countryside was a tolerant place he heard her swollen feet ticking off the eleven stairs how many times had he counted down along with her descent he shuddered would his reminders his arguments be enough today and why did his feet always fail to run when she approached why did he stand there facing her awaiting her as if some magnet drew them together he knew that his survival depended on her not seeing him not getting that hold on him he knew that he had to hide he stood frozen in place he could tell what she was wearing just by the swooshing sound of the fabric the hawaiian colored housedress worn like a giant zippered tent about her puffy white skin with its bright red blotches and unexplained blackandblue marks whoosh she descended she cleared the bottom step and faced with the choice of two directions to go somehow attached to his scent and headed toward himshe a person who couldnt smell burnt toast placed before her that was all she had eaten for the past three months one slice of toast that he left by her bedside in the morning before he headed to school she awakened closer to noon and then drank well past midnight her television turned up too loudly her glassy eyes fixed to it like the eyes on some of the boys stuffed animals dead eyes even when she was trying to slur through her words at him dead for years but not dead enough he thought as she charged through the kitchen door flinging it open with a bone crunching effort he passed through the laundry room door backing upalways backing up he couldnt seem to run forward when she pursued him he allowed her to control him the cry of the hinges gave him away a trickle of sweat slid coldly down his ribs and his throat went dry when he ran from her she hit him harder out through the laundry room window the suns fading rays muted by a stranglehold of clouds washed the horizon charcoal gray a pair of geese their necks stretched like arrows cut north over the hardwood forest where the boy had a clumsy fort built high into a tree in the summer he could hide in the fort but this was not summer and he was running out of places to hideshe knew them all and here he was in the laundry room a dead end worse a huge pile of dirty clothes erupted from the plastic laundry basket and despite the fact that he was in the midst of doing the laundryas if she didnt already have enough to be mad aboutsight of this dirty pile was likely to add to the punishment he reached for the bleach because it occurred to him he might throw it into her face and blind her though he didnt have the heart to do so and besides he discovered the clorox bottle was bone dry empty he stared down the into the neck wishing that by some miracle it would suddenly fill and save him from her wrath he glanced around at a room that offered only a back door into the cold and if he went out there she would lock him out and if she locked him out and anyone found out then they would take her away from himthis had been threatened more than once and that in turn would mean living with his uncle and if the boy had it right the uncle was a drug dealer and small time hooditalian and proud of it he went to church twice a week the boy wanted none of that on the other side of the door he heard his mothers footsteps crunch across crumbs on the kitchen floor as she drew closer sometimes she forgot all about him a few minutes into the pursuit not today he realized the bell to the dryer soundedding and it called magically to him the dryer why not he wondered without a second thought he popped open the door and with her footfalls approaching frantically gathered the clean clothes and stuffed them into the blue plastic basket with the purple fourleaf clovers he slid one leg inside the machine but burned his hand on touching the tumblers grayspeckled rim he debated taking whatever it was she had in store for him deciding instantly that any burn was better than that he pulled himself into a ball his knees tucked into his chest in a fetal position his lungs beginning to sear from the dry metallic heat he hooked his fingers onto the filters gray plastic tab mounted into the door and eased it quietly shut click he winced even in a fit of rage she had the ears of a mountain lion he had inherited those same ears or perhaps it was something that he had developed but whatever the case he heard her push the laundry rooms springed door open heard it flap shut again behind her like the wing of a huge bird he could picture her then as clearly as if he were standing in the room with her her soft spongy body slouched and immobile her dazed head swiveling like an owls scanning the room dully attempting to reason but too drunk to do so his disappearance would confuse herpiss her off if he was lucky she would begin to doubt herself she would forget how it was that she had found her way into the laundry room like a sleepwalker coming out of a trance whoosh the sound of her as she patrolled past the dryer her movements heavy and exaggerated his heart drummed painfully in his chest his lungs stung from the heat whoosh her dress passed by again he grabbed hold of the door in an effort to keep it shut should she try to open it if he frustrated her she might give up a tickle developed in his lungs stinging and itching at the same time it grew inside his chest scratching the insides of his lungs and gnawing a hole into the back of his throat where are you boy she called out hoarsely the phlegm bubbling up from the caldron he swallowed the scratching awayattempting to gulp on a throat bare with searing heatrefusing himself to cough and reveal his hiding place his chest flamed and his nostrils flared and he thought he might explode his lungs if he didnt cough boy she thundered only a few precarious feet away from him tears ran down his cheek he exhaled in a long controlled effort that denied his body any right to a cough and when he drew air in again it attacked his throat as if he had swallowed burning oil but this pain was so small compared to what she might inflict that he gladly accepted it even allowing a selfsatisfied smile to overcome him in the darkness he was indeed the clever devil that she often accused him of being and as he heard her storm back out of the room off to another area of the house where she would threaten her terror until blacking out in a chair or on the sofa or even on the floor he debated where and how he might steal some money in order to placate her and buy himself another night of survival chapter another one he wondered the sense of dread as great as anything he had ever experienced on his way back from his only trip to the beach all summer detective joe dartelli heard the call come over the radio and sat through the better part of a green light before someone had the good sense to honk and awaken him from his moment of dread the code was for a suicidenot that the codes did any good the local press monitored these frequencies like sucker fish clinging to the belly of the shark and they knew every code could interpret even the slightest inflectionbut it was the added word flier that caught dartellis attention a jumper another one by the time he reached the front of the downtown hartford granada the patrol personnel had already run the familiar tape around the crime scene holding a few morbid curious at bay and two impatient news crews they were lucky at eleventhirty at night the downtown core was virtually deserted the insurance executive set stayed out of the city at night unless there was a function better the late news had already ended making this tomorrows news dartelli spotted an unmarked ford taurus cruiser clumsily parked near the front and a black step van that dartelli recognized immediately as teddy braggs evidence collection van stenciled across its back doors were the words hartford police department forensic sciences division calling braggs detail a division was a bit of a stretch given that it consisted of only two people but maybe that made the public feel better about their tax dollars dartelli doubleparked the eightyearold red volvo wagon and left the emergency flashers going and flipped around the visor with the paperwork that identified the car as one belonging to an hpd detective so that it wouldnt be cited or towed he climbed out of the airconditioned comfort into a soup of nearly unbearable heat and wicked humidity he wore a pair of blue madras bermuda shorts loafers with no socks and a white golf shirt from scottys landing a fish and chips joint in coconut grove florida the souvenir of a vacation long in the past the patrolman at the door didnt recognize him and tried to shoo him away before dartellis police id gained him passage good evening sir the patrolman said apologetically joe dartelli nodded though there was nothing good about it at all an africanamerican spread out on the sidewalk the media closing in he clipped his id to the collar of the shirt whos on it dartelli asked kowalski the patrolman answered the detective nodded again figures he thought when shit went bad it rarely hesitated to go all the way fifth floor the patrolman informed him he heard an ambulances approaching siren climbing in the distance rising in both volume and pitch as if it might arrive in time to save the cooling remains that filled the cheap suit spread out bloodied and disfigured on the sidewalk a body bag and the coroners wagon was more like it and even then a shovel and hose were going to be needed august in new england he had never seen any tourist brochures bragging about it he approached the elevator with a sour stomach that had nothing to do with the hot dog and mustard that he had called lunch his stomach was instead the result of a toxic combination of fear and guilt another one he felt an unyielding pressure at his temples delivering an unrelenting splinter of pain that felt as if it pierced the texture of his brain he recalled the last suicide that he had attended three years ago and the resulting investigation and he felt dizzy enough that when the elevator car moved he reached out for the railing to steady himself i did my job he reminded himself recalling the death that the paper had quickly dubbed the ice man it had been a disgusting winter of seventeen ice and snow storms two blizzards and a tenday period when the mercury never crossed five above zero in march a melting snowbank revealed a frozen john doethe ice man i followed procedure he told himself but he knew the truth for the sake of a friendship he had looked the other way he had investigated writtenup and filed some potentially damaging evidence the facts of which when linked one to the next seemingly related to the ice man casethough indirectly and circumstantiallyelecting not to bring the evidence to the attention of the lead investigator detective roman kowalski for the past two years he had internally debated that decisionnow he questioned it i did not break the law this ultimately carried the most weight with dartelli he had stretched the law perhaps to its limit but remained within its bounds to be found out might cost him a reassignment or transfer but it was a job filled with difficult judgment calls and he had made his like it or not the discovery of this second such suicide however added a burden to that earlier decision had he misread that evidence had his decision to ignore the evidence now allowed a second killing despite the airconditioning he began to sweat again and he coughed dryly and his lungs hurt he blamed the granada inn it was a decent enough chain but this particular hotel was a piece of shit its nickname was the de nadaof nothing in spanish there were two uniformed patrolmen guarding the fifth floor and dartelli attributed his bermuda shorts for his being stopped for a second time kowalski who thought the world revolved around him sized up dartellis garb and said in his heavy bronx accent the only known witness is a stoned jordon across the street you want to do something you could take a statement detective roman kowalski had too much hairbushy black curly hair escaping his shirtsleeves and collar his eyebrows cantilevered out over his tightset dark eyes like a pair of shelves kowalski had five oclock shadow before noon he was too vain for a beard but it would have saved him a lot of time and effort kowalski chewed on the end of his trademark wooden match a pack of camel nonfilters showed through the breast pocket of his polyester shirt he carried the bitter odor of a chainsmoker the man reveled in the image of the renegade cop dart had no use for him when he cleared a case it was only because he got lucky or beat up a snitch he had a horrible clearance record he bent every rule there was and got away with all of it the darling of the upper brass im off duty dartelli announced so fuck me kowalski said irritably you want to nose around take the statement you want to be off duty go home and be off duty what the fuck do i care i saw braggs van hes working the scene now kowalski said indicating the motel room listen you dont want to help out on your day off i got no problem with that but then make yourself scarce okay i got no mood this time of night for no showandtell across the street dartelli asked he wanted a look inside that room and a chat with teddy bragg he had to know what they had so far he headed back toward the elevators nice shorts dart kowalski called out down the hall using his nickname you look like youre ready for recess joe dartelli his back to the man lifted his right hand and flipped the man his middle finger he heard kowalski chuckling to himself it was goodthey were getting along tonight the witness wore his new york knicks hat backward the plastic strap across his forehead his dark green absurdly oversized shorts came down to the middle of his black calves dart displayed his shield to the patrolman keeping the kid under wraps and the boys face screwed up into a knot and he shifted uneasily from foot to foot like a member of a marching band rap music whined loudly from a pair of fuzzy black earpieces stuffed into his ears the smell of marijuana intensified the closer dart drew to the kid dart indicated for the kid to lose the tunes he introduced himself formally as detective joseph dartelli crimes against persons division of the hartford police department he did so within earshot of the uniform and he noted the uniforms name in the spiral pad alongside the date and time he took down the kids name and drew a line beneath all the information annoyed by what the courts put a person through you dont look like no cop the kid said you dont look like a reliable witness dartelli countered you looked stoned out of your gourd you want this patrolman and me to search your person the kid shifted nervously just making conversation jack he said it was true of course dartelli looked more like a disneyland visitor than a robberyhomicide cop but it was important not to let his witness gain a sense of superiority or confidence walter zeller dartellis mentor and former sergeant had once schooled him to quickly judge the witnessright or wrong a cocky witness was to be kept off guard a reluctant witness nurtured and comforted dartelli had the nervous habit of thrusting his tongue into the small scar that he carried on his lower lip where a tooth had once punctured through the accepted explanation for this scar was that an outofcontrol toboggan had met a birch tree when dart had been a twelveyearold with too much nerve and too little sense the truth was closer to home the old ladys swollen claw had caught him across the jaw in the midst of one of her deliriuminduced tantrums and had sent him to the emergency room for four stitches and some creative explaining dartelli wore his curly head of sandy hair cut short especially over his forehead where the front line was in full retreat he had gray eyes and sharp bones and fair northern italian skin that most women envied in the right light joe dartelli looked mean which came in handy for a cop the artificial street lamp light produced just such an effect fracturing his features into a cubist impressionistic image of himself masking his otherwise gentle features tell me what you saw dart complained irritated by the heat he barked up another cough his lungs dry despite the humidity it was something he had come to live with like im parking that buick over there jack you know and the suit has left his sunroof open right so im making it shut okay looking right up through itwhen that boy done dives out the damn window and smears his ass all over the fucking sidewalk blood everywhere dives dartelli questioned doubting the statement immediately there was no such thing as a reliable witness no such thing right out the window jack im telling you he arched his big hand with its long fingers and pink skin under the nails and imitated a dive as he whistled down a doppler scale to indicate the fall bam he said when the hand reached the imaginary pavement fucked himself bad dart was thinking about bed about how it had been a long day and that he had been stupid to stop and involve himself a piece of shit witness some sorry piece of dead meat oozing from a suit across the street who cares he asked himself trying to convince himself to give it up but he knew that he couldnt walk away did he jump or did he dive dart attempted to correct for the second time inside his painful head came that unwanted voice i did my job im telling you that the motherfucker dove head first damn straight just like the fucking olympics he raised his hand for the reenactment complete with the sound track he was definitely stoned out of his gourd shitty witness dart thought again but then there was the ice man whose injuries also indicated a headfirst dive though the body had been struck by at least one snowplow and moved several blocks before lodging in a snowbank for anywhere between four days and two weeks making any positive conclusions about his sustained injuries a matter of conjecture but he had taken a dive and this guy had taken a dive coincidence shit what dart had seen stuck to the sidewalk seemed to support this witness the jumpers head was caved in most of his face gone his upper body a broken mess what had once been his left shoulder and arm were now folded and crushed underneath him doc ray and ted bragg would have more to say about the exact angle of impact though neither was likely to spend much time with the case suicides cleared quickly but dartelli knew jumpers didnt dive they jumpedeven off of bridges where water presents the illusion of a soft landing there were exceptions to everything of course he just didnt want to have to explain them he felt like tearing up the sheet of notepaper and burying this sordid detail right there and then you did it once you can do it again the unwelcome voice inside of him claimed punishing him forcing him to do anything but dartelli instructed the patrolman to take the kid down to jennings road and wait for either him or kowalski in order to make the statement count i cant leave my crib the kid complained dartelli told the patrolman he gives you any shit search him and bust him and let him sort it out i can cut me some time the kid offered quickly dartelli eyed him disapprovingly piece of shit witness he thought piece of shit case dartelli returned to the de nada passing his sergeant john haite who was currently holding court with the smattering of media haite did not like the night shiftthe two crimes against persons squads rotated into the slot and for those weeks haite was worthy of avoiding dartelli did just that by the time the detective reached the room teddy bragg the civilian director of the forensic sciences division was standing in the doorway smoking a cigarette and looking impatient working with a girl can be a nightmare woman dartelli corrected samantha richardson the other half of braggs team was no girl whatever shes like my wifealways telling me what to do bossing me around i mean who needs it i get enough of that at home shes in there dartelli asked rhetorically hearing the vacuum running on the other side of the door running the aardvark treating this thing like we got the simpson case or something the guy decided to kiss the cementso whats to vacuum whats the big deal bragg was midfifties short and lean with penetrating brown eyes and a top row of fake teeth he had the disposition of a high school science teacher his skin was overly pale and he looked tired dartelli knew that the man wasnt feeling well because bragg was usually the first to demand thorough evidence collection some jordon offs himself bragg continued smoke escaping his lips who really gives a shit race the detective realized half the department referred to blacks as jordons and although they left the italians alone they called the latinos panics four gangs controlled the north and south ends there had been fiftyeight homicides over the last twelve months in a city that five years earlier had seen fifteen the gangs and their violence divided along ethnic lines had stereotyped their races in the minds of most cops there were very few police operating without some form of prejudice to make matters worse the gang problem had become so severe that hartfordprior to the task force crackdownhad been singled out on a network primetime news magazine as being one of the worst cities in new england now the department had its own dedicated gang squadalthough the territory wars continued and the body count mounted weekly you give a shit dartelli replied i know you better than that teddy i dont know ivy im not so sure i do anymore he sucked on the cigarette and the action drew the skin down from his eyes and he looked half dead you been in those neighborhoodsthe projects i tell ya maybe theyre better off dead he finished the smoke and looked around for something to do with it you could always take over for me no chance the only hpd detective with a masters in criminalistics dartelli had long since established a professional rapport with bragg the detective took some heat from his colleagues for his educational backgroundmost of the dicks had come up through the ranks and some resented dartellis fast track having taken his degree from new haven university he was mistakenly associated with yale and therefore lived with the nickname ivy but he had also won some attention and respect from other detectives for his longtime association with the retired walter zeller and the detail he afforded his crime scenes his homicide clearance rate reflected his thoroughnessdartelli regularly topped his squads clearance board bragg rechecked his watch and said i am not going to spend all night at the stinking de nada damn her at that same moment the room door opened and a tall lanky woman sporting a pageboy haircut and flushed cheeks said ready boss she set down the aardvark a canister vacuum cleaner speciallyfitted with a removable filter for hairsandfibers collection kowalski appeared down the hall with an attractive hotel manager at his sidehe was a skirt chaser of the worst order he caught up to dartelli and reported no sheet on the guy his name is stapletondavid stapleton no criminal record the news came as a welcome relief to the detective it was one less thing to connect him to the ice man suicide the four of them entered the room together kowalski leading the way followed by bragg and dartelli with richardson taking up the rear camera gear slung around her neck the female manager stood outside the room watching them sam richardson had marked with dayglo police tape the lanes where she had vacuumed for evidence these were the areas in which the men were permitted to move about she monitored their movement closely the room was not large enough for all of them the result somewhat comic the bed is unmade and appears to have been slept in bragg recorded impatiently into a handheld tape recorder fuckedin is more like it kowalski contributed in his usual display of tact bragg reported his findings dictating as he went along studying the bedsheets and the area immediately around the bed he said red pubic hairs empty condom wrappera vaginal condom wrapper strands of red hair on the pillow evidence of sexual discharge richardson took photographs of the bed and then stripped the bedding and bagged it and marked the bag kowalski glancing out the open window said is any of this really necessary for a fucking flier your call bragg informed him obviously hoping to be sent home kowalski met eyes with dartelli who had been openly critical of kowalskis lax attitude at crime scenes what the fuck kowalski said well give it the fivedollar tour the woman shot pictures of the bathroom following closely on braggs heels as the mans voice rang out weve got some additional red pubic hairs on the toilet rim and also in the shower stall dartelli moved to the bathroom door bragg down on his hands and knees continued seat to the toilet is down flecks of cosmetics rim the sinkmascara maybe some base weve got a damp towel in a pile on the bathroom floor and a damp bar of pink hotel soap in the higher of the shower stalls two soap holders indicating someone took a shower not a bath the shower cap has been used now crumpled into a ball on the showers surround so the person taking the shower goes firmly into the jane doe column stabbing a wad of tissue in the plastic trash can bragg announced one discarded vaginal condom he prepared a plastic evidence bag and picked the condom out of the wad with his gloved hands and studied it by holding it up to the light he dropped it into the bag and labeled it semen dart asked well test for fluids kowalski stated so the guy hires a hooker has a little trouble getting it up and does a louganis out the window whats the big deal hooker richardson questioned indignantly why because she practices safe sex do only the hookers that you run with wear vaginal condoms detective kowalski openly verbal against women detectives was not loved by the females on the force he stuttered but didnt get out a full sentence bragg offered his opinion of what the evidence told them they do the business she showers maybe with him maybe alone and she leaves then for his own reasons our boy does a swan dive out the window nothing here indicating a struggle no sign of foul play all this he recorded into the tape recorder for the sake of his report dartelli welcomed this explanation as much as anyone but that voice inside of him was unrelenting he argued internally that there was nothing here linking this in any way to the ice man and yet and yet he couldnt let go of his own guilt just the similarity of the jumps troubled him he suggested id like to have a talk with his visitor yeah kowalski agreed but it will probably cost you just for the conversation the trim is probably twenty and goes for fifty a night maybe the boys downstairs got a list of redheads he said referring to the vicenarcotics division richardson exhaled audibly in disgust natural color or a dye job dartelli asked bragg we can test for that bragg conceded taking it as a request clearly unhappy with the direction the investigation was taking dartelli had a thin line to walk he needed to rule out any connection to the ice man to discourage anyone pulling those files or that evidence for comparison while at the same satisfying himself that there was no connection for to make such a connection placed the blame for the death partially on him bragg offered we can try to develop latent prints off the door hardware the window and frame armchairs bathroom fixtures we get something useful we run the prints through alps anything else he wanted out of here richardson had gone on a photo safari in the main room she called out did any of you guys see that the doodad has been taken off the window kowalski alone with the two men in the tiny bathroom made a face consisting of one part boredom two parts disgust dartelli joined her in the other room the dirty glass window was a slide frame and opened left to right the doodad she referred to was a preventera piece of aluminum that screwed into the frame to prevent the window from sliding open more than four inches city codea means to prevent children from practicing their peter pans the rooms only other window had its preventer in place and approaching it dartelli noticed that the screw head took a special tool like the hardware in public toilets he slid the open window shut and studied the screw hole where the preventer had been removed the threads shined brightly recent he thought wearing plastic gloves in this kind of heat was oppressive his fingers were waterlogged and the skin shriveled using his fingertip he explored the hole lets shoot it he requested she fixed both cameras with macro adapters and fired off a round of closeupstwo from the colortransparency nikon and two from the canon blackandwhite as she did so dartelli searched for the preventer and screw that had been removed richardson picked up on this and without a word joined him in his search they checked under the beds the bare drawers of the clothes chest rimmed with black cigarette burns not here she announced no dartelli agreed meeting eyes with her roman he called out to kowalski who had gone back to flirting with the manager in the hallway and seemed bothered by the interruption dartelli stated you checked the guys record so off of id found on the body or his registered name registered name the other detective replied stupid shit dartelli thought he inquired irritably you did or did not check the body for identification coroner will do that when he inventories the personal effects you want to go sponging around in that mess be my guest dartelli headed straight out of the room passing the detective and the manager kowalski called out to him his voice like that of a child who was missing the point what the fuck are you doing dart dartelli didnt answer he enlisted the help of the two large men from the coroners body wagon to help him roll stapleton samantha richardson showing a great deal of internal strength photographed the grotesque body including closeups and then together the three men heaved the body over two patrolmen shielding the body from the media and gawkers with a hotel bedsheet used as a curtain dartelli found the searching of the mans warm bloodsoaked pockets both tedious and trying though blood and guts no longer bothered him he had become numb to such things richardson documented the entire process on film including the contents of each pocket a small black comb in the back jeans pocket a thin wallet in the front leftconfirming the mans identity as david stapleton and in the front right pocket some quarters and dimes a stick of gum a packaged condom and the special screwdriver required to remove the windows preventer encouraged by discovery of the screwdriver dartelli searched each pocket three times growing a little more disgusted and a good degree more frantic with each attempt the missing preventer was just the kind of annoying detail that would haunt him and increase his suspicions and thereby his sense of guilt richardson changing rolls of film suggested the dead mans watch pocket the detective had not noticed this pocket sewn below the belt line but above the right pocket he could hear the voice of walter zeller chiding him for the oversight zeller had a low tolerance for such mistakes distant lightning flashed in the clouds electrifying the sky a moment later thunder rumbled and rolled down the connecticut river sounding like rocks spilling down a hill echoing in the caverns created by the downtown highrises it was a night that dartelli would have liked to climb to the roof of his apartment building and drink a beer while awaiting the rainenjoying the light show or to drive a ways out of town and take his dog mac for a walk in the woods instead he had his hand in a dead mans bloody pocket and a chest knotted in fear he shoved his gloved index finger into the tiny pocket and withdrew the small tab of aluminum and the screw used to fix it to the window frame a few huge drops of rain slammed onto the sidewalk like small bombs richardson glanced up into the sky i love the summer rains she said shaking her short hair side to side relief swept through dartelli at having found this piece of evidence even so the suicide continued to bother him and though he willed it to go away the feeling persisted he looked into the mashed face of the victimhe could just make out where the nose had been an hour earlier this man had been alive and the warmth of the body the immediacy of the death had an unusual and profound effect on the detective he cared about the victim rookies cared family members cared elevenyear veterans could not afford such indulgence the rain fell harder and a light breeze picked up and moved some of the hot dry air and the night opened like a curtain the rain washed the red blood off his hand and the aluminum preventer and screw that he held there rivulets of blood dripped to the sidewalk diluted and pink its like gods answer to the heat she said her face still trained toward the heavens her blouse wet and translucent yeah dartelli said i know what you mean he wanted to talk to the redhead he wanted to talk to stapletons girlfriendif she could be foundregardless of her hair color he wanted this thing closed up tight his secret protected but he feared it wouldnt be the faceless head seemed to be looking up at him what he asked the face suddenly sharply angry the rain fell more strongly the coroners approached with the body bag they wanted the body now they wanted out of the rain joe richardson said her voice revealing her concern over his outburst lets get out of the rain dartelli couldnt take his eyes off the face it wanted something from him joe she said stepping closer noticeably upset dartelli stood and walked past her off into the rain toward the volvo with its flashing lights another clap of thunder tumbled from the sky shaking the windows of a nearby building as it landed he didnt feel like talking to anybody not even her he regretted his own past actions and he wished to god that he had a second chance he prayed to god that david stapleton was a fluke coincidence people do jump out of windows his reasonable voice argued but in his heart he knew better chapter teddy bragg looked like a candidate for bypass surgery dartelli worried about him his skin was the color of watery cottage cheese and he lacked the nervous energy that had given him the longtime nickname buzz his eyes were bloodshot and his breath bad and he had buttoned his shirt incorrectly making him into an old man but dartelli didnt have the heart to point out the buttoning error because teddy bragg took such things extremely personally and when his mood went sour everyone around him suffered i got a total staff of two dont forget he said apologizing first which troubled dart and i gotta run this by kowalskiim perfectly aware of thatbut youre the one who asked about the apartment so youre the one i called the lab ceiling was waterstained acoustic tile the floor paintstained cement too much stuff had been taped and removed from the walls leaving dark holes in the creamcolored paint what remained of the evidentiary lab communicated by an open door with the pantrysize area in which a behemoth photo developer churned out crime scene photographs and mug shots lending an inescapable toxic odor to both areas that gave dartelli a quick headache and teddy bragg his rheumy eyes i can wait if i have to buzz its only a suicide lies one begot the next that wasnt your attitude on monday its thursday i have other fish to fry dartelli tried this out on the man despite the churning in his stomach and the tightness in his chest for four days he had slept poorly haunted by the image of stapletons crushed face and the suspicion that the past had surfaced like ahabs whale he wanted whatever bragg had wanted it badly but felt more like his alcoholic mother when she tried to hide her bottle no one must know he reminded himself i gave it to sam he said meaning samantha richardson the other half of braggs department richardson handled all of the photography and most of the evidence collection while bragg dealt with the scientific analysis that wasnt shipped out to the state police administration and most of the court testimony i sent her with a uniform as an escort because i was hoping to get her back alive stapletons apartment dartelli clarified itching for whatever information bragg could supply and trying to appear nonchalant about it the area north of the city where stapleton had lived was not safe for a caucasian out of uniform even in the daytime we didnt lift any red pubic hairs or head hairs for that matter and though the neighbors knew there was a girlfriend involveda lot of shouting evidentlyshe sam didnt get a name from them dartelli had wanted to handle these interviews himself but had decided that on a north end suicide it might attract unnecessary attention within the department for him to express such interest leaving it to bragg and richardson had been difficult dart liked to maintain control but he had complete faith in braggat least when the man was healthy no name dartelli asked frustrated by the thought he might have lost his chance to connect stapleton to whoever had been in that room with him lots of unanswered questions remained why had stapleton traveled downtown to the de nada if his intention had been to commit suicide and if his intention had not been to commit suicide then why did he come prepared with the special screwdriver and if his sole intention had been to have a whore on the night of his suicide then why had vicenarcotics failed to produce the missing redhead given the twohundreddollar finders fee offered for information leading to the womans identity it seemed inconceivable to dartelli that they still had no solid leads this was not a big town i didnt say that bragg corrected just that the neighbors were worthless as usual you did get a name dartelli said seizing on the fact and belying his external calm give me the fucking name he felt like shouting sheesh think you won the lottery or something bragg said suspiciously knowing he had the man bragg was withholding the vital information no sign whatsoever of this woman currently residing in the apartment with stapleton except for an empty closet and a couple of empty drawers in the bathroom maybe she moved out or something and as i said no red hairsall black sam said the place was trashed up pretty bad guy lived like a slob her name dartelli asked as calmly as possible and she didnt find a note or anything even close to explaining why he might have took the dive studying darts reaction he said i didnt think youd like that i need the womans name buzz thats where i start attempting to sound definitive bragg stated youre not going to ask us to compare fibers adding quickly not on a north end jumper for chrissakes put it to bed dartelli hesitated and said not for a north end jumper no bragg looked bothered dartelli couldnt be sure if he was reading the man right or if bragg was indeed physically ill but he was acting oddly as if he might be concealing something buzz dartelli inquired reminding himself at that moment of ginny rice because she always used darts name as an interrogative and it bothered him priscilla cole bragg volunteered heading off darts inquiry sam found phone and electric bills in the name of priscilla cole got to be the girlfriend making note of it dartelli thanked the man whats bugging you anyway bragg asked dartelli tried his best to wash the concern off his face nothing about this jump i mean the lab man said i felt it from the getgo ill be happier once ive talked to this redhead dartelli explained loose ends you know zeller bragg said darts throat constricted and he felt choked does teddy know he wondered he turned you into a worrier just like him bragg stated the explanation flooded dartelli with relief ill take that as a compliment dartelli managed to say though his throat remained tight causing him to sound emotional bragg nodded you could do worse than remind me of walter zeller bragg complimented him priscilla cole dartelli repeated hoping to end the conversation he didnt want to be talking about zeller escorting dartelli past the smelly photo machine and to the door bragg said stay tuned dartelli left with a nagging bubble in his throat stay tuned was teddy braggs warning for something unexpected dartelli didnt want any surprises in this investigation the man jumped he reminded himself he headed upstairs feeling ill at ease and nauseated perhaps whatever illness teddy bragg had succumbed to was contagious bud gorman looked like an underpaid middleaged accountant who had elected to allow his hair to fall out and couldnt be bothered to disguise this with a rug he had thick glasses a gap between his front teeth and a red nose with flanking irish cheeks standing at five foot five inches he wore a size fortysixshort sport coat and had an eighteeninch neck that made his neckties hang funny there was enough glare coming off the top of his head to prompt dartelli to want a pair of sunglasses when he spoke it sounded as if someone were choking him he chainsmoked nonfilters i dont have shit on this girl cole joe my guess is this guy took damn good care of her because she doesnt have any kind of credit history i mean nothing nothing dartelli repeated disgusted dead endsthey would etch it on his gravestone someday bud gorman worked for gbt credit services and as such had access to every credit database in the country any credit rating bank account or credit card account was his he had access to the records of ninety percent of all major retail firms issuing personal credit including all department stores major oil companies hotel chains travel agencies major airlines and phone companies if a person spent anything but cash bud gorman could track it usually this was done for the purpose of protecting companies or tracking demographics but for joe dartelli it was done as a public service quietly and for free bud gorman liked sport carsthanks to dart he had not paid a speeding ticket in over five years if james bond had a license to kill bud gorman had a license to drive and i tried to find you something joe you gotta know thats rightbecause i could hear it in your voice and i can see it in your face now and i feel like shit that i cant help you but thats the way it is with some people he studied darts disappointment if i had access to government entitlement programs i have a hunch thats where your ms cole would be and i do have some contacts over at irs though as you know my gut take on this is that shes not filing income anyway so why use up our welcome over something like this but its your call i want you to know no credit history dartelli was incredulous that address is damn near in the projects joe its not that surprising not really ive lost her maybe maybe not gorman said dragging a stout hand nervously over his shiny head maybe not he repeated help me out here bud insurance the man said speaking clearly maybe shes covered maybe not but if she is then shell be in the database and her address will be current health insurance dartelli questioned fair odds that shes covered joe lousy odds dartelli argued the david stapletons of this world are the exact demographic that go without health insurance shit this is an insurance town joe everybodys got some kind of coverage dartelli knew it was true hartford people carried inordinate amounts of insurance the same as rochesterians used only kodak film but what this meant to dartelliwhat gorman was suggestingcarried a personal agenda for the detective the last thing that dartelli wanted was to go hat in hand to ginny rice asking for favors and she was the only insurance person that he could think of i wont do it dartelli promised himself a promise broken with his next phone call chapter by five oclock on a hot august day the jennings street booking room held an air of confusion voices shouting detainees complaining attorneys arguing parents protesting police officers of every rank dress and both sexes attempting to manage the chaos the special task force on gang violence had brought in twentythree hispanic teens for booking and questioning dartelli and others had been enlisted for the raid the airconditioning had failed two hours earlier the air hung heavy with the tangy odor of perspiration and the deafening roar of constant cursing and swearing the room like the building combined creamcolored cinder block walls with vinyl tiled floors in a urine white the acoustic ceiling tiles were stained from the leaks that had been ongoing throughout the building for the past three years the place reminded dartelli of a cross between a post office and a prison at the moment it felt more like a high school principals office dartelli was consulting with a fellow detective on how to book one of the kids found in possession of a nineinch switchblade the two were speaking in normal voices despite the cacophony he glanced up as a red file folder squirted between a pair of bodies and he registered that this folder was directed at him it shook inviting him to take hold and then he saw attached to the folder a graceful feminine hand and attached to this hand an elegantly muscled and tan forearm covered in fine sunbleached hairs before he saw her face he identified the voice of abby lang joe this is for you spoke that voice the folder shook again we should talk he had never really looked at her arms before he didnt spend a lot of time looking at a persons arms but she had a nice pair lieutenant abigail lang worked the sex crimes detail alone two years earlier she had managed to sheer the detail off of crimes against personscapers as the dicks referred to itbut not without resentment both of her rank and the power her separated detail afforded her dart had admired the move one that had required a great deal of political savvy to accomplish but hed never had any interaction with lang until the moment this file was shoved at him she wore her straight blond hair turned in at the shoulder and had the kind of nordic looks that might have stopped traffic ten years earlier in her midforties she was a handsome woman with bright interested eyes a coy smile and a small slightly upturned nose on television she might have played an attorney or a nurse dartelli accepted the folder and felt obliged to thank her but she was squeezed by two sides of a competing verbal exchange and all but her perfume disappeared leaving dartelli drinking in a deep inhale nice the other dick said looking in her direction agreed answered dartelli who didnt have time to think about abby lang although he furtively searched for a second glimpse of her if he had taken a moment he might have realized that he had sat alone in his apartment for too many months since his break up with ginny had awakened to a television screen filled with electronic lint far too many times trapped in the darkness and solitude of a beerinduced coma had retreated too far into himself control was his issue his mother zeller the women in his lifehe always granted control to others surrendering himself to their whims desires and emotions during his worst depressions he allowed himself to believe that he had been a puppet for most of his adult life never navigating his own way but dancing along with the strings that dictated his actions from high overhead this feeling of being at the will of others could nearly paralyze him at times secretly he wanted to believe that he stood behind the wheel of his own ship as he glanced at the folder it was not the name gerald obright lawrence that caught his attention but instead the two letters that preceded the booking number scsex crimes had dart not ignored the evidence gleaned late in the ice man investigation evidence that confirmed the ice man was in fact the serial rapist dubbed the asian strangler by the mediafor his asian victimsthen that file too would begin with these same two letters but he had chosen to ignore the evidence for the sake of a precious friendship sergeant walter zellers wife had been viciously raped and murdered by the elusive asian strangler and the evidence discovered by dart irrefutably identified the ice man as the asian strangler with the very real possibility that zeller had cleverly avenged his wifes brutal killing but with absolutely no concrete evidence supporting this his partner and protege had chosen to let the evidence slide electing not to put zeller through an ordeal that ultimately could not be proven anyway and now like the great white whale resurfacing this folder brought the ice man back dartelli file in hand navigated his way out of booking and down the hall to capers he examined the opening pages of the report gerald lawrence had been detained seven times on suspicion of sexual molestation of minors he had been arrested and convicted only once late the previous year having served five months of a fouryear sentence he had been released and paroled on probation eleven weeks earlier lawrence had hanged himself four weeks later dartelli stared at the file a suicide a sex offender his best ideas rarely came to him in flashes of brilliance instead seeping into him as a trickle a faint voice that suddenly for reasons unknown gained in both volume and clarity as he sat before this file he asked himself coincidence his chest tightening he sensed someone behind him and spun around in his chair abby lang stood about five foot seven she had square shoulders a delicate neck soft eyes and full high breasts she wore ordinary clothing but it didnt look ordinary on her am i interrupting she asked stealing a peek over his shoulder he told her no she was not interrupting she handed him a second file this one from capers his own division it too was marked with lawrences name it was kowalskis case she informed him lawrences suicide but i keep the sex crimes files locked up and i thought you might want to see it why he asked the guilt seeping into him did she know about the ice man he wondered had she connected the ice man to the asian strangler investigation that jumper last week everyones talking about how hot and bothered you were by it everyone sam richardson she said you took it pretty hard dartelli knew the truth roman kowalski the hairychestandgoldchain detective who drove a red miata and benchpressed twoten was loathed by nearly every woman on the force abby lang was leaving it for dart to see the connection between the two suicides the investigating officer turning back to the file he offered for her to pull up a chair which she did lang saved him the trouble of reading gerald lawrence was known in his neighborhood as gerry law he hanged himself from a ceiling light fixture using a length of lamp cord he left a note that read quite simply i cant live with my crimes forgive me there was no booze found in his blood workup and though half an ounce of pot was discovered in the apartment there was no thc in his blood at the time of death and no indication of foul play place was locked from the inside kowalski closed the case with little more than writing up the necessary reports although it took him a couple of days to do so she sounded a little annoyed by this dartelli allowed as how any capers detective would have acted in pretty much the same way suicides cleared quickly listen she confessed openly this is the kind of thing i celebrate a known piece of shit takes himself out saves me time and energy five months on a fiveyear sentence thats justice she asked angrily but it was a suicide and it was investigated by kowalski meaning if she had evidence to support that kowalski had somehow mishandled the investigation then it was a case for internal affairs not capers not him she didnt answer his question directly gerry law worked the young girls in the neighborhood befriended them got them to trust him obtained a promise of secrecy and then the horrors began he took his time with them to make sure he could count on their secrecybroke them in slowly kept some of them for several years took photos and videos sold some of them used the photographs to blackmail the older ones you wouldnt want your mother to see this pure slime discarded those over fourteen we had some mothers who suspected someone in the neighborhood but couldnt find a witness he had them all too well trained you knew but couldnt do anything dartelli asked incredulously suspected she corrected this kind of abuse is often first noticed in the bathtub at home or at the doctors office its insidious because its not always that obvious depending on the act a doctor has to know what to look for parentsmothers in particularare often the worst they dont want to believe what they see happens all the time but you busted him dartelli recalled he leafed through the capers file studying the photographs of the hanging lawrences body hung by the neck from a length of wire fixed to a ceiling light fixture that was itself pulled out of the sheetrock sure we got lucky but only once seven arrests one convictionyou know the drill dartelli also knew the frustrations that went along with such work as he reached braggs forensics report she asked him why use a strand of lamp wire does that sound right he flipped forward to the detailed report of the apartments contents what are you saying he asked but he understood the question perfectly well she doubted the suicide she said if youre lawrence and youre planning to do something like this why not get a piece of rope dartelli hurried through braggs crime scene report it lacked detail indicating a hasty job typical of both a suicide investigation and kowalskis lax approachthe usual cotton and synthetic fibers expected in any home some copper filings from the lamp cord found on the floor under the body nothing special how did you finally get him dart asked trying to keep her away from questioning the suicide she answered an eighteenyearold girl came forward she had seen some oprah program that dealt with sexual abuse and realized what had been done to her and how she had blocked it out we put her on the stand and she identified him but she fell apart on cross and that cost us he gets five years commuted to oneout in six months five as it turned out because of prison overcrowding i mean heres a piece of shit that had done over a dozen young girls by some counts and he gets virtually nothing dartelli pulled out the medical examiners report abby reached over his shoulder and flipped past to a photocopy of lawrences suicide note let me ask you this she said youre gerry law slime ball pervert and here is your last comment to the world two sentences the grammar correct the message simple i cant live with my crimes forgive me dart studied the photocopy the lettering was jerky indicating stressunderstandable he thought given that the man was about to kill himself nonetheless the wording was curious though he was loath to admit it what is she after the choice of words is what intrigues me she said the word crimes for instance is that how a guy like this thinks crimes ive interviewed dozens of these men joe it doesnt ring right with me he could see in her doubting expression that he faced trouble does that sound right to you some downandout slime ball living on the edge of bellevue square she answered herself it sounds more like a prosecuting attorney than gerry law or a detective he kept to himself thinking of walter zeller what if gerry law was into drugs she asked what if he has a narco record as well roman kowalski had worked narcotics before coming over to capers dartelli finally saw what she was aftershe suspected kowalski not zeller she had nearly flawless skin belying her age she nibbled at her lower lip as she concentrated and said the narco files are kept separate same as mine without access to those files wed never know if there was a connection between an investigator and these suicides or not listen dartelli said feeling heat spike up his spine this is interesting abby but i doubt theres any great coverup going on here there had been a shakeup in the department a year earlier two narco detectives had been sent packing she was still sniffing these same bushes youre capers joe you could take another look at the lawrence casemaybe its connected to stapleton maybe it is but not in the way you think it occurred to him how convenient it would be for him if it could be connected to kowalski realizing that she had handed him the lawrence file not for his sake but because of her own curiosity dartelli wondered how to shake her interest what is it you want from me lieutenant its abby joe please and you know how it is with me and capers how far would i get with any of this it was true her rank and privilege were coveted and the source of much envy and resentment in capers sexism was rarely discussed but it existed any of what abby she offered him a look of annoyance and disappointment that reminded him of his mother he felt a pang of guilt and he wanted to shout leave me alone she reminded two suicides both investigated by the same detectiveone with a questionably worded note you were at the stapleton scene joe all im wondering what im asking was there anything there to suggest any kind of no he cut her off nothing leave it alone he mentally encouraged drop it the interruption infuriated her you joe youre not one of them she meant the clique at capers the old boys club no he wasnt one of them he was ivy the outcast with the educationonly zeller had included him dont tell me that i dont believe that for a minute were not so different you and me and dont tell me to go running to internal affairs because you know damn well that would be the beginning and end of it kowalski is far too well connected roman kowalski was loved by all perhaps the worst cop on the force the biggest fuckoff and the detective with the best connections to the top the most friends and allies you want me to stir up trouble is that what youre asking just forget it she said standing up glaring down at him and then storming off he wanted to call out to herto stop her and tell her that yes he too was curious but he sat in his chair watching her go hurting knowing somehow that things were different now and that with abbys involvement he would have to beat her to the truth he looked at the open file in his lap she was good she was thinking she was trouble damn her he thought chapter you look tired dartelli told the man feeling both curious and nervous about this impromptu meeting he hadnt lost any sleep over braggs stay tuned comment of a few days earlier but he hadnt forgotten about it either bragg looked worse than tired sick maybe the kind of sick that steals color from the cheeks and reddens the eyes and paints an inescapable sadness over a persons demeanor to the point that its hard to look without asking questions or offering advice dartelli didnt know where to start braggs condition seemed irretrievable looking at him was like looking at a sad old dog dartelli felt sorry for him i am tired bragg confirmed needlessly and i havent got good news im afraid he waved a finger at dart leading the detective out of his small office and across the hall to the pantrysize partial lab on the other side of the photo processor some computer equipment was gathered cheek by jowl in the far corner alongside some plastic milk crates stacked and used as shelving that same finger directed dartelli to a worn office chair three of the four wheels had survived its years dartelli tilted left and slightly back feeling as if he might tip over any second bragg took the newer chair the one immediately in front of the keyboard and oversize monitor he placed his hands on the keyboard his skin was shriveled and looked oldtoo many chemicals dartelli thought too many hours in laboratories there were reasons they offered retirement at twenty years dartelli could spot those who had passed the date bragg said we can go over hairs and fibers until the cows come home its all neat and sweet buttoned up nice woman therea hooker maybe on account of finding both the vaginal condom and the one in his pocketseems like overkill for a real relationship doesnt it she likes to dye herself red we confirmed that so what he likes redheads what do we care they were in bed together i can prove that he continued she took a shower she used the toilet im good on both of those sometime later our mr stapleton decides to test the effects of gravity nothing real new in terms of trace evidence nothing out of the ordinary nothing sending up red flags thats what we got on the one hand the computer came next and not as any surprise to dart who was waiting anxiously for whatever had tightened braggs throat to the point he had to squeeze out his words he was excited about something when he was really gassed about one of his discoveries he went instantly hoarse one big difference between the laws we both deal with yours are made by man and they vary all the time according to courts and juries mine are laws of nature and they dont vary an iota i cant make them vary even should i want toand sometimes i want to real bad he slapped the space bar dramatically and the screen came alive with color it took dartelli a moment to see that he was looking from above down the face of a building at a sidewalk it was done in computer graphics and though realistic it did not look like anything dartelli had seen not quite a photograph not quite a drawing i know this place dartelli said the de nada bragg informed him the particular laws im referring to are the laws of physics they dictate the rate at which an object will fall you cant screw with that no matter what this is a threed modeled visualization programcomputer animation but governed by the laws of physics how fast and at what angle of trajectory an object falls determines where it landspretty simple in this case vice versawe know where stapleton landed we measured it we photographed it we documented it every way available to usand thats considerable doc rays pathology report tells us that wounds on stapleton indicate that he struck that giant cement pot before he landedone of those pots designed to keep trucks from driving into the lobby although at the granada inn i think that might be an improvement dartelli felt obliged to chuckle though he felt a little tense for this reaction bragg went on that pot is a fair piece of change away from the wall which is what got me interested in the first place he glanced at dartellihe had mischief in his eyes enough of my flapping he said ill let my fingers do the talking the screen changed to a color photograph bragg told him this is from inside stapletons hotel room he hit some more keys and the photograph faded away replaced by an exact replica in computer threedimensional graphics nice dartelli said slick piece of software bragg agreed but notice the restrictions place is a sardine can foot of the bed practically hits the dresser you cant even open the bottom drawer all the wayi tried that remember he asked curiously dartelli didnt remember enter david stapleton he touched a few keys and a threedimensional stick figure appeared in the room looking like an undressed mannequin the animation lets us interact with stapletons possible trajectories in a scientifically accurate model he emphasized for darts sake bragg revered science the way theologians talked of god he worked the keyboard again returning dartelli and the screen to the outside this time from the sidewalk perspective where a crimescene photograph showed a bloodied stapleton folded on the sidewalk he once again manipulated the system into performing a metamorphism between the photographic image and one that was the result of computerization stapleton transformed into that same white mannequin we work backward he controlled the software so that the mannequin slowly unfolded itself lifted off the sidewalk connected with the rim of the enormous cement pot and then floated up into the air feet first head pointed down toward earth dartelli recalled the black kids description of stapleton diving out the window the kid whistling as he waved his large hand in the air indicating the dive bragg said the specific trajectory allows us to compute velocity necessary to launch stapleton out the window in order for him to travel the distance he actually traveled any other velocity and he lands in a different spot connects with that pot differently or misses it altogether then bragg added we look at three different scenarios stepping off the windowsill running at the window and diving or being thrown darts breath caught and heat spiked up his spine the chair wavered and nearly went over backward he caught his balance at the last possible second we ask for new chairs bragg said but we never get them he worked the keyboard check this out the screen split into two halves on the left a side perspective of the interior of the room to the right a frontal image of the hotel and a graphical chalk mark where stapleton had hit the computerized colors were unnatural the image eerie the mannequin walked to the window climbed to the sill and awkwardly squeezed through the small opening and disappeared on the adjacent screen the computerized body appeared and fell through space it landed feet first near the buildings brick wall far from the chalk mark he didnt simply jump bragg said so did he dive the mannequin reappeared inside the hotel room feet on the floor the head exited the open window and the body disappeared in the communicating window the body fell slowly and struck headfirst well away from the cement tub and the chalk mark no bragg answered he did not dive dartelli noticed that he had tuned out all else he felt as if he were inside the computer screen we have his weight programmed into it his height if he had an extraordinary build i might tweak things to make him appear stronger to the software but hes basically a normal build and ill tell you somethinghe needs a hell of a lot more velocity the scientist explained so lets make him run for that window the software showed the mannequin attempt to run through the room for the window the tight quarters required an awkward sidestepping you should have seen us trying to convince the thing to do that dance bragg said the mannequin struck the window and fake pieces of glass went out with him we tried ten different times to get him out that opening with the speed necessary he went through the glass every time turns out he would have had to start the dive back by the bed to make it out that opening with the necessary speed that computes to traveling three feet perfectly level through the airsuperman maybe not david stapleton dartelli said and that leaves interrupted by bragg a little help from my friends a second mannequin appeared in the room appropriately dark gray almost black it picked up the stapleton mannequin by the neck and waist took two running steps toward the window and ejected the body in the adjacent screen the body appeared and floated downward it fell short of the cement tub but drew much closer to the chalk outline than the other attempts we got it right on the second try bragg announced he would be a big guy or one hell of a strong woman or smaller man to accomplish this the gray mannequin was noticeably larger this time two steps and the body was thrown from the room it came out the window parallel to the ground arced rolled and the left shoulder impaled itself on the cement tub the body lurched back the head snapping sharply and the mannequin smacked to the sidewalk in a crumpled heap bragg worked the keyboard the crime scene photograph reappeared perfectly replacing the computer graphics an exact match wow dartelli said rocking forward tentatively in the chair a big guy he was thinking he had a couple of candidates in mind my sentiments exactly ignoring the screen and the photograph of stapletons bloodied heap bragg faced him the unfortunate part is that its not proof joe it can certainly be used to sway a jury or a judgeim not saying that its worthlessbut we have no other evidence to support someone spearchucked stapleton from that room and the evidence that we do have contradicts it fairly strongly given that it would have taken an amazon womanan easy six feet oneeighty oneninety if shes under six feet then shes built like schwarzenegger darts attention remained on the screen so it suggests homicide but doesnt confirm it precisely dartelli wormed his hands together and fidgeted in the chair its springs creaked under his weight a dozen thoughts flooded him but one quickly rose to the surface bragg seemed stuck with his own thoughts a heavy silence settled between them the screen showed the photograph of stapletons ungainly corpse twisted and awkwardpainful even to look at it has started dart realized he felt a surge of panic as bragg said i dont want to make a big deal of this but im going to try the software out on the nesbit jumpthe ice man dart was thinking that both zeller and kowalski closely matched the physical requirements that bragg had put forth zeller was right around six feet barrelchested built like a pickup truck not a sedan he had lost a considerable amount of weight after luckys murderbut not his strength dartelli thought why bother dart asked thinking he knows it would be an interesting test of the software wouldnt it bragg asked rhetorically i suppose dartelli answered trying to sound bored that one never cleared bragg reminded true dart was wishing the man would leave it alone and yet he too wondered what the software would reveal id be interested in the results the lab man typed instructions into the keyboard and the white mannequin representing david stapleton once again came out of the window in a dive he floated twisted and he fell connecting sharply with the cement tub before being thrown to the sidewalk dartelli felt the collision in his bones the software is on trial with us i need to test the modeling bragg said this could work well for me i wouldnt make a big deal out of it dartelli cautioned the man rankin would not exactly welcome pulling that particular case back out of the uncleareds agreed bragg said knowing the political sensitivity of the case and no doubt recalling the battering the department had taken from the press but it could be done quietlystrictly to test the software dartelli felt sick what if the software suggested that the ice man had not jumped he wondered ill give it a try bragg said dartelli said carefully and for now maybe we keep it our little secret teddy bragg nodded and as his fingers danced the animated david stapleton was thrown from the window once again catapulted to his contorted death five stories below chapter abby langs sex crimes office was as dismal as the rest of jennings road it was hard to improve upon linoleum and acoustical tile although she had given it her best she had hung a few pieces of artwork on the cinder block walls had a vase of dried flowers on her desk and there was classical music playing softly from the boom box an adagio for strings she like dart had a personal computer on her desk there were only a few detectives who went to this expense sit she said as he entered and shut the door dart obeyed it was in his wood check that out she said indicating the gerald lawrence file dart had worried that this might be about lawrence he had come armed with a number of arguments but he suddenly forgot most of them she said page numbers of kowalskis log she added the thing is he didnt need to include his log but he was trying to save himself the paperwork you ask me he put his foot in it there are pages missing dart spotted what she was talking about kowalski had merely admitted photocopies of his field notes as some of his case material on the actual report it read see attached but its typed up dart pointed out to her finding himself in the awkward position of defending roman kowalski whats the point of typing up your field notes instead of just typing up the report its ocroptical character recognition she reminded everyones using it to cheat on their reports dart was familiar with the scanning software that could turn handwriting into printed text but this was first that he heard of this particular application a shortcut he said exactly its not why the department invested in ocr but its probably the most popular use at the moment it made a world of sense to dart keep legible field notes scan them into the computer edit them on the word processor and submit them as your reportthus avoiding the tedious duplication that writing up a report typically required it made him question his own practices following her suggestion dart checked the page numbers of the typewritten field notes and discovered a gap between pages three and five four is missing he observed abby said nothing continuing to type on her terminal dart checked through the rest of the report in case page four had merely been placed out of chronological order page four did not exist dart said so he didnt have any use for whatever was on page four thats hardly significant dart rarely used even a third of his own notes oh yeah take a look at this she suggested scooting her chair back from the screen to use the ocr software you have to scan the material first right and the only scanner we have is in recordsand thats a pc its not one of the networked terminals meaning the scanner takes the handwritten notes and turns them into a graphic the graphic is read by the ocr software and turned into text that can be read by a word processor dart didnt need an education on ocr abby clearly sensed this she said it creates the files in its own directory what kowalski does is go down there create the file and print it up he doesnt move the file he doesnt erase it youre saying that you lifted his original file dart inquired impressed voila she said pointing to the screen kowalskis scanned gerald lawrence notes she had copied the file to disk and had moved it to her own pc industrious of her he thought realizing he would have to watch out for her dart read the screen recognizing the kind of notes that had been taken he realized immediately that kowalski had interviewed a witness to the gerald lawrence suicide quotation marks peppered the page darts first instinct was to believe the witness had proven a washout as so many did it would explain perfectly why kowalski had not bothered to include the text of the questioning dart snagged the filekowalskis official investigative reportfrom abbys desk procedure required the investigating officer to list the name or names of each and every witness to the crime including those deemed useless dart could find no reference to any witness her name is lewellan page abby announced dart read quickly down the screen he didnt like being behind abby on this reading he protested shes twelve years old abby greatly relieved no wonder he didnt bother listing her but he interviewed her joe she reminded hes required to list her she hesitated and asked so why did he leave her out what did she see abby he cautioned its speculation but for the second time the hopeful thought nagged at him is kowalski involved in this she advanced the screen to the bottom of the page her finger pointed out a sentence dart read i seen a white man a big white man he gone on upstairs and the next page is missing she informed him dart reread the material several times ohmygod he thought a white man i want to talk to her joe i want to know what it iswho it isthat she saw can you find her i dont know she said but if i do i want you there chapter jackson brownes music played in the background he sounded lonely so was dart ginny wouldnt agree to meet him at his apartment and he had no desire to chance an encounter with some boyfriend of hers so it was to be neutral groundsmittys bar a place neither of them haunted not that dart haunted any bar he was more a library man though loath to admit it it was a yuppie bar with dark wood furniture white linen and an island bar that dominated the entrance it catered to an insurance clientele white men and women in their thirties wearing dark suits drinking light beer and making conversation in the most animated voices they could muster aside from the core downtown with its gleaming skyscrapers the only place a bar like this could exist was west hartford and the valley whites a minority in this city had to pick their watering holes carefully jackson browne sang that he would do anything from flying airplanes to walking on the wings dart had felt like that once with her and maybe just maybe she had felt that way with him but it had failed dissolved like a figure walking into a thick fog he had watched it recede had reached for it called out to it and cried when it had vanished for such things can never come backat least that was what she had said ginny rice turned a couple of heads when she entered not so much for her looks as her presenceshe commanded attention he thought of her affectionately though he hoped she wouldnt sense this and he feared that she might because for her he was an easy read she wore blue jeans a brown bomber jacket zipped halfway to counter the airconditioning a teal blue stonewashed silk shirt and the diamond and gold heart necklace that he had given her on an insignificant anniversary this outfit alone set her apart from the nearly uniform crowd just as dartellis khakis and blue blazer had differentiated him she had cut her dark brown hair short well off her shoulders she had a perfect nose small lips and eyes the color of the shirt a matching pair of gold studs occupied her left earnothing in her right that was ginny always something just a tad different tomboy fantastic athlete yet dignified and graceful when she wanted to be she was somebody elses nowhe had heard the rumors he swallowed dryly attempting to clear his voice wondering once again why he had allowed it to happen hey dart she said pulling the chair out for herself if he had stood if he had helped her with the chair she would have been angry at him so he fought the urge and just sat there use of his abbreviated last name was not a formality she had always called him this he thought of himself as joe dart most of the time thanks to her she unzipped the bomber jacket a couple of the guys were still lookingginny knew this but she was accustomed to it and accepted it as flattery she wiggled a smile onto her face like an actor practicing in a mirror his heart banged in his chest let go he told himself he had been told that time heals all wounds but if that were the case then time was moving awfully slowly and the wounds still felt raw and seeing herthe freshness the comfort with which she carried herself her apparent happinesswas salt in those wounds dart was still back on the time line somewhere he felt adrift he had lost zeller and ginny in the same twomonth period he had not yet recovered jackson browne was plaintivehe had messed up a relationship you and me both pal dart thought you look good she lied she ordered a dewars on the rocks with a twist from a woman who had looked good to dart a few minutes earlier he thanked her and returned the compliment and she managed that same fake smile again and his heart stung she didnt want to be here she had better things to do he could have died at that moment shut up jackson dart thought he didnt want to hear about someone elses pain he had enough of his own bad idea coming here he realized he looked around and his eye found the door i saw you on television she said i thought youd regained some of the weight but i guess its true what they say about the camera adding ten pounds im okay he said but they both knew good the dewars arrived and she insisted on paying she had to stretch to reach into her front pocket and dart realized her every little movement thrilled him and he hated himself all the more hows mac she asked great together they had recovered the labrador from the animal shelter the weekend before they had broken up he and ginny used to visit the pound every saturday morning one of the rituals of the relationship twelve years old arthritic mostly deaf the dog had been found hiding under a porch stabbed eighteen times with a knife no longer had a voice boxwhen he tried to bark he sounded either like a balloon losing air or gears grinding depending on his message he owned a serious limp very few teeth and the sweetest disposition on gods green earth the attendant at the pound had named him mac the knife and it seemed appropriate enough and dart had kept the name and the dog ginny loved mac too though she tried not to show it she was private with her pain private with her pleasure too dart called out and ordered a vodkahe needed something stronger than the beer that was now empty in front of him the waitress didnt like being yelled at from across the room ginny didnt like it either dart felt like shit so she asked her patience wearing thin the conversation running out of easy topics i feel a little foolish asking this he admitted a patronizing grin he wished there were a way to start all over this conversation this relationshipeverything i need your help he told her this seemed a great relief to her perhaps she had feared another reconciliation attempt the tears the pain the impossibility she sampled the scotch smacked her lips and set down the glass carefully onto the coaster professional she gloated her work had in large part been responsible for the demise of their relationship and here was dart on bended knee asking for her talents the irony was not lost on either of them he nodded where was that vodka yes information he said she waited him out he didnt like that insurance records medical insurance he said softly do you have access to that you know better than that dartelli her job which lacked a specific title but fell vaguely under computer programming gave her access to everything to do with the major insurance companies and what she didnt have legally she had anywayat her probation hearing the judge had called her a wizard the paper had called her a hacker dart had called her babe but usually only after making love and certainly never around friends had she not repeatedly broken the law he realized that they still might be together or was it that she was caught at it dart wondered the department forbade an officer from consorting with a convicted felon although they had once discussed how there were ways around such restrictions he knew that even now she spent her evenings behind that screen invading networks accessing files to which she had no legal right with her it was an addictionit rated right up there with sex she was good at both she was the only person he knew that had been offered more jobs more money after being busted and placed on probation the calls had flooded in it was as if by being caught she had earned her degree the fbi had been quoted saying she knows more about computers than bill gates it had ended up an endorsement of sorts she was earning three or four times darts paycheck fine with him if she paid she got four weeks vacation and an expense account he had heard that she was driving a lexus he wondered what the judge would think of that she asked what specifically do you need i wish i knew well that clarifies it one of her complaints with him had been what she perceived as his reluctance to state his positionshe had called him wishywashy slippery and dishonest it brought back bad memories bad idea he thought for the second time ive lost track of a possible witnessthe girlfriend of our suicide our jumper she lived with him we think but we cant pick up a paper trailan address a phone number insurance records were suggested as a way of tracking her down he paused studying her and while youre at it he added awaiting a grin from her i thought i might try the suicide toosee if he was facing a fatal disease or something like that some reason to explain the jump the almighty bud gorman let you down she sniped over the course of their relationship ginny had repeatedly offered to supply the financial information that gorman provided dart but the detective had steadfastly refused because technically it fell under criminal activity his willingness to break the law using gorman but not her had been a perpetual sore spot he shrugged the guys name is david stapleton if weve got it right his woman is called priscilla cole he passed her the names on a blank piece of notepaper she didnt so much as glance at the names her eyes were locked onto his she held the gaze for an interminable amount of time without looking she reached out found the scotch and drained it he refused to break eye contact he could be as obstinate as she he had spent years lost in those eyes he felt a little drunk i miss you she said softly was she making it up yeah he answered its not serious what im in now its a filler something to take up the time warm up the nights give the weekends meaning she reached for the drink again but realized it was empty he felt like offering her his you could use someone she encouraged thats the thing dart offered it would be using i think thats okay as long as its clear no not for me it isnt her eyes grew sad but she never broke their eye contact want another she asked he wasnt sure what she meantanother chance another drink he nodded she raised her hand flexed her wrist and pointed at the table she never took her eyes off him never confirmed that the order had been received but the drinks arrived minutes later and dart thought how typical this was of her in control in command he started feeling angry with her he wasnt sure where that came from he touched the notepaper again breaking eye contact she scooped up the names neatly folded the piece of paper and slipped it into her shirt pocket impatient with him its true about missing you she told him i dont want you breaking any laws he wasnt sure what to say so he said this and then wondered why of course he wanted her breaking laws heaven forbid she mocked it might reflect on you more salt she picked up her glassit seemed a familiar movement to herand she said lets see how far i get yeah okay dart said not entirely sure if she were talking about insurance records or their relationship as much as he felt drawn to her torn by their breakup he understood that his tendency was to be attracted to women who needed him to save them his relationship with his mother had established this and he had continued it through several relationships and into the romance with ginny he had repeatedly rescued her when she had been busted for her computer hackingthere were times he felt it was his only purpose in the relationship he knew he needed to break that cycle if he were to go back with her no matter how tempting hed simply start it all againhe felt clear on this even so the heartstrings tugged when she swallowed her throat moved sensuously his visceral attraction pulled at him despite his reasoning but his reasoning won out and not long after she stood and left so why he wondered drinking alone once again did it hurt so deeply to see her go chapter four days later dart found himself standing out on the sidewalk in front of the jennings road headquarters alongside a restless ted bragg he could hear the sound of boat traffic out on the connecticut river the late august air was like a cocoon smothering every living creature that ventured outside dart would have preferred to have remained inside with the less than exceptional airconditioning but bragg had insisted they meet out here so that he could smoke dart toed the sidewalk restlessly waiting for bragg to say something patrol cars came and went i ran the ice man stats into the animation software like i said you said a week or two buzz dart reminded surprised at how quickly the man was getting back to him im motivated bragg said irritably this software is on trial i gotta decide whether or not to buy it and it aint cheap dart felt a worming sense of worry twist his gut and tried to hide it he felt slightly schizophrenic the constant din of his internal voice nagging and chattering away reminding him of his oversight during the ice man investigation and the repercussions now resurfacing came up with the same results bragg announced wearily clearly disappointed dart felt his words catch in his throat the same results he wanted to question this immediately to cast doubt on the findings but the burning intensity in braggs eyes silenced him youre saying that the ice man did not jump the asian strangler he thought to himself the man who killed zellers wife the ice man was thrown from that window darts mind was reeling you can prove that he worried that braggs finding might reopen the case and then a moment later what a horror that might bring zeller there is no secret that remains a secret forever he had to focus to hear what bragg was sayinghis mind was running through damage control a dozen internal voices competing for his attention was he in part to blame for stapletons death by not speaking up three years earlier was he wrong in assuming zeller had been involved there was no proof he reminded himself bragg said thats what the software suggests yeah though i gotta tell ya that it makes me question its validity im not so sure about this i mean i run it on two cases and two for two it comes out that the guy was tossed you kidding me he questioned seems more like a glitch to me im gonna call the company and have a little chat i wouldnt get too worked up about it just yet ivy let me do a little research maybe theres a glitch in the codesomething like that as you pointed out the ice man investigation was an embarrassment to this entire departmenthell if im gonna be the one reopens that one rankin would burn me at the stake true enough dart said encouragingly his heart beginning to beat again but the worry burned inside him lets you and i remember bragg explained in a concerned and patronizing tone of voice that i checked this out on my own my idea so lets leave it at that i was fooling around is alltesting the software theres no paperwork on this just me experimenting with some new software so unless youre in a godawful hurry to bring the wrath of god down on the both of us id just as soon keep this under wraps for now early versions of software like this are always glitching always ten to one the stuff is fucked up somehow trust me the issue was trust dart realized but it had little to do with teddy bragg it was about the publics trust in dartelli to investigate fully it was the faith the department vested in its detectives it was darts respect for walter zellerhis mentor and former partnerand his refusal to bring the man down for nothing more than suspicion a software problem dart repeated his throat dry he coughed exactly bragg met eyes with him silently conveying the message dont question this dart felt the need to spill his guts to let someone in on it the ice man was the asian stranglera fact no one but dart knew the asian strangler case remained unclearedand walter zeller had possessed the most personal reason for wanting the asian strangler dead three years ago that had been the end of it but now are we clear on this bragg asked dart nodded his voice too tight to answer just so were clear on this bragg took a long pull on the cigarette blew the smoke high into the air and added ill send you up a copy of doc rays prelim on stapleton blood toxicology shows no street drugs no nothing that would suggest narcotics of any sort aside from a lot of crushed bones the only things of interest are a couple of needle marks on the inside of the mans left elbow a junkie no thats the point he said impatiently nothing in the blood tox to suggest that blood donor maybe plasma center who knows maybe low on fluidspeople have trouble this time of year this kind of heat blood alcohol dart asked insignificant after a moment bragg asked what ivy why that look no drugs no alcohol in a jumper how often do we see that he shrugged how often do we see a jumper he asked irritably listen im taking it as good news you want to make trouble with it you talk to the doc yourself stapleton didnt jump buzz you said that yourself that was when i was trusting this software the man reminded other than that damn software weve got no evidence of foul playeverything weve got supports a clean jump he waited as if he expected an objection from dart dont make trouble out of this ivy give me a chance to check this stuff out sure dart said but inside he was dying the ice man had been murdered the proof he had been lacking was now staring him in the face he remained outside long after teddy bragg had left him there will be more killings he thought a car honked behind him he turned around to see abby lang behind the wheel she was waving at him to join her chapter when abby lang signaled dart over to her car window he immediately sensed that she was bringing new trouble and began plotting to avoid whatever it was that she wanted of him and yet at the same time he felt a need to monitor her he didnt want her wandering too far afield she told him kowalskis witness has agreed to talk to me she handed him the address perhaps it was the combination of her blond hair and blue eyes or her flawless skin that took a decade off her age but she emanated an eager youthful enthusiasm that rumbled from within her like a pot boiling to others it might have come across as a naivete but to dart it felt more like a concentration of energyas if she were a battery of sorts and that battery partially discharged when he met eyes with it autumn was not far off and the first signs of it frosted the edges of some of the leaves with color and the air smelled of it and the suns rays felt differentthings no longer shined they glowed he wondered why he had noticed none of this until now its just north of bellevue square projects she cautioned a bad neighborhood he thought this is not the best time of day for that area the projects were safest from sunrise until eleven in the morning because the gangs were latenight phenomena and the kids slept latedrugged hung over exhausted abby responded tell me about it but shes willing to talk so im going one block north of bellevue square a white woman alone are you kidding is that a sexist racist comment detective i wouldnt go in there alone he stated honestly well then ill keep you company she declared with a wry grin leaning away from him and popping open the passenger door no no no dart protested standing his ground get in she said glancing beyond him at the gathering of patrolmen standing by the headquarters front door or ill make a scene they met eyes and he sensed that she meant it he found himself walking in front of the car and climbing in alongside of her this is a bad idea he warned her live a little said abby lang langs blond hair whipped in the wind of the open window he caught the silhouette of her tiny nose in profile and the elegant even graceful line to her chin do you have kids dart asked where had that come from he wondered three how is it the family life she glanced over at him and glared her blouse ruffled and billowed its the best thing and the worst thing that ever happened to me one part joy one part chaos highly recommended he sensed little or no sarcasm in her married once upon a time only it didnt work out that waylike the fairy tales i mean the palms of his hands went damp he felt nervous are you flirting with me dartelli she looked over and grinned what he asked incredulously no he answered lamely she shrugged her shoulders oh well they turned right and drove into the heart of the north end they rolled up their windows and abby turned on the air and dart checked to make sure all the doors were locked white people rarely entered the north or south endnot without a blue uniformand the residents of the projects rarely ventured into the downtown core if the gangs crossed north to south there was bloodshed three separate cities coexisted poorly side by side the police refereed do you like ice cream she asked him this question was so far from his thoughts dartelli took a moment to answer who doesnt like ice cream what flavor she added and dont say vanilla vanilla damn it all i can be a major disappointment he apologized yeah and you think youre alone in that meaning she smiled that selfcontented smile of hers and angled her head toward the airconditioning vent enjoying the cold breeze she addressed the windshield chocolate frozen yogurt with raspberry sauce maybe i am flirting he announced honestly were only talking about ice cream rest easy a few blocks later she asked what was ginnys flavor mint chip i hate mint chip she proclaimed yeah me too he said grinning i kinda figured that she said just by the way you said it passing the bellevue square projects it occurred to dartelli that these kinds of living conditions did not belong in a city in central connecticut in the united states of america it seemed unimaginable that this kind of barren wasteland of urban decay could be but a scant few minutes from the citys revitalized downtown bellevue square looked so much like a prison that it wasnt too surprising that many of its teen residents ended up in one decrepit shellshocked buildings storefronts boarded up with graffiti encrusted plywood sidewalk curbs ankle deep in litter and not an aluminum can in sight blacks and hispanics attempted to stay cool on front stoops curbs and perched in open windows a wasteland like something from a futuristic novel dart took this all personally the system had failed miserably to drive through the projects was to experience total despair he felt it in the pit of his stomach park it where we can keep an eye on it dart suggested as they neared the address point taken if the car were identified as belonging to two white people it had a life expectancy of about ten minutes only the stenciled announcement police which abby placed on the dash offered them any hope of returning to the vehicle and finding it driveable and that was no guarantee abigail lang and joe dart climbed a cement staircase under the glare of a bare sixtywatt bulb along a plaster wall scarred from an endless stream of furniture being moved up and down these flights entering the apartment dartelli pulled off his jacket and unfastened his collar button and reached for his handkerchief to mop his forehead lewellan page was a twelveyearold black girl wiry thin and bugeyed with small budding breasts stabbing at her tight tshirt dart met eyes with her smiled at her but faced with a cold expressionless stare immediately saw her not as a child but as a victim abby clearly saw this too on the drive over having never met her never seen her in person a very savvy abigail lang had described lewellan page down to her long sinewy legs and high cheekbonesthis because she fit so perfectly the description of gerry laws former victims realizing that there were at least another dozen lewellan pages in and around this same neighborhood filled dart with a sadness that manifested itself inside of him as a painful silence no longer a child not yet a woman lewellan page blinked up at him with something like terror in her eyes perhaps to her all men were gerald lawrence the girl took a chair at a black enamel kitchen table her mother was still at work which was awkward for dart because they couldnt use anything the girl said without her mothers advance permission to interview her she said she did not have a father which hurt dart she did not know the difference between having and knowing her brother was out on the streets somewhere the onebedroom apartment was immaculately clean though spare of furnishings the small green couch and gray overstuffed chair in the claustrophobic sitting room were trained on a television the pillow and folded blanket indicated that someone slept on the couchprobably the brother who no doubt came and went the apartment door had four heavyduty locks on it and a police bar the kitchen window near the fire escape had been boarded up and three pieces of wide metal strapping bolted to the inside one look at her living conditions this young girl home alone and it was not difficult to imagine the befriending tactics of a gerald lawrence as the three of them began to skirt the inquiry lang expertly creating a rapport with the girl dart was struck by the girls maturity and it occurred to him that kowalski was wrong to distrust her statement because of age prompted for what she had seen lewellan was forthright showing abby and dart how from her kitchen window a person could see down into both the dirt parking area behind lawrences battles street tenement and a pair of windows that she claimed belonged to the dead mans apartment did you know gerry law lewellan abby asked the girl looked down at the chipped linoleum floor and nodded yes maam she said i did and did you like him the girl shrugged but she was clearly uncomfortable even frightened did he like you abby asked accustomed to such questioning though dart felt squeamish sort of the girl answered dart did not want to be here for this he wondered why he had bothered to come here at all why abby had dragged him into this and he thought that maybe it was emotional punishment a way to insure that he would not take a way out not drop the suicides the way he felt tempted to a few weeks and both david stapleton and gerald lawrence would be little more than a pair of files collecting dust in the records room abbys eyes flashed darkly at dart she seemed to read his thoughts and she did not approve youre not going anywhere they said help me out here tell us what you saw dart requested gently he did not want any more of her case history he did not want confirmation that this small girl had been locked up with gerald lawrence for even an afternoon dart reached for his collar and realized he had already unbuttoned it he sucked for air suddenly claustrophobic the girls large brown eyes begged at dart and yet she was scared of him it was some old car blue maybe gray she shrugged she was bone thin much too pretty too real for joe dart at the moment he wanted out of there old you know come around back here and park big man get out white man you know he go up the back stairs there she said pointing in the direction of the outside dart moved to the window he didnt want to hear this he said it was late it would have been dark no not dark the light come out of them windows down there its plenty bright enough she studied dart you think i be lying same as that other man she said referring to kowalski abby glanced up at dart condescendingly and then said to the girl you saw a white man get out of his cara blue carand climb those back stairs big man yes maam gray maybethe car and what did you do then lewellan dart asked hoping to discover some inconsistency that might invalidate her as a witness and at the same time explain why kowalski had left out her statement hope built inside him that abbys instincts were right perhaps the connection was kowalski not zeller what a pleasure it would be to bring down roman kowalski i watched the girl answered the man come sneaking around our alley late at night and i figure somebody gonna get arrested maybe kilt she nodded at dart and he felt a chill down to his feet bellevue square entertainmentarrests and shootings said with excitement as if this window were just another television screen dart considered the possibilities gerald lawrence could have been a dealer his white visitor a customer kowalski could know something about that having been narco once the buyer could have been a cop dart realized looking for kowalskis motivation a cop buying drugs near bellevue square or performing a shakedown was just the kind of information that kowalski would attempt to keep quiet if he handled it on his own if he hushed it up he could protect a fellow officer and pick up some chits to barter later in his career the white man was upstairs about five minutes abby repeated yeah and no shooting she told dart my mama tell me when there a shooting to get under a table head down and under a table five minutes was enough time to make a buy and get back down to the car dart thought it didnt seem to him near enough time to fake a suicide he experienced another wave of reliefhe had jumped to conclusions by considering zeller guilt he thought is a form of illness he looked at abby and saw sadness someone so young her eyes said to him someone innocent and innocence he thought is like a balloononce punctured its gone there is no making it whole again no making it well his mother had stolen a different innocence from him he felt empathy for this young girl what time of night was this lewellan abby asked between eleven and eleventhirty you were up that late dart asked he wondered if this was a possible crack in her story i dont sleep so good my mama reads to me after the news is over then maybe i sleep for a little while why dont you sleep well abby asked bad dreams by the name of gerald lawrence dart thought he glanced at abby how could a person volunteer to work sex crimes how could she live with this day after day abby asked the inevitable question and as it registered dart looked away did gerry law ever ask you over to his place i dont know we wont tell your mother abby promised she knows exactly what to say dart thought he looked back as lewellan page shrugged and focused her attention on the cracked linoleum again she nodded sheepishly he had bunnies she said white bunnies dart felt a stinging in his eyes and caught himself with fists clenched why bother asking this he wondered he didnt want to hear any of this but then he realized how important a question it wasperhaps enough animosity and hatred toward lawrence had built so that a neighbor had killed the man and made it look like a hanging maybe there was no white man involved at all maybe kowalski had discovered the hint of a murder and decided a scum like lawrence wasnt worth the taxpayers money abbys face held an expression of infinite patience and compassion dart admired her his own face probably held a look of horror he could see in the young girls fear and hesitation that she had indeed been in lawrences lair had petted those bunnies a victim attempting to fend off her confirmationnot wanting to hear ithe said impatiently well youve certainly been a big help god help him he would not bring this girl downtown he no longer cared about kowalskis missing pages let it go but for abby this was simply another investigation another case she had seen dozens of girls like lewellan page she would not allow dart to close the questioning are they nice bunnies cute bunnies she asked the girl nodded yes maam lewellan did you visit gerry law that night at night no way only when mamas at work mama dont like gerry none mama dont want me seeing the bunnies she asked dart you know what happened to them bunnies now that gerry is dead dart spun around and left the room his throat constricted his vision blurred kill all the gerry laws you can find and there would still be more he thought he wanted to change this girls life to turn back the clock abby he called out hoping to end this but he heard her voice from the other room as she asked softly do you think you might recognize this white man if you saw him again dart didnt hear an answer he could picture those thin shoulders lifting into that shrug the eyes expressive with fear there was a picture of jesus christ on the wall and another of the pope by the door to the bathroom there was a picture in darts head of gerald lawrence hanging at the end of a lamp cord cut him down with a pair of wire cutters zip him up inside the mes black plastic body bag and forget about it who cares about him why bother to investigate kowalski was right good riddance abby he called again come in here a minute she answered reluctantly dart reentered the kitchen tell him what you just told me abby said glancing at dart and punishing him for his desertion i saw the white man pull the chair out from under him dart stood there slackjawed for a moment it felt as if his heart had stopped the rationale that he had formulated in his headthe drug deal kowalski chalking up a favorevaporated several thoughts coursed through him from how lousy a witness she was a twelveyearold victim of sexual abuse to kowalskis missing pages the chair he recalled the photograph the chair lying on its side spilled over as if kicked away standing up and glancing out the kitchen window abby asked were the shades up or down dart recognized that tone of voice abby didnt believe the girl thank god he thought the shade was down gerry always had the shades down said the bunnies didnt like the sun she turned to face dart and explained but it was hot that night and there was a wind you know and the shade blowing back and forth and it moved once and i saw that white man pull the chair and i saw gerrys feet you know she glanced over at abby and paddled her hands out in front of herself like he was running you know running real fast dart felt paralyzed lewellan page had witnessed a murder to abby the girl said fritz ran away thats my dog mamall let me have bunnies now that fritz is gone said no bunnies as long as we have fritz but fritz is gone now gone for good she nodded enthusiastically fifteen minutes later dart and abby lang were back in the departmentissue taurus soaking in the airconditioning abby stated strongly she killed the dog or let him go or gave him away you think she wants those rabbits he had a witness now that in many ways he did not want and yet felt grateful to have someone had murdered lawrencethe same person who killed the ice man he wonderedand no matter who this person turned out to beeven if walter zellerhe had to be stopped and right away he couldnt help but think that he might have stopped this killing if back then had he spoken up he felt cold all of a sudden why would kowalski leave her out of his report she fired at him kowalski was a big white man dart understood what abby was saying he objected she could be lying about the guys color about any of it abby kept her attention on the road and slowed for a red light i dont think shes lying she said no he said though he wanted to bury the whole thing he thought he understood kowalski now more than ever mistakes compound other mistakes dart reminded himself you overlook something three years ago and it comes back to haunt you i did my job he reminded himself wondering if a board of inquiry would see it that way wondering if his career was on the line he felt like a fuckup a fool he considered a transfersomeplace in the south away from the winters people might attribute it to his breakup with ginny it was a good time to try but the better part of him knew that he could not outrun the truth better to stay and fight abby asked what exactly is going on with us joe dart felt his face and spine go hot how could she disconnect from lewellan page so quickly was that what sex crimes did to you numb you the way homicide turned you into a comedian she wanted an answer she didnt want to repeat herself lets forget the ice cream he said im not talking about ice cream abby found a stray button on her blouse and closed it she steered clear of a slowmoving truck turned at the jai alai fronton and crossed over the tracks she parked in the back of the jennings road building and just before they climbed out of the car announced i know what i know i know what im feeling from you for you its scaring me a little youre good company abby okay she said accepting this but dart didnt accept his own explanation he wanted to say something she was more than good company he was interestedthe couple of years that separated them didnt bother him a bit she was a fighter a comer she spoke her mind and when she met eyes with him he felt it inside whereas she seemed to have faced all of this to have reconciled herself to the obvious he could not not verbally and so he said nothing another deliberate omission on his part would he pay for this one as well chapter after weeks of routine work in which it was easy to lose himself dart still retained a folder on his desk containing five mug shots that little lewellan page had identified as likenesses of lawrences killer to her credit the faces appeared similarrenewing darts faith in her as a witness he stumbled onto the folder on a wednesday afternoon in early october and decided to do something about the worry that he had been living with since the interview the only step that he could clearly see was to steal a look at some files that he did not have authority to access the risk had kept him away from them but on this particular wednesday he snapped he had to do something before another suicide turned up dart walked down the hall to abbys office shut her door quietly and asked her out for an ice cream an ice cream she asked viewing him curiouslyas much for the way in which he had shut the door as his question its october someplace away from jennings road is all he informed her they met eyes and he sensed that perhaps she understood they agreed to meet in the parking lot a few minutes later the oasis diner was across town on farmington avenue on the way to the mark twain house and west hartford the first triplewide diner in the country the oasis retained its art deco interior which included a total surround of stamped stainless steel and movie stills of brando monroe and james dean dart had vanilla abby raspberry with chocolate sauce so she asked the drive over had been in complete silence dart said kowalski was narco before homicide doc rays preliminary of stapleton turned up some injection marks they may be nothing but its possible that stapletonmaybe stapleton and lawrencewere dealers the point is well never know because narco records are shut away and after what theyve been through if we go asking questions were likely to open up a hornets nest and have haite asking a lot of questions that neither of us wants to answer until we have some answers are you with me all the way she said rolling her tongue over the chocolate sauce she made no attempt to disguise her enjoyment and then licked her lips lawrence was a coverup it depends if we believe lewellan page or not he said she wouldnt survive on the witness stand if thats what youre asking no shed be torn apart by the psychologists who would discover her abuse and create all sorts of reasons she would want to invent someone killing gerry law thats my professional opinion personally i believe her and i think that you do too or we wouldnt be sitting here and you wouldnt look so tired and bothered if we apply through internal affairs for lawrences narco file it will take a ream of paperwork and six weeks plus countless interviews and reports and at some point well have to put everything out on the table in the meantime we arent sleeping well she said sampling the ice cream again she drew it into her mouth on the end of a white plastic spoon and skimmed the surface softly with her lips stealing a little bit of the prize at a time until what was on the spoon disappeared and she went after more he sensed no intention on her part in making this overly sensualit seemed more her way of eating her ice cream but dart had a difficult time with it what would it feel like to be kissed by her id like to get inside the narco file room he confessed the spoon stopped inside her mouth she returned it to the paper cup and put a napkin to her lips you what we need to know one way or the other if either stapleton or lawrence was ever investigated by narcotics its our only hope of connecting kowalski to lawrence she set the spoon down noticeably more pale she looked around as if he might have been overheard you must really trust me she said staring at him does the word suspension mean anything to you or how about the words suspension without pay how about an ia investigation with you as its target she pushed the ice cream away if youre using me as a sounding board joe then take this advice forget it theyll suspend you maybe toss you theyll make an example of youthats how it works she cocked her head at him what is that look narco is empty by one in the morning theyre all out working the streets or eating doughnuts or killing time at strip joints by three they go home capers is up and running but its down the hall thursday through sunday the cleaners start at midnight the rest of the week they go eight to eleven what they say about you and your research is true isnt it i cant watch the hallway and go for the files at the same time no way she didnt hesitate a nanosecond it cant be done no it cant she confirmed not without help he pressed message received now hear this no way your office has a clean view of the hallway with the door left open you could see down that hall could warn me sometimes theres a late bust predicting traffic flow in and out of that division is never a sure bet it would make me an accomplice we carry pagers they can be set to vibrate instead of beep did you know that if you were to program your phone to dial my pager number then it would take only seconds to warn me it takes exactly nine seconds to walk down the hallway and reach narcotics once youve rounded that corner she shook her head looking amazed that he had already timed it and whoever it was would recognize you im dressed as a housecleaner i wear a ball cap glasses and a presson stache i keep my head down no one ever looks at the wombats not at one in the morning i push my cart out the door and im gone besides he offered thats my risk not yours if im caught i acted alone youve done nothing more than pull an allnighter how unusual is that he spoke sotto voce his heart was beating fast and he was sweating the vanilla was melting in front of him untouched she reached out snagged the spoon and guided it back between her lips i suppose you already know the order that housecleaning cleans in which offices are done first i can do this alone he reminded but i thought id ask you first im pressuring you abby and im sorry lets drop it she removed the spoon and pursed her lips she looked at him quizzically skeptically squinting in a way that felt as if she were measuring him testing him youre right about ia putting the request through them would probably take several weeks but break into narcos files based on the testimony of a victimized twelveyearold girl does that strike you as odd dont look at me like that he toyed with the ice cream but wasnt hungry youre really pissing me off here damn it good a tension had settled between them uncomfortable and gnawing i think ive lost my appetite she declared at am dart wearing a fake mustache blue jeans and a dark blue ball cap entered the departments basement housecleaning closet where he located both a cart and a navy blue smock that the service people wore there were four workers assigned to clean the twostory building dart heading upstairs estimated that he had a little over an hour for a job he thought would only take a few minutes he had rarely found use for the speed key given him by walter zeller some four years earlier zeller had claimed that no investigating officer could get by without one despite their illegality the speed key was shaped something like a small flat pistol it magically picked most locks with the squeeze of a trigger and was the preferred tool of car thieves because of its simplicityinsert the tongue into the lock squeeze and hold the trigger rotate and the lock was open dart hid it under a stack of green cotton rags on the cleaners cart the mustache itched the glue had dried shrinking his upper lip in the process if he sneezed he might send the thing across the room he used his cellular phone to call narcotics secondfloor office he allowed it to ring eight times thrilled that no one answered he pushed the cart out into the hall headed quickly to the buildings sole elevator and rode up his heart rate increasing with every yard this exploit reminded him of trying to rob money from his mothers wallet atop her dresser bureauhe would steal the money not for himself but so that when she checked the wallet to send him out for a bottle she would lack money the elevator doors slid open and at a distance of thirty feet down the long ugly tile corridor he caught eyes with abby lang he felt stunned elated she sat behind a desk inside her sex crimes office looking both tired and concerned instinctively dart felt down for his pager and switched the beeper off so that if it were called it would vibrate not sound she was clearly there to help him nothing else could explain her presence at this hour as he rolled the cart toward narco abby picked up her phone and touched a single button less than five seconds later the pager clipped to darts belt began vibrating he reached down and cleared itlike silencing an alarm clock she did not look up at him but kept her head aimed down at her desk and the paperwork that seemed to absorb her dart had a lookoutan accomplice an angel on his shoulder the listing carts front right wheel chirped dart awkwardly navigated it to a position in front of narco he knocked waited and then knocked again with no reply he slipped his hand beneath the stack of green rags and removed the speed key the fact that he was violating regulations distrubed him if caught he would have some tough explaining to do he was the cop turned criminal and for a moment he couldnt bring himself to do this but the hope that kowalski not zeller was responsible for the murdersuicide of lawrence and the possibility of connecting lawrence to stapleton drove him onanything to quiet his guilt with the speed key the door opened effortlessly it was illegal in all fifty states to own such a device and dart suddenly understood why as in hotels the housecleaners at jennings road blocked open office doors as they worked dart did just that though only partially screening the room inside so that the closet used as a vault to contain files remained obscured from the hallway he switched on the interior light emptied a trash can into the hopper on his cart and placed a beatup feather duster on the desk top closest his watch face read the cleaners would be arriving any minute and would start on the first floor he had plenty of time the file room closet was locked but the speed key made quick work of it the light switch was mounted on the wall outside dart studied his situation planning predicting every movement required should his pager alert him to a visitor he had to keep all actions to a minimum and so rather than venture inside the room he stood there figuring how to avoid being caught he relocked the file room door so that once shut it would be locked and not require him to fiddle with it he used a green rag to block it open and tested that by kicking the rag free the door would close on its own then with the light on he stepped inside and looked to judge the line of sight if someone showed up unexpectedly this person would quickly have a clear sight of the open file room the light switch on the wall was on the far side of the hinges meaning that dart would have to kick the rag out of the way get himself around the door helping it close as he went and then hit the light switch but this light going off would be picked up even sooner by someone entering because the office door to narcotics had an institutional smokedglass panel and a change in background light would be noticeable he reviewed the situation deciding he had things in the right order rehearsed them once while counting in his head four to five seconds he guessed when combined with the five or so seconds that abby needed to alert him it would be too long he grabbed the mop and headed directly to the hallways broom closet filled the rolling bucket from the soapstone sink wetted the mop and carrying a yellow plastic sandwich board warning of a wet floor hurried to the end of the hall near the stairs and the elevator he mopped the floor furiously making it as wet as possible then placed the sandwich board in the center of the hall with all this water he hopefully had bought himself some extra time while also slowing down any approach back inside narco dart unlocked the file room for the second time blocked the door open with the rag and switched on the light the room was crowded with gray metal utility shelving along all walls and a pair of opposing stacks in the center all the shelves were crammed with folders dart checked his watch this could take a while a rolling stepstool allowed him access to the top shelves which was where he found the ls dart was surprised by the number of files each representing a narco investigation an arrest or a snitch the citys drug problem was huge he fingered the spines l a w and came up with five files carrying the last name lawrence splitting his attention between the files and the open door dart nervously inspected the spines of each of these five files charles buster lawrence eldridge lawrence philip lawrence maynard franklin lawrence lawrence taylor lawrence no gerald dart hadnt thought to memorize the dead mans social security number or drivers license number for comparison and people like lawrence used enough aliases that it seemed plausible that any one of these five could be his dart took the time to go through the folders again opening each to a mug shot or crime scene photo one by one he eliminated them no gerald lawrence to be found if lawrence had been investigated by narcotics it hadnt been in the recent past disappointment depressed him he didnt need the stool for stapleton the ss were in the center aisle with s t a at eye height again he thumbed through the spines all marked with colorcoded stickers a phone rang not ten feet from him darts heart skipped and his chest froze and for a second his head swam the phone in the outer room rang again seemingly louder and a third time hurrying he overcame his anxiety and started pulling files stickered s t a stacker stadler stafford he had to pull each file out a ways in order to read the name on the spine he looked down the line of similarly colored stickers realizing there were dozens of stas to go he jumped forward by a group of ten stands standzleff staples stapleton three of them clifford david r edgar he tugged david r from the shelf but felt distracted by the possibility of someone walking in on him he pulled open the file there looking back at him was the mug shot of a younger version of the jumper he pulled the paper clip and flipped through the pages to the writeup possession and distribution of a controlled substance david stapleton had been busted fourteen months earlier for dealing speed darts finger raced down the sheet to the name of the lead detective roman kowalski his pager vibrated at his side careful its wet he heard a slightly hysterical abby called out loudly dart flicked off the pager shoved the stapleton folder back into the stack and turned for the file room door it took four strides to reach the green cotton rag bracing the door dart kicked the rag out of the way and rounded the edge of the closing door in a smooth motion his right hand seeking out and locating the light switch as the file room door thumped shut the light went off simultaneously dart picked up the feather duster and beat the desktop violently the result of too much adrenaline he heard a male voice in the hallway call out someone done already clean up here a moment of silence lapsed hey lady someone already done this floor dart could hear the mans footsteps and the rattle of the mans cart as he drew closer ironically this was worse than being discovered by a narcotics detective who would pay little or no attention to the lowest of the low a janitor but one cleaner erroneously covering anothers territory was certain to raise some irish answer him dart mentally encouraged her he pushed his cart but only a few inches because the bad wheel cried out and then ensuing silence engulfed him there was no way to hide the cart without drawing attention dart stood inside the narco offices feeling completely exposed somebody done mopped the hall abby answered what do you thinkthat they did it for fun the cart stopped rattling signaling that the man pushing it had come to a halt dart turned and slipped the speed gun into the file room door prepared to use this as his hideout the cleaner wouldnt have a pass key the unexplained cart would present a problem but at this hour would anyone make a fuss the silence dragged out had the cleaner spotted the open door to narcotics or had abbys tone merely humiliated him into thinking this through you could always clean it a second time she offered sarcastically regaining her composure you people never do a very good job the first time anyway aint you a peach the man replied no wonder your sorry ass is working late the man replied angrily who the hell would want to be with you fuck off bitch whats your name the cart began to rattle again and this time more quickly the cleaner was beating a hasty retreat she had pushed this into the realm of a personal argument and as a police officeras a clientshe carried the stronger hand dart waited through the agonizing minutes for the elevator to arrive he then edged his squeaking cart out into the hall and closed the door when he glanced at abby she was shaking her head at him in disappointment dart fingered the brim of his hat in thanks and raced to the elevator stopping only to snag the wet floor sign and stash it on his cart he had to return the cart to the firstfloor storage room as quickly as possible he didnt want the cleaning company raising any questions and if he could pull this off then when the cleaner reported the conflict abby would be gone the floor would be dry the sign gone and there would no evidence that any cleaning had taken place the result would be an impression that the cleaner was trying to shirk some of his duties dart rode the elevator nervously his finger resting on the close door button ready to push as the elevator doors slid open he smelled cigarette smoke and heard a man and a woman in conversation at this hour he assumed them to be cleaners he needed to return the cart and then get out both without being seen the hallway was clear the voices appeared to be coming from down toward the property room where a door led to the parking lot grabbing a smoke he realized johansen get over here a voice called out from darts left as he was stepping into the hall coming the male smoker hollered back johansen the smoker would have to pass the elevator to reach that other voice the detective stepped back into the car and punched the close door button nothing he punched it a second time and the doors finally responded though to dart they seemed to close more slowly than any pair of elevator doors he had ever encountered the footsteps of the two smokers approached quickly and it sounded to him that they would reach the elevator before the doors shut fully he tugged the cart parallel to the elevator cars side wall and squeezed himself with his back against the panel but the elevator interior was done in mirror he realized too late and as the two smokers passed by the woman glanced into the car and saw darts reflection in the mirror had he managed to appear calm he might have pulled it off but as it was with his face screwed up into a knot and his eyes locked in terror he gave himself and his false identity away this woman worked with only three other people and joe dartelli was not one of them the elevator doors thumped shut and the car groaned as it lifted dart had not pushed the secondfloor button someone had called the elevator had the desk sergeant been alerted were they already looking for an imposter dart tore off the mustache and shed the green work apron preferring to be discovered as detective joe dartelli than a cop inexplicably impersonating a cleaner as the elevator crawled upward he prepared himself immediately to voice a complaint about the cleaning cart being left in the elevator the elevator bounced to a stop and the doors slid open abby lang stood facing him dart stepped out into the hall feeling vulnerable for a brief second dart felt caught off guardhis complaint waiting on his lips he told her triumphantly kowalski investigated stapleton in a meth case when she spoke tension strangled her words a patrolman came by the office they know theres an extra cleaner in the building he headed down the stairs told me they would work room by room both floors hes young new to the force bored probably taking it very seriously she said did you sign in she asked anxiously during the night shift all officers regardless of rank had to sign in and sign out the desk sergeant tracked who was there i used the back door he informed her and i didnt call down he added there are worse offenses there would be no official record of his having entered the building to him it was a minor offense but the more he thought about it one that might be associated with the imposter cleaner and end up a nightmare the more he considered it the worse it looked not good he admitted we can try the stairs she suggested wearily knowing it was a bust the first thing we do is distance you from me he announced you use the stairs ill figure something out no she objected im part of this youre not i am the elevator doors closed indicating that it had been called dart tried to think of any way out other than the elevator or stairs it was a fairly large building though only two stories and in a roomtoroom search hed be trapped he thought about walking down the hall around the corner and into capers but there would be a skeleton crew there who knew that this wasnt his shift what about the crib she asked windowless a glorified closet used for poker games and quick naps the crib had been converted from unused storage space if empty at the moment dart realized that he might be able to feign sleep there without raising too much suspicionalthough questions would still be asked im official abby reminded she had signed in properly i have every right to be in this building stay here dart watched her as she hurried down the hall passed narco and threw open the door to the crib she reached in and turned on the light clear she hissed down the hall at him dart ran to catch up and as he did a thought occurred to hima way to avoid the questionsthough the likelihood of her going along with it was slim they stepped inside and he shut the door and locked it they were both breathing hard now what she asked a game of cards i suppose she asked sarcastically at onethirty in the morning oh christ take off your clothes dart advised her already working down his own shirt buttons yeah right she snapped now he said strongly as he continued undressing he glanced over at the sad excuse of a couch and abby lang blushed understanding him oh shit she said itll work he told her oh shit she repeated he threw his shirt onto the back of a chair and unfastened his belt and unzipped his pants adding but only with both of us she hesitated looking once to dart and then again at the sagging couch her fingers reluctantly found the buttons to her blouse and she began to undress herself as her blouse hung open she suddenly moved more quickly i have to tell you she said apologetically that im not real comfortable with my body she mumbled something about having had children and being fortysix and it was the first time that dart knew her age i would have guessed midtolate thirties dart reported honestly sitting down to pull off his socks no no no she set straight clearly uncomfortable with which piece of clothing to remove first her blouse hung open and her jeans were unbuttoned and unzipped how about the lights she asked sitting down on the edge of the couch and waiting dart tossed her one of the two blankets folded on the shelf she caught it he turned off the light and banged a shin coming over toward the sound of her jeans rubbing her skin as she slipped out of them a young patrolman would not pursue identifying two detectives sexually engaged in the crib he would switch on the light apologize shut the door and go tell stories it might just work he thought it also occurred to him that it might get them both suspended and he felt awful about that sitting down on the couch his shin throbbing dart felt embarrassed he heard the unmistakable snap of her bra coming off and she whispered underwear lets leave it on his skin prickled with heat agreed she replied sorry about this he said groping in the dark for her they hugged awkwardly clumsily and lay down together she pulled the blanket over them how weird she said but then she wrapped her arms around him strongly and held to him tightly and said this is not a pass joe im frightened you didnt need to sh she held him more tightly a little late at this point as if to punish himself dart suddenly became aroused he wanted to say something to make some excuse to apologize but he said nothing attempting to move away from her instead but finding the couch too narrow abby said this definitely goes into the books as the strangest first date she chuckled dart laughed and then they shushed each other which only served to make them laugh all the harder their chests bounced together with the nervous laughter and it fed on itself until it was uncontrollable trying to suppress it only made it worse rubbing herself against his erection still laughing she said maybe someday we can make the most of that ive got one for you she added the both of them tight with laughter what if they give up the search dart buried his face into her shoulder and muffled his laughter we could be here all night he said he felt her nodding along with him when she placed her open hand on his head and held him to her skin their laughter stopped running down like a windup clock the mood changed in this instant dart felt his arousal even more substantial she stroked his back abby he said i know she answered in a whisper while her hands kept petting him no harm in hugging is there and so they hugged each other intimately warmly affectionatelythe kind of hug that can take the place of breathing he thought it can take the place of food and confuse time and stop all thought maybe they wont come she said kissing his cheek and moving toward his lips all humor associated with that thought had passed he kissed her tentatively at first and then with the passion that consumed him she returned the kiss parting her lips and opening her mouth to him when the door opened a few minutes later dart failed to look up he had planned to say get the fuck out of here because he enjoyed the irony of the statement but he just kept kissing her instead oblivious to the intrusion the voice of the young cop said hastily sorry sir and the door bumped shut abby lang began to laugh she held dart close and whispered id forgotten all about that yeah me too said joe dart chapter knowing what had to be done and doing it were two different things especially given the consequences death contemplating another mans death was a power all its own as much as this man wanted to believe otherwise to ignore the palpable high coursing in his veins was nearly impossible tonight his was the power of god there was no denying it he felt drawn toward intoxication but he resisted this he felt like humming and so he did though out of tunehe had never held a tune in his life he stood on a hefty garbage bag just inside the back door and stripped naked revealing his uncomfortably thin body carefully stepping off the garbage bag he turned it inside out capturing the clothing and slung the bag over his shoulder like santa claus and carried it through the sitting room up the narrow stairs and into the bedroom where he set it down into the closet he entered the bathroom still humming his gaunt frame a stranger to himhe still thought of himself as the muscular beefmeister he had once been wearing the latex gloves that he had donned prior to entry he opened the medicine cabinet a small wire showed in the metal seam of the cabinet and as he pulled on this the entire cabinet came free of the wall and he set it aside revealing a clear glass vial a box of disposable syringes and a box of needles he removed the vial and a single syringe and a needle and returned the medicine cabinet to the wall so that he could see himself in the mirror he hated this part the needles the pain standing before the mirror he studied his face wiped the alcoholsoaked cotton ball across the sunhardened aged skin lifted the syringe and pricked the needle into his top lip wincing with the puncture and drawing a drop of blood the injected fluid stung and itched at the same timehistaminesand the lip swelled and enlarged almost immediately turning a bright red as if an insect had bitten him the lower lip was next and again he winced he worked his lips as would someone standing too long in the cold and attempted to speak good evening he said to the mirror working his puffy lips painfully until they formed the words more clearly good evening mr payne another injection just below the mandible joints produced swollen jowls and distorted his face magnificently but it was the two shots one below each eye that altered him to the point of establishing a new identity he was at once a squinty puffyfaced bulldog with gray hair showing around the edge of the yankees baseball capsynthetic wig hair sewn to the edges of the cap not his at all the image in the mirror was no longer that of the man who stood before it but instead one wallace sparcothe name on the bills the apartment lease and even on the credit cards that had bought the clothes hanging in the upstairs closet an invented identity the man did not feel himself as sparcohe wouldnt allow himself to go that far to allow that dangerous switch to be thrown in his head he knew damn well who he was and what was going on herehe was going to kill a man a worthless piece of shit he was going to fix things he was more than willing to make the sacrifice necessary prepared but he would not allow himself to enjoy itdespite the occasional rushtry as part of him did to do just thatand he would not allow any part of himself to fool any other part it was wrong to kill regardless of the justification he knew this in his heart his soul in the quiet depths of his being he was doing a job thats all charity work he kept humming as he drew the cosmetic pencil through his thin eyebrows darkening them he envied pavarotti that enormous talent that gift he thought of mozart as a freaksome step beyond genius einstein belonged there with him michelangelo cuban cigars mexican beer the stuff of life and in this mirror another man a man of his inventionthere were many ways to play god you do what you have to he reminded himself the face that had started in this mirror before the charade of the injected histamines was one this man hardly recognized as his own gaunt and drawn pale with jaundiced eyes he thought of himself as handsome but the face he saw there was not he drove an old beatup mazda twodoor registered to mr wallace sparco dressed in mr sparcos clothing and wore mr sparcos old brown shoes timex watch leather belt and carried his nylon wallet he slouched as the fictitious mr sparco slouched and yet he hummed as only the driver hummed he drove up the hill toward trinity college the view to his right a spectacular display of the sparkling lights of the valley and slowed before turning left as the street became chaotic with costumed collegeaged trickortreaters out for an evening of selfabuse the costumes were products of educated imaginations and the willowy womanly legs clad in black tights were those of eighteenyearold wasps wobbly from beer and steadied no doubt by concern and giddy anticipation mr wallace sparco drove slowly through the teeming students reminded of mardi gras he beeped his horn lightly and turned left not understanding exactly why he bothered to drive up the hill but deciding each life even that of wallace sparco was entitled to the occasional distraction back on course he made his way to farmington avenue and headed for the affluence of west hartford only a short tenminute drive away where the dismal poverty of the south end ghetto gave way to the manicured comfort of the caucasian enclave where black gave way to white and project housing to suburbia the amex cards were quiet tonight the downtown deserted parents were home supervising another halloween a few minutes past the retail core wallace sparco turned right and a few minutes after that on into the nestled canopy of darkness and the colonialstyle homes that hid here from the fear of the inner city only a few short miles to the east wallace sparco turned left onto westmont and up the winding hill then right onto wendy lane driving to the very end of the culdesac where he pulled into and drove down the long driveway of the tudor house marked with the twentieth century real estate sign switched off his headlights and parked he waited five minutes in absolute silence the area in front of the garage could be seen from only one aspect of one other house a neighbor a hundred yards away through thick woods the tudor was shown occasionally and when it was it was often at night to accommodate a working couple but it wouldnt be shown tonight because wallace sparco introducing himself as alfred gluck had booked a showing with the agent who carried the listingthe rendezvous planned at the agents office six miles away and scheduled for an hour earlier by this hour a noshow now all his the back wall of orchard street covered in the gray strangling veins of dormant ivy vines could be seen through the two acres of barren autumn woods paynes young and attractive wife was said to be at her regular wednesday dinner with friends where she would remain until dropped off at pm she was in fact fucking wildly with the man who headed the local community theater group a man ten years her junior who paid an uncanny resemblance to dustin hoffman but possessing little talent at least acting talent he thought she had never once in the three weeks that he had kept her under surveillance made it home before ten leaving her husband harold on this night to become a victim a statistic a suicide reviewing his carefully orchestrated plan wallace sparco checked his timex watch and saw that he had a full fifty minutes to accomplish what had to be done plenty of time in which to play god chapter colt park occupied nearly twenty city blocks of open grounds with copses of treesmaples oaks pinesa jungle gym and a parking lot like any of hartfords city parks after sunset it was not a particularly safe place dart kept his eyes open for movement and his ears alert he felt on edge the occasional ghost or goblin appeared on the sidewalk far in the distance for this was the night of tricks or treats a night any cop dreaded a night as unpredictable as new years eve or the fourth of july by midnight the gangs would be out in full force by one oclock in the morning a teenager would be dead of a bullet wound on halloween that was virtually guaranteed dart waited for her in the early evening dusk that arrives in october like an unwanted cousin waited beneath a yellow cone of an overhead street lamp waited nervously for a woman he had loved too recently to forget but had loved too strongly to allow himself to fully remember waited as a few earlyfallen oak leaves tumbled across the grass sounding like spilled seashells waited and felt hurt the heat of indian summer had surrendered to the insistent cool of autumn the sky seemed a gloomier color and the air had lost its fragrance for the last two weeks dart had gone about his regular job of domestic assaults and gangrelated homicides but it was the string of suicides that occupied his mind he had reviewed reports studied photographs and kept a keen eye on roman kowalski he had not spoken to abby lang their night in the crib had not gone past kissing and yet they passed each other in the halls with only a furtive glance as if by sharing too much too soon by breaking all kinds of rules together personal and professional they had erected a wall between them ginny wore a dark overcoat that covered her to her ankles a scarf curled loosely around her neck she had parked out on the street and crossed the corner of the park at a brisk pace properly concerned about her choice of location for the rendezvous dart moved out from under the parking lot lamp cloaked by the gray dusk to where the two of them observed from a distance would appear as two indistinguishable forms in a quickly thickening mist hi she said softly unbuttoning her coat and removing an envelope that she then handed him whats this priscilla cole as you asked her med insurance records he had lived with ginny long enough to interpret her expressions the eight months that they had been apart seemed only a matter of days at times like this what about them one of the very seamy sides of the insurance world is the attempt on the part of the insurers toas they put it protect themselves from unforeseen losses unexpected losses if you live in los angeles or san francisco they may deny or limit earthquake coverage if youre a known drunk they may refuse to insure your auto the same practice carries over into medical coverage smokers may be restricted to certain qualified coverage excluding or limiting what will be paid out for emphysema or asthma lung cancer or other pulmonary disorders i follow you there is software in place in every major underwriter to flag possible highrisk cases its insidious but there you are and youre involved i police the software right i keep the code healthy and running all kinds of software including this screening variety it locates and flags questionable accounts that are then reviewed inhouse if necessary the coverage is reduced or even canceled im part of it dart just so you understand not proud of it but part of it dart felt restless and nervous both a product of their surroundings and ginnys blatant anxiety he wanted to hurry her along but knew better she went at her own speedin everything david stapletons claims were not flagged but his girlfriends werethis priscilla cole flagged for what hed hoped that teddy braggs d software was indeed glitched but bragg had gotten back to him complaining that the company claimed the software was errorfree for his own sake he hoped that she might report that priscilla cole had been diagnosed with hiv and that stapleton had taken his own life to avoid its horrors batteredwife syndrome she replied her eyes fixed onto him this was not what dart had expected he had trouble forming his thoughts much less thinking of something pertinent to say his thoughts were stuck on the ice man and gerald lawrenceon sex offense hed been relieved that stapleton had not had any such charges filed against himonly a narco record and that did not connect well with either of the other suicides and now this he thought she explained priscilla cole was repeatedly admitted to emergency rooms with unexplained contusions and fractures vaginal tearing bite marksyou name it the software is written to identify such injuries and flag the account victims of domestic violence are denied coverage by all major insurers but one there are laws being proposed to change that but at the moment thats how it stands she had two policies canceled and was on the verge of losing all coverage because were in the process right now of linking all major health databases once that is complete everyone will know everyone elses secrets there will be no switching companies in an effort to outrun your past or present he said exactly stapleton beat her he stated he could hardly get the words out sex offense he thought we dont know it was stapleton no theres no mention of him but the addresses what about the addresses she nodded the second policy to be canceled had the battles street address that you gave me shit of the three suicides stapleton lawrence and the ice man all werein one way or anotherguilty of violence against women and if someone were targeting these violent men to become victims themselves there were now two clear ways that dart saw to spot them men convicted of sex crimes and men involved with battered women it was a connection that ran tension into his neck and made his fingers cold zeller he wondered again he asked ginny can you get me a list of other women abused women yes i can try i dont want you getting yourself in trouble its not legal if thats what youre saying i could subpoena it if you have a few years you could yes my guess is that theyd deny the existence of any such listit amounts to a form of discrimination after all their claim is that the woman has the choice of leaving the man who is doing this to herthat to stay is a voluntary act its the old she wants it argument they ignore the psychological factors the existence of children and familiesits barbaric is what it is if you could get it for me then at least id have it while i go through the subpoena process but i dont want you taking any chances gin its important to me that you understand that he knew this was the type of challenge she lived forto raid a computer system and lift information but shed been arrested and convicted once alreadya second offense would be far more serious i want to help dart dont ask me why because i dont know exactly maybe i feel guilty about the breakup maybe id like to see us back together i dont really want to think about all that i just want to help it feels awkward to me your helping you asked me to look into it for you did he want to be in debt to her it felt as if that were where they were heading and it didnt feel good she said youre worried about me how sweet he couldnt tell if she was being sarcastic or straight with him and he wondered when it was that he had lost track of such nuances people get so close that they grow apart he thought wondering if every relationship was doomed before it began and feeling an ache deep within him chapter joe dart headed home to spend the rest of his halloween alone he channelsurfed finding nothing but stupid sitcoms with everyone in costume and blackandwhite monster movies with sinister sound tracks two beers later he conjured up the nerve to call abby lang she answered on the third ring and he asked if she was busy and she said not terribly and asked what he had in mind have you ever been a costume judge he asked her together they drove in and around trinity college searching out the best costume dart was the designated driver abby sampled from a thermos of scorpions her mood becoming lighter with each passing mile an hour into it she slid over next to him so that they were like two teenagers cruising main when either of them spotted an awardwinning costume abby would hop out of the car and snap a polaroid using darts crime scene camera she then stood the photos on the dash lined up like mug shots until she accidentally bumped the defrost switch and sent them flying they rated a phosphorescent glowinthedark skeleton highly a monster with green hair and an enormous wartencrusted nose won a place in their top five as did a giant turtle but the blue ribbon went to a group of seven students each dressed as a spear of green asparagus the lot of them bound together around the middle with a blue sash as if contained in a rubber band deciding that seven walking spears of asparagus could not be topped the two headed to abbys downtown loft so that dart could partake of the scorpions the loft was near the train tracks in a nomansland across the bulkeley bridge an area of town unfamiliar to him it was a secondstory loft accessed by a clunky old freight elevator that smelled of sawdust and burning electrical motors and gave dart the impression of entering an abandoned building but on the other side of the steel door to the apartment was a world all abbys she had sanded the wood plank floors back to blond and had hung seven white and green silk parachutes as her ceiling with the fixtures on the other side of the fabric so that the vast open space glowed in a soft flattering light white sheetrock walls defined the kitchen to the right and a bath some partitioned bedrooms an office and closet to the left directly ahead a potbellied wood stove served as the focal point of lawn furniture with green striped cushions including two chaise lounges and a quirky chess set that she used as a side table do you play he asked her as he built a fire at her request is that a comeon she answered chess yes and bridge and tennis and softball and volleyball if its a sand court i cant play indoors anymore where are the kids i dumped them off with a friend she answered then she added for the night and dart felt her answer clear down to his toes thats where im lucky she continued being a oneperson division i can pretty much make my own hours he heard her mixing the drinks he felt that he had somehow invited himself to stay with her and that wasnt his intentionor was it he wondered the bottom line was that he felt awkward stretched out on a chaise lounge beneath a parachute a fire crackling in front of him and a woman four or five years older than he mixing drinks in a kitchen half a block away youre going to love this batch she announced she had pulled off her sweater and unbuttoned the top two buttons of her shirt she had kicked off her shoes so that he could see her toes wiggle nervously as she took the chaise lounge next to him and placed a tray bearing a pitcher of scorpions and their two filled cocktail glasses the paper napkins had gary larson cartoons on them and the swizzle sticks read cactus petes casino jackpot nevada dart felt outgunned she jumped up and put on a cdsouthoftheborder guitar instrumentals he sipped the drinkmixed to killand felt himself relax that was nice what you did for lewellan she said her eyes on the fire arranging with the mother to allow the girl the rabbits a homicide dick with a heartnow theres a concept he felt his face flush hot it just seemed to make sense thats all you dont have to apologize im not going to rat on you i think its sweet trying to steer the topic away from himself he said shes so young i dont know how you do it innocent she asked thats what i wanted to say yes but she isnt is she no not thanks to gerry law i couldnt do your job we each find our calling he wanted to ask her how she had ended up in sex crimes and sex offenses and then he realized that he didnt want to know he admired her he felt a little intimidated could he date a lieutenant packs a punch he said of the drink you can handle it she replied drinking down a liberal amount and wiggling her toes again the music took over punctuated by sparks from the fire she topped off his drink he was well on his way to drunk the turtle was pretty good she said recalling the costumes um dart answered but the asparagus was genius yeah incredible you went kind of weird after our night in the crib she said honestly the booze getting to her was that so bad she added i thought it was fun he looked over at her but she kept her attention on the fire letting him look he finally admitted i enjoyed it i guess i felt awkward i dont know youve been treating me like i dont exist i felt like i forced you into that into kissing you she asked are you kidding she enjoyed some more of the drink into taking my clothes off maybe she laughed it certainly was an interesting first date she rocked her head and looked directly at him her eyes were smiling glassy her lips were a deep red and moist from the drink and if their chaise lounges had been closer together he would have tried to kiss her what are you thinking she asked slyly nervous he confessed good why is that good he questioned i have my reasons abby got up and moved the table with the drinks and pushed her chaise lounge closer to his she teased if this bothers you keep it to yourself im feeling particularly good at the moment and i can be dangerous when i feel this good i like danger he answered reaching out for her hand and taking hers is this all right he asked this is perfect she answered holding a knowing smile on her face dart felt suddenly at risk under her spellher control he fearedand it made him uneasy youre not going to freak out are you she asked you know me already he thought she explained i like your company especially tonight i make no claim to ownership i ask nothing more of you than to relax and enjoy yourself were both adults were allowed this now and then she squeezed his hand in hers as a signal okay with you i needed to hear that good i needed to say it it doesnt make me any less nervous he told her and they both laughedshe confidently he as a form of release she handed him her drink then and with his both his hands occupied she leaned over her shirt falling away from her and she kissed him wetly on the lips she took his breath away and she bit his lower lip and he felt it to his toes he returned the kiss awkwardly juggling the two drinks and her hand found its way inside his shirt and over his chest and he was immediately aroused one thing nice about middle age she whispered into his ear in a way that gave him chills is that you know what you like what makes you feel good she stroked his chestwhat turns you on and even better she added you arent afraid to enjoy yourself she helped him set down the drinks and she climbed over the arms of the chaise lounges and straddled dart and met eyes with him you know she inquired its been a long time he told her by way of apology im a very patient woman she said pulling him forward so that he sat up and tricking the chair into a full recline then she eased him back and lay down atop him and a heat grew where they touched he wrapped his arms around her strongly and held her and she nuzzled her chin into the crook of his neck kissed him once lightly and hummed affectionately theres nothing quite so amazing in this world as a good hug she said sex is over before you know it but the right kind of hug lasts forever is this the right kind he asked you bet she answered thirty minutes later she took darts hand and pulled him out of the chaise lounge and led him around a japanese paper screen to a small bedroom that contained a pine chest two long rows of hanging clothes and on the floor a futon with a down comforter she turned and faced him and pulled the shirt over her head her bra was translucent her nipples hard she undid her jeans and stepped out of them and dart was reminded of their night in the crib she said do me a favor and at least take off your shoes she slipped under the covers her back to him dart undressed fully and climbed in beside her pressing to her back like spoons he reached around her and cupped her breasts and hugged her and she hummed the air trapped in the covers smelled of her arousal and penetrated dart to his core they remained this way for several long minutes dart stroking her breasts lightly abby head bent kissing his arms and hands it felt to him that they had been lovers for a very long time and that they knew each others secrets and pleasures his fingers explored her and she slipped out of her underpants and bra and she found a condom in a bedside box and said something about safe sex and rolled him over and put it on him she kissed him then and rolled them over together so that dart lay atop her gentle at first she requested taking hold of him and rubbing him against her in a way that offered her pleasure and made her shudder rough at the end later they collapsed in a sweaty embrace out of breath and spent with exhaustion she kissed his neck lightly and ran her fingers down his back and giggled approvingly i knew it she said happily the only words she offered she held him tightly and wouldnt let him off of her even after they slipped apart lingering in the glow of the moment will you stay with me she asked uhhuh he answered kissing behind her ear working down her neck and finding her breast and kissing her there too maybe hugging comes in second she said a while later and dart dozed off with a smile on his face a beeping sound emanating from darts clothing awakened them he slipped out of bed i protest she complained you traded out she reminded him he carried the pager into the light of the other room and read the capers phone number off its lcd display he called in to jennings road speaking with sergeant haite he hung up immediately sneaked into the room and collected his things gotta go he told her in a whisper grateful that she unlike ginny would understand such things will you come back she offered please ill try its over in west hartford ill be a couple hours at least why bother with something in west hartford she asked coming more fully awake west hartford was out of their jurisdiction she answered herself immediately confirming that even halfasleep she could think faster than most detectives another suicide she said right he clipped the pager to his belt and checked his sidearm and holster another suicide he confirmed west hartford asked for our help many of the neighboring towns had little more than patrol squads using either hpd or the state police for the bigger investigations any record she asked flicking on the bedside light with no inclination toward modesty she had long since passed the age of pinup girl but she had nothing to hide he hesitated and she asked him a second time a pornography conviction he said im coming with you she announced throwing the covers off dart knew better than to argue orchard road climbed high up a hill offering a spectacular view of the distant city this was the highrent district half a million dollars and up for a threebedroom on an acre woods ponds views beamers rolexes divorces and silicon implants dart pulled the volvo into the curving drive and parked alongside an hpd patrol car in front of the brickandstone twostory house abby yanked the rearview mirror toward her and ran a brush through her hair they both hung their badges around their necks and entered by the front door tunas got the wife upstairs announced patrolman benny webster tanya fische an hpd patrol officer referred to as tuna was clearly websters patrol partner the wife popped a bunch of valium and is in lala land no use to us until morning we aint touched nothing in the study but its a messy one he said eyeing abby lang as if she might have trouble stomaching it single shot up through the roof of the mouth nine millimeter whos on it dart asked kowalski and he answered dart and abby met eyes interrupting the uniformed man something wrong webster asked seeing this everythings just ducky abby answered webster continued and their assistant chief west hartfords dart clarified nolan he said adding the name thats him yeah only he aint here showed up talked to the k he said meaning kowalski and took off it being a suicide and all he didnt seem too bothered wanted to brief his chief and prepare a statement came the voice of roman kowalski he looked tired the buttons on his shirt indicated he had dressed hastily what brings you here he asked dart sergeant haite and you he asked abby she didnt want to explain her having been with dartelli she said for kowalskis benefit and you lieutenant is that what you meant to say detective kowalski glared at her the wife was out with friends til about an hour ago comes home finds the hubby spread all over the study calls nineeleven kowalski eyed abby again and dart realized that maybe he was busy with his arithmetic the entrance foyer had a low ceiling with handhewn dark timbers and plaster that had pieces of yellow hay stuck into it to darts left a graycarpeted stairway ascended to the second floor he passed a small stone column supporting a wicker basket filled with trickortreat candy and fresh fruit he thought that on this of all nights halloween there would have been should have been potential witnesses around and about did she find the house locked or open he asked kowalski if you want to sit in the fucking bleachers and watch i got no problem kowalski said but if you want to play twenty questions fucking take it somewhere else you know whats amazing about you abby told kowalski stepping past him and moving toward the open study door is how delicately you handle the language he opened his mouth to reply but she cut him off raising a finger at him and be careful what you say to your superiors detective with extra venom she added cause ill bust you down to traffic given half the chance dart smiled at kowalski and raised his eyebrows taunting him stepping up to dartelli kowalski said earnestly im waiting on buzz before i go in there dont touch a fucking thing he pulled a pack of marlboros from his coat pocket and stuck one in his mouth ill be outside the study was the size of darts studio kitchen and sitting area combined oriental rugs dark antiques a stoneandbrick fireplace with two gargoyles supporting the fourinch thick burl walnut mantel a substantial puddle of blood on the rug below the deceased splatter pattern on the ceiling consistent with the top of a human head coming off an oil portrait of a man with a bulbous red nose who lived back when the river trade kept hartford prosperous ruled from above the mantel leatherbound books crammed the shelves looking both untouched and unread window dressing dart noticed a few spaces between the volumes like missing teeth the body was a mess draped over a walnut chair with a needlepoint cushion what remained of the head was angled back away from the blast and discharge of the weapon the top half of the mans clothes was brown with drying bloodbuckets of it harold c payne abby lang read fingering a mailing label on a copy of arts and antiques left on a cherry side table in the hall i didnt recognize him without his face you remember him cyberporn fuck shots and dcup starlets over the internet mailorder photocdrom digitized pornography the feds brought him down but i was consulted yeah i remember him sounds like a real sweetheart dart said piece of work this one hired himself four attorneys and got himself acquitted on all but the mailorder charge if im remembering right dart wasnt about to question her memory she said the whole area of pornography over the internet remains a little fuzzyyoull pardon the expression its still being sorted out is there a file on him in sex crimes dart questioned she met eyes with him understanding what he was asking no she answered simply but delivering the message that she did not appreciate the implications of his question her eyes said no one gets in my files without me knowing about it attempting to change subjects dart pointed out the snifter of cognac on the partners desk a spilled ashtray at the foot of the deceaseds chair and the butt of a cigar on the rug it appeared that payne had poured himself a drink had a smoke and then ate a barrel a walnut armoire was wedged into the corner immediately to the left the rest of that wall was floortoceiling bookshelves four leaded windows occupied most of the wall behind the desk where a computer was set up on a custombuilt return before bragg and the others arrived while he still had a moment of peace dart studied the crime scene a husband left alone while the wife went to a party a glass of cognac a cigar and a bullet through the roof of his mouth the perfect suicide he thought believing to his very core that payne had been murdered on the edge of the desk he spotted what appeared to be a guncleaning kit and what was clearly a box of shells no suicide note that he could see but the wife might have found one the gun hung awkwardly from the dead mans right thumb dart could predict that paraffin tests would confirm that the same hand had fired the weapon and he wondered how that could have been accomplished unlike the other suicides he viewed this one as the audience views a magic show looking for the tricks he tried to reconstruct how a zeller or a kowalski could paint so clear a picture a speed key or other lockpicking device could get a killer insideno trick there but then what overpower payneknock him unconscious careful to tap him on that part of his head that would later shatter when the bullet entered you would have to know about the gun he thought some advance work would have to be done but guns were registered and most home weapons were kept in bedside drawers or on the top shelves of closets what ate at him was the absence of physical evidence at the stapleton jump the trace evidencecrucial to any investigationgave no indication of the presence of a mystery visitor the lawrence hanging evidence had come in the same way teddy braggs report indicated finding some copper filings on the bodythese from the lamp cord used for the hanging the anticipated random cotton and synthetic fibers typical to any floor and head and body hairs but only from the victim no evidence to suggest foul play the scenario before him placed out the same wayit appeared a straightahead suicide having been trained in criminalistics this is where dart put his faiththe transference of evidence was virtually impossible to avoid hairs and fibers were in a constant state of exchange the person entering a room deposited such evidence the person leaving a room carried such evidence with him every variety of organic matter from leaves to pollen carfloor carpeting clothing food seeds hairs dirt and dust it seemed inconceivable that the suicides had been staged without any such evidence being shedand dart knew that this was exactly what the prosecuting attorney would say no evidence no case webster wandered over to check on them and abby asked him did the wife enter the study says she did yeah said she felt for his pulsehis left hand he chuckled can you imagine thinking that the thing in that chair might have a pulse you talk about dreaming how long was she in the room dart asked him dont know didnt say dart his mind on fiber evidence dropped to one knee and brought his head nearly to the floor looking into the room to webster dart said she was wearing slippers blue fuzzy slippers is that right he glanced up at the patrolman who appeared not to remember i ah find out yes sir webster took off a brisk pace and dart could hear him charging up the stairs what abby asked kneeling get down low dart demonstrated nearly touching his ear to the floor abby teased i love it when you talk dirty and then duplicated his actions see them the fibers he asked play with your focus he instructed got em she exclaimed excitedly blue fibers yup and do you see where they lead to the armoire not to the body yup and she rocked her head and they were nearly kissing both of them with their ears to the hardwood floor theres a dark swath cut down the rug between here and the deceased youre good dart told her her bottom was sticking high in the air and for a moment he wasnt thinking about fiber evidence and theres a lighter swath between the armoire and the desk the nap is worn down thats a hell of a lot of trips to the armoire she pointed out i agree and the darker swath she asked the nap is raised he pointed out its going a different direction from the rest of the nap why she asked exactly with the pieces coming together in his head dart wanted into the room and was tired of waiting for teddy bragg he told abby wait here dont let anyone inside joe he hurried off in the foyer he ran into webster just coming down the stairs the patrolman confirmed blue fuzzy slippers detective shes still wearing them kowalski was admiring the view working on his second cigarette as dart passed him kowalski asked are you fucking her dartelli dart kept walking the reason i ask is she has that look you know all rosy around the chest and neck a little more smiley than normal for her and because on account of im only seeing your car out here so im thinking the two of you rode together and its kinda late for that dart reached his car she any good dartelli you know if what they say about how a womans lips are the same in both places id say you scored big shut up kowalski dart said fishing two pairs of shoe covers and latex gloves out of the back of the volvo where dart kept a firstaid kit a flak vest and an evidence collection kit real nice mouth on her kowalski said dart shut the back of the wagon and heard a vehicle approaching probably teddy he realized deciding to hurry he passed kowalski but then stopped he said you know i used to think that youre as dumb as everyone says you are as dumb as you act the big mans head pivoted and he looked into darts eyes dart continued if youve fucked with these crime scenes in any way im going to have your ass smoke flowed out of kowalskis nose and he squinted at dart with such loathing that the detective thought he might take a swing at him tell teddy that i went in without him you cant do that kowalski protested dart held up the paper shoe covers so stop me he turned and went inside at the study door with braggs step van just pulling up outside dart and abby slipped the paper shoe covers over their shoes and donned latex gloves dart told her i want you to guide me keep me away from the blue fibers wherever possible and off that raised nap dart kept close to the near wall and reached the armoire without requiring any directions from abby exactly what are you looking for she asked he opened the armoire revealing a large television and an assortment of stereo equipment he ran his gloved hand blindly along the interior of the piece of furniture whats up joe she asked darts fingers bumped a stout piece of metal concealed beneath the first shelf he hooked it pushed it pulled it pop the edge of the armoire jumped away from the wall dart slid his fingers into the crack and pulled it open like a door jesus she gasped stay close to the wall he advised abby joined him dart pulled the armoire all the way open and found the interior light switch they heard the front door open and the voices of kowalski and teddy bragg dont touch anything dart said as he led the way into the hidden room the room had no windows the area closest to the hidden door was laid out like a computervideo laboratory the remainder dedicated to library stacks crowded with books of every shape and size cloth and leatherbound on closer examination the books appeared worn and quite old one of the stacks held several long rows of video tapes ten to one abby said this is the evidence that the feds never found the electronic equipment included two computers a white table several lights on tripods two video cameras a scanner a color laser printer and a multiline telephone nice gear dart said major money she said a vcr and twentyseveninch television occupied a separate table kowalski entered behind them dart looked first at his shoes furious the man had not worn shoe coversin theory any hairsandfibers evidence was now contaminated this kind of behavior was so typical of the man that dart realized mentioning it was useless kowalski was useless kowalski stepped over and opened one of the leatherbound books gloves dart chastised but the man had already touched the book kowalski ignoring dart completely flipped though the pages geez enough to make even me blush abby peered over his shoulder and dart watched as her face reddened noticeably she looked quickly away stepped back and coughed clearing her throat i thought you was tough lang kowalski teased gloves kowalski dart said irritably yeah yeah gloves dart repeated stealing the book from the detective dart glanced at it the photograph in question depicted a naked woman suspended beneath a horse via a leather harness in a challenge of proportions she was engaged in intercourse with the stud nothing left to the imagination dart slapped the book shut revolted kowalski had the tact to say you ever play horsey lang wearing latex gloves now he took the book from dart opened it and said oh my god this ones doing it with flipper for crying in your beer fucking a porpoise dartelli get a load geez what a pecker those things have cool it dart reprimanded kowalski held the book up in front of the woman what is that abigail a porpoise or a dolphin she averted her eyes no thanks dart took the book away once again enough he added act like a detective just once easy fred kowalski said back to him as an obvious warning he towered over dart by a good three inches and outweighed him by sixty pounds just having a little fun is all he glanced at abby and back to dart she got no reason being here anyway darts mind froze abby spoke up smut like this and youre wondering what sex crimes is doing here get a clue kowalski she pulled a leatherclad book from the shelf obviously incredibly old she gently opened the volume latin she said studying it twelfthcentury drawings she turned the pages shaking her head at what she saw it appears the roman clergy enjoyed pornography returning the bestiality book to the shelves dart told kowalski about the federal charges against payne and abbys earlier involvement kowalski didnt seem to be listening he seized upon the same booka kid in a candy storeopened it and asked hey dartelli would you recognize a boa constrictor if you saw one he had the arrogance to laugh what about half of one he looked up at abby lang and said talk about getting snaked once again dart stepped over to kowalski but he was spared the confrontation by ted bragg who entered and in an angry voice condemned them all for having entered the room before he had a chance to go over it this is a crime scene not a convention he complained get out dart said to kowalski go ahead tell him about the rug kowalski looked paralyzed the rug dart repeated cherishing the moment what the fuck are you talking about lieutenant dart asked abby she said to bragg the wife claims to have entered and checked the body fiber evidence contradicts this what the fuck kowalski blurted out she continued we have her crossing the room to the bookshelf the desk and here to this room further evidence suggests a variance in the nap of the rug between the door and the deceased photos of that would be good to have before the place is walked all over nap bragg inquired dart answered someone vacuumed that section of the rug buzz long before we got here vacuumed bragg asked what the fuck kowalski repeated looking directly at kowalski dart said someone hoping to remove hairsandfibers evidence in an effort to conceal what really went on here bragg his annoyance showing said and what really went on here ivy its a homicide buzz i want it treated as a homicide whos lead on this bragg inquired kowalski stunned and out of sorts had yet to break eye contact with dartelli im lead he announced authoritatively defiantly and until you tell me that we got evidence to the contrary teddy we treat it the way we see it a suicide you got any reason to doubt that then im willing to change horses if and when we make sense of it to dart he said you have information i dont have dart just stared at the man he was thinking that hed gone too far that it was time to close ranks chapter not even the bathroom would work for his purposes dart needed someplace isolated someplace there was no chance of being overheard and preferably a location that wouldnt raise eyebrows he ruled out either of the interrogation rooms because they would attract far too much attention he ruled out the cribtoo easily interrupted a vehicle would work he realized though getting the two of them into the same car would take some logistics and at this point some negotiating and then he hit upon it the elevator kowalskis use of the elevator in what was only a twostory building was the subject of much teasing within capers the opportunity arose a few minutes after the lunch hour when both dart and kowalski were summoned to teddy braggs office dart found kowalski playing computer solitaire on a pc that belonged to another detective kowalski offered no apologies for using his time this way instead he said just a minute okay dartelli i almost got this thing dart waited him out his impatience mounting finally kowalski lost the hand closed the game off the screen and spun around in his chair piece of shit he said you played the jack of diamonds on the wrong pile dart informed him not fully understanding why he began with confrontation bullfuckingshit i did i suppose you play the game more than me huh i dont think so mind your own fucking business bragg wants us downstairs he has the initial workup on payne sure why not as kowalski stood out of the chair dart was reminded how large and how solid the man was suddenly the idea of a oneonone confrontation in an elevator didnt seem like such a stroke of brilliance but it was all he had and he intended to follow through as they entered the hallway kowalski asked you taking the stairs making it sound like a chore no lets ride he said clearly surprising the man he stabbed the call button and a moment later they stepped into the empty elevator car he felt his heart pounding and the pulsing of a fatigue headache at his temples this was a little bit like deciding to ride a wild bull he realized he pushed the button marked and the elevator doors slid shut he tried to settle his nerves knowing full well that kowalskis reaction would be indignation dart counted to three and pulled the red stop button the car jerked to a halt hey what the fuck dart faced the man kowalski had dark mediterranean skin haunting brown eyes and heavy masculine features if he had been fifteen years younger he would have been working guess jeans ads his center teeth were stained from smoking the nonfilters and his voice sounded like someone chipping ice dart explained lewellan page who lewellan pagethe girl who witnessed the lawrence murder kowalski made a move for the elevator control panel but dart blocked his effort get this thing moving he complained i wanted to talk in private dart explained the point is not to embarrass you but to understand your thinking your reasoning an oxymoron if he ever heard one lawrence like talking to a bull elephant the suicide over on battles dart reminded the hanging the detective asked rhetorically the case finally registering dart couldnt tell if the man was acting or not every detective had an actor inside oh her kowalski said yeah her dart agreed whats to tell you interviewed her you wrote up that interview and you kept it out of your report why kowalski looked confuseda child trying to connect the dots he had to be wondering just how dart had gained such knowledge what else the detective knew and how it all impacted him he stuttered shes a kid ivy what the fuck attempting once again to reach past dart he said anxiously get this thing movingthis is giving me the creeps in here it wasnt the elevator but the topic making him nervous dart realized shes a witness he said emphatically bullshit shes a bored nigger kid who sees whites as bad the only whites shes ever seen are cops they come and take people away they make trouble get a clue dartelli she gets me by the cajones and tries to invent some story about a guy doing lawrence i mean give me a fucking break will you how do you operate this thing he stepped forward dart maintained his position between kowalski and the panel not good enough dart warned she witnessed a caucasian male pulling a chair out from underneath lawrence she described the mans flailing legs perfectly i think she actually saw it youre saying she invented it probably saw it in a movie or something how the fuck should i know did you bother with any of the rest of it there was a note i think the place was locked up no sign of a struggle no evidence to suggest foul play whats the fucking big deal dart felt confused he believed lewellan pages story kowalski had investigated david stapleton while on narco did dart dare play that card as well was lawrence involved in trafficking dart asked hoping to see a reaction in kowalski that might tell him something drugs how the hell would i know some pot found in the apartment it seems to me nothing hard core that i heard about kowalskis expression revealed nothingno surprise no panic dont trust it dart cautioned himself let me tell you something dartelli i dont want no rogue cop prying into my cases okay you got problems with the way im doing things you go through ia and well see what they say your buddies at ia you mean dart said caustically fuck off are you listening to me he stepped forward an intimidating presence what im saying is i dont appreciate your working my files without asking me okay showing up at crime scenes uninvited what is it with you you go through channels from now on here dart realized was the ultimate in irony a cop known for his misuse of the system telling dart that he should play by the rules the hypocrisy caused dart to laugh and throw his head back youre too much he said then in a whisper as if he believed he might be overheard even on a stopped elevator kowalski leaned in closely to dart and said in his coarse voice listen to me dartelli okay lets say that some white guy did do lawrence that nighthypothetically speaking a big white guy on the edge of bellevue square at night lets think about this now how many candidates do we have for this person huh he held up his meaty hand and raised a single chunky finger one a junkie in need of a fix that would mean lawrence was a dealer which we have no proof of that would also probably mean a struggle of some kind okay so wheres the evidence two what other damn fool would be ballsy enough to visit the square after dark who but a junkie goes into that area at night not even the fucking cabs for chrissakes theres only one answer isnt there okay he glared at dart neither man was going to say the word that teased their tongues im not real upset about some pervert like lawrence ending up hanging from a wire and i sure as hell am not going to use some twelveyearold abused and abandoned nigger girl to rip open an investigation that could lead where we both know it could lead okay whats the point lets just drop it dart shook his head we cant drop it oh for chrissakes get off of your fucking white horse we let it go because hes a sex offender is that it fuck off or because it might involve one of us i didnt say that kowalski protested sure you did the control panel buzzed as someone called the stopped elevator kowalski said you think justice is just left to us thats bullshit were way the hell down on that food chain justice isnt up to usits up to the courts oh come on kowalski protested i mean us human beings theres other kinds of justice you know theres laws of the jungle you stick your dick in a twelveyearold and shit happens to youcar loses a wheel on the highway fucking radio falls into your bathtub how the fuck do i know a cop fakes your suicide dart completed maybe yeah just maybe and who the fuck cares dartelli are you honestly sorry that this maggot ate shit and died you crying for this guy fuck him fuck anyone like him david stapleton harold payne dart said and then he realized by kowalskis expression just how thick the man could be by all appearances kowalski had not made the connection until that momentone hell of a performance if thats what it was fuck me kowalski said they probably would have liked to dart answered but in his heart of hearts he ached if kowalskis surprise was legitimate then dart could remove him from suspicion which left only one other on some level he knew that the killer could be any one of hundredsthousandsof people but that did not register one face one name dominated his thoughts walter zeller he stepped out of the way of the panel kowalski got the elevator moving again the floor bounced kowalski cautioned you bring that girl into it and youre in for some serious trouble im telling ya dart nodded he saw kowalski and his possible involvement in a different light though he wasnt sure whether to trust it or not wherever this leads dartelli cautioned then thats the way it is you want to play boy scout go join a troop being called a boy scout was among a handful of the most derogatory labels used among fellow officers kowalski added lawrence got what he deserved the car stopped moving and the doors opened kowalski took one step toward freedom reconsidered and turned to face dartelli no thats not true he got off light if id done it he said convincingly id have cut off his cock shoved it down his throat and let him choke to death dart didnt move from the elevator car thinking if you had done it we would have caught you whoever had staged these suicides had done so brilliantly and again dart could think of only one chapter as difficult as it was for him to face it dart realized that he had to locate walter zeller and question him informally he convinced himselfat least at first he would make it appear that he was seeking zellers advice the protege returning to the feet of the mentor but he no longer had any doubt it had to be done at least three men were dead dart believed he knew why they had been selected it was time to act before there were more for the last few months the word around the department had been that after a brief stint with a security firm in hartford zeller had been offered a better job in seattle dart had believed all along that better job or not it was important for zeller to move on preferably as far away from his wifes murder as possible seattle certainly fit that bill but try as he did dart failed to raise a seattle phone number for the former sergeant either through the personnel office directory information or through any of the many friends zeller had left behind he was able to obtain a seattle address for zellera box number on first avenueand to determine that zellers pension checks were directdeposited into a first interstate bank account but beyond that the trail ended officials at the bank had the same box number no residential address no phone number none of this came as any great surprise to dart or put him off his effort most police officers retired or not protect themselves from possible revenge attacks by maintaining unpublished phone numbers and using post office boxes for mailing addresses zeller whose desire for privacy was legendary and who had put away dozens of killers could be expected to take such precautions while running an errand on a tuesday in early november dart drove past sam and robs smoke shop on asylum street and pulled over a block later in direct violation of federal import restrictions sam and robs sold a variety of cuban cigars out of their back room to preferred customers during his twenty years of public service walter zeller had been a regular customer and had developed a friendship with the owners the shop smelled of fresh pipe tobacco rob the older of the two proprietors had died of lung cancer five years earlier his brother sam in his late fifties was bald with a brown mustache and red cheeks and high cheekbones he wore a tattered green apron with the name of the shop embroidered in dull red thread his shirt cuffs were threadbare and a button had been replaced on one of them he had a smokers voice and a gamblers nervous eyes he didnt seem to recognize dart until the detective mentioned zellers name at which point an association was made for years dart had wandered the shelves of this outer room while zeller had negotiated for the cubans in the back after the introductions were made dart told him that he had a difficult investigation on his hands and that he had lost track of zeller i thought that he might have had you send him some cigarsthat you might have an address or a phone number he went to seattle sam informed him needlessly vancouver gets all the cuban brandscanada you know no restrictions so you havent heard from him heard from him sam repeated he was in here not three weeks ago bought several boxes of here in the store i hadnt seen him in a couple years still too thin he was complaining about a dominican hed been smoking and how they dont measure up no question his cigar has a hint of cocoa in the wrap you cant find that in any of the dominicans theres only one cigar for each of us he said like a salesman do you smoke a cigar no have you tried it no thanks three weeks ago three or four yes and before that sam considered this a moment hadnt seen him in years when he came in here three weeks ago how much did he buy dart asked three or four boxes i think it was and how long will that last him the sergeant a while anyway he thought a moment and said a month or more and its been about a month dart said yeah thats right isnt it sure i see what youre saying maybe i can put him in touch with you dart thought fast and spoke his mind or better yet he said i could leave you my number and if he came in maybe you could stall him long enough for me to get over here and surprise him call you ya mean right i like that sure i like putting people together thats one thing about cigars he advised they bring people together after a good meal a poker game after a round of golfits a social activity smoking is staying here or visiting dart inquired did you get a feel for that visiting i think he wasnt very talkative not the same man by any means but who can blame him i dont think any man could recover from losing his wife that way sams face tightened and dart had the feeling that the loss of his own brother hung over him as well its not easy the man whispered confirming darts suspicions a feeling of dread swarmed through dart like the first hint of the flu it seemed implausible that zeller would have visited the city and not looked up a single frienddart had touched base with everyone he could think of dart handed the shopkeeper his business card call me right away would you please i love a good surprise the man said yeah dart answered this will be a hell of a surprise walter zeller was not a rich man having earned a policemans salary for twentytwo years and so it had confused even his closest friends when he left the city and refused to sell his housethe house where his wife had been raped and murdered he owned the house free and clear and it represented his single biggest asset and yet he had refused to sell giving no explanation for dartelli no explanation was needed perhaps he was the only one of zellers friends to understand that part of the man that specific quality that would have made selling the house a further violation of his wife lucky zeller had treasured the housea rather common tract home in vernon the house was a brown ranch at the end of a culdesac in a subdivision that hosted rvs powerboats and camper tops for pickup trucks dogwood lane was oil stained from parked cars its concrete gutters looking like chipped teeth the limbs of the few mature trees bare with winters approach reached for a sky of gray cloud and cold wind dart parked in zellers driveway wondering if he had quietly moved back from seattle without telling anyone the buildings brown siding was stained gray where water from lawn sprinklers had soaked it dart felt a pang of nostalgia troubled by the sight of the unattended gardens and he knew in that instant that zeller was not living here the sergeant renowned for his green thumb for the endless hours he lavished on his plants and gardens would never have allowed his beds to go unattended a fourfoot apron of bare earth choked by clumps of dead weeds surrounded the house a few of the flower islands that had been cut into the small lawn by zellers own hands had been covered over with gray gravel buried as lucky had been dart thought knocking sharply on the front door there was no answer no sound of anyone inside no surprise he thought as he walked around the house and into the backyard which flooded him with memories of barbecues beer and long discussions of the cases they had worked together he could recall luckys cooking and the sound of her high voice despite the passage of time the image of her bound and gagged corpse called up effortlessly and struck dart with a pain in the center of his chest and a stinging in his eyes the three years that it had remained vacant had taken its toll the deck needed painting as did the trim around the windows he climbed onto the deck and knocked on the back door and peered through filthy windows at a kitchen that he had at one time considered almost his own memories continued to plague him mixing with images of the suicide victims his police half battled with his friendship half his suspicions contradicting his faith and trust in walter zeller the similarities between the suicide jumps of the ice man and david stapleton were impossible to overlook the lack of a suicide note the computer simulation confirming the bodies had been thrown from the windows and for the better part of three years dart had believed without knowing that walter zeller was to blame for the ice man he tried several windows all locked he wasnt about to break in by the look of the place zeller had never returned dart knew that the inside had been left exactly as it had been on the night of luckys murder he had no great urge to visit that nightmare again he walked fully around the house and climbed into his volvo and sat parked in the drive for several long minutes contemplating zellers possible involvement a chill ran through him head to toe and back to the center of his chest he loved walter zeller like a brother like a father in a way that others wouldnt understand he didnt know if he possessed the strength required to do what had to be done the mere suggestion of zellers culpability seemed itself a crime certainly something that could not be raised with sergeant haite and the powersthatbe without a stack of evidence walter zeller was the closest thing to a true hero that jennings road had ever produced to arrest walter zeller on suspicion of murder would crush morale the brass was certain to resist it without the smoking gun glued into zellers hand and twentyfive nuns as witnesses dart could think of a dozen reasons to drop this investigation and very few to continue with it but he backed the volvo out of the drive focused on finding zeller and connecting him to the crimes his trust and faith converted to anger and resentment chapter the following day dart abby and little lewellan page made the fortyfiveminute drive to sheffield through a cool but gorgeous afternoon mac the knife patrolled the back of the volvo lewellan offering her hand to lick the spine of mountains bearing the northern stretch of the appalachian trail were frosted with the first hints of winter lewellan who had never been out of the bellevue square area of north hartford sat quietly in the backseat eyes wide with awe asking a nonstop stream of questions tommy templeton was well into his fifties since dart had seen him last his hair had gone completely gray he was a big solid man shaped like a barrel with legs he had rough hard hands that looked more like a carpenters than an artists he had a deep voice kind eyes and a small scar below his lip greeting the three of them at the front door of his hilltop home he shook hands with abby and lewellan and admonished dart six years ive been up here and youve never visited youve called what once not allowing dart the opportunity to respond he welcomed them into his home with its antique furnishings and spectacular sixtymile view of the rolling hills of western connecticut the ceilings were low and the floors creaked under foot the living room smelled of woodsmoke and pine needles teddy has made it over to fish a couple times doc ray too dart had heard about those weekends more drinking than fishing maybe i could make the next one dart lied what about you lewellan templeton asked do you like to fish i like fish sticks she replied they all laughed abby put her arm around the girl and held her closely a people person tommy templetons real gift as a police artist had been his ability to make friends quickly and to coax images from the unwilling minds of his witnesses his was the craft of instant friendships since he had been divorced and left the force six years earlier templeton had lived alone creating commercial art for the tourist shops in southern maine he painted seagulls and fishing trawlers and he drank too much and got out too little there was no escaping the rumor mill of hpd despite the view tommy templeton worked in a studio with the shades drawn because sunlight compromised his computer screens the computer geartwo flatbed scanners a color laser printer and a pair of macintoshes occupied the tops of three doors supported by roughwood sawhorses and steel file cabinets cables and wires ran between them in a confusing tangle he had pinned various pieces of computer art both color and blackandwhite on his walls there were nudes landscapes wildlife and three selfportraits the images some of them vaguely familiar to dart were impressive like many artists templeton carried an aura of eccentricity there was a duck decoy wearing a pair of reading glasses in the far corner that immediately grabbed abbys attention but it was the fullfrontal nude that captured lewellans attention shes beautiful the young woman said shes titled venus tommy templeton said proudly i morphed her whats that mean shes a composite photograph do you know what a composite is its like pasting several photographs on top of one another except that you can see through them venus is a combination of seven different photographs qualities from each lets not get into details dart thought examining the vargaslike round breasts wide hips narrow waist long legs and square shoulders toms fantasy girl seemed more appropriate although the photographic quality of the image made this woman appear absolutely real knowing that she was not made the effect disarming ill show you templeton said as he sat lewellan down into a chair in front of an oversize computer screen dart and abby stepped back allowing templeton to take over the man called up a file on the computer and five vehicles appeared onscreen below them was an interestinglooking contraptiona cross between the space shuttle and a porsche that on examination contained some element of each this is exactly what were going to do he explained you and me he said as went about scanning each of the five mug shots that lewellan page had identified as the man that she had seen outside of gerald lawrences apartment on the night of his hanging with the photographs onscreen and in front of lewellan he asked do you recognize these lewellan she nodded were going to see if we can combine these into the man you saw okay okay templeton talked her through a careful examination of each of the mug shots asking her to identify exactly which feature of which shot looked most like the man she had witnessed he began with the shape of the head lewellan picked the third man tommy templeton placed a series of black dots around this face omitting the hair and then clicked a button on the mouse and connected them all after a few mousecontrolled instructions this same face hairless and without ears appeared in the empty box at the bottom of the large screen dragging a small black square across the screen with the mouse he then erased the contents of the face itself and only the shape of the head remained this empty head looked ghostly and odd to dart who stood behind the two of them abbys fingers brushed against darts hand and she slipped hers into his and they hooked together holding hands the chins not right lewellan told the former police artist okay lets change that he erased the chin here he said handing her an aluminum pen with a wire attached do you want to draw it she tried several times and on her fourth attempt appeared satisfied templeton worked with the image for a momenthis artists eye knowing how to improve itat which point she declared thats good thats real good they worked together light pen and mouse and highlighted two different sets of eyes each of which lewellan felt contained something of the man she had seen templeton instructed the computer to merge the two the computer then animated the evolution from photo a to photo b stepping through a series of frames with each successive frame the eyes of photo a grew more similar to those in photo b lewellan studied each of these individual frames selected one and templeton then merged these eyes into the empty face in the bottom box this concept of everchanging slightly altered frames was what made morphing so effective dart realized with an identikit the witness was only given a choice of eyes number eyes number etc with morphing the features of several different faces could be made to evolve into a single face with no one feature of the final composition exactly as it was in any of the others the department should have this dart let slip as the face in the bottom box slowly grew to something recognizable tommy templetons eyes flashed darklythe argument for better technology among other issues had contributed to his early retirement an hour later the suspects face had eyes eyebrows and hair they took a break and stood on the porch and templeton smoked three cigarettes in a row lewellan and tommy templeton talked about the special effects in terminator and jurassic park dart watched a small plane make for the horizon abby lang her coat wrapped around her as a blanket drank in the lateafternoon sun they resumed their work by concentrating on noses this time it took three successive morphings to produce a nose that satisfied lewellan and then only after tommy templeton had touched it up with a computerized airbrush dart had wandered off to study some of the artwork and it was only as he returned to check up on their progress that he realized the eyes were familiar to him this realization stopped him cold the suspect still lacked a mouth and ears are you okay abby asked it was dark out dart didnt know how long he had been standing there lost in thought but it had been at least forty or fifty minutes templeton and lewellan page took another break to rest their eyes and templeton found some pretzels for them to eat when the two went back to work at the computers dart and abby took mac for a walk mac walked like an arthritic boxer hobbling along his collar jingling do you want to spend the night tonight she asked dart had been doing more and more of that lately they had not discussed their relationship on any serious terms but he thought about her often and he missed her when a couple of days passed without contact id like that he said good me too he told her he would need to drop mac at his apartment and offered to pick up some dinner on the way back over she told him that she would cook chicken if he made a salad and with that they had dinner planned he felt a slight pang of guilt and he missed ginny and it made him wonder if she had gotten any further with her attempt to compile the list for him and how he hadnt heard from her in a few weeks youre off somewhere abby said just thinking thats all they returned to the house in silence she took his hand again she wore gloves dart did not we could use more time like this she said dart wasnt sure how to reply to that so he let it go he led the dog back to the car how many kids grow up like lewellan he asked sadly she had never seen the woods except on television her entire image of the outside world is from television what kind of society are we creating save one life you save the world she quoted its overwhelming he said shell never forget this experience abby offered maybe by losing gerry law we gain lewellan page i doubt it dart admitted yeah she agreed me too but it was a nice thought they reentered the house tommy templetons voice could be heard congratulating the girl the two still on their break were looking at a coffee table book of wild animal photographs are you going to look lewellan asked dart is it done dart asked not quite templeton asked abby sat down with the girl and the book and templeton came over to dart and motioned dart out onto the deck which produced an immediate anxiety in the detective tommy templetons face part shadow part light looked like a mask and offered dart a disturbed expression were getting close he said though it sounded more like a warning what is it tommy maybe nothing what im not sure the face dart asked yes it looks familiar dart stated templeton nodded the eyes who templeton shook his head who tommy dart repeated doesnt make any sense and besides the rest of the face doesnt work at all who i cant make it out he said but it sure as hell seems familiar to me dart nodded i know the eyes yeah weird isnt it the man asked dart didnt answer he asked do we trust this i do shes good came the reply which is not exactly what youre asking is it is this the face she saw or is it someone she has seen since and has convinced herself otherwise we both know the score with eyewitnesses joe dont we theyre about as reliable as the mail but she has a face in her headi guarantee you that whether its real or imagined i cant tell you half an hour later templeton called abby and dart into his studio his heart pounding strongly dart approached the computer screen but templeton directed him away the printer templeton said pointing weve enlarged it its just coming out the four of them stepped up to the laser printer where a piece of paper was being slowly ejected upside down so that only the white of the paper showed dart wanted to grab it and flip it over but he waited for it to finish printing templeton picked it up and turned it over the image was that of a face it looked so much like a photograph that dart briefly forgot that it was not lifelike and human dart reached out and touched the sheet of paper feeling an incredible sense of relief the face was jowly the brow strong the high cheekbones reminded him of an irishman try as he did he could no longer make the face into that of walter zeller even the eyes looked different he felt giddy he felt high as if hed been drinking theres your man templeton said handing dart the image thats him lewellan page confirmed dart felt both confusion and happiness it was one time he felt thrilled to be wrong about the identification of a suspect but his stomach rolled and his bowels loosened when at the door saying goodbye tommy templeton leaned in close to him and whispered id like to play with this image joe ill fax you a copy if i get anything but i thought dart complained his euphoria popped like a balloon his objection interrupted by templeton inside every face theres another face templeton cautioned in a sinister tone of voice call it instinct call it a hunch this isnt the face that i expected abby saw the two men whispering and caught eyes with dart her face a knot of concern lewellan page ran out to the car and opened the back door and petted the dog let me work with it templeton told the detective ill give you a call leave it alone dart wanted to say but he nodded wishing that secrets could stay hidden and that a persons face could never change chapter theres no question in my mind that the rug in paynes study was vacuumed sometime just before the suicide but not being a detective bragg said sarcastically i dont see how that might bear upon the investigation teddy bragg looked better today more color to his face less to his eyes he smelled like cigarettes the file for the halloween suicide harold payne lay open on his desk the small office was cluttered with paperwork a lucite microscope a forensic science award sat in the corner gathering dust alongside a canning jar containing a pancreas suspended in a clear fluid dart had never asked about the pancreas but hed seen it there for years lights glowed on a small fm clock radio indicating it was switched on but the volume was evidently turned down before the suicide dart asked curiously definitely prior to the shooting yes weve lifted blood splatter from the surface of the rug whats the point kowalski asked irritably bragg answered the point detective is who vacuumed that rug when and why we checked with the wife who explained that the housecleaner had been there the same day but for reasons that ill get into that doesnt cut it she was in therethe wife dart reminded ahead of our arrival yes so she could be lying kowalski glanced over at dart with a look that penetrated perhaps dart thought he too understood that this might lead back to zeller bragg cautioned we know by the vacuum patternthe width of the swaththat it wasnt any of the machines in the house furthermore weve checked the bags of the two machines and ided wool fibers with the proper dye lot to match the study rugand that tells us two things one the rug was vacuumed possibly that same day two someone else using a different machine vacuumed the rug after the housecleaner but before the suicide the upstairs canister vacuum he continued would appear to have resided upstairs and only worked the upstairs to dart he said you know how i hate inconsistencies like this its petty bullshit i know but it bugs the crap out of me kowalski complained it doesnt matter he added not to me does it affect your ruling in any way roman great minds think alike bragg said i asked myself the same question does any of this matter the kill is by his own hand its cleanin a manner of speakingand convincing so what do we care exactly but we do care bragg contradicted all because of one tiny piece of evidence kowalskis brow knitted whats that you see bragg said to dart these portable batterycharged vacuums dont get up much horsepower these dustbuster things oh theyre fine for crumbs on the counter or spilled sugar but you put them to work on an oriental wool rug like we find in paynes study and they just dont measure upnot when measured against our industrialstrength twentyamp variety its like one of those cheap television ads on cable you vacuum an area with yours and well go over the top of the same area with ours and lift a good amount of material that your vacuum missed and thats just what happened he met eyes with both menin braggs dart could see a contained but eager excitement scientists have to get their kicks somewhere he thought ted bragg motioned for them to sit tight and went off in search of something he returned a moment later with two wax paper bags he placed them down on a light table and set a ruler between them he then carefully opened each bag and drew the contents out onto the light table with a set of plastic chopsticks he was careful and exact with his actions on the left is what we vacuumed from the study on the right is what came from the door mat outside the kitchen door in the garage seeing the evidence before him dart began to piece together braggs evidence the pile from the study included dust crumbs hairs and an abundance of fibers mostly wool by their curled appearance the doormat in the garage had netted some sticks dust and what appeared to be a small blob of oil and dirt but both groups shared similar items small elliptically shaped pieces of vegetation pine needles dart asked you see bragg encouraged i told you its interesting you call that interesting kowalski challenged we havent divined the species the lab man reported maintaining his attention on dart but as you can see a similar vegetation was found both in the study rug and on the garage doormat so what kowalski complained irritably on the very top of the garage doormat bragg clarified determining a persons actionswhat a person may or may not have doneis a responsibility we both shareyou from a wide variety of evidence and witnesses me from the translation of the physical sciences i can tell you a couple of interesting facts roman and maybe you can make sense of them for me kowalski looked like a kid in the schoolyard who didnt want to play he pursed his lips and looked around nervously for somewhere to steal a smoke that rug in the study had been vacuumedits not something i can necessarily prove but its something i know to be a fact our examination of the machine used to vacuum that rug earlier in the day came up negative for any such organics and yet our subsequent vacuuming of the same area produced this asyetunidentified organic matter most likely some kind of conifer needle we also picked up a trace amount of phosphorus and nitrogen compoundscommon potting soil detective similar organic matter and soil was discovered atop the garage doormat suggesting someone had wiped his or her feet on the way into the house i questioned the wife it was not she a little tough to question the victim but there was nothing on the soles of his slippers to suggest a similar organic matter we returned to the home and inspected eleven pairs of boots and shoes all negative kowalski said nervously so the wife was screwing the gardener in the old mans study and they made a mess of things they cleaned up but not so good maybe the old man found out and put a bullet through his lid bragg nodded agreement as he said might be except that the gardener put the beds up for winter three weeks ago and a search of the premises revealed no such potting soil the beds were heavily mulched oat straw we picked up no trace amounts in our vacuum filters he hesitated and said what we did come up with was this he produced a clear plastic container there were small blue crystals inside its a salt and fertilizer compound sold as deicer the blue is a dye they add for marketing purposes the compound melts ice but doesnt kill common plants flowers or grass he summarized three itemsthe conifer needles the potting soil and the rock salt its enough of a signature ivy if you bring me a suspect the unspoken message interested dart more than the facts ted bragg had invested an inordinate amount of time in this case that otherwise would have been considered a grounder his poorly staffed forensic sciences division was a busy place they put investigations to bed as quickly as possible bragg or his assistant samantha richardson had returned to paynes possibly more than once in search of evidence it revealed to dart how unsettled the man was with his discoveries all that bragg could do was present the evidence in hopes of interesting the lead detective ultimately it was the lead detectives call whether to pursue that evidence he clearly saw kowalski as the weak link so what exactly are you saying kowalski asked rhetorically answering what youre saying is that some joe entered the house through a locked garage and did a little housecleaning before he left after which our friend harry payne blows his hat off with a nine millimeter am i missing something here he addressed dart this sounds like a bunch of bullshit to meno offense teddy what do you think he asked dart in a leading tone dart hesitated kowalski said fuck the pine needles and the goddamned potting soil theres always crap at any crime scene that you cant explain am i right or am i right youre probably right dart confessed where do we go with this he asked bragg where you go with it is your business bragg reminded clearly upset im just telling you what i found where would you go with it dart restated kowalski rocked uncomfortably onto his heels bragg pondered the question he searched kowalskis eyes and then darts a botanist probably identify the organic matter that may or may not tell us something and i think i would run a crew out to the payne house once more to do some detail work between the garage entrance to the kitchen and the door to the study but the garage was locked kowalski protested i cant argue that bragg agreed but ivy asked me what id do and thats what id do yeah well kowalski complained i say forget about it this is not a fly ball boys its a grounder the guy ate a ninemillimetercase and casket closed you want to beat it stupid thats your business me i got other shit to do kowalski flicked his thick black hair off his forehead with his meaty hand and said later dart saw him reaching for a smoke before he was out of the lab bragg said something like this comes up you know who i wish were still around yeah i know dart acknowledged his stomach burning i know he thought privately and just maybe hes closer to this than you think chapter the small twoacre patch of grass along the west bank of the connecticut river was technically part of riverside park though not directly connected to it this particular section was beneath the charter oak bridge a relatively new structure linking hartford and east hartford the rivers brown surface reflected the gray of the sky and the delicate etching of the dormant trees that lined its banks a pair of ducks raced down the very center of the waterway their wings singing a brisk november chill raised ginnys collar and had brought out a winter wool sweater she wore her green oil slicker partially open green rubber halfboots with leather laces and a pair of small pink gloves the winter river was quieter than that of spring or summer void of sound as if sleeping while awaiting its blanket of ice which had already begun to creep in from the edges dart took a deep breath you look worried whats wrong he felt he knew her well enough to ask this although it implied an intimacy that she was clearly not comfortable with on that day nothing if its personal its not she snapped he felt too much a part of her to separate himself from her tension it attached to him and slowly choked a ring around his upper throat restricting his air and increasing his heart rate the name of this woman that you gave me danielle payne she said referring to the late harold paynes wife is in the system as a victim a domestic abuse for dart this confirmed that at least one verifiable way existed for the killer to identify his victimsthis could not be explained by coincidence the second part of the victim list seemed to be associated with convicted offenders he said you could have told me that over the phone its bigger than that bigger than we thought more confusing she didnt appreciate nagging and so he waited her out but the anxiety swelled in his chest she said your friends stapleton and lawrence had both recently purchased extensive health care policies twohundredandfiftydollar deductible the kind of policies you would associate with the affluent both within three months prior to their suicides these are both men with no prior coverage what did me in was your friend harold payne stop calling them my friends he wanted to complain he had a policy in place but it was one thousand deductible exactly three months ago he reapplied and obtained a twohundredandfiftydollar deductible dart wasnt sure what to make of this information thinking aloud he muttered all three suicides had new or recently altered insurance policies yes which connects them all one to the other absolutely she agreed it seemed to dart yet another way that a killer might have identified his victims and this in turn worried him because ginny had been exploring the same database why he asked still puzzled i dont have any idea but it would seem that someone is buying these policies for them and if thats the case i may be able to find out who that is by accessing billing can you do that this is computers dart you can do anything safely more lectures the comment infuriated him and for a moment he felt tempted to give her a piece of his mind but restrained himself by chewing on his lower lip maybe one of the companies had some kind of marketing campaign in place offering policies for wife beaters and convicted sex offenders the demographics are similar he said realizing immediately that paynes affluent lifestyle distanced him from both stapleton and lawrence i dont know dart conceded thats not right she handed him a large manila envelope and said victims of domestic violence as identified by the insurershartford east hartford west hartford its a big list dart and probably quite incomplete you might want to try your sex crimes files guilt in the form of a searing heat flashed up his spinedoes she know about abby he wondered hartford was a small town and rumors circulated freely is she trying to tell me something right he said attempting to interpret her expression while at the same time avoiding contact with her eyes she could read him far too well but his eyes did stray to hers and he saw that she was looking over his shoulder not directly at him and her expression was one of concern causing him to glance back quickly in the distance a ramped footbridge climbed up from ground level to a landing where it turned and rose by a series of formedconcrete steps to the pedestrian way on charter oak bridge silhouetted on the landing stood the figure of a tall man dart looked quickly away his pulse pounding with this sight returning his attention to ginny and saying softly is he still there hes heading up the stairs dart ventured another glance and asked how long was he there i dont know she answered her voice reflecting her fear did he approach from the bottom or the bridge i dont know she repeated harshly darts first temptation was to turn and go after the man despite the fact that it could have been any pedestrian simply pausing to enjoy the river view but he felt uneasy about leaving ginny alone in an isolated location especially given her discovery of a possible conspiracy involving the three suicides listen he said go she prompted are you sure go im fine dart took off at a run the entrance to the pedestrian ramp was a hundred yards ahead the ramp itself climbing in his direction he crossed several islands of weeds and a pair of paved roads that saw little if any traffic at that time of year reaching the ramp he pushed hard climbing it quickly while glancing down at where he and ginny had been talking ginny her head tilted back her chin raised watched him intently dart flew up the concrete steps and up onto the bridge itself and looked in both directions first left up the inclined arch of the bridge then right toward the city and then down at ground level he panted out of breath blood pounding in both ears a car in the midst of a righthand turn was visible to him only briefly he blinked his eyes closed in an act of concentration attempting to burn the image into his memory but like the car the image escaped an undefinable blur leaving only a color imprinted on the underside of his eyelids bluegray dart recovered his breath and turned back to the steps to rejoin ginny but she and her car were gone leaving dart with that color imprinted into his vision lingering like the afterglow of a flash camera bluegray he blocked out all else but this color allowing it to swim within his head and a voice quickly filled the void it was the voice of a twelveyearold black girl that interrupted him the voice of lewellan page resonating within her mothers kitchen as she offered to lieutenant abby lang a description of the car that she had witnessed parked behind gerald lawrences battles street apartment on the night of his suicide blue maybe gray he recalled her saying the killer dart wondered furious that he had not seen enough of the vehicle to register a make a model or a year chapter standing inside the roadside phone booth dialing the number walter zeller experienced a parents anger stupidity he thought is an art form in the proper hands he had never been a parent but he understood a parents frustration well enough he collected his strength preparing himself for the confrontation annoyed by its necessity alarmed by the degree of emotional resolve that this required like dredging up the black muck of the river bottom to clear the way for further passage traffic blew by him on the commercialized strip that could have been anywhere usa oversized plastic signs declaring drive thru window and americas favorite cheap marketing gimmicks like giant anchors perched out front or a lobster claw reaching for the sky like a church steeple he felt quite above such fanfare sick of it disgusted by the greed the blatant disregard of aesthetics and the publics seemingly insatiable appetite for neon repetitive architecture and low everyday prices sick to death throughout his years of public service he believed that he had concealed well his sentimentality only lucky had ever seen that side of the otherwise ironwilled sergeant yet dialing this number and anticipating the voice on the other end flooded him with such emotions alarming him with a vulnerability that both relieved and ashamed him relieved because it reminded him of his own humanity ashamed because walter zeller was above sniveling about the past his blunt fingertip hesitated alongside the final digit an eighteenwheeler roared past carrying behind it a train of raised dust and the stench of diesel and burning rubber zeller stabbed the button fuck it he thought dartelli the voice answered walter zeller hesitated a knot in his throat hello i cant hear you without introduction zeller asked why do it the easy way when theres a hard way sarge zeller registered the astonishment in darts voice the fear and concern his decades of skilled interrogation techniques not lost are they suicides ivy silence as even the kids breathing stopped answer me maintain the upper hand at all times no of course not good very good ive been trying to dont trydo he said purposely interrupting to prevent the kid the completion of even a single thought keeping him off balance and out of sorts maintain control they took their own lives but theyre not suicides ivy do you understand no dont get sidetracked with insurance records for christs sake what the hell can that accomplish it was you on the bridge disappointed that hed allowed the man a complete sentence zeller strung together a series of thoughts and voiced them as a single spoken stream im your fucking guardian angel ivy im watching over you so that you dont go astray and believe me its a fucking fulltime job with you whats happened to you making a huge tangle out of something so simple overthinking he said raising a complaint that he had voiced dozens of times making problems instead of solving them losing track of the basics didnt you retain anything for any conviction to stick the detective needs to be able to connect all the dots himself that is unless the snitch is willing to take the witness stand and i can tell you right fucking now that that is not the direction were goingyou and me the basics damn it all didnt you retain anything shit if the suicides arent suicides and if on the other hand these guys all killed themselves then what the fuck is going on here make sense of it ivy dont make a mountain of confusion what about their blood ivy the basics sometimes the enemy is within he slammed the phone into the cradle his hand still shaking though not from the cold things never went as planned and people were as unpredictable as the weather walter zeller felt the need to take the kid by the shoulders and shake some sense into himset him straight he stood in the phone booth looking down at his trembling hands wondering what was happening to him how could he let the kid get to him this way how had he become involved in the first place kowalski was the one he had targetedas dumb as stone and yet smart enough to let a sleeping dog lie the truth would out soon enough all by itself joe dartelli the pride and joy of his police career was another thing entirely dartelli with his college degree and his barnyard sense of where the rat was hiding was proving nothing but trouble ill put him in the hospital if i have to zeller thought just like theyre trying to do to me he glanced down the street nervously alert for the familiar toyota for the cracked and bent face behind the wheelthe hired kneebreaker he had been outrunning all this time outsmarting outthinking looking down once again he felt relieved to see that his hands had stopped shaking he was under control again and for zeller control was everything chapter dart was part theatre critic part acting coach it was his job to make this woman tell him what she didnt want to any interrogation amounted to the same thing a con game of giveandtake of tricks the challenge of making someone say something that he or she had no intention of saying any investigator worth his salt knew that everyone held secrets the skill was finding a way to pry it out the capers interrogation rooms were a pair of small unattractive cubicles each containing a cheap table and two metal chairs dart dragged a third chair inside and shut the door well aware of the effects of such an austere environment interrogation offered only a single door that door lead either to jail or to freedom depending on how the critics rated a performance danielle payne the wife of the halloween suicide had an artificial look of surprise around her eyes that could be attributed only to a face lift her skin was flawlessly smooth her lips a sensual red and the rest of her could have been the model for tommy templetons venus a pinup of epic proportions with a pair of breasts that would have made her surgeon proud displayed in a tight turtleneck top that accentuated the lack of any visible means of support defying all rules of gravity and age that she had been married to a known pornographer could be easily determined by her lousy taste in clothing her platinum hair the gum that she chewed between her front teeth and a heightened sense of sexual readiness communicated by repetitively placing her hand into her crotch and withdrawing it slowly and a tendency to shift her upper body around restlessly jiggling her breasts and twisting her narrow waist as if she needed an itch scratched scratched hard by the look of her the attorney to her right darts left was a silvertongued sixhundredgrandayear asshole by the name of gambelli his mere presence warned dart not to expect much after formal introductions for the sake of a tape recorder he asked the woman to recount her activities on the night of her husbands suicidea suicide that dart considered a murder but lacked the evidence to investigate as such throughout her narration dart sensed in her an underlying nervousness that he associated with lying there were two different kinds of anxiety that surfaced in an interrogationthe person uncomfortable and unfamiliar with being in the company of a cop and the person who had something to hide danielle payne fell firmly into the second category how would you describe your relationship with your husband ms payne my relationship she asked checking with the attorney who offered a barely visible nod warm and fuzzy dart offered turbulent nurturing we got on okay i guess okay dart asked affectionate romantic distant cold we liked each other fine harry you know had his work his stuff and i had my stuff too okay i guess he was never rough with you dart stated clearly making her uncomfortable rough she gasped blushing physically abusive dart clarified gambelli tugged at his french cuff and said where are you going with this dartelli danielle payne squirmed in her chair all sexuality lost her face puckered up into a knot of worry abusive situations are difficult on the victim of that abuse i ought to know he thought thinking of his alcoholic mother and hiding inside the dryer meaning gambelli questioned ms payne dart said doing his best to ignore the attorney was your husband ever physically abusive toward you did he rough me up some sure he did she admitted hes gone now whats it matter if i tell you he was not an angel so what show me a man who is and you put up with this behavior of his dart said you tolerated it you endured it she shrugged weve got a nice place to live i drive a mercedes have you ever driven a mercedes she asked her eyes searching dart as if to say that this mattered a great deal dart shook his head no she said its a nice car a real nice car a mercedes so what do you know isnt it true dart asked her that on at least six different occasions you admitted yourself to the emergency room for injuries sustained from conflicts with your late husband that on two occasions you telephoned nineoneone and asked for help from the police she said defensively it was all a mistake hes dead dart reminded you dont need to fear him you dont need to lie to me she looked away her attorney advised her that she need not answer any question that she chose not to her eyes pooled with tears she waved him off dart waited until she appeared more at ease he needed to judge her reaction carefully to this his most important question he studied her and asked were you ever approached by a man offering to help you with your husband her expression disappointed him for she didnt appear to understand the implication that dart was attempting whereas her attorney certainly did i dont want you to answer that the attorney snapped to his client but danielle payne had already formed an answer in her head and she spoke it they approached him not me it was his problem not mine nothing i could do about it for the first time in this meeting dart and gambelli met eyes neither able to contain their astonishment at her answer darts eyes said sternly let me pursue this gambellis were a cauldron of concern the attorney admonished danielle please but she had to protest he didnt tell me any more than thatonly that they could help him and he was going to try it to dart she said harry loved me loads he didnt want to be mean really he didnt want to hurt me they dart asked knowing full well that the attorney would interrupt which he did but danielle payne seemed to be venting whats he care what i say hes dead and gone whats it matter to him seizing quickly on this dart asked who offered to help your husband ms payne what do you mean by that dart had imagined just the oppositethat walter zeller had made himself available for hire to women who wanted their abusive spouses eliminated that he had created a profession out of reversing his years of investigating homicides an abused wife or lover or the mother of an abused child would have plenty of motivation to see the sex offender killed a carefully manufactured suicide would be quickly cleared zeller could carry out his own passion and earn a living while convincing himself he was doing the world a favor this fit zellers controlling personality and his disenchantment with the legal system that he had abandoned but danielle payne was throwing him off completely the mention of a third party and this third party approaching payne himself did not fit with any of darts preconceived notions i dont know she answered and he trusted the confusion in her eyes harry said he couldnt tell me but that things were going to get better that he was going to be better and that i just had to trust him and the doctors gambelli released a chest full of air and said enough attempting to silence his client to dart he said id like to speak with her alone detective if you intend to pursue this any further i must speak with her first doctors dart said to the woman do not answer that danielle gambelli warned and this time his client obeyed she nodded and hung her head she wore sky blue eye shadow on eyelids edged with pencil her lashes gobbed with mascara the woman murmured theres nothing to tell i dont know any more than that gambelli shook his head in disgust and slapped his legs with open palms doctors dart repeated in the voice of a man thinking aloud i never met em she said but harry was better toward me nicer and all and so i wasnt complaining a thought occurred to dart did your husband ask that you leave the house that evening no way she answered sharply it was halloween dart countered didnt he want you home to help give out the candy she hung her head again it isnt a friendly neighborhood she said at least not toward convicted pornographers dart thought realizing that the paynes would have been shunned following his arrest he didnt have a meeting planned gambelli allowed this question to pass no not so as he told me about reading from his notes he questioned her about the housecleaner and she confirmed that the house had been cleaned that same morning she also confirmed that there was no dustbuster or similar small vacuum in the house and who had access to your garage it operates via a remote is that right a clicker yeah sure harry and me we both had clickers in our cars and you used yours upon your return dart asked she nodded he said and the garage door was down at the time sure it was whats this with the garage door and all dart believed that braggs evidencethe pine needles rock salt and potting soil found in the garage and inside the studypointed toward paynes killer having entered through the garage once inside the garage the kitchen door was unlocked and would have allowed egress undetected access to the garage was only through the automatic door openers one of which danielle payne controlled it was this combination of facts that had led him to consider that she had arranged for her husbands staged suicideproviding her garage door opener to a killer she had hired and none of your husbands business associates would have a garage door opener for your house of course not your housecleaner no and your security system that night it would have been on or off harry liked to keep it on when we were home he didnt want no surprise visits she blushed and averted her eyes it was the police he had hoped to avoid but halloween it would have been off for sure at least i think it would have been dart dropped the biggest bombshell he had in his arsenal hoping for a direct hit it stemmed from a phone call he had placed earlier that day you werent with your friends the fallowfields that evening ms payne as you claim to have been in your sworn statement dart glanced at gambelli knowing that the attorney if not his client would understand her vulnerability we checked with the fallowfields you saw them only for a drink that evening the woman glanced at her attorney i dont want to file perjury charges he said leaning heavily on the word and presenting it as a serious possibility and i wouldnt want to drag you through the routine of being booked and charged with that or with more serious crimes but i do need some answers and so i turn it over to youthe two of youas to where we go from here her frightened eyes appealed to gambelli the attorney sought out and located the womans signed statement and read it over he then said i would advise you to answer the detectives questions danielle given the circumstances i think its in everyones best interest he looked over at dart with a mixture of anger and respect and seemed to be fully involved for the first time where were you that night ms payne for all her fortyodd years she looked more like a child as she appealed again with her eyes gambelli simply glared back at her she told the detective with a friend a friend in bed okay i was in bed with a friend you were having an affair he stated no shit she answered angrily we were fucking our brains out okay you want the details i want his name i want the exact times she asked her attorney do i have to gambelli nodded she provided dart the details of her assignation and said you satisfied it would require a phone call to verify but he suspected she was telling the truth the doctors dart said i need everything and anything that you can tell me i dont know shit im telling you only that harry said that some doctors were going to help him get betterabout hitting me you know about roughing me upand that i wasnt to tell no one did he meet with these doctors dart asked i dont know he must have right did he take medication injections she said touching her own arm i know that because i saw the bandaid on his arm one night and he said how that was part of making him better injections dart repeated taking this down in his notepad those were his words making him better dart checked right and you took that to mean better you know less hitting less rough stuff not that i mind it a little rough you knowthe forfun kind of rough but harry had a temper on him that wouldnt quit sometimes and it wasnt me you knowhe used to tell me that it wasnt me it was just me being a woman it was like something chemical in him like a bad seed like that movie where the guy changes into the crazy doctor who kills people you know like that you never met these doctors no never spoke to them on the phone not that i know of and he received these injections every two weeks just about seems to me hed had maybe four or five your husband changed his medical insurance dart stated do you remember that dont know anything about it swear the dates of which appear to coincide with this treatment he didnt tell me jack shit about anything to do with money that was his department my department she hesitated and then said my department was the bedroom she locked eyes with dart hers a fire of fierce intensity and resentment he had demeaned her debased her with this questioning if these doctors should contact you they wont but if they should i should call you she stated forget it no way harrys dead let him be they were trying to help him so maybe theyll help someone else an alarm sounded in darts head zeller had made a riddle out of itpeople taking their own lives but not committing suicide a drug gone bad he thought guinea pigs test subjects as zeller had warned the blood of the victims could be the key chapter joe ive got another one abby announced in a forced whisper dragging a chair over to his desk she smelled like lilacs in bloom her cheeks were flushed and her blond hair needed combing darts attention was elsewhere he had just hung up from speaking first with teddy bragg and then with pathologist dr victor ray requesting the results of harold paynes blood toxicology the discussions had strayed into unfamiliar territory as dart explored what could and could not be detected by such tests finally persuading dr ray to request a complete workup since typically blood toxicology tested only for the more common narcotics and alcohol levels and tightwad teddy bragg had not wanted to release the funds necessary for such testing without some damn good reasons which dart found impossible to provide abby placed a computer printout on the desk in front of dart a single line highlighted in a bright yellow reading the name on the file his body reacted as if he had taken a niacin tabletevery pore on fire his blood pressure rose so quickly that he could hardly hear her whisper this is from our files she said meaning sex crimes and this she emphasized is from capers another highlighted line that shared the same name he forced himself to inhale a drowning man attempting to recover a suicide joeand a suspected sex offender as far as i can tell the two have never been connected she said excitedly which i can explain we do not reveal the identities of suspected offenders because of the libel suit lost in new haven only arrests and convictions this guy was never arrestedwe didnt have enough evidence she paused and said do you recognize the name joe remember that case think what the papers would have done if wed showed them this she said tapping the sex crimes folder can you believe it she waited knowing he would recognize the name and although he did he said nothing he wasnt sure what to say in part because he felt in a state of physical shock she misunderstood his hesitation its the ice man joe come on the ice man and he flew out of a window just like stapleton did whats that coincidence stapleton was not the first a critical part of the job working a string of crimes was to identify the first in the series abby believing as dart did that they were on to a string was ebullient with her discovery get it i was second on the ice man he informed her a lump filled his throat painfully choking him he understood at that moment that there was no running away only avoidance things believed dead and buried inevitably returned either symbolically or literally stepping out of the grave he saw no way to tell her no way to ask her to return the files and forget about it the ice man had crawled back out of his grave a part of dart actually felt relief the remainder of him was in a state of total panic kowalski was the lead he explained i was the second talk about coincidence she said lowering her voice teddy is going to pull the evidence for us what dart asked astonished yeah isnt that great she said mistaking his reaction for enthusiasm he agreed to review it with rankin and haite after lunchto see if we can make any physical comparisons to stapleton and the others the d animated software had already made just such a connectionno wonder that bragg felt prompted to delve into possible connections dart felt short of breath he could feel his skin go alternately hot and cold his head swam damage control he warned himself whats wrong joe she asked cautiously i thought youd be thrilled its an obvious connection dart felt paralyzed by the numbness sweeping through himhe was in the midst of an anxiety attack he heard her footsteps coming down the stairs and the whoosh of her dress he looked up only to see abby he weighed the options available to him she placed her hand tenderly on his arm and that did it he snapped his head toward her startling her and said how would you like to take a walk concern stealing the excitement from her face she pushed her chair back and stood a bitter cold had descended on the city in anticipation of winter still more than a month away they walked from headquarters toward a path that led down to the river they passed a few smokers and then found themselves alone in the woods he wasnt sure how or where to start i was the second on the ice man he repeated kowalski was the primary but he was worthless and everyone knew it they wouldnt assign zeller because he had lost lucky only a few months before and there wasnt much left of him but i consulted him nonetheless because then as now theres none better yes i remember a lot of it she said sadly i was directly involved because it was the asian strangler because of the sex crimes connection although i was still with capers then so he explained even though i was technically the second it actually ended up my case in many ways nothing new for a kowalski investigation they stopped she leaned against a tree stump and dart sat onto a rock embedded in the earth but he didnt feel connected to the earth he felt almost as if he were floating he continued the guy was found naked and frozenas youll recallhis head bashed in from the jump no identification the pressure to clear it got pretty intense media slump city hall going ballistic they came down on kowalski like a ton of bricks i was left pretty much unscathed i continued to consult zeller he was drinking pretty heavily at the time and was starting to lose it i loved him like a father dart confessed his throat tight it was hard for me to see him like that im sure she studied him hard on anybody joe kowalski ended up in the hot seat but because of his connections he was pretty well protected spent most of his time defending an investigation that had basically gone nowhere if its any consolation joe she said still misunderstanding him im sure you did as good a job as could be done given the circumstances me no it was zeller who broke the case meaning she had that abby look of concern that he had come to knowknitted brow pursed lips lowered chin if she had read those files then she knew that the case had never been broken but simply cleared as a jumper it was zeller who idd him he had jumped from a window on the night of that terrible blizzard hit hard and either landed or rolled into the street covered by the falling snow he was struck by a city plow and pushed three blocks down the street where he was deposited under a snowbank for three weeks when it finally thawed we had the ice man on our hands he stood and she followed and they walked deeper into the woods gray and brown tree trunks leaves mushy underfoot he wasnt sure how much to tell her but he began to realize that it was all going to come out that secrets were a thing of the past if nothing else he thought this is a dress rehearsal for my discharge zeller found the apartment first it should have sent up a red flag he thought he didnt want it to appear that he was working kowalskis turf so he funneled the information through mepointing me without actually telling me anything hes doing the same thing again he realized he was the best she said admiringly maybe too good dart replied confusing her judging by her expression he taught medrummed into me is more like itto always return to the crime scene not just once but several times that you always see it differently and so thats what i did he stopped this was the dangerous territory and despite his resolve to tell her everything he felt himself holding back and he hated himself for it this was the voice of the devil he realizedstill looking for a way out still believing that the secret could be reburied are you going to explain that she asked she pulled at her jacket fending off the cold she sat down on a log and dart joined her he nodded and swallowed his mouth and throat bone dry and said it wasnt from my repeat visits but teddy braggs report and the accompanying inventory of the ice mans apartment it listed a spool of hemp rope it was put down as a fiftyfoot spool of threeeighthsinch hemp your mind does funny things who knows where my mind was or what it was up to but that hemp rope leapt out at me and wrapped itself around my neck like a noose again he tried to swallow again his throat constricted lucky zeller had been found tied up with threeeighthsinch hemp abby squinting rocked forward nervously her hands clamped in a viselike grip between her thighs dart said i had access to the other asian strangler reportslucky wasnt the only one all three of the victims had been tied and bound with hemp rope i was very proud of myself and not thinking it through i wrote it up and put it into the file i requested that teddy bragg collect the spool from the apartment oh god she said seeing clearly where dart was headed not long after that i started thinking what youre thinking now and it terrified me too he hesitated and said i stole two pieces of the rope from the property roomone used on lucky zeller the other from the spool found in the apartment i circumvented teddy and submitted the samples to the lab and intercepted the return report so that no one saw it but me it came back that the two were from the same manufacturermore than likely the same lot run oh christ zeller had somehow tracked down his wifes killerthe asian stranglerand as far as i was concerned had probably caved in his hat and then tossed him out a window to cover it up he looked up at the bare limbs and the gray skyit all seemed so dead i had to cover myself because the state police lab would itemize the work done for us in their monthly bill and teddy bragg meticulous as he is would see it so i properly filed the lab report in with the ice man file in case he checkedput it right where it belonged oh shit she said good little boy scout he was chiding himself as he held up a finger to stop her briefly i had some thinking to do the asian strangler was dead a man who tortured and mutilated women no cost to society no more concerns about the threat he posed and i had to think whats so wrong here if i was right zeller had evened the scales had done us all a favor and maybe had found a way to live with the loss of his wife he was no longer drinking he was looking better even talking about teaching down at the university he continued but i had left quite a trail of evidence i had to bring it to kowalskis attentionto haite and rankinor let it slide leave it where it wasdivided between the property room and the file room she paled noticeably he said strongly it was entirely circumstantial i knew damn well that this was no grounder we wouldnt get a convictionnot if walter zeller was in fact the killer he wouldnt leave that kind of trail oh shit she said realizing what she had done by alerting haite to the ice man files dart felt resolved now to tell it all in a way it felt good to him but i did bring zeller the evidence that i had i told him what i knew and what i thought he had done he must have gone ten minutes without saying anything then he looked over at me and told me that it was time to retire he showed no remorse no guilt but he had hate in his eyeshe had wanted to stay on in the department and he knew that i had ended that she scooted over to him and held him and he felt the warmth of her through his jacket ive opened it up again its better i think this thing has damned near killed me and now stapleton and lawrence and payneall far too close to the ice man oh shit she gasped its him abby i may never prove iti dont know how hes doing itbut i know it in my heart and that means that im responsible for those deaths you want to talk about motivation to solve a case she leaned back and caught eyes with him theyre slime joe every one of them is pure slime trust me on this theres no great loss here look the other way he said disgusted you dont think ive considered that a jury of one uniform justice shoot the guy in the alley and its easier on everyone you try that out its not something you can live with and keep coming to work bullshit she said you dont know that youre right you cant prove ityou said so yourself you need to find zeller to collect more evidence to take control dart felt like adding haite will tear you apart youll be suspended investigatedand you never will find out the truth she added do you think kowalski will she checked her watch theres still time for what me to get out of the country he mocked to get the ice man files and the evidence and make them disappear youre not serious dart said i got you into this abby i am serious she said and damn it im going to need your help chapter the meeting took take place at a dirt culdesac called the swing a dirt track that led to an old tree overhanging the river used in the summer to swing and splash in november the place was certain to be deserted dart remembered the location from his rookie year when the swing had been one of his patrol responsibilities he had come upon a coed group of skinnydipping teens and had scared them half to death to reach the swing he drove to the east hartford side crossing charter oak bridge and headed north until the treacherous dirt track that led steeply down toward the river and executed a hairpin turn before descending into the bulbshaped parking area littered with beer cans he locked the volvo and took mac for a short walk going slowly so that the old dog didnt push his arthritic bones when dart stopped drinking in the view of the peaceful river and a gaggle of canada geese skimming its surface mac came alongside and leaned his weight into dart catching his chin on darts kneefor mac the ultimate sign of affection he reached down and petted his head mac was old having lived two more years than the vet had given him and yet it was true he was darts best friend the idea of losing him was too much to bear and for this shared moment of quietude dart felt grateful he continued on and reached the edge of the river where a thin shelf of bone white ice stretched twenty yards toward the main current rocks had been tossed through the ice puncturing it with small dark holes that had bubbled river water and then scabbed over as darkness settled in from across the river came the lights of the water treatment facility and the power generating station dart couldnt escape the feeling of being watched paranoia tickling at the edges of his rational mind and yet the area appeared to be clear as he climbed back up to the parking area mac at his side he heard the sound of gormans arriving car bud gorman darts friend whose job involved tracking a persons credit history and spending patterns was dressed for the cold his big ears protruding from beneath a knit cap dart didnt think of the man as possessing a nervous disposition but this spying did make him jumpyhis nose twitched like a rabbits thats an old dog he said what did you find out dart asked knowing to keep this business gorman was a talker walter zeller drew unemployment for two months march to early june three years ago after he retired dart said i suppose so july through december the same year he worked for something called proctor securities yes i remember dart said he pulled in six hundred fortythree a week after withholdings we have record of the usual phone and utility bill payments some credit card activity for this same threemonth period lived at fourtwentyfour winchester court yeah come the first of january last year his credit records move to seattle as you indicated he leaves his account here open to cover some automatic withdrawals but heres the strange part about the seattle side he added ominously i show virtually no financial activity except for some electronic fund transfersautomatic depositshis pension each month a single withdrawal is made against this accountmy guess is a certified check or bank payment that is probably then mailed to whatever location zeller has specified the amount twentythree hundred the same every month the only other withdrawals appear tax related and again are not drawn on account checks but paid into the bank funds instead and drawn from there and thats all you show the man is out of the system joe hes existing in a strictly cash environment is my guess if hes spending cash then i cant trace him no one can dart thought wondering if that was the point to show dart that he had done a thorough job gorman added credit card activity up to january was retail mostly department store records show jeans boots shirts socks and underwearstrictly basic stuff weapons airline tickets train tickets hotel rooms nothing like that gasoline no nothing thats what im sayinghes strictly cash you mentioned taxes he filed all taxes as a resident of washington state but no financial trail indicating that he spends any time there or anywhere else dart reminded true thats right its almost as if hes disappeared he has dart thought and if he had a bank account in some other state id know same with credit cards department store accountsi can track anything that requires his social security number the night swallowed them in an envelope of darkness the air was wet and accompanied by a bonechilling cold that cut through darts jacket and sweater mac sitting alongside dart leaned his weight warmly against darts right leg the detective reached down and petted the dog and pulled on his ears which mac loved and if he could get around the social security number obtain a false number dart asked thats a hell of a lot more difficult than it used to be but if he could dart asked thinking new social security number drivers license bank accounts credit cards wed never find him gorman replied his disappointment obvious right yeah answered dart i think thats just the point chapter bragg said youre as nervous as a fox in a chicken coop its the chickens that should be nervous dart said whatever bragg was often trying to sell himself as the country farmer that a boy from brooklyn could never be there was a new leak in the small closet that bragg used for a lab the area smelled strongly of photo chemicals from the huge developer in the next room you look sick teddy you feel allright fine pale you smoke too much shut up im worried about you dart objected or doesnt that count no it doesnt count he said you worried about that crippled dog of yours too he turned out fine hes not crippled see what i mean bragg bumped darts shoulder with his own look closer he encouraged dart leaned over the lab counter and pressed his eye closer to the loupe its the organic matter from the payne suicide its called a bald cypress it grows here but its not considered common by any means samantha richardson joined in the paynes do not have a bald cypress on their property dart had forgotten all about her she had remained so quiet she was dressed in blue jeans a white shirt and a forest green sweater vest she was wearing wirerim glasses it was the first time that dart had seen her in glasses sam followed up on this at my request bragg informed him why we both know why goddamn it bragg answered angrily lang made all that stink about the ice mannesbitand although that got nowhere haite sees the unusual number of suicides and hes looking for a possible connection its langs fault not mine dont blame me or me samantha chimed in i got bigger fish to fry than this bragg complained but he wants each and every piece of evidence on every one of these suicides followed up on if there is a connection he wants it dont blame me christ hes got kowalski running around like like a fox in a henhouse dart completed fuck off thank you so were reworking the lawrence evidence the nesbit stuff stapleton payneits a shitload of work mention of the ice mannesbitcaused dart a flash of panic but he concealed it braggs explanation was filling in some gaps haite had sent dart a memo inquiring about a complete blood workup on payne so far dart had avoided an answer and this is about the only unexplained trace evidence at the payne suicide richardson completed bragg added and haitelike me like yousees the possibility that these bald cypresss might have been left by a visitor and helike me like youwants to know who that visitor might have been and what the fuck he was doing there i see said dart thinking i know who it was i know what he was doing there but haite of all people is not going to believe it without a hell of a lot more evidence no bald cypress there dart said to richardson not at the paynes no which is where you come in said bragg cause theres only the two of us here and i got other fish to cook to fry dart corrected fuck off to richardson bragg said tell him hhs has a listing of all bald cypresses in hartford east hartford and west hartford hhs the hartford horticultural society they keep track of rare species she reached back to the counter and handed dart a fax only eleven in the area which is where you come in bragg repeated you want me to go hunting down trees dart asked perplexed trees rock salt and potting soil bragg reminded we lifted all three in combination its a definite signature and its not me bragg objected but your wonderful sergeant haite who wants this you want to take issue take it upstairs no thanks i didnt think so i could help after work richardson offered dart no you couldnt bragg countered there was something in the womans eyes that said this had nothing to do with bald cypress leaves and dart felt it clear to his toes id like that he said not knowing where his words came from good she said not good bragg complained fuck off dart said though in good humor and bragg cracked a smile the detective folded the fax neatly and slipped it into his pocket he could feel richardsons eyes still boring into him as he left the lab it felt good chapter at seventhirty on a cold november night an hour and a half after the day shift ended dart and samantha richardson were out hunting down the registered locations of bald cypresses sam took east hartford and the greatest concentrationsevenof the trees dart took the city residents at the first two of darts four locations politely explained that they had never heard of the species and offered for dart to look around which he did as it turned out there were no bald cypresses at either location he reached sam by cell phone and was told with reluctance on her part that the horticultural list had been compiled some seven years earlier many of the trees could now be dead and worse others might have been planted within the last few years and not be included on the list the door of the third location was answered by a matronly woman with bluish hair and substantial girth closer to east hartford this was a decidedly nicer house than darts first two attempts there was a small backyard with a birdbath but the bald cypress was to be found inside the house making dart skeptical about the possibility of this leading him to paynes visitor the futility of this search began to wear on him he felt depressed and stretched thinnothing about these cases ever seemed to connect he worked on hunches but with so little evidence here he was chasing a tree he felt like an idiot at pm dart once again connected by phone with richardson who was having equally bad luck and she informed him that she intended to head home and try again tomorrow dart had promised himself one last try but he too gave it up after work the next night at a few minutes past pm dart drove over toward pope park south to search the last of his four locations although a scant few blocks from the trinity college enclave the hamilton court address was unfamiliar to him and not the kind of place that dart felt easy visiting alone at night it was a tough neighborhood and the proximity to pope park made for some tension as it doubled as a needle park after dark on the parks northern boundary park street ran eastwest and was the most dangerous of any street in the city at night anything and everything was available there from crack cocaine to teenage boysthe weapons count was astronomical if a patrol car cruised park street it did so with a team heavily armed and ever alert hamilton court turned out to be a filthy narrow alley less than fifty yards long that bisected a steep hill and connected hamilton street with park terrace dart turned onto the street and kept on driving reluctant to park or even to slow down four decrepit clapboard buildings lined the alley two on each side surrounded by broken and decaying chainlink fences driving past dart hoped the entrance to these houses might be on zion at the top of the hill but he made a pass through the alley twice and determined that their only access was off hamilton court number was pale yellow the windows of the ground floor alit the rotting wood trim had once been white dart parked and locked the car with the engine running thankful that he kept two car keys for just this purpose he removed his police identification card and slung its chain around his neck hopeful that a shooter would think twice before dropping a cop cop killers had short lives once inside hartford jails he walked over to the sagging stairs and climbed them quickly with sharp quick movements as he kept an eye on everything around him stupid time of night to be here he thought to himself heart pounding his hand ready to draw his weapon this was a shootfirstaskquestionslaterneighborhooda concept that didnt sit well with dart but one he understood he knocked sharply and waited no one answered fine with me he thought as he turned to return to his waiting car as he stepped down onto the second step he heard and felt something crunch beneath his shoe and the alarm inside his policemans brain sounded he wanted to label it glass but it didnt fit almost like glass his senses told him dont stop the same internal voice warned but he did the steps proved too dark and he withdrew his small penlight condemning himself for being such a boy scout and shined the light onto the step the cone of light caught tiny white stones like stars in the night sky but stones did not pulverize as these had and so dart looked closer still checking over his shoulder for a mugger or a kid with a semiautomatic cautiously he knelt reached out and carefully pinched some of the material between his fingers that same alarm sounded with this tactile contact rock salt bragg had connected rock salt to the payne suicideto paynes possible visitorand although dart might have been elated with such a discovery in this neighborhood on this street at this time of night he half wished that his foot had missed that step mac tried to bark from the back of the volvo sounding like a vacuum cleaner with its belt out of adjustment dart glanced up to see if it was a warning but decided it was only old mac longing for company wanting to go home me too boy dart placed the dust into his palm and shined the light on it a wateryblue huejust as teddy had described it in theory because hamilton court was listed as a location of a bald cypress tree with this discovery dart had two of the three elements identified by bragg the detective in dart could not ignore this like it or not the wretched old house seemed inexorably linked to harold payne he deposited the pinch of rock salt in his top pocket gathered his courage and decided to look around back a narrow dirt driveway ran alongside the building and accessed a rickety wooden slat fence that had once been painted green having no legal right to enter and keeping in mind that hamilton court might prove valuable dart elected to stay out but he found a space in the rundown fence to peer through inside this back area it was dark and his eyes took a nervous moment to adjust along with his anxiety he felt excitement unable to see he lifted the penlight and shined it inside and what he saw caused him to gasp once an enclosed garden it was now a place of ruin and neglect lying on the ground the printing wet and faded the paper burst open like a rotting corpse a bag of potting soil had spilled its contents across the path to the back stoop the third element that bragg had described to the left of the area stood a scraggly tree its limbs barren for winter at the base of whichand in fact littered across the entire area including where dart stoodwas a carpet of small needles some a dull green others brown and amber a bald cypress tree dart knew without knowing he collected some of the fallen needles into his pocket he quickly turned off his penlight and glanced up the sheer wall of the worn house his heart racing his skin prickling it seemed so gloomy and desolate like a haunted house from a film or a nightmare but this place was real and the effect on dart palpable whoever lived here had been inside harold paynes on the night of the killingnot suicide but killing and the cops instinct welling up inside of him said that this person had been more than just a visitor dart made for the car unlocked it and climbed inside mac greeted him with a slobbery kiss were not going home boy he informed the dog intending to keep hamilton court under surveillance abby reached dart on his cell phone at eightfifteen reminding him that he was fortyfive minutes late for dinner he told her briefly about his find and that he and mac were keeping an eye on hamilton court from up on zion without a bit of annoyance she announced that two dinners to go were on their way twenty minutes later abby lang in blue jeans and a deerskin jacket was sitting in the front seat of his volvo working on a chicken salad for dart the most difficult part of police work was sitting around waiting for something to happen which was one reason he had eschewed narcotics lewellans mother has given her consent for the girl to participate in a lineup abby announced proudly if we ever get a suspect and how did you pull that off dart asked thrilled that they might have a viable witness but still confused by the face that the girl and tommy templeton had creatednot zeller not kowalski he was toying with the idea that zeller had hired these hitsbut kept his own distance in case something went wrong which when attempting to stage suicides seemed inevitable magic id say so dart replied a while later with two paper coffee cups riding the dashboard dart said i have a confession to make she rocked her head on the car seat and looked at him okay she said its not okay he hoped that she might pick up on what he meant but she waited him out im getting used to this comfortable with it you and me im talking about i know what youre talking about and yet at the same time i still think about ginny i still think about my marriage i know you do he said she took a deep breath and said there are times when im madly in love with you joe others when im not so sure i feel that im sorry she apologized i wish it were different i really do id like to see more of the kids theyre always going off somewhere just as i arrive i dont want to hurt them she said theyre too young to understand all this the seat cushion crackled as she adjusted herself he could hear the drone of city lifetraffic mostly a disturbing silence hung over them she added charles and i have planned all along to get together for a week and see if we cant put it back together i told you about that she said defensively i we its for the kids sake i thought maybe that had changed given the last month no she said crushing him that hasnt changed thats not fair he complained she popped open her door and scrambled out of the car she jumped across an icy puddle and up onto the sidewalk and started away from him at a brisk pace she was risking both the surveillance and her own safety he too broke the rules he left the car and chased after her she heard him coming and increased her stride abby he called after her dont she objected come back to the car its my mistake she stopped and turned and he bumped into her she pushed him away forcibly and hollered loudly youre damn right its your mistake and a big one these are my children were talking about im sorry dart apologized he approached her tentatively she eyed him skeptically and then the two of them wound together arm in arm and she whispered into his ear asshole jerk lets drop it okay he asked whatever happens happens she nodded halfway back to the car she took his hand joe dart laced his fingers with hers and squeezed at eleventhirty the downstairs light at hamilton court went dark followed several minutes later by an upstairs light going on dart explained an automatic timer agreed either that or someone has been walking around in the dark for the last five minutes together they watched the building until one in the morning when the upstairs light went off dart repositioned the car on park terrace where abby could keep an eye on him as he crossed and once again knocked on the front door no answer he returned to the back of his car moved a sleeping mac out of the way and got into his firstaid kit using a piece of white athletic tape he bridged the hinged side of the houses front door placing it at ankle height if the door were opened the tape would tear loose from the hinge around back again with abby watching dart wedged a thin stick into the crack of the only gate in the dilapidated green fence if the gate door were opened the stick would fall to the ground simple trickshe and zeller had used them dozens of times he dropped abby back at her car hoping she might invite him to her place but she did not on the way home he worried about this and again when he took mac for a short walk he slept poorly until am having no idea what had awakened hima nightmare a sound something out on the street and then the thoughts cluttered his head like bats trapped in an attic he lay awake for hours spinning churningdriven by the possibilities that hamilton court offered confused by abbys mixture of hot and cold if he was to get a look inside that house he was going to have to convince haite to involve the state police haite in turn would need to involve captain rankin a real mess in the morning he returned to hamilton court again he knocked on the front door and again no one answered the piece of white tape remained in place disappointed not to find a sign of anyone he moved around back his heart busy in his chest his palms damp and cold he hated this neighborhood he found the stick that he had jammed into the gates crack lying in the dirt on the ground dart picked it up and held it in the oozing mud outside the gate he saw shoe prints coming and going shoe prints not his own sometime during the night someone had been inside the rock salt and leaves that he had collected the night before were now in separate envelopes on the front seat of his car marked and labeled evidence he thought perhaps just enough to convince haite to authorize the raid chapter it had been a busy few hours dart loosened his tie and unbuttoned his collar i need an ert for an evidence collection raid on a house in the south end dart explained to sergeant john haite the skin around the mans eyes was an ink blue reminding dart of a raccoon mask capers was run by two sergeants john haite or dave almedi each with his own group of detectives and his own desk in a glassed room off the divisions floor the two were rarely in at the same time because their units rotated in and out of twelvehour tours dart took a metal chair across from haites cluttered desk the fluorescent lights made their skin glow an ugly yellowgreen a what haite asked rhetorically the idea of using an emergency response team to do a raid for the sole purpose of collecting evidence was an idea all darts it would require writs and warrants and probable cause dart explained i can place an unknown person inside harold paynes study on the night he committed suicide bragg will support me in that whoever this was may have attempted to conceal his or her presence by vacuuming the rug haite appeared skeptical dart handed over braggs report completed only an hour earlier that showed an identical chemical composition between the rock salt recovered at paynes and the salt dart had collected at hamilton court this links this suspect to both paynes and the house at eleven hamilton court i contacted the owner who put me in touch with a property management firm peter sharpe haite said all the slum property was handled by sharpe he was hated by the police yeah the place is rented to one wallace sparco white male fiftytwo dart passed haite the photocopy of sparcos drivers license he went in for the kill by handing him next the computerized rendering lewellan page had witnessed at gerald lawrences although imperfect the similarity was undeniable wallace sparco has been busy making suicides dart said shit came haites reply comparing the two photographs he looked over at dart with basset hound eyes of irritation he didnt want things more complicated they are not suicides thats what i need to prove or disprove these are not your investigations where the hell is kowalski on this its an end run sergeant dart went ahead reluctantly i dont feel good about it but thats the way it is an end run on kowalski each one of these suicides is his dart pointed out oh shit haite tilted back in his chair oh shit i know said dart i dont like it either fuck this haite said exasperated i dont need this kind of trouble dart waited him out he knew better than to push haite someone tapped both payne and lawrence and set them up to look like suicides haite muttered why to keep us from catching on to keep going to clean house theyre both sex offenders sergeant pornography wife beating stapleton too stapleton is who the jumper at the granada inn august oh shit he scratched his head oh fuck i know dart repeated and what the hell are you asking for an evidence raid with an emergency response team in case it gets ugly thats a lousy area pope park i know a way to get in and out without sparco any the wiser fuck that haite said we just get the paper right and we kick it and search it so what sparco is one careful son of a bitch sergeant we have less than zero to go on if we dont find some kind of evidence connecting him to these crime scenes we dont want to tip our hand that weve been there its illegal have you considered that no matter what we have to post the place that it was searched those search notices have a habit of blowing off the door sergeant oh fuck whats happened to you dartelli blow off the door youre suggesting we purposely avoid posting notice that is illegal detective he had raised his voice to shouting dart knew that by now the other guys would be looking this way but with his back to the floor he couldnt see we post it and if it blows off it blows off this is not like you the sergeant condemned he added this sounds much more like kowalski or drummond than you whats gotten into you three murders made to look like suicides dart answered weve got a jury of one running wild sergeant if we dont do something the numbers are going to increase haite and zeller had come up through the ranks at the same time there was mutual respect between the men but a healthy competition as well if anyone felt as strongly about zeller as dart it was this man sitting across from him were dart to share the possibility of zellers involvement with haite the detective risked being reassigned without ironclad proof john haite was not about to bring down walter zeller so dart avoided mentioning his former sergeant or the ice man investigation but haite had just reviewed the case a few days earlier what about the ice man he asked he took a dive just like stapleton dart met eyes strongly with his sergeant yes he did he offered nothing more telephones rang out on the floor haite and dart maintained an unblinking eye contact youre saying the ice man was a sex offender do we know this can we prove this dart replied i didnt say anything about the ice man sergeant do you have a specific question that you want to ask haite still maintaining eye contact bored a hole through dart he understood the meaning of darts reserved tone of voicehe was trying to warn the sergeant off perhaps the only coincidence that haite could pick uponwithout darts cooperationwas the date of zellers retirement which followed quickly after the ice man investigation no questions haite whispered dryly fingering the photocopy of wallace sparcos drivers license and dart had to wonder what the man saw in the face did he too see the resemblance to zeller dart nodded fine with me he hesitated and asked again and the ert raid ill see what i can do haite now looked as pale as teddy bragg two vans pulled onto park terrace at am one was painted gray and carried a red diagonal stripe that read mannys steam and clean it had been confiscated by the state police in a drug bust two years earlier and was now outfitted with a personal computer and printer communications hardware and an elaborate video setup the second van was a customized beige dodge with what appeared to be darkly tinted windows but were in fact oneway glass behind the glass six men and one woman sat on opposing steel mesh benches clad all in black wearing combat boots that laced over the ankle four were members of the state police ert unit one of the outsiders was joe dartelli who had suffered through an egregiously boring ninetyminute briefing that had been lectured by the commander of the state police unit tom schultz the remaining two a woman named gritch and a man named yates were a team that someone at hpd had coined ted bragg on amphetamines evidence technicians whose specialty was speed and efficiency they all wore communications devices in their ears nightvision goggles perched on their foreheads bulletresistant vests black handcuffs black ninemillimeter semiautomatic handguns in their belt holster and maglights velcroed to their belts gritch and yates carried bulging black canvas bags at their sides the straps slung over their shoulders and necks they all wore black farm hats that carried the single word police in bright yellow stitching the veterans called these target caps for obvious reasons the ert members wore the hats backward like black and hispanic kids the protective vests carried bold yellow print across the back state police all but dart also carried a stun grenade and a smoke grenadeboth of which dart had argued to leave behind but ert the most militarylike unit of the state police did not would not vary from procedure one of the ert members sitting directly across from dart said a military unit could put a scope on those windows and tell us if we were facing any lifeforms lifeforms brandon one of the others teased what are you expecting klingons attack dogs asshole animals and humans the scopes work off infrared you can scope right through walls with the newer ones brandon held a bunch of electronic gear in his arms dart easily identified him as the techie hey commander a third said to schultz we ever gonna get anything like that on our budget who the fuck you kidding schultz was the marine drillsergeant type who had given the briefing every other word was a swearword or a denigrating obscene comment involving some aspect of female anatomy titsucker fistfucker cunt breath a real charmer gritch apparently tolerated schultz storing away enough harassment ammunition to retire comfortably if she ever chose to press a suit after the ninetyminute soliloquy schultz and dart had entered into a brief but vehement discussion of chain of command dart emphasizing that it was his raid schultz insisting it was his team they compromised whereby schultz would handle the team logistics while dart directed the actual reconnaissancein this case the physical inspection and the collection of evidence the search warrant had to specify what it was that dart was looking for if that item was to be removed for lab work the trickone of the oldest trickswas for him to list everything and anything that he could think might be found in the search it took a cooperating judge to go along with such practice but there were plenty on darts list was everything from a portable vacuum cleaner to lamp cord wool rugs to latex gloves scope on schultz directed brandon who carried what looked like a black metallic snake clipped at the calf and thigh to the outside of his right leg he reached up to his head and flipped a small device into place that looked like a dentists mirror and came to rest two inches off his eye his right hand worked a small box attached to his belt that dart could not fully see he reported scope fully functional ert members dart thought apparently saw little use for verbs schultz checked his watch it had a black face and was on a black plastic band probably wearing black shorts dart thought schultz looked up at the vans ceiling which dart now understood was this mans reaction to radio communication because as lead detective dart was also able to hear the voice traffic from the operations van two minutes schultz told his troops dart felt the prickle of heat in his scalp exactly two minutes later following a brief communication check between members of the unit the van started up and turned into hamilton court schultz rattled off orders single file people we stay in shadow where possible brandon will scope the back gate we move on my signalswe speak as little as possible any resistance we withdraw to the park and our support transportation questions if we encounter weapons fire one of schultzs men asked dartelli leads the retreat to park you brandon and i take up defensive positions and follow asap anyone else dart felt his heartbeat strongly he wanted to think of this as a drill but his adrenaline told him differently the van stopped and the doors flew open the team moved quickly quietly into the shadows dart a part of them could barely see the others okay schultz said he followed at the back behind gritch the unit was well trained and moved as an entity the van having hesitated only long enough to disgorge the team purred down the alley schultz held them in shadow for exactly one minute and then moved himself and his gadget man brandon across to the green wooden gate the two knelt and brandon uncoupled the black snake from his leg and inserted it under the fence the snake was in fact a fiberoptic camera the small dentist mirror at his eye a viewing scope brandon inspected the back garden area and with a hand signal pronounced it clear schultz using a speed key unlocked the gate and then signaled the unit forward his ert man leading the way followed by the evidence technicians and then dart within seconds the unit was lined up in shadow alongside the house darts heart pounded heavily and he felt sweat trickling down his ribs brandon slipped the fiberoptic camera under the weather seal of the back door and used the video gear to inspect the inside a moment later schultz had opened this door as well again he waved them forward they were inside dart had only used nightvision equipment once in a seminar hosted by the new england law enforcement association the goggles were bulky and the view from within them an eerie combination of green black and white the unit moved ahead fluidly but dart felt awkward and disoriented as if he had stepped into a video game with his world reduced to glowing colors he moved forward one unsure foot at a time inside the house was as it was outsideold and worn in this first room there was a shoddy couch a tilting standing lamp a frayed recliner and an old television set gritch and yates fixed their attention onto dart who immediately pointed to the recliner the two evidence technicians attacked the piece working silently efficiently pulling cushions sweeping dusting for latent prints digging at the crevices glassine and white paper bags premarked with room locations were used to capture the finds in seconds the recliner was itself again no prints gritch whispered into her microphone playing in darts right ear dart scanned the room experiencing tunnel vision annoyed by the goggles schultz and his commandos were gone presumably conducting a preliminary search gritch tried dusting the television remote she shook her head at dart yates took a special solvent and cleaned the dust away leaving no trace of their having been here dart looked across at an upright piano missing several keys there were a half dozen photographs in acrylic frames on top he pointed these out to gritch and yates as well and again they descended on their targets with an uncanny quickness and efficiency bags were openedsomehow silentlyand gritch produced a special camera yates removed what looked like a flashlight from his pouch switched it on and directed it at the photographs without the goggles the special light would have appeared an extremely dull violet inside the night vision it appeared as if he had shined a halogen flashlight onto the subjects gritch fired off a series of shots and to darts surprise the camera worked in absolute silence it would be explained later that the camera was digital recording the images onto a computer disk these images could be enlarged and manipulated electronically room by room the team moved through the house the kitchen was tiny gritch and yates spent most of their three minutes there dusting objects and pulling tape in hopes of lifting latent prints dart checked the refrigerator and made mental notes male food bacon eggs hot dogs beer diet coke turkey sausage english muffins ice cream orange juice and a dozen frozen dinners yates swiped the toilet rim and bagged the tissue from the downstairs half bath gritch seemed to inventory the cleaning products paying special attention to those that retained price labels all the while a steady stream of communication flowed in to dart and schultz from the operations van mostly this came in the form of a running time count one minute two minutes thirty seconds these were punctuated by announcements of traffic approaching and traffic clear this barrage instilled in dart a sense of protection of security knowing that three plainclothes street officers were working the immediate neighborhood and were in constant touch with the operations van they had been inside the building just over five minutes before dart began to understand schultzs actions more clearly saddled with a team of sixconcerned for the units safetythe team leader was deftly deploying his manpower to avoid having more than three people occupy any one of the small rooms dart gritch and yates were orchestrated as a team while schultz and his three armed ert men swept the next area and kept on constant alert dart and the evidence team next found themselves headed down a narrow wooden staircase into an unfinished basement area that housed a washerdryer a clothesline several cardboard boxes of storage and just to the side of the staircase a workbench cluttered with flytying materials and hardware gritch signaled dart pointing to the side of the clothes washer and to the shelves above she shook her head no dart returned the gesture her message was unclear to him she touched her communication pack and whispered no detergent no bleach dart saw then what wasnt there realizing as zeller might have once schooled him that what was missing was as important as what was present and that gritch and yates had been carefully schooled in such matters dart nodded making a mental note dart pointed out the flytying work area and the team descended on it furiously photographing sampling and collecting again dart found himself impressed all their combined movements measured coordinated and productive they left the basement within two minutes schultz directed dart and the evidence team to the second floor where a narrow hall accessed two bedrooms and two baths the main bedroom was larger than the guest room and had its bath adjoining there was enough ambient light here that dart could remove the annoying goggles but gritch and yates kept wearing theirs seven minutes came the steady voice in darts earpiece the evidence pair went about photographing and sampling areas of the room while the detective stood back studying the layout the beds headboard was centered between two windows that faced the alley across from the bed a chest of drawers awkwardly spanned the corner just clear of the door to the bath to the right of which was a door to a closet something about the room troubled dart though he couldnt put his finger on itthe neatness the cleanliness the lack of personality he wasnt sure it clearly had been lived in he could make out a small pile of coins on top of the dresser a bic pen and what might be a roll of antacids yates was already busy working these for latent prints dart edged over to the closet and carefully opened it his hand sweating inside the latex glove there were a dozen shirts on hangers and a white wire rack that held folded jeans socks underwear tshirts a sweatsuit and other clothing gritch tapped dart on the shoulder moved him and began shooting photographs of the closeted clothing yates training the special lowlevel flashlight on the contents we have an unidentified male approaching on foot on zion the voice in darts ear announced heads up people schultzs voice said into darts earpiece lets rendezvous at the base of stairs immediately he paused right now people yates returned to the clothes dresser and wiped down the pen and several of the coins gritch prepared and then bagged the digital camera and said to dart this was closed correct yes she shut the closet door fully closed fully closed dart acknowledged suspect is turning down hamilton came the spotter in darts right ear team leader inquired the male voice from the van do you copy that please copy replied schultz prepare to evacuate all personnel the operations van announced calmly roger over the communications device schultz ordered down here now people get the lead out as dart headed out of the bedroom he glanced over his shoulder to see both gritch and yates dash into the bathroom and then back out through the bedroom their heads and the ungainly goggles sweeping left to right during the briefing schultz had informed dart that he wanted these two particular technicians because of their incredible photographic memories he had told a story about gritch returning from a raid and reciting fortyfive tides of books contained on the studys shelveshe estimated that gritch had been inside there less than a minute a later sid report had confirmed all fortyfive titles report the operations van requested subject is entering hamilton court the male voice replied youll need to abort via the back route copy how could the dispatcher sound so calm dart wondered his chest felt on the verge of exploding copy said the van back route copy replied schultz schultz and his two men were waiting at the bottom of the stairs we have an abort situation schultz announced over the unit intercom unidentified subject approaching he tripped a button on his belt pack and said to the operations van status the back is still clear dart heard in his earpiece schultz repeated this schultz now addressed dart directly the nightvision goggles making him look like some kind of bug your call detective do we apprehend or not this was first time dart heard emotion override the mans military mannerschultz wanted to stay and apprehend the suspect dart asked gritch how did we do in here well below what we might have hoped for yates nodded his agreement she was saying that they had nothing no evidence of consequence in a flurry of activity dart then heard the operations van direct the field surveillance operatives operations van this is control shepherd can we get a video of the subject with a driveby detective shepherd negative hes already in the alley if you get a pickup youll be lucky id advise the team to enter pope park well pick up at york street operations van negative on pope park were rolling team leader acknowledge abort schultz off mike said well dart did not want to apprehend given the lack of evidence he wanted this suspect but not yet negative then he immediately voiced a consideration to brandon can we get a look at him brandon aware of the order of rank looked to schultz for the answer we can get anything detective schultz said its your call personnel van whats the call operations van team leader field agent suspect has passed target hes turning down the drive schultz yanked the gooseneck microphone to in front of his mouth and said for everyone to hear hes going for the back door well take the front he threw the switch on his communications device and spoke schultz well need ten seconds operations van you wont get it schultz placed his gloved hand on the doorknob pointing at brandon dart asked can we leave the camera set up in here if we leave brandon we can came schultzs answer we dont have the necessary warrants for wire surveillance but we are allowed in here if you want to record this guy its going to have to be in person your decision but well pick it up in the van dart asked in the operations van yes schultz answered brandon and i stay dart said operations van suspect is inside the back gate you better get out dart heard a rattle at the back door as a key turned schultz faced his crew and said were going to take him people positions no dart objected with a harsh whisper his body in full sweat the sound of the key in the lock somehow louder we cant make it schultz countered were too late dart argued we hide ride him out maybe we get a shot to leave schultz and dart faced each other and despite the goggles dart felt as if he were looking directly into the mans eyes and that they were locked in a battle of wills schultz acquiesced observation only until further notice go the door cracked came unlocked and cracked open tentatively the ert crew scattered and disappeared instantly brandon and dart raced up the stairs dart didnt see where the others went only schultz who stashed himself into the front coat closet as he reached the landing following closely on brandons heels dart heard something like static in his right ear and realized it was schultz barely whispering over the intercom schultz i want location reports check in asap give me suspects position people ert agent philgim philgim im in the kitchen ert agent donaldson donaldson basement stairs ert agent brandon brandon upstairs bedroom dart dartelli upstairs bedroom schultz split it up up there ert agent yates yates basement with donaldson ert agent philgim hes inside silence over the intercom dart heard a floorboard creak downstairs and he prayed it was the suspect not one of schultzs commandos he didnt want a dead suspect and these ert types were weaponssharp brandon following orders motioned for dart to enter the closet and that he brandon would take up a position in the bathroom to dart it felt as if several minutes passed before another voice came over the intercom ert agent gritch gritch living room hes heading for the stairs hes using a flashlight the idea of a flashlight didnt sit well with dart the resident would certainly use the lightsunless dart thought he wanted to disguise his coming and going perhaps hiding in the closet affected dart so much of his youth having been spent hiding in places like this perhaps it was that even all these years later by imitating his actions as a child he was suddenly a part of those emotions a surge of frustration anxiety and anger swept through him stealing control of the rhythm of his heart he realized that he was not standing inside this darkened closet by choice but because someone else had directed him here brandon schultz it didnt matter who he had done this not by choice but necessity adrenaline filled him with panic he felt claustrophobic as if this tiny space were shrinking in on him he heard footsteps coming upand he could actually smell his mothers cheap perfume could hear the woosh of her dress he knew where he was a cop standing in a darkened closet that it was their suspect coming up the stairs not his mother but nonetheless he smelled her no mistaking that perfume he yanked the goggles down over his eyes and wondered if the beating of his heart could be heard through the closet door schultz suspect is at top of stairs donaldson philgim provide backup schultz was seeing to it that dart and brandonan hpd cop and a techie the lowest of the low in his opinion no doubthad some ert support something dart could do without he mustnt lose this suspect or find himself in a firefight he heard breathing on the other side of the closet door and it was everything he could do not to imagine his mother im a grown man he told himself and yet the past remained he held his breathhe could hide better than the best of them he reached down and fingered his weapon if that door came open there was going to be hell to pay he could picture the two ert men ascending the stairs delicately not emitting a sound despite the old planks trained to be weightless trained killers he wondered what their nightmares were what demons possessed them the sound of the suspects heavy breathing passed by the door grew faint and then disappeared ert agent philgim suspect is inside the bathroom dart heard a sweep of fingers on the outside face of the door like a faint scratching and realized that the ert men were signaling him warning him they were in the room they didnt want dart firing on them schultz i dont want brandon at risk apprehend suspect repeat apprehend ert agent philgim apprehend copy dart gently eased the closet door open philgims goggles swung to face him the agent nodded pointed toward the bathroom and then to the weapon in his hand dart slipped his sidearm out philgim pointed to donaldson who was also facing dart donaldson held a phosphorous grenade up for dart to see and indicated for dart to remove his gogglesthe bright light would be blinding dart nodded lowered his head pulled the goggles up onto his head and covered his eyes ert agent philgim brandon phos grenade dart heard the click of a tongue brandon being in the same room as the suspect could not speak not even in a whisper and yet had communicated his acknowledgment these people arent human dart told himself he heard a loud pop and even with his eyes shielded a flash of blinding white light flooded him there was a series of harsh shouts and commands as the ert agents announced themselves police stay where you are no movement hold it they moved in careful orchestration one protecting the other dart screening himself with the doorjamb saw the suspect kneeling on the floor both hands over his eyes the grenade had blinded him the effect would last several minutes there was a smell of bitter smoke and a gray haze floating on the ceiling the porcelain lid that belonged on the top of the toilet tank was off and a wet brick and a plastic bag containing small glass vials sat on the closed seat the brick ostensibly inside the toilet to conserve water turned out to be a hollow plastic imitationa hiding place designed and sold as such in their quick assessment of the bathroom yate and gritch had missed this philgim yanked the mans arms behind his back announcing you are under arrest on suspicion of tampering with crime scene evidence this was the way the search warrant read dart was amazed at the teams efficiency and the way that they stuck to procedure the handcuffs snapped into place fuck off said the husky voice of the suspect his head still bent toward the ground dart knew that voice it belonged to roman kowalski chapter john haite looked exhausted rubbing his eyes to get the sleep out he dart and kowalski sat in the second of the two capers interrogation rooms dart still dressed in black on the rooms only table was the plastic bag containing the glass vials that dart had seen on the toilet brandons fiberoptic video had recorded all of kowalskis movements once inside the bathroom ironically by their efficiency the ert team had invalidated this evidence by showing that kowalski had collected it and kowalskis name was not listed on the warrant it was a bugaboo that had both haite and dart in a lather i want to hear that again haite said angrily dart had to let haite conduct the first round of questioning rank had its privileges kowalski said a phone call a tip a snitch i got the call i responded i was told if the key was outside the place would be empty but i wasnt about to go inside calling hellos what the fuck guy told me there was some shit hidden inside a fake brick in the toilet i headed straight there he was talking like i wouldnt have much time all without a warrant haite interrupted i understand the problem here kowalski answered and were supposed to buy this haite questioned what the fuck do i care sergeant thats the way it is watch it haite warned the key to the back door dart asked hanging on the nail right where the snitch told me id find it jesus what a pile of shit haite said and what about this he said pointing to the bag on the table he told me where to find that too kowalski said reluctantly i know it sounds bad it sounds godawful haite corrected impossible is more like it its the way it went down the man said sheepishly bullshit haite counted its fucking bullshit kowalski and we all three know it you had better shit or get off the pot pal because otherwise a load of trouble is coming your way dart trying to calm things down asked what did the snitch say about this stuff he pointed to the table he said there was shit pertaining to the suicides that id be interested in he said there was some kind of coverup some kind of cleanup man involved he said there was evidence there that could bust the thing wide open and that if i was interested i had better get my butt over to hamilton court shit it sounded good to me he complained to haite he whined it sounded good sergeant what the fuck do i know you know about warrants for chrissakes procedure jesus youre a fuckup he hesitated his voice rising as he went and that is if we believe any of this crap because i for one dont believe a goddamn bit of it detective not one goddamn bit youre a fucking embarrassment to this division a fuckup of a cop and youll be waving traffic or doing time when im through with you now tell us what the fuck youre up to who the hell this wallace sparco is and how the hell you fit in or im sending your ass to booking and youre getting a number pal kowalski paled in all his years of service dart had never seen the man lose his color despite that he placed his spread hands onto the table and said calmly i got a call from a snitch a snitch youd never heard of before haite pressed true but he knew about the suicides he seemed to know what he was talking about he told me id be interested told me where the key was told me what id find i followed up on it then you guys he said to dart honesttofucking god its all i know without a warrant haite protested i know i know this stuff is useless to us haite shouted pointing at the table its probably key evidence to this fucking investigation and its absolutely useless it wasnt until haite put it so succinctly that dart understood he couldnt mention it to the othersthey would never believe it it was zeller he had found a way to invalidate the evidence knowing kowalski would sucker into anything easy he had made a pawn out of the man and used him to cancel out this evidence dart stood up where the fuck are you going haite thundered theres something ive got to do tommy templeton did not appreciate being awakened at four in the morning he had lit a cigarette coming out of bed and opened the door with it dangling from his mouth he was wearing a pair of blue boxer shorts exactly what the fuck are you doing he asked dart the detective handed him an envelope i need five maybe ten minutes of your time you look like a fucking ninja its been a long night weve got kowalski in lockup its a mess come in let me put some coffee on i cant think without coffee ill get the coffee you take care of that templeton undid the clasp and opened the manila envelope he slipped out a fivebyseven blackandwhite photograph and turned it around walter zeller what the hey you can do what you do in reverse right templeton appeared puzzled im telling you i need coffee you got the advantage here this morphing stuff glancing at the photograph again templetons brow knitted sure i have a drivers license photo i have the composite that you made with the girl yeah so i think theyre both zeller dart said and this is not for public consumption jesus fucking christ templeton swore skip the coffee im awake now ten minutes later the two sat before templetons monitor the artist had carefully enlarged sparcos drivers license photo and superimposed this into the scanned image of zellers police id zellers face fit perfectly inside sparcos its the distance between the eyes and temples the artist explained those are two givens that cant be changed he worked with a small pen on a digitized pad and gently erased sparcos jowls thinned the mans swollen lips and reduced the discolored bags under his eyes a moment later there was only zellers face on the screen looks like you get a gold star dartelli what if i dont want it joe dart asked chapter with bud gorman having retraced zellers former employment to proctor security dart started with terry proctor the security firm occupied the top two floors of a fourstory cement and steel structure on asylum street the receptionist in her late twenties wore a gray wool italian suit with black buttons and a white blouse buttoned at the collar at darts office the receptionist was an irish sergeant with a wart on his chin and a scowl on his face after waiting a few minutes dart was led down a hallway lined with corporate citations and blackandwhite photographs of international cities terry proctor imagined himself a big player in corporate security when in fact he was small potatoes the big boys like kroll associates had never heard of him and never would his office overlooked a section of the connecticut river brown and lazy and a view east of barren trees interrupted by buildings it had been decorated like a cheap tearoom muzak played from hidden speakers making dart slightly nauseated he half expected a cocktail waitress proctor was ruggedly handsome six two with piercing blue eyes and wide shoulders but he dressed like a usedcar salesman he wore goldplated cuff links and black glasses etched with a bifocal line his hairpiece matched his glasses his smile the cufflinksgold fillings dart sank into a brown vinyl couch that hissed at him like a snake proctor worked a remote control device aimed it at the wall and the music stopped thank god i had hoped you might be looking for employment proctor said to dart he came across as a male madam trying to lure dart into homosexual prostitution walter zeller worked for you after he left the department dart said it was quite the coup when we got walter proctor said though he looked a little nervous dart thought a huge disappointment when he left but then again with all hed been throughpersonallynot too big a surprise im not sure hell ever be happy in the private sector he advised some people arent made for this work and im not saying its easier or more difficult than what youre doing where you are nowdifferent is all he toyed with his wristwatchalso goldplated some of the finish worn off can i ask what he was working on when he was with you of course you can ask he smiled a toothpaste smile and offered dart a patronizing look if only i could answer he said the smile not leaving his face the strongest selling point for any private security firm is confidentiality detectivethe cornerstone of our business im sure you understand it goes no further than me dart promised im not here to lift your skirt joe the man said earnestly leaning forward and speaking softly dart wondered if the office had a hidden tape recorder he basically confirmed this when proctor reached out and triggered the remote returning the music and covering his voice guys like proctor thought of themselves as big shots the real big shots never let on you wouldnt believe the ndas i have to sign nondisclosure agreements the boilerplate runs twenty pages many go over fifty this length seemed to be a source of pride for proctor you wouldnt believe the penaltiesseven figures in some cases im bound legally and morally to keep my lips zippedthats all there is to it he didnt have a moral ounce in his body so are my employees its one reason we pull such large paychecks people come to us to keep things quiet okay sorry so even if you wanted to help me you couldnt dart tested of course id like to help bullshit let me tell you something proctor ill come here with subpoenas if i have to youll have to the man said offering another staged smile seemingly unaffected corporate private anything you can give me sorry dart saw resistance in the mans eyes he didnt want dart to have this information out of stubbornness or guilt im in a position where i have to have no comment joe i wish i could help you okay sorry what makes a man leave a cushy security job after only a couple months dart asked thats not privileged i told you as far as i could tell he just wasnt ready for this we operate differently than you guys sure we pay well and for that we expect loyalty dedication attention to detail my take is that walter needed more time he needed more time to grieve over his wifes deaththats my opinion youre saying it was for personal reasons absolutely nothing to do with his work dart pressed the man looked uncomfortable you can answer that dart reminded proctor flashed his plastic smile you want to tell me what it is that you are working on joe whats your interest in zeller are we both interested in zeller dart asked we serve a necessary function i help ease your workload whether you acknowledge that or not you break laws to accomplish your clients needs we uphold those laws we break the little lawsthe ones you wish you could break chain of custody warrants for search and seizure were rarely after a court settlement we do what were hired to do to break the law not at all you know that joe we play within the accepted boundaries if we didnt we would be out of business you know that you wont help me with zeller dart asked i cant its not that i dont want to and if i subpoena you and it happens to leak to the media are you threatening me joe im warning you terry he said having never met the man before id rather keep the gloves on but if they come off i want you to know that im serious about this were not talking about taking bedroom pictures of some ceos unfaithful wife this somehow caught proctor where he lived the man squared his shoulders and sat back in his chair his face red his fists and jaw clenched in an angry voice he said dont be an asshole dartelli it doesnt suit you i need answers you wont get them here ill get them well see on his way back dart found a pay phone and called gorman i need a client list for a security firm in town can you get it for me proctor securities can you do it i can identify all deposits and i can trace those deposits to bank accounts will that do dart gave him the dates of zellers employment at proctor are we getting somewhere gorman asked hopefully part of the reason for the mans participation over the years dart had come to understand was the excitement the speeding tickets were just an excuse were getting somewhere dart answered but the closer we get the worse it looks chapter i tell ya teddy bragg said to dart sitting in the cramped forensic sciences office this is rocket science or might as well be so if i lose you speak up because i dont want to have to explain everything all over again dart felt uneasy bragg had excitement in his bloodshot eyes and he offered a wide smile of his capped teeth recently bragg had not been smiling about anything his skin had a little more color to it he had come to dart in person something unheard of for bragg he had ranted on about how dart should thank him for doing all the necessary research because without it he wouldnt know what he knew and now that he knew what he knew he knew it was important critically important he had said dart had followed him down the hall with his heart in his throat hed never seen bragg like this you look better dart said feel better he pointed to a canister in the corner of the office that amid all the other debris dart had failed to notice otwo he said good old oxygenor new oxygen actually he smiled again showing off his dental work let me get this straight dart offered seeing the open pack of cigarettes on the mans desk youre still smoking but now youre taking oxygen as well physician heal thyself but youre no md buzz mind your own business it works dont knock it are you paying attention are you yes he handed dart a photocopy of a page containing too many boxes all filled with numbers full blood workup that you requested harold payne whats it tell us dart asked it tells me i tell you he replied arrogantly what it tells me is that your boy was a quart low on androgens everything else checks out fine androgens male hormones testosterone and company the hard in hardon slow down buzz we arent even started yet i tell yathis is a wolf in sheeps clothing this is the kind of thing that a guy like me lives for you been there you know androgens dart repeated he took out his notepad seeing this bragg said good boy now youre getting the point what is the point or do you have to take me through two years of premed first dont get cute bragg warned most hormones can be categorized as either peptides or lipids peptides are chains of amino acids lipids are fats and oils steroids are an example of a lipid did you hear me steroids do i have your interest yet both males and females possess endocrine systems that deliver estrogens what we think of as female hormones and androgens the male hormones in varying quantities those quantities control development and maturity of the genitals body hair breasts voice rangehuman sexuality he craned forward pay attention some say the psychology of sex as well because many peptides have association with psychological activity it is a delicate and precious balance responsible for the propagation of all species a peptide is a chain of amino acidsyou make it longer and it becomes a protein in its shorter version it acts as a hormone on an atomic level there are some fascinating things that take placebut ill save you that unless youre interested give me the cliff notes version bragg warned youre going to need to study this if youre ever going to understand it this wont come easy ivy this isnt ballistics or even dna fingerprinting this is heady stuff we would have missed this if you hadnt pushed for that workup but you did and i gotta tell ya i love this shit but worth what dart repeated were talking about vastly diminished levels of androgens ivy radically diminished levels if you follow me i want to follow you im trying dart said ill tell ya somethingbased on this blood work i would have bet the farm that payne was a neuter no testicles but i checked answering darts puzzled expression he said damn right i checked with doc rayjewels intact which means that there is no medical explanation for these deficiencies and let me just say that hormone deficiency has been a major focus of the medical community for decades and im quite aware of the science as a whole and certain treatments in specific does this has to do with his being a wife beater it certainly could you bet and if you ask me it does opinions might vary but theres the rub lower levels should make this guy passive abnormally higher levels of androgens would be anticipated in a sex offender and thats where the research i was talking about comes in he pointed to a stack of books he was speaking so excitedly that dart could barely understand him i got some of this online last night some of it from standard reference ive posted a couple of emails i should know more by tomorrow or friday fascinating stuff he said let me get this straight paynes levels were lower than normal and given his abhorrent behavior with his wife we would expect higher levels i would bragg corrected yes and heres the bigger problem the blood workup did not reveal any medicationthe synthetic or animal hormones we would expect to encounter with chemical castration castration let me give you some background he pointed to the stack of books and newspaper articles on the countertop first off keep in mind that were talking about sex offenders ivy very important were talking about men who take tenyearold girls behind toolsheds and force them to have sex full penetration oral sex anal sex you name it it aint pretty if its assault then they break a few limbs in the process beat her up or if its a harold payne then its the beating her up that counts bruises contusions lacerations fractures these guys are beasts if youre asking if we care about these guys dying all i can say is im not i tell ya im not crying over losing harold paynenot if he took his own life but were both questioning that arent we of course we are or you wouldnt be here listen to meseveral years back late eighties finland instituted a program of voluntary castration for its sex offenders they traded these men freedom for castration the group was monitored and studied over a fouryear period the results were impressive two to four percent recidivism versus eighty in the control groupa ninetyeight percent reduction in sexual assault and even these figures are skewed the two to four percent repeat offenders were picked up for offenses like voyeurism and flashing in fact none of the castrated offenders went on to commit a violent sexual act not one the castrations were voluntary dont forget bragg continued i tell ya its a relatively simple procedure the testicles are removed and replaced by prosthesis and dont feel too sorry a percentage of the group reported having intercourse about once a month but the abhorrent behavior caused by either defective hormone productionif you willor the bodys overproduction was eliminated entirely simple english castration works but paynes equipment was intact dart reminded scientists and researchers in this country bowed to the religious right and deemed castration barbaric this despite the obvious success but it led to other attempts the us decided that a less barbaric solution would be to administer high doses of estrogen in theory to counterbalance the ill effects of the overproduction of testosterone thats known as chemical castration it was tried on a voluntary basis in some of our prisons it failed on two counts one because of the inherent social problems with this approach breast development loss of facial hair a change of voice two it just plain didnt work the funding was scrapped and the program dropped we reverted to locking away sex offenders but for far too brief a time teddy where am i going with this he asked rhetorically let me tell ya he spun his chair around and produced one of several gray cardboard boxes the size and shape of a shoe box he removed the lid and pulled out a plastic bag inside of which was a smaller plastic bag inside of which were the glass vials recovered from hamilton court dont jump all over me about the inadmissibility of this evidence because ive heard all about it and besides thats your problem i dont give a shit my job is to make sense of evidence and boy can i make sense of this talk to me dead viruses he said pointing to the vials mean anything vaccine good boy bragg said clearly impressed only in this case youre wrong close but no cigar mention of a cigar reminded dart of zeller and he studied bragg closely to see if maybe the man knew more than he was letting on he decided that he wasnt so there are three systems currently in wide use for the delivery of gene therapy gene therapy dart echoed dna the building block of life i got that dart said anxiously my guess is that our mr payne was in a gene therapy program dart finally saw what bragg was getting at he nearly shouted a program involving sex offenders wife beaters bragg nodded its called antisense technology what it amounts to is divining which gene produces ill effects and then attaching dna material to that gene to resequence its behavior its been effective with huntingtons disease high cholesterol its a wideopen field the government has been actively mapping human dna since the eighties in something called the human genome project everyones involvedeven bill gates we found injection marks dart stuttered we thought maybe giving blood or selling plasma bragg acted out giving himself a shot in the arm shooting up dead viruses mixed with fresh genes its the ultimate solution he said nothing barbaric about it fix the gene correct the hormonal imbalance improve the behavior like cutting the nuts off without a knife break the chain im not saying thats whats going on here but its possible how possible quite possible bragg pointed to the vials if this shit is what i think it is its the cutting edge chapter and what do you think abby asked i think zeller knows about these gene therapy tests i think he doesnt want anybody offering a cure to sex offendersanother excuse to parole them nesbit was on parole at the time he killed lucky and the three others its difficult isnt it hows that dart asked no tears for guys like gerald lawrence theres a part of mea big partthat wishes them dead i work with their victimsbut week in and week outand whats been done to them makes me sick oh yes she reassured him me too dont think i get used to this you never get used to it this came as a relief to dart who had worried that she had become hardenedthat something had been stolen from her as well he explained that was a major part of my reasoning for not going forward with the ice man who cares making them dead is somehow more satisfying than locking them up but what if there is treatment and what about so many sex offenders expressing pressing remorse and genuinely wanting to stop she asked i know its not an easy issue i know what has to be done dart said dreading this thought well i know what has to be done too she said seductively she wore a pair of tight blue jeans and a loosefitting gray sweater that dart found provocative because when she leaned over it fell open at the neck drinking a beer from the bottle she was sitting in darts one remaining captains chair her left leg kicked up over the arm he was prepping a radicchio and shrimp risotto and trying to concentrate on the recipe mac was snoring at abbys feet before you start that she said take a break once you get going on a risotto you cant stop she motioned him into a chair tell me about kowalski dart opened a beer its possible that hes telling the truth he told us the same story three times in a row and he remembered details well the trouble with interviewing a cophe knows what youre looking for he could be full of shit its hard to say but you believe him she stated i do haite doesnt and i cant tell haite because it involves zeller and im not ready to lay all that on him personally ive never believed anything kowalski says hes a bullshitter from way back she asked whats his status itll be reviewed meanwhile hes still active i dont imagine hes too keen on you he never has been she took a pull on the beer and set down the bottle there was something brewing in her what about these tests he asked you mean have i heard anything have they discovered some abnormal gene in sex offenders to my knowledge no but listen there have been rumors for years about a crime gene youve heard that stuff the times reported last february that the genea combination of geneshad been identified nothings impossible she asked rhetorically is there a prozac for sex offense not that ive heard of not yet but as teddy bragg says stay tuned would you have heard if there is such a thing being tested doubtful no something that controversial would be cloaked in secrecy i wouldnt know about it until it hit the mainstream and theres nothing close to mainstream i do keep up it felt right to have her here comfortable easy she drew down the beer got up and found her way through the kitchen drawers until she had what she needed to set the table dart enjoyed his moment off his feet what are you thinking about she asked him placing down a fork for his place kowalski he lied he coughed that cough sounds bad she said you live with that thing dont you he didnt feel like telling her about it he had never told anyone and didnt see why he should start now he said its not the best story and wondered how it was that his mouth had so purposely disobeyed his brain its a bad story actually he added wondering where that too had come from you dont have to tell me you know no i dont want to his brain answered i had what you might call a reckless mother a drinker she was a drinker and my father was nobody i never knew him at least i dont think i did but my mother was her brother was a dealer big time lots of money she was i dont know confused he took care of her she was eighty miles of bad road is what she was and i was on that road at least at the beginning i was the beginning for me as a kid you know i ran errands cooked booze mostly the errands bought her booze for her i think about it nowthis kid buying brown bags in the back alley jesus what a time in my life that was bad road she asked an angry drunk he answered he tried the beer he didnt want to talk about this and he thought if he kept his mouth busy then maybe she would get the hint change the subject it didnt seem to work she stared at him waiting she got confused about things money the booze sometimes she would drink an entire bottle while i was at school and by the time i got home she would think that i had never bought the bottle that i had spent her moneyas if it were hers anyway the money she got a check once a month from the brother drug money i later found out bad money he felt a little more relaxed it wasnt as hard to talk about as he had imagined she seemed interested but not terribly upset he had always thought that if he talked about it the person would get upsetthe way he felt about it mad real mad so you got sick she asked the cough she reminded no no he said not sick i she when she got mad when she mixed things up she she took it out on me i was handy i guess hit you she asked but in a way that sought to clarify not accuse yeah he answered i guess so he thought about starting to eat the risotto he was feeling nervous not comfortable at all yeah she hit me he admitted how many times had he lied to the school nurse about this how many years had he covered for her and on this particular night he suddenly unloads what the hell is going on he wondered hit me all the time and you can only take so much of thati could only take so much of thatbefore you learn to run it kind of trains you to be a coward he said this came the hardest for himthat he had run all these years later and it still felt cheap to run from her as if he didnt measure up he had always wanted to hit her back he had never lifted a hand her face all bloated her eyes unfocused who could hit that he wondered you dont have to talk about this she repeated a few minutes had passed he realized he hadnt touched his food but i want to hear if you do want to talk about it i ran he said he felt the stinging in his eyes and he wondered if he should leave the table i ran he said again he swallowed it felt as if a chicken bone were stuck in there and i learned to hide until she settled down passed out is more like it used to find her on the floor like a beached whale lying there i couldnt move her thought she was dead wishful thinking i suppose he felt tears running and powerless to do anything about it abby didnt seem fazed she was still staring at him intensely but he felt no judgment coming from her shes trained for this shit he thought suddenly understanding why he had picked this particular woman to unload on shes the one who could handle it he continued so i hid the broom closet the basement there was a piece of furniture in the dining room that i could fit into but she found me almost always until i discovered the dryer the clothes dryer her face remained impassive revealing no opinion no sympathy no pity and yet he knew that she had heard him he wondered if she could be so objective so internally calm or was this some kind of act that she had learned as a professional she never thought to look in the clothes dryer he explained it became my first choice and more than once i had been doing a load of laundry and i would yank that laundry out of there as fast as i could and climb inside and pull the door closed the heat she said your lungs he nodded his throat felt scratchy but he didnt want to cough in front of her for it suddenly felt as if it would seem he had forced it so he swallowed it away and said roughly yeah i figure i fried them hiding in there he drank something to do keep his hands busy stop them from shaking somewhere to avert his eyes he thought that maybe five minutes passed in complete silence it felt more like an hour thank you she said he felt embarrassed all of a sudden he had lowered his mask and felt incredibly vulnerable is she still alive no but she lasted a long time i was eighteen and i was still living with her dont ask me why he hesitated she had control i suppose thats why abby came out of her chair and approached him she bumped his chair and slipped a leg over him and sat down in his lap facing him she stroked his hair back at his temples and repeated thank you she rubbed away the snail tracks left by his tears he experienced a kind of giddy high flooded by the relief of having told someone the kiss that followed was gentle but by no means innocent he kissed his way across her chin and down her neck and as he did she whispered harder and he sucked the soft skin of her neck into his lips and she shuddered and purred umm he leaned her back and kissed down into the loose neck of the sweater as her hands slipped behind him and pulled his shirt free and warm fingers scrambled over his back sending flashes up his spine and gooseflesh head to toe abby knew his secret and knew his pleasure as well her back was hot to touch and the more he kissed her neck the more excited she grew until she muffled a knowing laugh of pleasure signaling that they had crossed a line in an explosion of energy she got out of the chair and led him down the hall and into the bedroom undressing herself as she went at that moment the buildings hallway fire alarm sounded loudly dart smelled smoke a curling fear ran down his spine he had a great fear of fire stemming from his drunken mother being a smoker perhaps it was the clothes dryer as a child or the memory of a range fire he had witnessed out west as a teenagergreat sheets of bright orange sweeping the plains and spewing a thick charcoal gray into the blue boundless skyor perhaps he thought it was simply an intuitive response to something that could kill so quickly but dart felt a surge of panic and though he saw abbys horrified expression and her mouth moving he heard no words she pulled on her clothes she searched the apartment door for heat dropped to her knees and sniffed between the carpet and door its okay he heard her say ready he asked were going she announced over the abrasive fire alarm far in the distance the first wail of a siren was heard ready he nodded his attention riveted on all that he was leaving behind on memories and artifacts of his time here with ginny she took hold of the doorknob slowly he cautioned stepping aside she nodded and eased the door open there was no flash of flame no billow of smoke only the increased volume of the alarm and the sounds of harried shouting and racing footsteps mac took off down the stairs a general sense of chaos surrounded them as they hurried to the central stairs and began their descent the smell of oil smoke was overpowering it smelled of fear and old paint and dust of all those years dart had used these stairs forsaking the tired elevator it smelled final the smoke grew thicker as they descended enveloping them like a fog they checked for each other at each turn of the metal handrail her wide eyes glanced over at him from below came sounds of panic two floors down dart caught sight of several familiar faces and wondered how he could live in the same place for so many years and know so few of his neighbors they knew him most knew he was a policeman and though he knew some by name not nearly enough mrs amory he said to abby as he stopped at the fire door to the ground floor eleanor amory went about in a motorized wheelchair and had picked this apartment building because of its location on a city bus route she was in her late seventies and fiercely independent abby apparently understood just by the way he spoke and she stopped and helped him check the door for heat before they passed through and into the downstairs hallway the smoke was heavier here and dart believed that it was coming from the parking garage that a car was on fire and this lessened his panic because fire could be contained well in the concrete garage they ran down the long hallway and only then was dart aware that the only light came from the emergency lights a fact that had escaped him all the training he thought wondering how panic had so easily engulfed him feeling it behind him now and glad to have it gone which apartment he heard abby call from behind him he kicked the door in signaled her inside and motioned for abby to take the rooms to the left dart took those to the right eleanor amory was not in the kitchen or the small sitting room or in any of the three closets that dart searched quickly joe abby called out eleanor amory was in her bedroom coiled into a ball in the far corner a nightgown bunched at her knees a collapsible wheelchair propped against the wall alongside her she was in shock her dull blue eyes glassy and open wide in a fixed stare abby stooped tried to communicate with the woman but it was of no use she tentatively eased her arms into the fold of the womans bent knees and behind her head and together with dart they hoisted her and dart took her fully into his arms as abby helped the woman to take hold around his neck a moment later they were outside in the alley behind the building and eleanor amory was in the care of emergency personnel abby stood holding the womans hand the alley was dark awash in the scattering fractured light of emergency vehicles and from the buildings garage a thick coiling plume of black smoke rushed into the night sky the area was crowded with onlookers as well as with residents of the building in pajamas raincoats and whatever else they had grabbed several held pets tightly in their arms one woman was crying as she stared up at her windows mac was sitting away from the chaos like an old person watching a parade dart felt the cold he felt awkward and out of place accustomed to being the one responding to an emergency rather than experiencing it firsthand there were so many things he wished hed taken photographs gifts letters his first uniform as a patrolman he ran down an inventory as he watched four fully clad firemen become swallowed by the smoke as they charged the garage he hoped for a quick resolution the night air was filled with the sound of communication radios spitting static of children crying and adults sobbing and an endless roar of orders being shouted about to the lay person the bystander the efforts of the emergency crews seemed chaotic and disorganized but dart knew better he crossed his arms tightly to fend off the cold a harsh and unforgiving voice whispered dont turn around ivy nod if you can hear me dart nodded he smelled the stale aroma of cigar smoke despite the petroleum in the air and he recognized the deep slow voice and the way that voice spoke his nickname i cant afford the attention walter zeller said dart stunned could feel the mans presence as he stepped closer and continued in a hushed whisper your volvo has had a slight problem is allan electrical short under the dash if there had been less plastic in it it might have never burned at all dart had so many things to say that nothing came out his thoughts bottlenecked somewhere near his tongue what with the fire and the chaos and the surprise that zeller had orchestrated all of this to make contact with him youll figure this out at least if you have any sense left in you you will he added i cant do your fucking work for you kid i told you that wish i could but then you wouldnt hold up on the stand would you you gotta do this yourself you gotta get your mind off your pecker and back onto your desk what i want you to think about ivy isand i want you to remember this youre looking at what you know what youre familiar with rather than digging in and finding whats really the cause here he added that theyre all connected the gene therapy dart said maybe you are listening he added maybe i should have just called you again you know how i like to do things in person so you torched my car dart said exasperated he made a move to turn around but zeller stopped him with a stern dont he added its not safe for me for you theyre murders ivy but its not what you think i know what you think do your fucking homework do us both a favor an old beatup car pulled into the far end of the alley not a police car not fire in the flashing lights dart couldnt make out the color or the face of the man who opened the car door and peered out quickly before climbing back in and driving off as a patrolman approached him to tell him to move you see that zeller asked theyre after me ivy why because i know the truthbecause i found out the truth find it damn it all do your fucking homework dart said softly the hormones he waited a second and turned his head slightly and said a treatment of some sort zeller didnt answer dart attempted to turn around for a second time expecting his effort to be blocked but instead faced the dark shadows immediately behind him broken only by the rhythmic hypnotic pulse of vehicle emergency lights zeller was gonevanished though dart could still hear the mans whispers over his shoulder his teacher his mentor gone his killer for a fraction of a second dart wondered if he had imagined this conversation he scanned the area again carefully probing every possible hiding place gone theyre murders ivy but its not what you think lies dart thought tricks hes toying with me find it damn it all do your fucking homework dart felt sick to his stomach the smoke curled into the night sky and then it too was gone chapter over the course of the transition between day and night tours detectives worked poorly sometimes falling asleep at their desks in the middle of interrogations or even during phone calls moods went sour and tempers flared haites unit including dart and kowalski had just switched to the graveyard shift and walking through capers was like entering an area laden with land mines to make matters worse the building was going to shit a leak that no one seemed able to stop ran a slow but constant drip into a fivegallon white plastic container in the far corner by the coffee machine the uninterrupted sound of it was a source of constant irritation covered only by the drone of activity to which dart and his colleagues had long since become accustomed dart cleared a domestic stabbing in the north enda black woman had killed her drunken lover he felt lucky because it was an early call eightthirty at night and that took his name off the phone list the rest of the night would be spent writing up an easy report speaking with the oncall prosecuting attorney and waiting for sunrise to free him he was midway into his report when the familiar banter inside capers slowly trickled down to nothing and the room was silent this took a moment to register at which point dart looked up and spun around to see ginny rice standing in the capers doorway everyone in the division had closely followed the drama of their split and her unexpected appearance had quieted his colleagues she wore a pair of gap khakis and a white shirt under a green sweater she had two earrings in her left ear and a small gold chain worn as a necklace dart stood and walked over to greet here doing so in as quiet a voice as possible hey there he said hey dart somewhere where we can talk he lead ginny to the crib and sat down with her at the scarred table where a copy of guns and ammo lay open i may be in some trouble she said up close she appeared dazed or overtired worn at the edges what kind of trouble it may be nothing he reached over and took her hand a mass of confusion he wondered how after the pain she had caused him he could feel so instantly comfortable with her she said the new policies remember i accessed billing twice dart had covered for her had helped her out of a legal knothole only to have her caught hacking a third time that had brought a federal conviction something that dart could not help with now he found himself feeling guilty about having asked her to do this it turns out there are dozens of new accounts all paid for by fund transfers from the same account its a union bank corporate account dozens she nodded all males and though i havent confirmed all of them i know that at least three have wives who were kicked by the system as victims of abuse the tests dart thought he said nothing i think what happened was that i tripped a security gate going into union trust you broke into a bank electronically she said adding defensively how else could i identify who paid for all this insurance it was a perk he said guessing that the insurance coverage had been used as an incentive to gain test subjects what never mind he said i thought i had a hole in the firewall she explained i thought i had a clean entry but maybe i stepped on something getting out im not sure all i know is that my software detected surveillance they watched you he exclaimed she nodded chances are they know what i went after and did you come straight here her face tightened i shouldnt have done that should i you never know dart said its doubtful they would have put you under physical surveillance if it was federal they would have busted me she answered you see she craned forward thats one reason i came straight here im hopinghell im prayingthat maybe you hpd has some kind of whitecollar crime thing in place because otherwise its private he answered yeah private and shit they could sue the pants off me id rather face you guys than a corporation any day they can sue you either way he added they wont though corporations rarely sued that brought the case public and exposed their system as vulnerable to electronic attack they preferred keeping things as quiet as possible often dropping all charges in exchange for a gag order against the hacker on occasion the hacker got a job offer from that very same company he reminded and you wouldnt rather face us youre on probation a second conviction and i do time i know she crossed her arms and shuddered im scared to death dartelli she said but hey i got the name of the company for you at least i didnt come out emptyhanded the people buying these policies paid out of a corporate account under the name roxin incorporated bud gorman would be able to answer questions about roxin dart wrote the name down she said i thought youd like that dart looked up from his notebook still angry with her why gin why take the chance what youre going to get mad at me for helping you i appreciate the help its not that she interrupted i want us back together the building was heated by forced air and it was the only sound in the room as dart averted his eyes back to his notebook and ginny scratched at some epoxy stuck to the table i miss you she said i miss you too he answered honestly youre involved with someone he reminded her from what i hear we both are yes i am too sort of sort of i am abby lang she said he had nothing to say ginny had left him what he did now was his business and his alone he said companies have their own computer security systems isnt that right they monitor their own systems for breaches this bank for instance its subcontracted usually yeah so if anyone knows about you its themthis private firm or the bank itself i did it from home she said as always two steps ahead of him all my stuff is on my home machine can they trace it back to you depends how good they are she replied how long they were on to me i had the call switched through new haven and routed through a yale web site normally they wouldnt be able to break that but i was on there pretty long they might have depends and if they did they could act or they could sit on me and go for a second hit two or three hits are more convincing easier to use against me but you will not go back there no she chuckled nervously not likely so we wait and see he offered she nodded are you okay worried yeah he agreed if theyre private they might watch me something like that i think thats whats bugging me the mostthe idea of that you know surveillance they might he admitted but if they misstep he reminded her then you can turn right around and sue themand that just might get the charges dropped she nodded but her fear was palpable its a thought he said if you suspect something like thatelectronic surveillance anything like thatyou should let me know maybe we can turn the cards on them he asked are you okay she looked like hell again she nodded but it was all show what about it she asked what about us zeller used to say to me you come to a fork in the road take it dart answered it elicited a smile from her a soft laugh dart coughed i guess thats where i am he said at that fork in the road she pursed her lips i understand im not saying no i understand abby may try to reconcile with her ex if she does and it works who knows and youre all right with that she asked incredulously its a unique relationship he answered were very much in the hereandnow well i cant say that im not jealous tomorrow is a long way off where abby and i are concerned she looked up at him with tears in her eyes he let go of her hand im sorry she said yeah answered joe dart me too dart called bud gorman at home and caught him before he went to bed i need yet another favor dart said cautiously testing if he had asked for too much lately referring to the speeding tickets he added im going to owe you a hell of a lot of fixes screw fixing the speeding tickets im getting a jeep i hit a piece of metal yesterdayone little piece of shit on the center line i was only doing about seventy probably in a thirtyfive zone dart thought thing had such low clearance it jumped up and punctured my gas tank lucky i didnt flame out shopped jeeps this afternoon its not safe out there its a company called roxin incorporated its called roxin laboratories inc gorman corrected its a biotech genetics firm i take it you got the email i sent you genetics dart thought but how do you know did you get the email or not gorman interrupted i havent checked today its swing shift im brain dead genetics he thought again roxin laboratories inc had purchased medical insurance policies for known sex offendersprotecting themselves in case the test program went badly and its gone badly dart thought brain dead huh well come alive for a minute cause what im talking about is the proctor securities client list you asked for i turned up every check written to the company for the last twentyfour months posted the list onto compuserve for you but roxin dart again began but was immediately interrupted is on the list joe proctor securities is on retainer to them theyre a big client i placed them in the top ten of my proctor list oh my god dart blurted out zeller would have discovered roxin while working for proctor it fit you want a credit run on roxin gorman offered no problem dart couldnt get a word out his mind cluttered with a dozen thoughts joe you there gorman added know anybody who can get me a good deal on a jeep chapter the spaceage facility was surrounded by a ninefoot wrought iron fence enclosing what appeared to be three or four acres of park the fence carried evenly spaced signs warning against unlawful trespass in the crotch of an elm tree dart spotted one of what he suspected were dozens of hidden security cameras roxin laboratories was a small fortress nine miles west of downtown and a few miles south of the town of avon nestled away in a thickly wooded hillside and overlooking the farmington river the physical plant consisted of a large fivestory geodesic dome of steel and mirrored glass and a similarly constructed multistory laboratory attached like a box to the domes south there were two vehicular entrancesthe main one with a manned booth and an automated entrance to the employees parking lot alongside the box dart showed his id to the guard and parked in a visitors spot close to the main doors all security guards wore dark blue uniforms pressed and starched with emblems stitched onto the right sleeve and name panels above the right breast pocket dart surrendered his weapon and his cellular phone and passed through a cleverly disguised metal detector met there by a man in his early twenties who owned a severe haircut and piercing green eyes and who introduced himself as richard richard wore a light blue suit and expensive shoes shined to a mirror finish he instructed dart on how to use his visitors pass in order to log in to the computerized security system to dart this felt a little bit like entering a prison the elevator panel operated only after richard swiped his creditcardsized security pass through the reader he and dart changed elevator cars on the third level after passing through another security station and entering the lab building a series of air locks gained them access to the second set of elevators and offices and labs beyond the need for an escort became quickly apparenthallways and doors lacked identification except for a cryptic band of bricked colors reminding dart of nautical flags on foot they crossed a skybridge connecting the elevator bank to the third floor of the lab building high above what richard called the terrariuma small enclosed courtyard complete with a running fountain and a living lily pond offices looked out onto the courtyard the security is somewhat ominous i know richard apologized but recombinant genetics is not to be taken lightly the security has much less to do with the integrity of our ideas than it does with the preservation of environmental continuity thats certainly reassuring dart said richard attempted what passed for a smile yes well we wouldnt want anything getting away from us richard explained no dart agreed we wouldnt after another ten yards dart said expensive facility exploring with a compliment when we started up biotechs were the darlings of wall street the board wanted to make a statement with the facilityand i think they have definitely dart agreed weve had enormous success with our arthritis drugartharest is its commercial name he announced and big things are expected of our prostate drugan anticancer gene therapy drug they arrived at a door marked with a red flag two blues and another red richard used his id card to gain them access and showed dart inside a generous conference room the table a series of thick slabs of black granite on a chrome frame had down its center three flat conferencing microphones that looked more like ashtrays the chairs were black leather slung between polished steel and braided wire a large abstract mural of polished pink stone and blue glass occupied most of the far wall a set of floortoceiling white laminate cabinets occupied the far end of the room presumably housing audiovisual equipment richard seated him asked if he could bring him something to drink and when dart declined retreated through a door that made a sound as if locking behind him four excruciatingly long minutes later the door opened and a tall slightly heavy middleaged woman with dull dark hair wearing a conservative gray suit and cream blouse entered graceful and poised she carried a large black leather briefcase with her that she parked in the chair next to the one into which she lowered herself she wore cream tights and black shoes with low heels she had never been pretty though always smart dart decided before she spoke a word welcome to roxin she said like a tour guide allowing the heel of her shoe to flap off her foot its quite the place dart said you dont see it from the road no only from the river and only then if youre looking its remarkable for its privacy im told that your time is extremely valuable so ill get right to it he said thats kind of you detective i need to confirm some names with you men involved in a test youre conducting a clinical trial she corrected which one dart felt out of his element dr arielle martinson was roxins director of research and development and ceo it surprised him that he had gained access to the top on his first trynot at all what he had expected typically he had to stairstep his way up the corporate ladder i have the names here he said passing her a sheet from his notebook the small wrinkled piece of notepaper suddenly seemed unprofessional to him he felt halftempted to apologize for it martinson was a woman with a formidable presence commanding a great deal of space around her the kind of person in whom he immediately sensed both leadership and integrity the two articles he had gleaned from the wall street journal and the new york times cast her as a woman pioneer in a predominantly male field the recipient of dozens of prestigious awards including a threehundredthousanddollar macarthur while at michigan where she had worked as part of the human genome project her specialty was hormonal gene therapy the journal had speculated that roxin was on the verge of a gene therapy treatment for menopausal side effects with a market projection of eight hundred million dollars annually she had a nervous habit of tugging her shortcropped dark hair down past her right ear and fiddling with it she kept herself nearly in profile to him shielding the practice as best as possible as if she was aware of it but could not control herself this from a woman who seemed by all measurable appearances in total control she accepted the notepaper read the names from it and made a phone call reciting the names into the receiver for the benefit of someone named angelica i see she said thanking the woman before hanging up she half turned to not quite face dart and looking at him out of the side of her eyes said yes they are listed with us though im afraid thats all i can share with you at this time dart was amazed by her frankness he had expected the runaround they are he repeated not quite knowing where to go having prepared for a battle yes he thought considering alternatives he felt certain from her preemptive statement that she would not discuss the nature of the trial are you aware that all three men are deceased he paused suicides the news clearly had an effect though she contained her surprise well clinical trials are conducted in the blind detective are you aware of that as the creator of the drug we can either hire an independent or remain with an inhouse team for our stagetwo efficacy trials either way these trials are conducted in the blind that is though were made aware of the names of the participants and occasionally have a role in selecting those individuals we are not informed as to who is receiving the actual drug and in stage three to whom the placebo is administered if in fact placebo testing is involved i see dart said again feeling out of his element would you be willing to discuss the nature of this particular trial he inquired your mention of suicide troubles me obviously she said and all that i can tell you is that were the suicides in any way linked to the trial we most certainly would have been notified i can assure you of that guidelines are quite rigid in that regard so youre saying these three suicides are unrelated he asked incredulously can you prove otherwise she asked voicing concern not anger he decided to drop the bomb were not entirely sure they were suicides dr martinson she turned as gray as her suit and her hand became busy with the lock of hair sabotage she asked are you saying that someone is attempting to sabotage my clinical trials if the suicides were connected to the trials he asked what then she smirked not liking that thought one bit she shook her head offering him a better view of her neck her hair whipping out of the way and briefly revealing what looked like a wide scar just below her ear her hand returned there quickly and turning her head away she said if our drug is made to appear to cause severe depression or other psychological side effects i can assure you that the trials would be immediately halted and we would take a serious look at the causal relationship but let me say too that one of the benefits of gene therapy is the specific targeting of the medication and therefore the lessening of many side effects associated with other groups of medications as to how it would affect uswell it would devastate us of course we dont think highly of killing our test subjects detective and let me just say that these drugs see rigorous testing prior to human trials and i certainly would not expect severe psychological disorders to go unnoticed and therefore untreated youd catch it first he said you bet we would she answered so someone could hurt your company if they were to imply an association between your trial and these suicides this kind of sabotage could ruin us she appeared nervous then irritable and anxious to be done with dart she said to be perfectly honest detective the idea of this is frightening and id like to get right on it again she said strongly i think if there were any such connection to be made i most certainly would have heard about it but if youd excuse me i need to know whats going on he said bluntly i understand she said i may be able to help you he offered yes she attempted a smile but it failed she was too shaken one last question dart said he felt invasive with these questions here was martinson having been told that someone was trying to sabotage her company and he dart continued to pry into every dirty corner is proctor securitiesyour security firmever involved in these trials in any way do they ever have access to these trials or to the trial results i should say not she flushed a bright crimson they police our parking lots for gods sake they help us with corporate espionage from at home and abroad her eyes went wide and she snapped where the hell are they when we need them he could see her making a mental note about this she pulled herself together and said this is a highly competitive field detective with tenshundredsof millions of dollars at stake if one product fails another may be in position to take its place terry proctor is supposed to stay on top of that kind of thing protect our interests she tried another smile this one more effective can we continue this another time dart nodded she spun her head around as she stood and dart stole a look at her neck definitely a scar a knife wound and by the look of it a nasty one chapter dart didnt want to return to hamilton court because the house was being kept under surveillance on the hope that wallace sparcowalter zellermight be apprehended but it was zellers own teachings that leaned dart toward going back and reexamining its contents that house remained the only physical link to the visitor at the payne suicide always return to the crime scene zeller had taught him usually i hate being on call samantha richardson said flirting with dart as she unlocked the door to the photo lab braggs assistant and photographer wore blue jeans and a red flannel top that looked suspiciously like pajamas at eleventhirty at night anything was possiblepeople showed up in the strangest clothes dart was hardly sleeping between the night tour and day calls like the one at roxin laboratories he felt a wreck and looked it too at night the tiny basement forensics lab smelled no better than during the daytime thanks to the photographic processor in the adjacent room richardson pulled a pair of chairs in front of the computer monitor and dart joined her for initial viewing we downsize the images for higher resolution she explained the ert team had shot digitized images not photographs richardson prepared dart for what he would see shooting in relative darkness as they did the lighting as you can imagine is off the camera sees things much as your nightvision goggles one of the nice things however is that we can ask the computer to compensate and correct the lighting deficiencies fill in color enhance and often the images get surprisingly close to a welllighted even daylight look thats what well do she told him well start with the degraded image and enhance we can always get back to the original the first image a shot of the sitting room with the recliner and television appeared on the screen at first a difficult green and white a black bar moved slowly down the screen and as if lifting a shade the room was suddenly in full color the technology amazed dart youll like this she said typing furiously and then grabbing the computers mouse the floor of the room suddenly tilted and the image became fully threedimensional as if dart were on a ladder looking down what the hell dart asked the digital cameras are stereoopticanother advantage the computer uses algorithms to create the threed effect she rotated the room so that dart was looking from a different direction but the left of the screen was blank she explained the computer cannot fill that which the camera never saw she pointed to the blank side of the frame and said this is where the photographer was standing while taking the shot dart gushed with enthusiasm over the technology which richardson clearly appreciated she complained only the staties can afford the cameras but maybe one of these days frame by frame richardson walked dart through the house and through the evidence the ability to manipulate the point of view afforded dart the opportunity to see the rooms from many angles he studied each carefully occasionally requesting an enlargement of a particular area something the computer could render in seconds room by room he sought out any physical evidence that might provide insight into where to look for walter zeller aka wallace sparco the killer is inside them zellers words continued to haunt him as much as dart believed zeller was the killer the only convincing physical evidence that he possessed connected the resident of hamilton court to paynes suicide everything else remained circumstantial and though he now believed that zeller was sparco it didnt necessarily mean that sparcozeller had actually killed payne perhaps as zeller wanted dart to believe it was the roxin drug that connected all the suicides and martinson and her company were in fact the ones to blame no matter hamilton court seemed to offer dart the main hope of finding answers and its resident if he could only locate zeller for several days now he had cursed himself for not attempting to bring in zeller at the fire he wasnt sure how he might have accomplished that he had ended up outside unarmed and in shock but he blamed himself for falling under zellers controlling spell ever the student the listener are you with me richardson asked sure she led him through a series of enhanced images that took them down the basement stairs and into the laundry room even under the effects of the computers improved colors the room appeared dingy and dank dart recalled the moldy suffocating smells there he said leaning forward and pointing out the workbench can you enlarge that richardson rendered the image into d rotated it to face the workbench and then stepped the computer through a series of enlargements drawing the workbench progressively closer flytying gear he said fly fishing she said yes there was a small flytying vise that sat beneath an adjustable light both mounted to the workbench and with a magnifying glass attached above the vise the shelves were littered with feathers and plastic containers too grainy in enlargement to see well if dart had not known that wallace sparco was in fact walter zeller he might have passed right by this as he had on the night of the raid but suspecting this might be zellers lair the flytying kit stuck out walter zeller hated fishing the kit made sense only as an effort to create a fictional identity for sparco as such its existence could be explained but dart the student the man who knew walter zeller nearly as well as zeller himself read more into it the ruse was too elaborate to be explained as an effort to mislead investigators he could have left a tennis racket or a bag of golf clubs its more important than that dart thought thats as good as were going to get it samantha richardson said dart checked his watch no he said we can do better dart knocked on the car door and then slipped inside the man behind the wheel had blond hair and a dark mustache he looked younger than his thirtyeight years dart knew him as jack he had forgotten his last name anything dart asked glancing down the street at hamilton court nothing lights i said nothing didnt i im going inside dart informed him if youre going inside im going to take a leak if im going inside i want you as backup he indicated his cellular phone if someone shows up i want a warning well the man protested i want to take a leak you wait for me ill be your backup dart wrote down his cellular number dont be long he requested you want a doughnut or coffee jack asked no thanks dart returned to his departmentissue taurus with the volvo out of commission getting to work had meant hitching a ride with a friend or taking a city bus he was tired of both neither of which worked well for the night tour he sat behind the wheel for ten minutes then pissed off decided to wait no longer he slipped on a pair of latex gloves and entered through the back door using the key that hung on the nail that kowalski had claimed had been described to him in the anonymous phone call the nail was there all right and the key that hung on it and the nail was rusted not a recent addition all of this would be part of kowalskis scheduled ia review the second time into a building always felt more familiar though entering alone and without backup made dart queasy he was not afraid but apprehensive he moved quickly through the sitting room where the rooms only lamp on a security timer was dark at one oclock the bedroom light upstairs would be switched off automatically also on a timer dart headed immediately to the basement pulled the door shut behind him and switched on the lights step by step he cautiously descended feeling an increasing sensation of dread he passed the washerdryer ducked under a clothesline and approached the workbench and the flytying kit as seen on the labs computer the surface was littered with baggies and small plastic vials dart studied these more closely some were filled with feathers others animal fur others contained bare metal fishhooks in varying sizes lead shot metal filings pipe cleaners rolls of thin wire thread he leafed through the contents and then again it did not escape him that kowalski liked to flyfish nor that kowalski had been caught here nor that kowalski for his bungling of lucky zellers murder investigation was a known enemy of zellers again struck by the significance of the flytying kit dart inspected the contents of the workbench more carefully elk hair pheasant feathers partridge bobwhite peacock synthetics of every color a small plastic vial of thin aluminum shavings another halffilled with copper shavings dart paused his hand on the prescriptionsize plastic vial containing the copper shavings he experienced a flash of heat like a nausea that began in his stomach and rose into his throat like a bubble he recalled teddy braggs review of the gerald lawrence evidencethe mans hanging himself with a lamp cord dart fished out his notebook and flipped backward until he found lawrences name written in caps at the top of a page he skimmed down through his notes copper filings on clothing and skin consistent with the lamp wire copper filings dart shook the small vial it contained a few coiled pieces of differentgauge copper wire he held it up to the light a small crescent of fine copper shavings filled the bottom his hand shaking he set down the vial and drew up the stool beneath himself his legs suddenly watery he studied each of the vials more carefully separating out the baggies of swatches of brightly colored fabricspieces of carpeting and clothingas he remembered teddy bragg detailing the usual hairs and fibers discovered at each of the crime scenes the last small film canister that he opened offered all the convincing he needed he tapped out its contents onto the table human hairs but it was the color that both intrigued and excited him they were red and he understood chapter what the hell ted braggs shirt was buttoned lopsidedly and there was sleep dust stuck to the lid of his left eye richardson is on call tonight this morning he corrected checking his watch it was am dart had been at hamilton court only a few hours earlier it seemed like a lifetime to him now i needed the best teddy i needed you thats bullshit and we both know it richardson is good he sized up dart you look like shit i feel like shit dart said he checked his watch again so whats so fucking important he added i tell ya this had better be good do you have your stuff its in the car ill help you dart offered bragg shook his head in disgust may i remind you i am not on call tonight they removed two heavy bags from braggs trunk dart was trying hard to reveal none of the turmoil and excitement he felt convinced that he finally understood each of the suicides only bragg was capable of confirming these for him and for bragg himself but to be truly effective he would have to trick the man where is everybody bragg questioned i havent called it in dart answered leading him up the flight of stairs smells like smoke in here bragg said moving up the stairs slowly are you trying to tell me that youve called me to a crime scene that you havent called in thats right bragg stepped inside the apartment door and set down the bags thats not like you ivy no i tell ya if youre yanking my chain im not i need an overthetop is all dart told him yeah rightan overthetop bragg repeated caustically since when do i do a halfass job ivy answer me that youre the best teddy fuck you bragg stooped toward the bags youre playing assistant ill tell you that much this just became a twoman team he snapped on his gloves and went to work dart heaved a sigh of relief forty minutes later bragg sat down clearly exhausted he had scrutinized every detail of the crime scene collecting and bagging evidence at each step he had been particularly intrigued with his discovery that the carpet below the broken window appeared to have been vacuumed he had given dart an allknowing look that the detective had relished clear to his core bragg packed up his gear keeping the dozen or so evidence bags separate he sat on a wicker chair dart leaned against the wall well dart asked i tell ya i see what it is about it that gave you the hardon ive got glass from the broken windowinside on the carpetthat says the perpetrator most likely entered from the fire escape mud and some familiar organic matterit looks like those same cypress needles to methose from his shoe solesgood supporting evidence all this in an area that appears to have been vacuumedagain familiar maybe we find rock salt and potting soil when all is said and donemy guess is that we will but ive got synthetics and what looks like cotton fibers on top of that area meaning weve got timing problemsjust like at harold paynes suicide dart answered him with a nod attempting to keep any emotion off his face bragg said it looks like some guy comes in and taps someone you have a body im assuming dart didnt answer annoyed bragg said the blood splatter is telling me small weapons fire at close range drags the body from yea to yea he said pointing to the carpet marks that ran from the television to the window and judging by the blood smear out there tosses the stiff over the rail toward that dumpster the dumpster is next ivy i gotta get a look down there he smiled proudly you found the body in the dumpster am i right dart said youve never been to my place have you teddy he rounded the corner into the kitchen and retrieved a beer from the refrigerator he handed it to the forensics man your place no why do you ask bragg drank generously from the can did i tell you that ginny took most of the furniture when she split dart looked out into the empty living room braggs eyes followed his closely is that right bragg asked uneasily he shifted in the chair restlessly dart drank a long gulp of beer yup left you three chairs did she bragg asked counting the chair he was sitting in and two others by the breakfast table across the room three thats right braggs eyes filled with concern what the hells going on agitated he glanced at dart sharply this is your place huh yup oh shit listen we all lose our cool eventually ivy it happens if you called me because you want help getting rid of the evidence i cant do that for you i can walk away from here i can never mention this but i cant help you dart smiled its that convincing isnt it he asked what the evidence bragg looked around what are you saying i had to make sure it was convincing bragg said you called me because were friends i understand that interrupting dart said i called you because youre the last line of defense youre the final arbiter youre the one who signs off on this stuff youre the guy teddy dart reached down and sorted through braggs evidence bags all neatly marked and labeled he found three of those he was after and dropped them into braggs lap bragg studied them his forehead was shiny with perspiration i wont destroy evidence for you ivy dart laughed he met eyes with the man and said those fibers are from the basement of hamilton court a flytying setup in the basement everything in little containers fishing it has nothing to do with fishing bragg lifted one of the bags then and inspected its contents closely confused and nervous animal hairs metal shavings synthetics feathersall there on that flytying table dart explained the crime scenesthe suicideswere works of fiction the hairs and fibers were props teddy planted by a very clever individual they told a story that we were comfortable reading he pointed to the living room it took me a little over two hours to set this upbut then im new at this braggs eyes went wide as he began to comprehend you staged this i had to see if it could be done i had to see if i could fool the best you are the best teddy it couldnt be richardson i scripted this crime scene and i used the necessary props to be convincing you woke me up for a staged crime scene bragg checked his watch were predictable teddy you meall of us he added if you know us well enough bragg put down the beer and got out of the chair and walked a few feet to the edge of the living room and looked it over staged he asked incredulously dart gave the man time to think it over to see the various ramifications of someone planting trace evidence at a crime scene he finally announced they were all homicides teddy every last one of them bragg considered this for a long time yeah think so i tell yato be this good he declared strongly you gotta be better than smart you gotta be one of us thats right bragg paled you know who it is dart nodded yeah he answered i know chapter wallace sparco was feeling out of form he should have been feeling good another worthless piece of shit was about to stop using up air but dart was getting too close he was making a real pain in the ass out of himself beneath sparcos forest green safari jacket zeller wore a hooded sweatshirt and a tan fishing vest its pouches and pockets loaded with goodies the bulk of it added the look of weight to him which made him feel better he thought of himself as a big man it was difficult for him to feel this thin this slight this insignificant zellers hands sweated lightly inside the black golf gloves that gripped the steering wheel dennis greenwood lived just north of colt park on norwich street in the south end dictating that zeller conduct himself with extreme selfconfidence and work quickly norwich street was immediately west of dutch point an area so dangerous that city cabs stayed out a white manno matter how bigwalking the streets in this area offered himself as a potential victim to enter this area at night was so risky that zellerlooking and behaving like wallace sparcofelt forced to make his move during dusk he turned left onto wyllys and parked checked his sidearm pulled the hood over his head grabbed the small duffel bag and made for the twostory tenement less than half a block away dennis greenwood rented the upper floor accessible only from the back sparco threaded his way over soggy litter dog shit and foulsmelling trash and found his way to the rickety wooden stairs which he climbed in a hurry one thing nice about this neighborhood was that the cops would get nothing from any witness no cooperation whatsoever zeller could have killed the man out in the street and dart and company would not get so much as a description surveillance here had been difficult zeller had patrolled the area only three times and decided it was too tough a neighborhood to park his car and effect a stakeout he did know that greenwood had no phone no credit cards no current girlfriend the black man had held a variety of jobs over the last six months including a position at the murphy road post office he had either quit or been fired always because of drugs and alcohol four months earlier his drivers license had been reinstated after a sixweek stint with a cityprovided twelvestep rehabilitation program there was no car registered in his name although as of a week ago he drove an eighthour shift for yellow cab the shift ended at four in the afternoon it was fivefifteen sparco reached the scarred wooden door and knocked sharply the drawn shade parted slightly and sparco saw an eyeball peering back out at him im working with the clinical trial zeller said in his best wallace sparco voicea little lower than his own we have a change in your medication open the door please mr greenwood he waited through the metallic sound of four locks being disengaged and the abrasive rubbing of the door on the jamb as it came open his hands felt damp and uncomfortable inside the leather gloves but he accepted their necessity how are you doing zeller asked stepping inside tapping the toe of his right shoe in an absentminded nervous gesture it all had to go perfectly to pull off greenwood the way zeller wanted it okay i guess the black man was in his early thirties his skin more cream than charcoal he had a wide flat nose and thick lips that parted slightly to reveal a chipped front tooth mildly handsome his face knew no smile and the hard distrustful eyes knew no friends the studio apartment was dingy dark and smelled of cigarette smoke and bitter coffee a worseforwear color television glowed blue from the cornera cop show rerun the countertop of the pullman kitchen held empty bags from fastfood chains the furniture consisted of a ratty twin bed a single straightback chair and a milk crate used as a footrest in front of a red vinyl overstuffed chair that had seen better days sparco saw no reading material whatsoever a pelt of dirty clothes hung from a hook by the bathroom the apartments only two windows had been boarded over with irregular sheets of dirty plywood recovered from construction sites pieced together poorly with screws nails and duct tape it was worse than any prison cell zeller had ever seen for dennis greenwood this was home sparco his shoulders slouching set down the duffel bag which occupied greenwoods attention and drove a look of suspicion into the mans hard eyes his brow furrowed and his jaw muscles flexed tight as chestnuts i need to ask you some questions about how things are going sparco said maybe take some blood i just had my tests he complained sparco stepped closer to his victim and said in a warm friendly voice hey im just following orders you got to understand he met eyes with the man and then delivered the blow as a sharpened speara single devastating thrust of his right fist into the exact center of the mans chest greenwoods body seized his knees gave out he tried to breathe but the blow to the solar plexus had been perfectly delivered and the effect was immediatehis nervous system stunned numb and useless sparco spun him around in an instant sagged along with him supporting him as they sank down to a kneeling position and then slapped a pair of handcuffs on him locking his arms behind his back he then forced the mans flapping chin up sealing his mouth closed both covering the mans lips and pinching his nose with his right hand sparco awkwardly fished out a small plastic bag filled with cocaineannoyed by the need for the gloveand bringing the bag to his teeth tore a corner off it greenwoods breathing would return before the use of his limbsthe bodys first reaction was for survival wallace sparco waited his left hand muzzling the mans air supply the chest began to heave straining for air sparco reinforced his grip greenwood blinked repeatedly reminding zeller of a bird he choked him down hard pinching his nose and denying him air greenwoods body recovered quickly and he began to struggle rocking his head pushing back with his legs desperate to breathe sparco still cupping the mans mouth raised the bag of coke to the mans nose and inverted it at the same time that he released his finger pinch in one enormous breath greenwood sucked in the contentsa gram of cocaine as the white powder spilled over his upper lip he looked as if he had dipped his face in baking flour his eyes went wild and wide as the coke froze his lungs and rushed to his head he tried to scream but still muzzled managed only a whimper sparco hooked his elbow around his victims windpipe in a practiced choke hold took his own right wrist in his left and applied a constant steady pressure like a vise being careful not to bruise three years earlier the hartford police had been taught this defensive move and then a few months later refused to use it after three suspects had died of crushed windpipes this is for melanie zeller not sparco whispered hotly into the mans ear melanie eleven years old fondled raped and sodomized over a sevenmonth period by this bastard at greenwoods trial he had testified that he had gotten her high on coke before doing her melanie for whom greenwood had wept while on the stand a performance that bought him thirty days in jail and a twoyear probation from a judge with a known drinking problem the system dennis greenwood passed into the semiconscious state that zeller intendedan oxygendeprived narcosis neither awake nor fully unconscious sparco moved smoothly his actions had been choreographed and the routine rehearsed he dragged the body over to and into the red overstuffed chair facing the television went over to the sink and poured a glass of water and returned to the body he opened his safari jacket and without looking removed the unlabeled brown prescription bottle with the tamperproof cap he primed the pump first tilting the mans head back and pouring a tiny amount of water down his throat greenwood coughed violently spraying the water sparco tried again this time massaging the mans throat and the water went down he then emptied all twentyseven of the tenmilligram valiums into greenwoods mouth and chased them with a mouthful of water greenwood swallowed repeatedly the visible pulse beneath the skin of his neck revealing the effects of the cocaine on his heart zeller cleaned up the mans chin with wallace sparcos light blue handkerchief as attentive as a mother with her newborn and then studied the room carefully he found a small plate by the sink he set it down by the unconscious victim and tapped the coke bag until a dusting fell there then in what he considered a brilliant touch holding it by the edge he used greenwoods laminated drivers license to move this dusting of cocaine around on the plate and then left the license in plain sight sitting there from his fishing vest he removed the short length of a plastic drinking straw that he had prepared in advanceit already had traces of cocaine up inside it he pushed the body around accessing the mans handcuffed hands and pinched the straw with greenwoods fingers so that it retained his latent prints and then placed the straw on the plate he put the mans prints onto the prescription vial as well and dropped it into the chair alongside the victims leg its plastic lid left by the plate walter zeller had attended dozens of similar crime scenes wallace sparco studied it carefully to make sure it added up he liked itit looked good the duffel bag housed the cordless dustbuster sparco ran the device over the floor where the cocaine had fallen as a snowy dust lifting every last grain he then vacuumed the entire area between the apartments door and the kitchen sinkthe area in which he had walked putting the vacuum away he turned once again to his fishing vest this time carefully examining its contents he selected three vials popping one lid at a time and carefully sprinkling a tiny amount of household dust then a pinch of cotton and synthetic fibers and finally a trace of cigarette asha recipe for teddy braggs aardvark to find greenwood twitched awkwardly and unexpectedly and zeller wondered if the blood vessels in his head had exploded and killed him before the valium was given a chance he hoped not wallace sparco paid it no mind his work was completed if he wasnt dead already greenwood would suffer an irreversible coma within the hour death within three sparco removed the handcuffs and checked to make sure there was no bruising from them he walked gingerly to the door the locks were the variety that offered a springloaded tongue meeting a steel housing screwed into the jamb a knob could be twisted and a toggle thrown to set the lock open or allow it to close sparco threw the toggle on all three releasing their metal tongues the fourth lock was a deadbolt mounted inside the door there was little sparco could do about that he pulled the door shut firmly setting in place three of the four locks when in twenty to forty hours the bodys decomposition announced itself to neighbors the police would have to kick the door splintering and destroying the jamb perhaps covering up that the dead bolt had not been used it was dark out and bitterly cold and wallace sparco felt the heart of walter zeller beating strongly in his chest as if it were he who had been drugged he felt none of the remorse that he understood any sane man would feel but stopped short of judging himself insane conversely he took no vain pride in his workit was something that had to be done that was all someone had to dispose of the trash with no davids in this world he thought the goliaths would rule unchecked zeller pulled the sweatshirt hood up over sparcos baseball cap and gray hair looking once again like an executioner or a franciscan priest he forced himself to walk slowly down the stairs not wanting to attract attention or to appear a man in a hurry image was everything an act one man playing another one man living one man dying a murder turned into suicide and walter zellerthe creatornowhere to be seen chapter ted bragg was kneeling by the door to the secondstory apartment at norwich street the suicide had been called in at four in the afternoon and dart alerted shortly thereafter bragg informed the detective a woman in the apartment downstairs smelled him im guessing hes two days old whos primary i am answered greg thompson from behind just interviewed the neighbor didnt see or hear a thing just smelled the jordon is all shit like this guy stinks bad he added looking around the room bragg said to thompson what were going to see what were going to find is a suicidea drug overdose what were looking at he corrected is a homicide thompson appeared bothered says who says the evidence bragg answered i think i can show you but its going to require several hours and everyone coming and going wears shoe covers hair nets and gloves itll never happen thompson said thats the way its going to be bragg insisted dart pulled out the piece of paper from his coat pocket and unfolded it greenwoods name was a third of the way down ginnys list of men whose medical insurance had been paid for by roxin he had written the letters np alongside greenwoods nameno phone for dart the room felt dark and cold the burden of this mans death weighing on him for the past two days he had been using this list to try to anticipate zellers next kill he had interviewed or spoken to six of the list of twentyfour dennis greenwood had no phone and dart not liking the neighborhood had not traveled out herenot during the night shift now greenwood was deadthough exactly how zeller might have accomplished this still mystified him the guy had a sheet thompson said to dart sex crimes dart said back glancing over at the dead mans gray face with its swollen eyes greg thompsons jaw dropped now just how in the hell did you know that chapter dart needed the support of the department if he was to convince dr martinson to suspend her clinical trial turn over all the names and then for either proctor or hpd to provide protection for these men until zeller was apprehended greenwoods murder confirmed for dart that this was the only course of action worse he now needed to break the news of zellers involvement to haite convincingly and yet carefully without mentioning zellers name never putting haite in the position of being required to report zeller to internal affairs and thereby losing control until zellers actual arrest it would be better if he were thought of as wallace sparco that would keep both internal affairs and the upper brass out of the investigation if the pursuit took on task force proportions zeller would never be caught he was far too savvy dart waited outside christ church cathedral not properly dressed for the cold weather shifting back and forth on painful feet nervous cold and tense one of the first gothic revival churches built in the new world the cathedral with its tall spire shaped of brown stone was said to have been created to bring the congregation to heavenly thoughts darts thoughts were on a baser level though he looked skyward and asked for some help john haite winced as he spotted dart from afar a man who liked to leave the office at jennings road and not bring it home with him haite motioned his wife and son inside the church coming over to dart with a determined look he said whats the meaning of this i need to talk to you my son is in his first thanksgiving pageant im not on duty tonight i traded with i know dart interrupted but it has to be you and it cant wait until tomorrows shift im sorry sergeant this is bullshit haite said impossible theres been another suicide dart informed him another homicide he corrected tomorrows friday were the night shift that leaves the entire weekend its never going to be the right time haite glanced around he waved to a few of the other parents just arriving with their preschoolers he seemed embarrassed he whispered angrily nice fucking timing vespers had just concluded in the chapel and dart spotted a priest at a side door he approached the man showed him his shield and asked for a room in private for a few minutes the priest quickly agreed dart waved haite toward the door and the sergeant approached reluctantly apologizing and gesticulating deferentially to the priest who showed them into a small choir room with rich dark wood paneling and a lush red carpet dart found it interesting to see haites more humble side he was a more religious man than dart would have guessed haite was clearly uncomfortable here a large dark table occupied the center surrounded by four straightback chairs in the main hall a pianist and guitarist could be heard practicing the programs childrens songs including old macdonalds farm the setting felt surreal dart placed an impatient haite in one of the chairs and then leaned a shoulder against the paneling alongside some choir robes on hangers we have a difficult situation he began we have a psycho whos killing sex offenders is what we have haite interjected if it were only so simple dart said winning the mans surprise and full attention go on i have to be careful how i put this you have seven minutes he said checking his watch otherwise we do this little dance tomorrow night i have a list of names you dont want to know how i came by it stapleton lawrence payne and tonights victim greenwood are all on this list so are twenty others i have reason to believe that a similar if not identical list is in the possession of a drug research company located out in avon all men all test subjects for some kind of hormonal therapygenetic therapythat i believe is aimed at changing or eliminating their violent behavior toward women kind of a prozac for sex offenders haite looked as if someone had slapped him across the face except that both cheeks were bright red he mumbled you need some time off dart continued it is also my beliefsome of which i can provethat a lone individual is staging murders to look like suicides to keep this drug company from bringing the product to market to see that the drug fails in the clinical trials to keep sex offenders behind bars not wandering the streets under treatment i can support that attitude haite said bluntly theyre all homicides sergeant lawrence stapleton payne staged brilliantly teddy bragg can prove itor at least make a strong case the technique is ingenious the methodology impeccable why suicide why not just kill the bastards to invalidate the clinical trials to keep us off the investigation to kill as many as possible before anyone catches on haite nodded okay he said lets say youre right the individual in question is known to us as wallace sparco of eleven hamilton court an ert raid that blew up in our faces and had us arresting one of our own dont lead with your failures dartelli dart tried hard to ignore him whats of particular interest to us sergeant is that this individual perpetrating these crimesand dart paused here to collect himself is he searched for a way to say thisconfidently familiar with police investigative procedure especially as regards the collection of hairsandfiber evidence chain of custody et cetera hes a cop haite was no dummy he knew where dart was going with this he said youre thinking kowalski dart shook his head no and spoke extra slowly someone with a personal grudge against sex offenders someone lets say whose wife may have been violently raped and murdered he paused watching the color drain from haites complexion someone with a firm understanding of hairsandfibers evidence collection techniques and a sharp enough mind to use that understanding against us god the sergeant said his eyes wide dart glanced at an oil painting of jesus that hung above the handbells haite said you think its dart quickly interrupted better if this is kept speculative until such a time as the individual is apprehended i think haite thought for two of his remaining five minutes in total silence glancing intermittently at dart with something like hatred in his eyes he seemed to blame dart for all this trouble like a parent blaming a child dart letting the blame roll off him felt that he had made his point well and so far haite had kept a cool head it was going better than he had hoped dart said i need the weight of this department behind methe support that these were murdersif im to convince this company roxin laboratories to suspend their trials forget it haite said shattering darts brief flirtation with success but sergeant one thing at a time detective the investigation first the suspect first you are not putting this department into the position of defending a theoryone in which weve brought no charges against anyone and have nothing but some hairsandfibers evidence to go on we have to involve the prosecutors office we have to do this all aboveboard you want to shut down this trial you had better have a suspect in custody but sergeant for now they are suicides haite roared his voice no doubt carrying into the main hall theyve been cleared as suicides youre talking about reopening cleared cases hell go on killing dart reminded in a hoarse whisper he felt devastated as if hed had the wind knocked out of him some perverts some child molesters you think thats going to shake up a lot of people do you get a clue dartelli hell kill them dart repeated thats your problem detective you are my problem this is your theory not mine you prove it or you lose it but do not go making any accusations until you damn well know what youre talking aboutuntil you can prove it to me and the prosecuting attorneys office what youre talking about here he rolled his eyes they were filled with tears his friendship with zeller getting the better of him i for one hope to god youre wrong he checked his watch looked at dart and snapped not one word of this to anyone anyone not until you hand me the smoking gunwith an arm attached to it do you understand do you know what youre saying dart asked what youre condoning he looked around the room and in a church no less he felt like adding not one word the sergeant repeated please dartelli said speaking the one word he hoped might get through haite kicked back the chair as he stood and it nearly went over you really are a boy scout he said viciously storming out of the room but stopping and turning to face dart from the open doorway you didnt learn anything from him did you dart straightened the chair and followed haite out into the cold chapter the house was a large victorian on a oneacre fenced estate in west hartford just down the street from the governors mansion towering elms and oaks lined the street the smell of woodsmoke tinged the air one neighbor had already put up christmas lightsa team of seven perfectly sculpted reindeer made of tiny white lights arcing up toward the sky drawing a sleigh parked on the grass hoping for snow this was a mercedesbenz neighborhood dart felt conspicuous in his taurus he checked himself twice in the rearview mirror attempting to improve on the disheveled and unkempt appearance that seemed stuck on him he jerked the mirror back into place slipped a breath mint into his mouth and climbed out of the car dr arielle martinson answered her own front door carrying a yellow legal pad and halfglasses she wore stonewashed designer jeans a mantailored flannel shirt without makeup she looked a few years older he noticed a shock of gray on the right side of her head that he had missed during their first encounter she had pulled back her hair just prior to answering the door for she held a hair elastic wrapped around two fingers and her hair still held that shape of someone standing in a strong wind but it was down by the time she greeted dart and she shook her head again freeing her hair more making sure to cover that scar she admitted him with hardly any small talk he the cop taking note of the exquisite furnishingsoriental rugs flowing drapes and antiques the security systemthe motion detector winking high in the ceilings corner and the handcarved door to the library as she directed him through she had been working at one of two computers one on a mahogany partners desk with a burgundy leather top a reproduction tiffany lamp an original oil painting over the fireplace a brown lab lying between the leather couch and the leaded window she offered him coffee tea or something stronger he declined mentioning that he was on duty she found herself a glass of white wine in the kitchen and quickly returned its a beautiful house he said taking a chair with needlepoint upholstery she said its late lets get down to business shall we what brings you back so soon detective a man named greenwood a drug overdose suicide discovered late this afternoon we think hes part of your trial she pursed her lips i have no comment i only wondered no comment is no comment she said curtly her heaving chest showed him that she was agitated her darting eyes provoked a sense of concern in him as if she were attempting to conceal someone hiding in the room were on the same team here he reminded following our last meeting i attempted some inquiries but a blind trial is just that im afraid again i assure you that if the suicides were found to be related in any way to our trial i would be well aware of it and the trial would be halted but i have not been made aware of such a relationship in spite of my inquiries i understand that you have a job to do i have no quarrel with that i would suggest to you that they are murders weve confirmed that dart interrupted silencing her related directly to your trial i need to stop the trials you can prove to me that they are related the fingers of her right hand ran up and down the stem of the wineglass nervously dart said we need to offer these men protection impossible theyre targets she stared at him for a moment and then said detective dartelli i cant divulge to you the nature of any of our trials but what you are suggesting would most certainly compromise the trial most likely nullify any results and thereby cost this company millions of dollars i can promise you detectivepromisethat well fight any such attempt on your part you and your department will bear huge legal costs if we have anything to say about it i dont think either of us wants that we need your cooperation he almost pleaded i need to bring proof to my superiors he thought i need to shut you down no thats not going to happen she said sternly you have proctor working on this is that it you think you can handle this without dart caught himself midsentence recalling zeller at the fire and the mans intimation that zeller was himself a target he met eyes with martinson hers were stone cold and her breathing had calmed to where her chest was not moving at all frighteningly confident proctor had been told to rid her of this problem called walter zeller she knows about zeller dart realized you need me he told her her gaze remained unflinching she sipped the wine and rested the glass cradled in her hands in her lap and her fingers toyed with the stem again the suicides will eventually be linked to your clinical trial dart warned to your drugthis prozac for sex offenders she stiffened noticeably a look of hate filling her face unless a person is held responsible by the police tried and convicted your drug will be blamed he didnt want a gang of rentacops hunting down zeller and performing roadside justice no matter what his crimes the sergeant deserved better suddenly he felt his sentiments shifting toward zeller found himself believing that he owed it to zeller to find him first do you understand me dart asked angrily her impassive front was getting to him she had still not recovered from his calling her drug prozac for sex offenders he sensed that he knew something that she didnt want him to know and that in desperation he might have played that card wrongly i think we both understand each other she returned her voice dry despite the wine unless these suicides become reclassified as homicides your drug will be blamed you said yourself that such a ruling would be devastating to your company that reclassification is up to me doctor no comment she lifted her chin and literally looked down her nose at him what was her game he wondered you need me he repeated if murder it would appear that someone had attempted to sabotage her research if suicide that the drug had fatal side effects i need to get back to my work she said stubbornly you need me to do this he said again need you she smirked and said lets assume hypothetically that youre rightthat someone may be testing what youve called a prozac for sex offenders do you see the importance of such a thing can you begin to understand the social and economic implications of such a treatment the benefits to society even were this company to be partly effective in its goallets say that we could reduce physical and sexual abuse by ten or fifteen or twenty percent with no adverse side effectscan you argue effectively against such a treatment but there are those who would stop such a thing if they could oh yes believe me there are they would say a crime committed is a crime to be paid for they would do anything to see such a treatment failanythingthis hypothetical companys competitors certain rights organizationsits a long list you say you may be able to reclassify these suicides as homicides detective lets say hypothetically of course that this company had over ten years in such an effortwhere would you put your faith she drank some of the wine and caught eyes with dart what im telling you detective if youre listening is that im not convinced that these men these suicides of yours were ever part of any roxin trial dart felt the words like a blow to his chest you seem like a perfectly nice man i wouldnt want to embarrass you she spun the wineglass in her fingers you may be made to look foolish if you pursue this any further she cautioned can she get the names off the list he suddenly wondered he had no documentation from martinson concerning the participation of stapleton lawrence and payne in the trial only a verbal comment made to him several days earlier she could deny it all if she could destroy the record of their participation then her only concern for their killer would be that he be taken care ofquickly and quietly the less publicity the better and that he dart not make trouble if someone has convinced you to go outside the law on this dr martinson i strongly advise you to seek a second opinionpreferably a legal opinion theres no reason to further my impression she said sharply interrupting him and coming to her feet her chest heaving once again is that we are both wasting our time detective and that we both have better things to do than to sit around speculating i have in fact solicited just the legal opinion for which you seem to be strongly lobbying and that has come back an unqualified no comment unqualified she repeated ill show you to the door now this is not the way to handle this dart warned youre making a big mistake and you detective had better be careful or you may need your own attorney your own second opinion she paused by the front door the threat came not from her words but from her eyes dont meddle detective she turned the handle and opened the door the cold air rushed in and stung darts face we can work together on this dart offered one last time i dont think so no thank you she opened the door dart stepped outside suddenly chilled to the bone he was out on farmington avenue when his cellular rang and the phone got hung up in his pocket trying to come out he thought he had missed the call because it stopped ringing just before he answered the line was in fact dead but a moment later it rang again dartelli he answered youre finally thinking like a cop said zellers voice dart immediately checked the rearview mirror and the cars in front of him but it was a pitch black night and besides he thought zeller would never make it that easy i can help you sarge but you save it ivy just do your fucking job thats help enough theres a science editor at the new york times might be interested in what you know his name is rosenburg good writer the line went dead dart jerked the wheel skidded off the shoulder and came to an abrupt stop at the top of a hill he jumped out of the car and searched for a vehicle executing a uturn or parked conspicuously below him was an intersection with a gas station and a bookstore on opposing corners he looked for someone standing at a pay phone or an idle car nothing besides he thought for a second time he would never make it that easy chapter with the surveillance of hamilton court failing to produce any sign of wallace sparco and with a be on lookout alert having failed to raise his vehicle dart felt his only chance of finding the manof saving him perhapslay within that building but when during the friday night shift he approached haite to discuss the technical merits of the searchandseizure warrant issued on the house haite forbade him to enter or get anywhere near hamilton court what began as a civilized discussion ended in a shouting match with all of capers staring at the two through the glass wall of haites shared office dart stormed out and feeling the brunt of everyones attention continued into the hall looking for somewhere to calm down he hurried down the hall and seeing abbys light on knocked and entered they hadnt seen each other in nearly a week a fact that had escaped dart until he found himself standing there looking at her what are you doing here he asked her this is my office at night i make my own schedule im a oneperson division she hesitated and then explained im trying to get onto your schedule so we might see more of each other another hesitation ive missed you the kids its actually better this way they sleep at night im with them in the mornings and afternoons i should have tried this sooner when do you sleep i dont she answered you look like youre ready to break something not something ive done i hope haite hes bullheaded i misjudged him brought him into my confidence when i probably shouldnt have sent him off the deep end he suddenly wants nothing to do with these suicides he keeps assigning me domestics the night shift she reminded him domestic quarrels and assaults were almost entirely the domain of the night shift yeah i know but ive got bigger fish to fry and he knows it it scares him is the thing which fish i told himnot directly but i told himabout zeller oh shit she gasped seems his loyalty outweighs his concern overand these are his wordsa bunch of perverts getting killed she nodded as if she understood or had encountered such resistance herself she said i had a case involving a gym teacher junior high molesting his girl athletes a peephole in the shower stealing underwear from their lockersthe whole nine yards he raped three of them got one pregnant or maybe wed have never known the school board tried to pressure me not to press charges said it would hurt enrollment said that theyd fire him and that that was enough they got to someone upstairsi dont know how and they fired him and ran him out of town and i pressed charges before he got out of town but no press no publicity i never heard about that no one did she said it damn near cost me my badge looking at him coyly she added but i kept my badge in fact i got my own division she grinned i found out who they got to dart and others had wondered how she had managed to pull a sex crimes division out of capers and now years later it was explained he was struck with an idea what is it she asked seeing his change of expression a thought he said feeling more calm than when hed entered he placed a knee onto the rooms only other chair you are your own division he said thinking aloud true story you dont go through haite for warrants thank god what he asked directly to the pa do not pass go do you operate under special probable cause requirements or the same as the rest of us he clarified does the prosecuting attorney hold you to a sex crimes angle she filled in for him no she answered she added sarcastically surprisingly enough they treat me like im a lieutenant i didnt mean i know you didnt but it sounded a little that way i need to extend the search warrant for hamilton court he stated i need inside i can get inside she said you can accompany me checking her watch she said itll be a phoner this time of night whos the oncall judge cryst cynthia cryst she said a woman joe piece of cake trust me on this she pushed her paperwork out of the way and pulled a blank pad in front of her this is a grounder they entered hamilton court an hour later abby carrying the signed warrant in her pocket the automatic timer had the sitting room light switched onit was pm abby via dart had listed three items on the warrant that had been left off of earlier warrants grocery store shopping bags the framed photographs on the piano and articles of clothing with both of them wearing latex gloves he collected the framed photographs into a white paper sack the photos i can understand she said even though you assume its zeller who put them there to create this wallace sparco identity you think there may be some significance to them something he might tell you without intending to but the shopping bags she asked he thought to put food here dart explained having led her into the kitchen again as you said to build the perception that sparco lived here sparco didnt live here neither did zeller he used this as a staging areaat least up until we discovered it he must have used someplace else after that he knew it was virtually impossible not to carry something of yourself into every crime scene and to take something of the crime scene back to your house with youits the nature of hairsandfibersits what he drummed into me all those years i was the one with the degree but he was the one who understood fiber evidence handshakes and piggybacking so he came here changed clotheschanged identities she corrected did the crime came back changed back she understood it then the chain of evidence would always lead back to here if we ever found anything at a crime sceneand he took extra precautions to see that we wouldnt like vacuuming and laying false evidencewe would only find his safe house not the man himself but grocery bags she inquired skeptically maybe he was too smart for his own good dart said searching drawers he buys groceries to convince us sparco lived here even eats some of it to give the place a livedin effect but if he saved the grocery bags dart thought aloud sorting through the contents of another drawer abby yanked open the cabinet below the sink pulled out the trash can and hoisted the trash baga plastic grocery bag she completed for him then he would use them as trash bags youre brilliant he crowed i know its true isnt it but not brilliant enough to know why you care about this she added he took it from her and turned it around for her to see the green writing on the side shopway he said reading the name thats up on park she said naming the worst street in town how many groceries between here and shopway he quizzed two three maybe catering to the college kids catering to the whites he said shopway was an innercity store youre trying to narrow down his neighborhood she said impressed to identify someplace we might find him she added we put the shopway under surveillance assuming its closer to home dart grinned at her dumping what little trash the bag held and collecting the grocery sack as evidence then he opened the downstairs coat closet and searched through the three jackets hanging there abby said he would have bought these at a secondhand storea salvation army something like that youre looking for tags something to further narrow the neighborhood nothing dart mumbled shutting the closet door and leading her upstairs following closely abby said my guess is that hes going to wish he hadnt trained you so well compliments dart said will get you everywhere he entered the bedroom and headed for the closet abby switched on the light dart turned quickly shook his head and said no this he said checking through the clothes may have started out secondhand and he would have bought it big so that it fit him but wasnt his size and some of it would have gotten thrown out the payne stuff for instancetoo much blood but he has a thing about clean clothes did you ever notice freshly ironed shirts pressed pants he and lucky got in an argument once because she wanted to save money but the sarge insisted on sending out his shirts it was almost a fetish she completed for him holding up the shirttail of one of the hanging shirts is this what youre looking for next to her gloved right thumb was a blue commercial laundry tag neatly pinned with a thread of plastic to the shirttail excitement stole into dart a grocery store was unlikely to have an address for a customer but a commercial laundry just might as they climbed back into the taurus their body language expressing their urgency dart told her i would have found the laundry tag he started the car but i might have missed that grocery bag he confessed you see she crowed you need me the map on abbys office wall consisted of enlarged photocopies of a onesquaremile area surrounding the park street shopway supermarket dart had made a pot of coffee having worked through his shift but stayed at jennings road abby had gone home for a few hours sleep having returned a few minutes earlier just before nine using the yellow pages dart had spent the wee hours narrowing down the location of the citys nineteen commercial laundries six pushpins were now stuck into the improvised map at dart yellow pages at his side hung up the phone stepped over to the map and withdrew one of the pushpins white tags pinned to the collar using safety pins he said at abby complained white tags green tags pink tagsbut no blue tags well find it dart said not near the shopway she said removing the last of the pins dart stared at the map thoughts buzzing in his head maybe im wrong he said feeling depressed this was his sleep time and a saturday morning to boot his body was experiencing jet lag his head hurt his back was sore from having fallen asleep in a chair he envied her the few hours sleep abby excused herself and left the room dart who had been trying since thursday to return a call left by ginny dialed her number her machine picked up he cradled the phone jealousy consuming him ginny was always home on a saturday morning this meant that she hadnt slept there the night before hed wondered why he hadnt heard from her typically they played phone tag until one reached the other abby returned and said brightly so i guess we try every friggin laundry in the city until we find one that uses blue tags she plopped down into a chair by a phone and said do you want to start with the as or the ns an hour later abby hung up and reported well youll be happy to know that i finally found a company using blue tagsat which point dart hung up in the middle of a call you shouldnt have done that she said they use blue tags but their numbers arent close to this fivedigit one that we have his moment of elation past dart sank down in his chair and rubbed his eyes did they say anything about blue tags he gave me the name of the company that wholesales the tags she replied and dart realized that this was where he should have started all along nutmeg supplies out of bridgeport but its saturday and they wont reopen until monday so if we can wait we cant he reminded no i didnt think so but we may not have to dart said recalling that bud gorman often worked weekends gorman was an avid nascar fan and liked to travel to nascar races all over the country he managed this without chewing up too much vacation time by working sixday weeks and then trading in this extra time for a friday or saturday of his choice buying himself threeday weekends whenever a race required an extra travel day dart reached him and was put on hold gorman returned to the phone angrily you never return my calls ive hardly been home i have the roxin information for youwho they are what theyre about i have more urgent local needs dr arielle martinson gorman said ignoring him three venture capital firms and an industrialist from sweden own seventythree percent martinsons been at the helm since the inception she came out of the university of michigan where she chaired the genetics research program which saw a hell of a lot of federal funding and where this industrialist cederberg first met her a real slow start to earnings as with most biotechssix years until it made a nickel has done very well with an arthritis treatment artharest dart interjected forcibly interrupting the man another time bud thanks ive got an what you might be interested to know the man continued undaunted is that martinsonwho pulls in eight hundred a year plus stock options incidentallyhas nearly an entire year of her life missing i mean ive got basically nothing on her i show some medical expenses some attorney expenses and thats about it thats all folks my guess is she went off to what amounts to the funny farm in switzerland but it wasnt no vacationi dont show that kind of spending pattern at all dart recalled the thick scar behind her ear and her nervous habither compulsionof attempting to keep it hidden my guess is if i could get into her insurance records gorman said wishfully dart made a note to call ginny and see what she could do he felt himself sweating gorman had agitated him dart charged in before gorman could start again i need the nameand the phone number for that matter if youve got itfor the owner of something called nutmeg supplies in bridgeport wait a second gorman said disgruntled let me write this down dart repeated his request and gave his extension in the conference room gimme a couple minutes when the phone rang and dart answered it gorman read off the information without saying hello he ended with no charge and hung up dart reached the owner of nutmeg supplies at home and heard football in the background on television the television made him think of home and that made him think of mac and even with the neighbor kid walking and feeding the dog during the days he felt awful having to lock the dog up so much on night shift the owner of nutmeg supplies a man named corwin grew angry with dart at first believing the call was a phone solicitation im with the hartford police dart repeated for a third time i thought it was a gimmick the man said apologetically that you was selling home security or one of them steering wheel locks or something im not selling anything dart said i understand that he apologized again dart stressed the urgency of his case building up corwins importance and underscoring that the information was vital to an active homicide investigation the man rallied to the call an unusual but welcome response ill need to go down to the office blue tags you said only blues blue five digits starting with nineeight if we sold them corwin said confidently ill know who to he paused you did say murder right thats right thats what i thought you said fortyfive minutes later corwin called back i got two retail and one commercial with blue tags the ninetyeight thousand series went to abes over on seymour seymour dart shouted into the phone without meaning to yeah seymour street abes commercial laundry dart checked the open yellow pages for an address abes is not listed in the yellow pages he complained theyre commercial not retail they do institutional worknursing homes that sort of thing i doubt they would advertise no retail dart asked some probably theres a storefront of sorts as i recallmind you i havent done a delivery in ten years its not a big part of their businessretail thats a bad part of town yes it is even ten years ago yes commercial work mostly theyre a good customer for us big volume dart thanked the man and was already turning through the white pages his finger running down columns a manicured nail entered his visionabby had found the listing corwin clarified you said a murder investigation right yes i did and i helped very much thats okay i like that hey detective he said holding an impatient dart on the phone nail the bastard dart thanked him again and hung up he told abby he said to nail the bastard what did you say she asked i thanked him she was over checking the map pinned to the wall its seymour street just south of park street we cant go in there alone joe she chided not without a cruiser not without backup he didnt want to get into this with her haite would resist giving him any help would never grant him backup what made this worse much worse for dart was that just the sound of the words seymour street was familiar to him but he couldnt remember why could not place the voice speaking those words corwins voice too fresh too present in his mind but then that voice came to him after seven years of hearing a voice daily it did not stay blurred for long walter zeller had been raised in his parents house on seymour street back when park street had been a good neighborhood not a demilitarized zone he had spoken of that house that time often affectionately nostalgically referring to it simply as seymour street dart could not remember what had happened to the house zeller had inherited it upon his mothers death four years ago that much he remembered well because zeller had paid some inheritance tax rather than sell the place despite its almost worthless value he wasnt sure what had become of the place after that perhaps dart thought wallace sparco lives there now chapter this was itdart knew before he set foot out the door he stole four hours sleep at home after walking mac around the block and fixing himself a tuna sandwich by fivethirty it was dark outside and it occurred to him that the earlier the better because the worst gang violence came after ten at night by the time the drugs and the alcohol and the restless anger had taken hold he dressed in black jeans and a navy blue sweatshirt so that he could walk with hood up and buy himself some disguise he made the trip alone believing that he would find zeller at the house on seymour street that the man had chosen the perfect safe houseno one from outside not even a cop would enter the heart of park street at this time of night without good reason and plenty of backup maybe zeller had cut himself a protection deal with one of the gangsestablishing himself on an innercity warning system consisting of cellular phones and cb radios the cops always arrived five minutes too late as he drove past the courthouse and a string of gentrified houses used as law offices he was struck by the irony of their closeness to park street only a few short blocks to the south law and lawlessness coexisting side by side two blocks from these law offices fourteenyearold girls hustled themselves on street corners and crack dealers sold their goods from the sidewalk dart drove with his sweatshirts hood pulled up and he drove fast running stop signs and disobeying traffic lights on the seat beside him lay a loaded shotgun under the sweatshirt he wore a flak jacket in the pocket a speed key his sidearm had a round loaded into the chamber in his left pocket he carried two ammunition magazines taped together into a speed clip the car doors were locked the closer he drew to park street the slower the traffic and the busier the activities this was the south ends sin streetthe night was alive with possibility despite the november cold the dark street corners were crowded with puerto ricans and a sprinkling of spanish italians and portuguese all under twentyfive le soledos and the latin kings ruled this turf the wrong color socks could cost a kid his life to show a weapon was to start a fight they had teethed on stallone and lee and schwarzenegger and snipes and considered themselves equal to the task it felt to dart as if anyone older than thirty had been exiled the place was ruled by restless youth fortythousanddollar bmws and mercedes benzes cruised park street at ten miles an hour driven by teenage kids doing business over cellular phonesand proud of it to honk at a car for driving too slowly was to invite a stream of bullets if it could be snorted mainlined or smoked it was available if it could be fucked it was pimped if it had been stolen it was for sale if it was living it could be made dead he felt the glare of suspicious eyes but did not exchange glances in a moving car a white person would briefly be toleratedbusiness was business and a good deal of park streets business came in from the white enclaves to the west but for a white person to make more than two passes down this street would quickly spread the word he knew that he was being watched monitored and if zeller had bought protection then to leave the car was to face an army of hungry street rats looking to make trouble he parked the taurus on walcott three short blocks from seymour he grabbed the shotgun and hurried from the car carrying the weapon in plain view moving at a slow jog moving deeper and deeper into darkness and hoping to reach funk street without incident streetlights around here were knocked out as quickly as they were replaced to view this area from overhead in a passing plane it would appear as a square black box lit only by the brilliance of park street a block to the north dart cut left crossed the street and jogged down funk toward seymour his heart somewhere up around his ears his body feeling as if he had stepped inside an oven then across the street appeared a group of youths like a pack of hungry dogs where they had come from he did not know but there they were he had spent much of the last four years interrogating coldblooded killers no older than these kidskillers who showed absolutely no remorse proud to kill for a pair of basketball shoes or a leather jacket or the imagined love of a sweetheart blank eyes dialogue borrowed from movies human shells void of love filled with unspeakable hate they spotted him and they catcalled they liked the shotgun they yelled and taunted dart cut across the street at a run not looking back appear in control the frightened voice inside of him encouraged when he heard their footsteps at a run he knew that he had problems he turned up the steam broke into an allout sprint a cop running from a bunch of punks he couldnt let go of this thought and yet he couldnt run fast enough halfway down funk he violated his own rule and glanced over his shoulder they were coming for him they too were running he felt the desperate fear of the hunted never mind that he was armed equally he was outnumbered he faced armed children who would kill out of boredom who would kill because of the color of a mans skin he faced the very real possibility of firing his weapon at a minor could he bring himself to do such a thing he had no idea if and when selfdefense could or would overcome reason they were fast runners they were gaining on him he often had dreams in which his legs grew impossibly heavy he would run as hard as he could and yet be caught in a slowmotion crawl and now the bad dreams came facetoface with reality as he felt a huge weight bear down on him drain him drive him into the pavement as if his limbs were suddenly cement and the pavement beneath his feet a thick gripping mud yo dude a high winded voice called out from behind dart reached seymour and cut right running smack into a group of four hispanics in their twenties dart fell to the sidewalk and quickly scrambled to his knees one of the kids drew a weapon and aimed it at dart police dart announced more from instinct than consideration he tugged back the shotguns recoil and engaged a shell bullshit the kid with the weapon said gimme your gun dart winded and out of breath heard the fast slap of shoes as the other gang quickly approached the hispanic holding the gun had only a fraction of a second to make his decision he seemed to take in darts shotgun perhaps he recognized it as a police issue he looked to his friends shrugged and gently returned his weapon to inside his jacket he nodded be cool man perhaps he had simply thought dart out of his mind dart ran on his muscles aching as he tensed expecting he might be shot in the back but instead he heard angry shouts from behind him as the kids from funk street collided with the hispanics on seymour he heard the words hes heat man hes heat dart slowed to a fast walk barely able to catch his breath up ahead the facades on the buildings looked vaguely familiar and he thought he remembered the look from the old photos on zellers hallway wall seymour street for just that second he lost his focus neglected to take in his surroundings he leapt up into the air as a pair of alley dogs barked from only inches away and he landed poorly twisting his right ankle he went down hard dropping the weapon and rose painfully to his knees the dogs bellowed edging toward him heads down teeth glaring he picked up the fallen shotgun one of the dogs lunged at him dart jumped back and fell onto the ankle and went down for a second time he growled back ferociously the dogs whined and took off regaining his feet he glanced across the street and this time recognized the building without question a faded photograph zeller with his aging parents all grouped on the steps that served as a porch the photo was daytime now it was night the buildings upperstory windows were lit the back door was locked dart tried it a second time gently twisting the knob leaning his weight against the frame but it wouldnt budge the only accessible window was locked and seemed to be nailed shut from the inside dart leaned his shotgun against the wall and slipped out the speed key he shoved it into the upper lock squeezed its trigger and twisted hearing a slight click with the dead bolt free dart turned the doorknob and pushed and the door came open scraping against the sill he took hold of the shotgun and stepped inside he grabbed the doorknob lifted the door on its hinges and shut it silently the first thing that caught his attention was the smell of cigar smoke it was both familiar and frightening he stood absolutely still caught up in memories a surge of emotion flooding him with all his determination he had not given much thought as to how he might handle an actual confrontation with his mentor he couldnt help but still love this man respect him trust him even he had formed his professional identity within this mans formidable shadow had been protected by him and had in turn guarded him as both patron and teacher he stood at that moment shotgun in hand intending to confront himto accuse him of plotting and carrying out a string of homicides charges that would result in zeller being brought downtown to where he had earned his reputation as the best of the best the kitchen was small and dated back to the fifties chipped linoleum a stained sink and pitted fixtures the countertop carried crumbs and detritus of past meals a string of small black ants paraded along the seam of the splash disappearing behind an old toaster the cigar smoke hung in the air he felt it as a warning zeller was not far dart set down the shotgun having intended it for street defense not necessary with zeller then having second thoughts he picked it back up he moved stealthily into a small sitting room and turned up a narrow flight of stairs zeller had been raised here he had told so many stories about his youth and this place that dart found himself imagining he knew the floor plan disappointed now that the real item did not live up to his memory it was far less grand than zeller had painted it embellished by memory the homes size had been exaggerated by its former resident dart felt a growing sense of dread as he climbed the stairs zeller a murderer waiting somewhere in a house he knew well dart the reluctant inquisitor a stranger here zeller did not surprise well he tended to lash out and ask questions later dart neared the top of the stairs an equally narrow hallway leading to an open door immediately to the right and two opposing doors directly ahead all the doors were open all dark it felt to dart like a shell gamehe expected to find zeller in one of the three but he worried too about the noise hed made with the kitchen doorzeller could well be expecting him dart searched his memory for a clue left by one of zellers family stories he could hear the mans voice inside his head could see him sitting there something about as a kid having witnessed a mugging down on the street he recalled leading him to favor zellers room as being either of the two directly ahead of him he would duck into the nearest room first establishing a defensive position behind the doorjamb then wait for some sure indication of zellers position his heart seemed stuck up in his throat his chest was tight and his mouth dry he was drunk on fear his knees felt like water circulating his head were the crime scenes of the socalled suicides the deaths so neatly orchestrated would this be how someone found joe dartelli were these to be his last few minutessneaking around an unfamiliar house in pursuit of a man he felt as close to as a father he wondered what thoughts had been inside his mothers numbed mind when she had pursued him had she in her own way been as terrified of finding dart as he was of finding zeller he lifted the stock of the shotgun training the barrel at the floor in front of him it would require only a slight lift and a squeeze of the trigger at close range a shotgun made everyone an expert marksman he counted down slowly from five an old habit meant to settle the nerves as far as he could tell the technique failed miserably three two he took one quick step up the last stair and turned quickly to his right the back of a wooden chair hit him squarely in the chest as if the person on the other end of it were swinging for a home run as the wind exploded from him dart raised the shotgun and pulled the trigger and then pulled it again but nothing happenedjammed from the tumble out on the street the concussion of the chair lifted him off his feet he skidded across the hall and banged into the far wall expelling what little air remained dart gasped for breath his chest feeling paralyzed his ribs bruised the shotgun flew from his hands as a boot connected with it that same brown boot then came for darts face swinging straight up toward his chin but dart managed to lean away to one side sagging and the blow missed walter zeller lost his balance and caught himself on the banister nearly going down the stairs instead the brief look that dart caught of the mans face showed a person different from the one dart remembered haggard and worn destroyed by grief and guilt and exhaustion hes an old man dart thought knowing that zeller was only in his early fifties he wore a dark green plaid flannel shirt and blue jeans but they fit him loosely like a man diseased he had a weathered round face sparse graying hair and an irish nose broken too many times to count he looked hard and mean but to dart the mans soft blue eyes gave away his true personality dart tried to reach for his weapon but his arms weighed tons and his chest had been set afire by the crushing blow of the chair his one feeble effort was to rear back and slide his right foot along the floor connecting with the one boot that held all of zellers unsteady weight for zeller it happened too quicklyfirst he lost his balance and then dart kicked away his only solid platform sending him down the stairway headfirst he went down hard turning a full somersault dart whose arms still would not function rolled himself face down on the dusty floor and drove himself forward with his feet his hurt ankle cried out splinters tore from the floor and embedded into his chest and arms he heard zeller groan curse and then start back up the stairs youre dead ivy the sergeant barked clawing his way up the stairs dart had lived ten years believing in that voice and everything it said dart propelled himself to the end of the hallway and into the dark room to the right his arms began to tingle they were coming back to life he rolled across the rug about to lodge himself beneath the bed but grasped the absurdity of trying to hide as a child he had developed himself into a professional hider and as he reached again for those talents he glanced around assessing that he had to get out of the room now he heard the recoil of the shotgun and a shell bang and roll on the hardwood floor zeller was in the hallway had cleared the weapon dart could move both shoulders he had feeling in both hands though he still found it hard to walk he struggled to breathehis chest felt caved in his head pounded from a lack of oxygen of the rooms two windows one faced the street the other nearest to dart faced a flat rooftop footsteps he tried for his sidearm but both hands proved useless he was a sitting duck no time to break the glass first this registered immediately he came to his feet tucked his head into his chest and ran backward ducking and propelling himself through the pane of glass his head smacked the top frame dizzying him glass flew everywhere in a deafening explosion dart felt the cold of the outside air he felt a warm trickle down his back he rolled across the hard tar until the crunching sound stopped and he was out of the shards of glass he came to his feet and headed across the roof to the unforgiving brick wall that faced him forget it ivy zeller yelled across the expanse we should talk this flat rooftop was wedged between two taller buildings the brick building dart now faced also looked flatroofed but a full story higher a steel ladder fixed to the brick wall led up to the others roof that meant that there had to be roof access between the two buildings ivy dont run dont force me we can talk dart paused and glanced over his shoulder zeller was through the window and coming toward him the shotgun cradled in his arms talk dart wondered eyeing the weapon he could barely catch his breath the trickle down his back was definitely blood the top of his shirt was warm and damp with it he hobbled along the wall away from his pursuer working the injured ankle for the first time in his life he didnt trust walter zeller hes out to kill me dont zeller warned loudly as dart rounded the corner i know what you know he cautioned in a voice that indicated he was running now talk to me dart found the steel fire door that he had anticipated the silver duct tape was not anticipated it had been placed at the level of the handleblocking the latch openand told him immediately that zeller had intended this door as part of a wellplanned escape route anticipate the unexpected a zeller credo the shouting at him had been for the specific purpose of distracting and stopping dart before he discovered a way off the roof confine the suspect to a specific areadart knew the tricks he hoisted his sluggish arm forced his unwilling fingers around the handle and tugged hard on the door it swung open tearing the tape from the doorjamb he ducked inside the door thumped shut and locked behind him the enormous room spread out twenty feet below him like something from a science fiction film and smelled immediately familiar huge gray machines lying like sleeping beasts cheek by jowl their metallic skins glistening in the dull light of half a dozen exit signs the unmistakable odor of cleaning solvents dart was inside abes commercial cleaners a few steps down was a wooden balcony with offices to the left dart stumbled down the stairs dragging his bad ankle as if it belonged to someone else zeller had chosen his route wisely the heavy machinery would offer good cover with this idea foremost in mind dart hurried to the far staircase his vision limited by the darkness and made for the ground floor two successive shotgun blasts ruptured the door he had come through and flung it open as if it were made of paper ivy the familiar voice called out threateningly zeller sounded furious dart had witnessed the consequences of this temper enough times to know that the possibility of negotiation had passed zeller made statements he would make one now the shotgun would do that dart hobbled down the final step and onto the shop floor giant commercial laundering machines made up the first row dart cut through this to the nexta long line of dry cleaning machinesdodging fiftyfivegallon drums of cleaning solvents and reminding dart that this was no place for small weapons fire he heard zeller come down the metal staircase to the shop floor the thought of entering into a firefight with the man seemed absurd and yet the deeper he moved into this maze of behemoth equipment the more vulnerable he feltand the more it seemed inevitable zeller obviously knew his way around here dart did not dart headed for the nearest illuminated exit sign cutting through a row of enormous dryers he threw his hip into the panic bar and smacked his head against the unwilling door chained shut they chain em shut at night ivy came the casual voice of zeller from somewhere out on the floor youre shit out of luck dart checked the padlocknumber coded the speed key wouldnt do him any good but there had to be at least one exit out of herezellers planned escape route but where he instinctively moved toward the back away from seymour street where he kept thinking as he moved along the row of dryers installed cheek by jowl if all the exits are chained he tried to make sense of this knowing that zeller had more than just the rooftop exit at his disposal not the roof not the doors he spotted it thena black shape in the farthest corner of the vast room a drain the faster he ran the larger the building seemed to him the back wall was not drawing any closer impossibly the far wall seemed to move away from him bad choice zeller hollered his voice echoing in the cavernous structure bad thinking ivy dart glanced around realizing he had entered a box canyon of sorts the brick wall to his left the line of interconnected dryers to his right the dryers were too sheer too high to attempt to climb his only other way was to reach the drain and hope it was zellers exitor turn around and get back out into the center of the building where he would be less confined he limped badly the harder he ranhe wasnt going to reach the drain in time running at a sprint he looked right the machines he looked left the wall he looked right again and then the obvious hit him out of breath dart stopped he was facing a clothes dryer chapter dart pulled himself up into the clothes dryer drew his legs in and curled into the alltoofamiliar position thrown into a storm of memory he all but lost track of where one life left off and the other began suddenly ten years old again the footsteps avidly pursuing him he was a driver who had lost hold of the wheel a pilot who had lost track of the horizon bitter fear seared his throat the latch mechanism on the commercial machine was far more serious than what he had faced as a child his fingers studied it quickly attempting to decipher its secrets whereas his family machine had had a friction catch this behemoth used for carrying a hundred pounds of wet laundry closed via a locking tongue operated solely from the outside to get out dart needed to block the tongue from catching removing his wallet from his back pocket required an act of gymnastics a credit card was too thick a photo too thin his fingers located his laminated drivers license held it firmly against the metal jamb and drew the door slowly closed so that the springed latch was held out of its hole by the card dart snugged the door into place firmly shut he was swallowed in a darkness and smell whose familiarity overpowered him rationally he knew where he waswho he was but somehow the past won out in the darkness of the dryer a film played before his eyes and he saw his drunken mother stumbling toward him for dart there suddenly was no walter zeller only memories of terror it felt as if his lungs were burning his throat tickled he was hiding from the beast nothing but nothing would make him give himself away her footsteps grew louder his heart swelled painfully choking him beating as fast as the clanging wheels of a runaway train his body steamed with sweat shell kill you a voice inside him warned this time shell kill you hell kill you a deeper voice echoed he has nothing to lose white sparks filled his vision like fireflies the smell of his own fear overpowered the tangy lintflavored metal that had meant sanctuary the back of his shirt was damp with his blood and his ankle throbbed the sound of shoes approachingdragging on the cement floorgrew closer the beast was upon him the person out there was so close dart could hear the breathing he felt a fool for sitting awaiting his fatea passive acceptance a relinquishing of control he wanted to do something not just sit by and await the hell that might come bad choice ivy zeller shouted bringing him back a nearby dryer kicked into action then another switched on closer this time round and round we go zeller said one by one he was turning on all the machines he intended to bake dart out yet another dryer roared into action incredibly close he realized imagining the horror of being trapped inside a machine capable of that kind of severe heat he began a slow but even count one thousand one one thousand two the heat generated was enough to turn water to steamhe would burn in minutes but if he timed it right one thousand five one thousand six he racked his brain trying to dredge up an image of the front of the machine were the controls to the right or left of the door first he thought left then he saw a totally different image that had the controls to the right which to trust you wont like it zeller warned shouting above the din he was exceptionally close one thousand nine the wall behind dart shook and rumbled as this the next machine over was switched on nine seconds between machines he began the count all over again one thousand one the ensuing noise was deafening too loud to overhear zellers footsteps nearly too loud to maintain the rhythmic count in his head it would come down to timing one thousand six he cocked his leg back tucking it up into his chest with his right hand he needed to make a choice his weapon or a firm grip on the rim of the drum so that he could get out quickly he wanted out above all he wanted out one thousand eight he kicked the door open with all his strength and knew immediately that he had connected with zeller he heard the big man cough out umph as he went down hard and lost his grip on the shotgun it slid a few feet away dart leapt out forgetting about his bad ankle and collapsed to the cement floor as his ankle gave out zellers head was bleeding it left a smeared trail as he wiggled and stretched for the shotgun dart still down himself reached for his weapon zeller managed to snag the stock of the shotgun with his right hand he sucked it toward him the barrel moved like a huge rotating gun turret until dart was looking directly into the sole dark eye of the end of the barrel darts sidearm was aimed at zellers face no more than a yard apart both men motionless lying on the cold cement floor long time no see zeller said loudly above the roar of the dryers the side of his face was bleeding badly though all head wounds were bleeders dart intended to say something but the words caught in his throat let me explain something the man continued because you always needed to hear things straight you never could get things right the first time around bullshit dart managed to cough out he felt on the verge of tears zeller was going to pull the triggerhe felt certain of it his life had come down to this one fragile momentthe one man he had come to respect in life intended to kill him he felt his own finger grip more firmly on the trigger another fractional pressure and the back of zellers head would explode against the brick wall you aint bringing me in zeller announced proudly fuck that look ivy save it for the jordons out on seymour street what im telling you is that you aint gonna do it not because you cant but because im not going to let you you failed you see dart felt his heart jump zeller knew all the right buttons to push you are not gonna bring me in for this that aint gonna happen so you have to do it big fella no aiming that thing as some kind of threat because it aint no threat to me its the solution you got it he waited for dart to respond but his patience ran out you got it he repeated shouting pull the fucking trigger ivy he said more loudly pull the fucking trigger before i dust you asshole the end of the shotgun rotated an inch trained on darts throat from here i can take your head clean off your body you thought about that it crossed my mind dart hollered so pull the fucking trigger again he waited ive been inside the system ivy im not going through that he added not even for something i believe in darts eyes stung he felt so angry at the man zeller bellowed there was a time i wanted to recruit you can you imagine that i convinced myself that you couldthat you wouldhelp but then i feared that boy scout attitude of yours you live in a fucking bubble ivy righteous ignorance youre your own morality play you want to know why ginny left you because youre too good you protect this image of yourself fuck the image ivy dart felt absolutely still all of a sudden he could hear the traffic through the wall and far in the distance something dripping the air felt hot and incredibly thin his finger begged him to squeeze the trigger it was as if for a moment he had connected with god he had never been in this place before nice try dart said realizing that zeller was attempting to trick him into firing you dont get it do you you still dont fucking get it you think youre so fucking smart mr detective let me tell you something i avoided your shift because i didnt want you becoming leadnot on any of them give me a kowalski or a thompson but keep me away from joe dartelli not because youre such hot shitbut because youre so well trained said the man who had trained him zeller smirked pleased with himself dart glanced toward the wall wondering if he could roll fast enough you so much as twitch zeller declared and doc ray is going to need a sponge mop to bring you home theyre trying to help dart said if he was going to be accused of being overly righteous then he was going to speak his mind martinson zeller asked he smiled dart knew that smileit was zellers unforgiving smile the one that gave way to the anger and fury youre going to tell me about arielle martinson you were always so fucking naive i thought we broke you of that he blinked rapidly maybe he had lost enough blood to pass out righteous and naive you shoulda been a fucking minister you know that moving the weapon back toward darts eyes he said dryly and no fucking sense of humor either the suicides were meant to make them scrub the testing dart said trying to buy himself some time to find some way out of this he was not going to shoot zeller he was determined to bring him up on charges gold fucking star ivy he blinked rapidly again and why the fuck would i want to do that if zeller blinked repeatedly like that again dart thought he might manage to knock the shotgun barrel toward the wall but far enough he wondered the spray pattern of a shotgun was far wider than its small barrel opening i know what youre thinking because i know you ivy youre so fucking predictable thats your problem youre thinking i flipped out youre thinking its for luckygod rest her sweet soul this last bit was said in the true voice of walter zellerthe zeller who dart knew and respected but you dont know shit he offered dart a look of disappointment and said martinson was raped while at the university cut up bad dart recalled the ugly scar behind her ear victims everywhereand he knew by the mans tone of voice where zeller was going with it dart didnt want to hear this it took her over a year to recover after that she made it her lifes work to do something about sex offense it became a passion and from there an obsession she became consumed by it she made mistakesbad business decisionsbased on the conviction that gene therapy was the answer an unproven technology mind you she devoted funds that she shouldnt havegot herself into trouble she had to make it workthats the hole she dug for herself he blinked repeatedly like a man about to lose consciousness theyve conducted three different trials in five yearsall to shitty results nesbitthe ice manwas in the first group they paroled him early to be part of that trial that was the only reason he was out and able to kill lucky the fire door at the top of the stairs cried out over the top of the roarthe door by which they had entered dart felt paralyzed by what zeller had told himhis mind swimming the cop in both of them knew from the distinct prolonged sound that it was not a squeak caused by wind it was not the door settling all of its own someone had come through that door had entered they both lifted their heads at once to listen more clearly the threats of only seconds before gone footsteps coming down the first set of stairs that lead to the balcony dart wanted the rest of zellers explanation staring up into the darkness zeller hissed you stupid shit dartelli you led him here he whispered incredulously you let yourself be followed jesus christ dart felt himself shrink he had not checked for someone following him too preoccupied with the dangers of park street zellers hand came off the weapon drew a zipper across his lips and signaled first to dart and then to himselfhe wanted dart to follow him adversaries they were suddenly partners again the transition felt natural dart didnt question it zeller rocked up onto his knees grabbed the shotgun checked over his shoulder for dart and stood in a crouch moving along the line of groaning dryers keeping close to the machines he lifted his hand and stopped dart short of the very end he pointed to a depression in the corner of the floor where a large mesh grate covered a manhole he signaled that dart should cover with his weapon as he would go first and lift the grate for dart who was to follow and enter the hole ahead of zeller dart signaled back that he would hold the grate for zeller instead but the sergeant flashed his middle finger at his former protege then he raised his index finger as if to say ready dart nodded he pushed past zeller for the first time offering him his back he edged slowly toward the corner of this last dryer and sneaked his face out just far enough to see around the corner so that he could defend their position zellers breath was hot on darts neck the detective jumped not expecting it zeller placed a hand firmly on darts shoulder and spoke into his ear his name is alverez you met him at the fire he was the one in the car the reason we dont kill the bastard is that theyll only replace him and we dont want that got it dart nodded zeller glanced around the corner of the roaring machine and gently eased himself away he went back to hand signalshe had seen someoneand then hurried into the corner with the grate his heart aching dart edged his left eye around the dryer the man pursuing them was looking lost standing motionless in the center of the aisle he was carrying what looked like an uzi zeller managed to open the grate without being heard over the rumbling of the dryers he signaled dart and dart limped over to him pocketed his sidearm and slipped quietly down the steel tube using hand and foot grips welded into its wall his ankle screaming zeller passed him the shotgun and followed easing the grate down into place above him flashing sparks indicated that alverez had seen them a spray of bullets skimmed off the grate throwing fireworks overhead zeller winced and buckled on his way down the ladder and though dart did not see the mans blood spilling from his shoulder when zeller reached out and accepted the shotgun dart knew that hed been hit zeller switched on a small penlight as he came off the last rung and pointed down the storm sewera cement pipe perhaps four feet high he signaled for dart to defend their backside then crouched and lead the way into the claustrophobic tunnel the bottom of the pipe was dry after only a few feet when a spray of bullets echoed back at the base of entrance tube zeller switched off the light alverez had fired a volley down through the grate in defense the grate banged on the cement floor above and far behind them alverez was inside zeller allowed dart to run fully into him stopping him he grabbed for the detectives hand and pulled it down to a cold metal grip dart tested his toe forward and felt it slip out into nothingness this pipe ended here he crouched and began to descend using the ladder of grips that zeller had indicated at the last rung he stepped off into water so cold that it caught his breath the sergeant flashed his penlight only once aiming it down a large arching stone ceiling that was dripping water and coated in a green slime the water in which they stood was pitch black dart heard the distinct sound of scurrying rats but ignored ithe didnt want to think about being in a storm sewer with a few hundred irritated rats at his feet zeller pulled on dart and led the way from behind them came the unmistakable sound of shoes scraping on cement with his left hand held out against the tunnels wall as a guide dart followed the sound of zellers splashing the sergeant had clearly practiced this escape for he moved knowingly in the darkness darts ankle chilled by the water felt a little better when they were a good twenty yards down this tunnel dart heard alverez spit out the single word shit followed by the sound of a falling man landing hardhe had gone off the end of the pipe into the larger tunnel the man fired off a stream of semiautomatic weapon fire in anger made apparent to dart only by a terrifying whistling in the air around him alverez was coming after them with a vengeance darts hope that he might be too injured to follow were dashed darts left hand went into space as the wall ran out sssst zeller said to his immediate left dart blindly negotiated the turn into a similar tunnel and they started off again he realized that the intersection was yet another of zellers ploys alverez would be forced to make a choicehopefully the wrong one he and zeller stayed in this connecting tunnel for several minutes before taking a right they were following the layout of the city blocks overhead by all indications they had lost alverezten minutes later zeller stopped them and they listened intently there were no sounds from behind only rats darts feet were numb and he could feel the chill spreading up his legs and into his bones zeller led on they took one more right and walked through shallower water for another fifteen minutes at which point dart heard a small waterfall ahead of them zeller allowed the detective to bump into him once again as he stopped he heard a deeper sound beyond the small waterfall and for the first time his eyes sensed a distant circle of gray at the center of the black in which he had lived for the past eternal forty minutes they then reached the source of this gray the water that held them spilled from the end of the storm sewer falling to a mass of ice below the river spread out before them etched with the bare branches of dormant trees reaching into a canopy of low clouds that reflected back the dull amber glare of the sleeping city chapter we cant take a taxi they might think of that they might even be listening in on a scanner it wouldnt take a genius to guess that a pickup down by the river at this time of night would be us zeller led dart along the rivers edge darts ankle felt almost normal it was you up on charter oak bridge he said to the man in front of him speaking back as they walked zeller said yeah i had to know what you were up to and then ginny was involved and that other womanlangand i realized we had problems alverez an outoftowner a guy hired to break my kneesyours too by now convince us to shut up he led through some shrubs that tore at darts clothing and then along the rivers edge again ive been avoiding him for months but with you in the picture i imagine theyll bring in more help he said in a troubled voice i heard a rumor a shooters been hired thats hardly breaking knees the difference between a spot fire and a range fire is getting an early jump hired by whom proctor dart asked one thing ill say about you ivyyou do your homework they walked in silence past the glaring lights of the power plant until they reached charter oak bridge they climbed the same steps where dart had seen zeller standing and in minutes were up on the bridge my cars back in the south end dart reminded wistfully hell watch it after he realizes we lost him stay away same with your apartment same with jennings road hell look for you there in his eyes youve hooked up with me ivy youre fucked they have a hell of a lot to protect theyve been trying for me for months even if you hadnt stirred the nest by going to roxin youd be on their list now anyway you know about my visit dart asked astonished ivy i know fucking everything how quickly we forget but they need me dart protested they need me to bring you in for the murders they should be helping me dont you get it ivy are you that fucking ignorant maybe i am zeller stopped and turned around dart could barely make out the mans face in the ambient light as a car passed and zeller was caught in the headlights his eye sockets filled with black shadow he said the laterin doesnt work laterin the drug theyre testing he said condescendingly it doesnt work dart ruminated on this zeller seemed to be making one last bid for innocence listen how do you monitor whether or not a drug aimed at sex offenders works this isnt canceryou dont take an x ray he said condescendingly you keep the guy under surveillanceyou monitor his every move zeller spoke slowly proctor security had the contract to keep these creeps under surveillance i was working for them and what did i find out a full half of these assholes repeatedly reoffend theyre no better than they were his jaw seemed to move mechanically inhumanly dart couldnt catch his breath and martinson or someone over there skewed the findings and i without meaning to caught on i got pissed off at proctor one day and he made a booboo and hinted at something he shouldnt have i got a look at some files and turned up altered reportsproctor was giving them the results they wanted so what was my next step the teacher asked roxins files exactly harder to break into at the time but not impossible since then theyve made the place into fort knox i saw the fucking test results ivythe real ones the shit theyre testingthe laterindid nothing oh christ dart said they caught me at itnearly caught me nearly physically had meand ive been on the run ever since once i got started you know alverez was brought in the paperwork that i saw was shredded deleted whatever bet on it i couldnt produce a shard of evidence to support what i knew so only the one choice he said leaving it for dart to draw his own conclusion what fucking choice was there dart felt in turmoil he had deciphered the suicides as murders concluded that the murders were the work of someone attempting to discredit roxinwalter zeller but what zeller now told him turned all that on its head dart mumbled thinking aloud if i had left them as suicides if i had connected them to the clinical trial what the fuck do you think ive been trying to tell you with these phone callsand risking seeing you in person you were doing too good a job you were pissing me off all you had to do was connect the deaths to roxins clinical trial he led dart off charter oak electing to leave a main thoroughfare the rest would have fallen into place zeller said shes running out of moneymartinson this laterin thing has consumed her for ten years shes moved her resources around thrown too much money at laterin she has probably cooked the books but eventually that catches up to you theyve been in various stages of clinical trials on laterin for years she needs this to work if it doesnt shes shitoutofluck this fails shes out of business everyone goes homesome of us happy zeller checked over his shoulder dont look now he said dart glanced back and saw a police patrol car approaching at a crawl zeller told him the woods behind my old place two hours be there he cut down a side alley leaving dart alone disappearing in a heartbeat he had perfected the art of vanishing the patrol car pulled alongside rolling at a walkers speed dart displaying his shield walked over to the car whats the problem here your piece the uniformed driver said adding sir and making a head motion in darts direction didnt know who you was darts sweatshirt had ridden up over his holstered weapon which was now in plain view how about the other guy hes with me dart replied he was he thought couple of guys in clothes wet from the knees down walking these particular streets on a cold night carrying hardware the cop explained i understand dart said you on duty sir the cop asked trying to impress now you want i could give you a ride back to jennings road i could use a ride dart said but not to jennings road chapter they met in the dark alongside the droning hum of the electrical substation not far from zellers former home its mechanics were silhouetted against the sky like a giant schematic it had snowed an inch the first of the year and the temperature had dropped into the twenties dart arrived first and was shivering by the time zeller approached telegraphing the pain he was in without meaning to alverez had clearly wounded him back in the sewers dart was for moving out from under the loud hum of the overhead wires he strained toward the wooded darkness this shit makes too much noise dart complained glancing overhead stepping closer to zeller he pointed into the dark youre jumpy take it easy zellers voice was tight dart worried for him are you all right fucking peachy thanks what now zeller said its my job to sell you on leaving these as suicides let martinson take the fall she deserves he paused id like to tell you that ill turn myself in but i wont im not going to be locked up its too late dart explained ive already convinced teddy bragg and haite that they were staged suicides the good news is that haite wants nothing to do with it well there you go zeller said go along with him let them stand it wont bring down roxin martinson has dropped the names of the suicides from their list of participantscovered her bases it was difficult to see in the dark but dart thought that he saw zeller nod as if he had expected something like this his voice colored by pain and discouragement zeller said she pulls that off and its all been for nothing he added bitch i think youre wrong about the filesthe records of the clinical trials dart said taking control of where they should head he couldnt remember contradicting zeller so directly being deleted he continued shredded does that sound like martinson you say theyve been in clinical trial for years a person like hera devoted scientistis not going to destroy test data not for any reason bullshit its gone hidden maybe but not gone he explained she needs that data she created that data its important to her she wont destroy it i disagree if im her i destroy all physical evidence of those files but only after ive hidden a copy away for my own use and what youre going to subpoena it weve got ginny dart reminded him the computer you think martinson has it in a computer zeller asked amused by the absurdity where else password protected safe easy to get atbut impossible for anyone else to access doubtful ivy its gone she shredded it he reminded i was told that those files were shredded shredded maybe but not destroyed youre not making sense zeller said angrily shes not going to give you those files ivy believe me you make noise about them and shell destroy them sure as shit maybe thats what we want dart said obliquely for her to erase them make some fucking sense would you zeller reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a mashed cigar he tore open the crinkled cellophane and broke the cigar in half where it was torn stuffed it into his mouth and bit a piece off the end spitting it out zeller located a match cupped it lit the cigar i fucked this up ivy what im trying to tell youhe puffed on the cigar and blew out the flame is that its over dart saw a small red dot blink against the fences galvanized pipe it seemed like nothing more than the lingering aftermath of zellers lighting the match but darts sight remained fixed and the dot moved it moved quickly toward zellers head and dart identified it for what it was an electronic sighting device used by marksmen the red dot touched the fence behind zellers shoulder and then quickly found his neck dart slapped out with his open hand catching a stunned zeller on the side of the face and knocking him to the side zeller stumbled dropped the cigar and fell to dart the bullet sounded like a thin fast wind at ear height zeller didnt hear it he misunderstood shoving the detective away and prepared to fight when the red dot found darts cheek zeller lurched forward and returned a lifesaving shove dart went down into the wet snow as the second bullet splintered off a piece of a tree trunk behind them the two immediately crawled toward the cover of the trees their attention fixed on the other man alert for the glowing red dot of the assassin as the dot found zellers back dart hissed right and the sergeant rolled to his right the ground where hed been crawling a fraction of a second before exploded into mud and dirt right dart instructed again and again the earth erupted under the power of the bullet zeller came to his knees and crawled fast aware that the marksman was locked onto him that all it required of the killer was to sweep the sight back and forth and await the signal dart moved left intentionally widening the space between them to give the marksman a larger dead space where the technology would fail to send a signal but it was zeller the red dot hunted and dart experienced an increasing sense of dread left right he called out commands attempting to steer him clear knowing well that the laser at the end of a weapon was faster far more agile than its human target a piece of zellers leg exploded as a bullet hit from behind zeller splashed facedown in the muck roll dart coughed out emotion choking him the dot wandered onto zellers ribs and then froze there the sergeant rolled but not before dart heard the distinctive sound of another bullet taking a piece of him zeller groaned came to his knees and scrambled to his right in a zigzag pattern the ground around him came alive with a series of small explosions dart raced ahead toward the trees feeling helpless looking on as zellers efforts slowed dart spun around withdrew his weapon and stretched into a prone position he fired blindly into the dark the shot echoed loudly the red dot weaved across the open space toward him dart searched for the source of that light but saw nothing he fired again a wounded zeller hurried on hands and knees into the woods like a crippled dog darts attention divided between the red dot as it raced across the snow toward him and the seething darkness that hid the shooter if he rolled to his left he would meet the laser to roll to his right would only disorient him he held his ground his heart pounding his finger begging to squeeze off another round zeller fired two consecutive shots intentionally drawing the red dot away from dart and back toward himself the shooter was good he knew that his targets had turned to face him that his next shot although silenced would produce a muzzle flash identifying his location the flash would give either dart or zelleror botha target to aim at by challenging him dart and zeller forced him to reconsider spraying bullets at them the laser wandered across the snow the full attention of both cops fixed to it it moved toward zeller stopped and headed back toward dart zeller scrambled backward still facing in the direction of the shooter but moving toward and finally reaching the woods he pulled himself to a position partially blocked by a tree dart lay prone his weapon aimed in front of him but his eyes on the lethal red dot sweeping the snow it edged steadily closer ten feet five feet three feet zeller also tracking its progress fired yet another round and then quickly rolled away attempting to escape having made himself a target with his own muzzle flash the dull red dot jerked wildly in zellers direction the sergeant fired again buying time for dart as he scrambled farther back into the woods he lost sight of the small red dot causing panichis world had been reduced to this one small orb of red light to misplace it could mean death red light flashed in his left eye dart jerked his head away as if from a burning match the tree trunk that he was pressed against exploded and wooden shrapnel splintered his face clouding his vision and temporarily blinding him he knew then that he was a dead mancouldnt see couldnt flee the allseeing laser he would be targeted and killed he pressed himself flat to the ground reducing his profile while frantically trying to clear his eyes of the debris zeller his eyesight adjusted to the darkness saw dart take a face full of bark and splinters zeller knew that the next sound hed hear would be darts last moment on earth no time for him to find a better position it had to be now like shooting fish in a barrel using a scope like that for himself zeller realized it was over he had tried to bring down roxin and he had failed the davids didnt always win out over the goliathsjustice was something strived for but not always won as a cop he had lived this truth for over twenty years he pushed his back against the tree pulled his knees into his chest braced his arm raised his weapon and he fired i will not be locked up he thought the report echoed through the woods and the shot drew the respect of the shooter who abandoned the electronic search in darts direction and he turned the laser onto zeller zeller fired again thinking show me that muzzle flash the red dot crept across the snow up a tree and found zellers knee the sergeant braced himself give me a target he mentally challenged a yellowwhite flash came from within the woods straight ahead the woods echoed with a volley of reports as zeller squeezed off a succession of shots intentionally creating a wide pattern his knee blew apart his shoulder exploded he managed one final shot run like hell dartelli he thought to himself go with god dart pressed into the snow cleared his eyes zeller had clearly emptied his magazine and had to be in the process of reloading for the woods were absolutely silent as his eyes cleared he could discern the rigid symmetry of the black tree trunks rising from the white snow and the surreal geometry of the power substation to his left he lay perfectly still waitingexpecting the red dot to find him he came to his knees and scrambled wildly through the snow stealing his way more deeply into the trees he awaited a signal from zeller but knew that with the shooter still out there the sergeant too would lie low he relived the events of the past few minutes once againthe sound of zeller unloading the ensuing silence zeller might have hit him dart realized he crept forward his eyes better now he could make out the smooth white bark of the trees the glowing ceiling of low clouds bouncing back the city light the unbroken clarity of the snow as sheer and smooth as a silk scarf minutes passed and still nothing dart wormed through the trees making his way back toward the small clearing by the substation where he had last seen zeller he moved carefully stopping every few feet his body protected by a tree eyes alert for the lasers searching red dot he waited and listened and then he moved on cautiously he couldnt be sure of time but it seemed that five or ten minutes passed and still nothing no human sounds no movement fear gripped him the hum of the power station grew louder again he paused assessing the area ever alert for the sharpshooters laser the closer he came to the clearing the more of a target he presented at the start zeller had been in this approximate area he looked for him left and then right he scanned the snow for tracks the silence was frightening it occurred to him that zeller believing he had hit the shooter might have gone after him to confirm the kill he realized that his best move might have been to remain relatively close to where he had been injured in case zeller was himself now seeking out dart the two of them going around in circles he moved forward stopped and waited nothing systematically he moved forward again when he looked left he saw him zeller was about ten yards away sitting up still facing the area from which the shots had come dart hissed at him but not loud enough to gain his attentionor else zeller was simply refusing to acknowledge his attention all on the shooter it was bad form for dart to approach the sergeant and increase the size of their target so he hunkered down behind a pair of trees and waited after another five minutes of absolute silence of bonenumbing cold he began resenting the mans behavior at a stakeout that had gone bad zeller had once kept him waiting like this for over fortyfive minutes when zeller lit up a cigar dart would know the sergeant considered the area clear dart waited another three minutes and ran out of patience he had seen zeller take at least two shotshe might have passed out dart weaved his way through the standing tree trunks and hissed once more this time close enough loudly enough to be heard again zeller refused to acknowledge him in any way so typically arrogant dart felt angry at the manhe would go to any length to remind dart of the hierarchy of their relationship he would sit by a phone and allow it to ring until dart answered it it infuriated dart he finally reached the manzeller was leaning against a small evergreen that bent away from him with his weight a pair of whitebark birches in front of him as a screen he held his gun in both hands resting on the ground between his legs his knee looked badly hit it was the position of zellers gun that sent alarm shivering through dartthe arm was slack the barrel of the weapon planted into the wet snow and mud zeller revered his weapons preached the code of proper care and handling treating the weapon like this was unthinkable dart took another few cautious steps coming to within an arms reach he smelled blood he leaned forward in the dim light sarge he whispered anxiously glancing over his shoulder all the while expecting the lasers searching dot sarge he repeated the man didnt move dart looked into zellers face the hole was quite small immediately below the left eye he gasped sarge he blurted out the knot tightening in his throat his chest burning his eyes filling with tears he didnt reach out to touch him to disturb him only to check for a pulse he gripped the mans warm wrist realizing in a flood of memory that the two had rarely touched even to shake hands realizing that had zeller had even a single heartbeat of life left within him he would have broken darts grip instantly and told him to keep his hands to himself walter zeller was dead forgetting himself forgetting all training placing himself at serious jeopardy joe dartelli raised his face to the sullen sky and shrieked no so loudly and for so long that to hear it from a suburban home one would have imagined a wounded animal he stood then weapon in hand not thinking of lasers or semiautomatic weapons but only of revenge he ducked and moved deftly and quickly through the trees as smoothly as water over rock he ran across the clearing his feet slipping on the wet snow and entered the opposing woods tree by tree he worked his way across the front of this copse knowing the shooter could not have been too far into the trees during the attack at his feet brass casings lay scattered about warm when first ejected they had melted small tunnels into the snow the ground was scuffed and muddy from the shooters frantic movements the path of mud indicated that the shooter may have dragged himself off into the woods back toward zellers former home whether he had followed one of them here or had been keeping the place under surveillance and had overheard them dart couldnt know the prints were not clean and the snow was discolored with either blood or mud or both neglecting concern for his own safety dart quickly cut his way through the trees and shrubs leaving the hum of electricity behind him the track left by the shooter grew heavier and more labored until it became apparent to dart that the man had been wounded had crawled his way through the trees he pressed ahead knowing that he must be gaining on the man through the woods came the plaintive cry of sirensat least two perhaps three or more the shots had been heard and reported dart suddenly had to contend with the pressure of timehe could not afford to be brought downtown for an officerinvolved shooting investigation the key to dealing with martinson would be speed timing he heard groaning before he saw the man he passed the black shape of the mans discarded weapon and kicked it aside the shooter lay on his side curled in a fetal position clutching his bleeding stomach with both hands ignoring his wounded shoulder it was too dark to see much of his face but his fingers were spread open his hands clearly empty he was a tall lanky mannot the same build as the man in the laundry zeller had hit him twicea serious gut shot and a minor bleeder in the shoulder the gut shot was final even with an ambulance he didnt look as if hed survive the sirens quickly drew closer dart heard one of the cars come to a stop up on the highway rest area where dart had parked dart leveled his handgun sighting down the short barrel at the mans head the shooter cowered curling up tighter darts arm began to shake a voice from inside him demanded he pull the trigger do it this voice pleaded darts finger found the trigger guard and then the trigger itself his thumb tripped the safety allowing the gun to be fired he stared down the dark tube at the mans head the man shook with fear he couldnt do it dart lowered the weapon securing the safety and walked silently off into the woods he knew well what hell zellers murder would createthree perhaps as many as five investigators would be assigned the forensics work would be exhaustive the meetings endless when the second dead man proved to be a hired killer from out of state the governor and the fbi would be brought in the press would get wind of it and the story would take off like wildfire stealing headlines and news radio leads from greenwich to putnam perhaps as far as boston and providence and in the process dart knew the opportunity to sink roxin would disappear quickly the coverups would begin the fictitious stories welded in place the connections quickly distanced within a few short hours following the first news leak of zellers death any and all hope of exposing roxin could be lost all zellers efforts defeated zellers methods had ultimately killed himdart could not escape this thought despite his good intentions the man had chosen the wrong solution by violating the very laws he had once upheld he had dug himself into isolation and desperation convincing himself no doubt that he was engaged in noble selfsacrifice the truth it seemed to dart was more that luckys death had pushed him over the edge and it felt sad to dart that such a man could become so lost so maybe i am a boy scout dart thought dart went off first at a walk then at a run in the opposite direction from the arriving police who were already crowding into the woods as shouts raised behind him he felt filled with an overwhelming wish that zellers death would not be in vain martinson had not destroyed the files dart felt certain of it chapter haite glanced up from his desk at the detective standing in his office doorway and said jesus h christ dart was all mud blood and wet clothes shut the door were haites next words closely followed by you were there dart nodded what the hell happened i wont be dragged into the investigation dart said the hell you wont haite glanced over at the wall clockit was one in the morning ive got a dozen patrol and four detectives out there the capers office area was empty what the hell happened the shooter died in transit doa at hh he said referring to hartford hospital dart looked haite directly in the eyes and said i was wrong about the suicides they werent murders is that right haite asked not believing dart for a moment but not questioning him either this was what haite wanted to hear i misread the evidence sergeant its my fault dart said did you yes i may be able to prove that roxin laboratories is involved in a coverup concerning a gene therapy treatment they are testing the drug apparently has severe psychological side effects resulting i assume in some of these suicides its a terrible thing where does zeller fit in haite asked bluntly i dont believe i have ever mentioned zellers name to you sir im not sure what youre referring to the use of sir was certain to catch haites attention his death dart choked out is certainly a tragedy to us all i want him to die a hero not a criminal haite hissed openly honest how much of this is going to surface how much of what dart asked in his best innocent boy scout voice you can keep it that way haite asked sounding both surprised and impressed were under some time pressure sir dart said making sure to repeat the formal address he coughed and picked some mud out of his teeth if were going to prove roxins involvement we have to move quickly well need a variety of warrants a full ert the surveillance van if we fail he said maintaining his eye contact with haite i fear that accusations may be made against sergeant zeller in an effort to discredit him and divert blame from where it belongs you can really keep him out of this haite asked again i wasnt aware that he was ever implicated in anything dart answered calmly playing his part has his name ever come up in regards to any of these investigations haite dragged a hand across his mouth contemplating darts offer do this for zeller darts eyes told the man can you actually pull this off dartelli haite understood that to commit the resources dart was requesting would necessitate his own involvement putting his ass on the line should darts plan fail and the truth of zellers criminal activity be revealed they would both be risking their careers to save zellers reputation can you haite repeated wanting an answer that they both knew dart could not give i had a good teacher said joe dart chapter they needed martinsons password driving a departmentconfiscated lexus dart approached the employee parking lot entrance to roxin at am he wore jeans a sweater and a windbreaker the lineman at the top of the phone pole armed with a highpowered monocular worked narcotics but had done a good deal of undercover surveillance work across town the worker down the manhole not far from the governors mansion was with snet and was awaiting court permission to tap into a highspeed data transmission line that serviced a remote computer terminal located in the study of dr arielle martinsons home ginny had determined the existence of this remote terminal after questioning dart thoroughly about the computers he had seen there bud gormans check of snet billing had confirmed it the unmarked black ert step van was parked half a mile down the hill from roxin the team ready with black ladders to assault the facilitys west wall if necessary haite was in the command van with two techies parked near roxins main entrance it had the rear left wheel jacked off the ground and a number of tools lying nearby as if abandoned with a flat tire in fact the allwheeldrive vehicle could be driven right off the jack if required in darts left ear a small earpiece kept him in touch with the command van and thereby ginny and the spotter atop the phone pole he wore taped to his chest a fiberoptic camera no thicker than a fountain pen and curved on a piece of flex so as to capture darts point of viewan interesting twist demanded by the judge issuing the warrants there were few guidelines for a hostile raid on a computer network they were improvising as dart pulled up to the unmanned security gate he switched on the video recorderno bigger than a walkmanand spoke to the microphone clipped under the collar of his jacket position one im all yours gin the techies inside the van were recording his every word dart heard ginnys voice answer wearing a telephone headset at her kitchen table with two laptops in front of her both connected to highspeed data lines ginny echoed position one and said here goes nothing dart wondered what this validation must feel like to her she had hacked into roxins mainframe with the permission of the court and at darts request in return for her cooperation the court had agreed to expunge her criminal record including taking her off probation and now with the law behind her she was attempting to take control of the security area of roxins computer and open the arm of the gate from a remote location miles away the security gate resembled the ones at car rental lotsa red and white horizontal bar prevented entry and a long row of sharp spikes designed to puncture tires inhibited exit dart waited nervously for ginnys magic anything he heard her ask no one second she said how bout this the gate opened bingo dart said as he drove through youre a genius lets just hope i can get you back out she said only half teasing at this hour his was the only car in the lot he drove toward the severalstory block of glass and metal that attached at the north end to the giant dome the place looked like an enormous glowing spaceship dart switched off the headlights im facing the second door from the south end he informed ginny theres no number on it the stairways are to your right she asked the glassedin stairways were clearly visible to him thats right correct confirmed the spotter also listening in ive got it she informed him ive logged you into the system under the employee name of nealy george nealy hes listed as a biochemical engineer assigned to bblockwhatever that is did you get that george nealy bblock dart answered to get him in ginny had needed to choose an existing employees identity if stopped by security he would claim to have lost his id card somewhere between the parking lot and wherever they caught up to him can you get me in he asked tell me when youre at the door she answered dart climbed out of the car reckoning that by now the night security had been notified of nealys use of the parking lot outside the door was a stainless steel device used to read id cards dart had none standing at the door he said im here stand by ginny said in his ear darts nerves were already shot he had no idea how he would make it through the next half hour he checked in both directions repeatedly how bout that ginny asked the security devices bluegreen lcd read incorrect signon informationplease try again dart tried to open the door no he informed her he worried that she was in over her head completely unfamiliar with roxins security system she had to come to understand it all on the fly real time as she called it stand by she repeated how bout that she inquired incorrect signon informationplease try again negative dart announced sweat streaming from his armpits with the temperature one degree below freezing this is lookout reported the man atop the phone pole i have an unidentified individual on foot heading south along the east side dart looked up he could just make out a tiny black dot a hundred yards away a security guardand heading toward him we have one more try ginny explained if we fail then nealy will not be permitted inside and if were to continue ill have to check you into the parking lot under a different name and try again incorrect signon informationaccess deniedplease contact the security deskthank you were toast dart announced unidentified individual is seventy yards and closing reported the lookout the gate ginny asked panicked dart looked over his shoulder the entrance gate rose and fell you got it hold the phone she said the guard approached now less than fifty yards away the man waved still too far for his face to be seen and conversely darts could not be seen by him were running out of headroom dart warned another few yards and darts face would be identifiable how many roxin employees would a security guard recognize joe she asked dart read welcome dr janet jorgenson the door clicked dart pulled on the handle it opened the guard was twenty yards away they could clearly see each other youve got to think on your feet zeller had once schooled him hes an outside guard dart thought disarm his suspicion dart raised his voice and offered you want me to hold the door for you the guard shook his head no thanks he answered dart stepped inside his armpits soaked his throat dry the elevator was straight ahead a door marked the stairs to his right not wanting to wait for an elevator car and recalling from his earlier trip to roxin that elevators also required security access dart chose to use the stairs the door thumped shut behind him janet jorgenson he complained into the microphone climbing the stairs his new identity had given him a sex change in his left ear he heard the name was immediately above nealys on the list what can i tell you who am i dart asked although it didnt matterhe couldnt very well pose as jorgenson the thing is she explained the way the system worksthe reason nealy would not work back thereyou have to be a certain security clearance to have access to all doors otherwise youre supposed to take a particular door at a certain time of day nealy wasnt being allowed in jorgensons got the run of the placeclearance five she told him who am i dart repeated feeling uneasy about this vice president and deputy director of r and d she said you made me martinsons assistant dart queried angrily security might notify proctor of an unexpected latenight visitif proctor had any sense he had his team on alert proctor was likely to know martinsons nextincommand and it seemed to dart he might question a visit by her at this wee hour of the morning might see darts ruse for what it was it pushed him to hurry this is seatofthepants dartelli she sounded bitter he wondered what haite was thinking as he heard two exlovers argue during a sting he charged up the stairs as quickly as his bad ankle would carry him the lookout atop the phone pole reported the unidentified individual is inspecting the lexus he appears to be using a handheld communications device scanning returned the voice of the dispatcher dart continued up at a run passing the door marked with a large weve intercepted the radio transmission the calm voice of the dispatcher said the individual called in the vehicle registration number and is awaiting callback the sergeant is recommending that you abort operations at once repeat recommending you abort do you copy after a brief hesitation the dispatcher said evacuation plan a as in alpha do you copy plan a called for dart to head on foot toward the erts position where the elite team would help him over the perimeter fence and to safety all this was said not for darts benefit but for that of whoever might be listening in to the unsecured frequency they were using if proctors people were in fact monitoring police radio transmissionssomething haite and dart hoped was happeningthen perhaps darts arrival at roxin would act as an invitation im on the third floor dart announced are you listening he wondered a blue rectangle a yellow triangle and green circle he announced to ginny blue yellow green she repeated box triangle circle stand by this office door like every other housed an id reader to the right of the jamb the cryptic code on the doors was playing to roxins advantage ginny had to locate the specific door in the database he waited impatiently finally he heard her say try it dart pushed down on the door lever and the locked door came open got it he said brightly im in access to the office was certain to show on the security screens in the lobby ginny had been schooled not to attempt to shield darts activities from these screens although it risked darts getting caught it also allowed security to inform proctor or other superiors of darts movementssomething critical to the sting working the clock was now running and the trap set the cheese was there for the taking dart slipped into a chair in front of a computer monitor where a screen saver drew geometric patterns on the screen he tapped the shift key and the screen saver vanished replaced by dozens of computer software icons im at a terminal dart announced softly well done people haite said for the benefit of anyone eavesdropping joe dart was online if dart was right about martinsons scientific ego then she had stored copies of the earlier clinical trial reports somewhere in the mainframes memory and only martinson herself could retrieve them ginny could not gain entrance to the passwordprotected file without the cooperation of martinson herself by am under the authority of a wire surveillance warrant martinsons two unpublished home phone lines were being monitored under separate warrant terry proctors residential lines were under tapandtrace surveillance forbidding recording but allowing the identification of phone numbers coming and going over the lines since the inception of the surveillance no traffic had been reported at martinsons records would later show that proctors lines had been incredibly active that night im logged on dart announced for ginnys benefit his hope was that if not immediately within minutes this radio traffic would be overheard by proctors people and passed up to both proctor and martinson dart therefore had to slip up making believable mistakes as he went the lexusa car not registered to any roxin employeewas part of that fiction use of the police radio frequenciesimpossible to scramble with so many participants involvedwas also part of the ruse proctor had to be led to believe that dart was close to uncovering martinsons files but so what dart doubted that terry proctor was aware of the existence of any such evidence it seemed likely that once zeller had blown open martinstons scam proctor would have advised her to destroy all evidencehe would have accepted martinsons word that she had done so only martinsonand intuitively dartknew the truth no way would she destroy eleven years of research dart would have to enlighten proctor without it seeming intentional and to sting him into panicking martinson to finally destroy the evidence she held so dearly by necessity ginny was also part of the ruse manipulating and monitoring and preparing to trap martinson most important was that dart not allow himself to be discovered or abducted before completing the sting to be caught was to fail logged on and awaiting instructions dart repeated okay dart ginny said heres what i want you to do keystroke by keystroke ginny navigated dart flawlessly through a hole in the upperlevel security firewall that she herself had run only an hour earlier the roxin laboratories rox net logo in gold and silver sparkled on the screen followed by a greeting and a cautionary nondisclosure statement warning of fbi investigation im in dart acknowledged enter the following ginny instructed rambling off a series of entries for dart to duplicate he began typing furiously nervous he made several mistakes and had to start again hold it ginny said anxiously now not having to playact im seeing some movement within the facility the lookout said i copy that lights have come on in the box i think theyre on to you joe ginny said her voice gripped in fear dart took the news two different ways if they were coming after him then they knew he had broken into their computer and they knew where to find himall of which was good because terry proctor was certain to be notified but he could not allow himself to be caught im moving dart announced dart left the room in a hurry his sole mission for the next five to ten minutes to distance himself from security while maintaining the possibility of computer access roxins security computers were capable of tracking access on an officebyoffice basis the moment dart had entered the office the computer had registered that access and alerted the guards similarly every time a security guard used his pass to enter a hallway or an elevator ginny knew about it the result was a kind of electronic catandmouseeach side able to monitor the others movement had ginny been given days or weeks to override the security systems she might have been capable of misleading security by creating false electronic clues for darts whereabouts thus giving him the advantage but as it was she was lucky to be able to monitor movements at all and dart was forced to keep on the move working against the security team was the facilitys allglass design for each time a hallway or office light went on the lookout saw this and warned dart of his pursuers location as he ran into the hall dart heard the lookout warn es ascending repeat eaglesam ascending copy eaglesam copy dart replied already running down the hall in a northerly direction for communications purposes they had designated the structures four imposing elevator hubs east and west south and north eastsouth was the elevator bank nearest the parked car dart turned around and ran to the stairs adjacent to elevators en and descended to the second floor the complexity of the layout worked against dart and in the favor of those who pursued him he was a rat in a maze and the keepers knew the way armed keepers at that dart bounded down pausing occasionally for the telltale sounds of anyone approaching with a running dialogue in his ear as the lookout and ginny both advised him of securitys location at am eastern standard time november dr arielle martinson was recorded as logging onto rox net from a remote terminal in west hartford ginny was right there with her using a landlink telephone line that connected her to the common van via the only scrambled radio frequency available to hpd she announced cryptically the fish is on the line just as she had been told to access password she spelled is leanmont ginny studied martinsons online movement as her second laptop computer patched into the highspeed data line by the snet worker down the manhole outside the governors mansion recorded martinsons every keystroke ginny divided her attention between the one laptop monitoring security and the other monitoring martinson rox nets central interface utilized both graphics and menus allowing the user to click through desired addresses and functions martinson was clearly no stranger to the network she moved quickly and flawlessly often clicking her choice so fast that ginny had no time to read or make note of it though her laptop did record it martinsons first choice selected from the welcoming menu was for other services ginny missed the names of the next two selections because of martinsons speed but she caught the heading daily diary because it required a password martinson typed in eqtz and ginny wrote this down despite the fact that the laptop continued to capture it all the ceo chose options next followed by set date function and ginny took note of it all because martinson had to slow down to enter a date june ginny followed her with a computer hackers admiration she had expected her to have used the networks personal file area a section devoted to an individual users personal storage it was the logical location to upload information into the server as a rule network software restricted user storage to such limited areas and only such areas allowing the system operator to predict control secure and maintain a specified amount of storage martinson had cleverly found another location that would allow the uploading of files one that through a series of passwords and now a date function installed several secure gates in place effectively locking the information away so that she and only she could access it a colorful calendar filled ginnys screen with the date june highlighted in a small box there was a todo list complete with preferences a timeofday work space for appointments and calls a small spreadsheet to track cash and credit card expenses the calendar work space was left blanka particularly clever move even if a hacker sleuthed the several passwords needed to reach this location even if the hacker then arbitrarily landed ahead on june in the year there was nothing to see nothing that announced the prized information hidden within nothing but a single asterisk at the very bottom of the screen in a box marked memo martinson clicked on memo an information box presented itself in the middle of the screen restricted by password please enter digit alphanumeric string ginny looked on as martinson typed laterin the letters meant nothing to her the screen filled with the first page of a technical report ginny was momentarily distracted by the contents of this page it had something to do with drug testing ive got it she spoke into the phone but martinson caught her offguard by suddenly selecting edit delete the screen responded memo is pages delete contents yesno martinson moved too quickly before ginny could notify the snet workman to interrupt the transmission martinson sent the necessary y down the highspeed transmission line into the phone ginny shouted disconnect but the screen suddenly read deleting contents is unrecoverable are you sure yes no this final protection device saved them disconnect ginny shouted again but the blinking cursor frozen in its position on the screen told her that the snet man had done his job martinson was disconnected ready ginny informed dart although able to access the systems security functions by modema necessity to allow people like proctor to monitor functions from the fieldginny had no modem access to this userarea side of the roxin network access was restricted to actual terminal nodes to prevent the kind of hacking that ginny had in mind where the snet man had managed to hardwire ginny the ability to monitor martinsons line she lacked the necessary software cryptography to manipulate data that job was up to dartelli dart reached the second floor at the same time that the security guards pursuing him charged into the third floor office where he had been working he told ginny the color code on the door that he was facing and a moment later when the small indicator light turned from red to green he opened this door and entered a glassedin area behind the wall of glass and a stainless steel entrance purification chamber he saw a cleanroom lab with no computer terminal the idea of breaking into a genetics lab did not thrill dart he turned around and hurried out seeking another office the next door down was marked with a blue box a yellow box and two red circles ginny believing she was getting the hang of things said youre in dart tried the door it was locked the bluegreen characters marched across the reader access deniedplease contact security thank you no good he announced try again she advised same thing shit she said theyve locked me out were screwed the computers security program had identified ginnys raid and blocked her access dart stood there in the darkened corridor his heart pounding in his chest wondering what to do he couldnt think clearly it was as if all at once his mind went blank es descending by stairs en descending by stairs warned the lookout suddenly eaglenova descending eaglesam descending do you copy the security team pursuing him had split up coming toward him from both directions leaving dart sandwiched trapped by ginnys attempting to gain him access the computer had once again identified his location how many guards on the night watch dart wondered one at the front security desk one at the thirdfloor security desk two possibly four roamers four to six total he decided if that number held he guessed that the team sent to bring him in would be no larger than a pairleave one man by the car one to roam the west side of the building and send two after him dart glanced back at the reader access deniedplease contact security approaching the second floor the lookout reported in an attempt to divide and conquer the pair had split each taking one of the stairways no doubt the computers had been used to shut down the elevators in an attempt to bracket dart into being caught lookout how many in each stairway his feet began to carry him toward the south stairs the closest to him the plan formulated quickly in his mind a security guard will carry a master key a card allowing him access to the various rooms one each returned the steady voice perfect dart thought arriving second floor the lookout warned dart was on the second floor the door to the fire stairs was ten feet away five his only hope was surprise a rentacop in pursuit would be excited and probably poorly trained he would be thinking that his target was attempting to run away and hide he would be in a hurry a wedge of yellow light arced across the hallway floor as the guard opened the door to the stairs this wedge spread open like a fan unfolding illuminating the far wall a boot and a dark pant leg stepped through the guard had gotten ahead of dart by a fraction of a second the other guard at the far end of the hall could not be far off dart threw himself to the floor diving for that leg as if it were home plate he hooked his left arm out and snagged the leg as he slid past pulling the stunned guard with him the man went down looking as if hed hit a banana peel all limbs in the air at once a whoosh of air was expelled from his lungs dart scrambled atop him grabbed him by the hair and snapped the mans head down firmly against the hard floor the sound of the contact instantly made dart nauseated the guard groaned sickeningly hes alive thank god dart thought as he reached down and ripped the mans creditcardsize pass from where it was clipped to his pocket dart flipped it over establishing that it did in fact carry a magnetic stripe he had one shot he realized after that they would block use of this card as well hold it stay where you are roared a voice from the far end of the hall dart came to his feet and charged through the door and into the stairway down or up he debated his legs carried him up behind him in the hallway he heard the fastpaced running of the guard coming in hot pursuit in his left ear he heard ginny we gotta get this happening dart were running out of time and i mean fast dart ran all the way up to the top of the stairs and through to the hall attempting to slow down his thoughts and concentrate his adrenaline was his biggest enemy using the guards card to enter a room would alert security to his location and would in turn limit his chance to do what had to be done it gave him an idea he slid the stolen card into the first security box he encountered the light turned green dart spun the doorknob threw the door open and then quickly pulled it shut he ran to the next security box the next door and followed the same procedure and the next one eye trained nervously on the fire stairs through which he had just come he crossed the hall and used the card on two more offices blocking the first with a pen to keep it from closing the security computer would now show six offices accessed backtracking dart entered through the door that he had blocked by the pen he could hear the security mans footfalls charging up the fire stairs he had only a few seconds with the door open he shoved his stolen card into the reader and began violently rocking the card back and forth the sound of the feet stopped dart guessing the guard was standing immediately on the other side but was being more cautious than his partner below dart continued to wiggle the security card it cracked along the left edge with one tremendous effort dart tore the card straight across leaving a significant piece of it down inside the reader to prevent another card from being inserted he pushed the door firmly shut just as he heard the fire stairs door whine open the guard was on the sixth floor with him dart slipped into the first chair that fronted a terminal he touched the space bar and the screen saver cleared go he said to ginny a voice interrupted and instructed the tigers in the garden terry proctor had arrived dart felt a chill run through him right into his bowels it was a huge risk for proctor to come here in person illustrating to dart just how desperate the man was dart pulled out the cellular hoping for privacygetting off the police frequencypushed recall and send and a moment later ginny answered weve got less than two minutes now listen carefully level by level ginny steered dart through the proper key combinations and necessary passwords to ensure that dart was on track ginny kept repeating anxiously whats the title line whats the title line dart would read the uppermost title and await the next instruction out in the hallway dart heard the security guard open a door and then silence hell have to search every office dart thought realizing he had bought himself some time he could picture the operation continuing outside proctors arrival had triggered a third phase independent of dart the lookout confirmed that proctor had entered the ert team dressed all in black was presently scaling the walls of the compound on their way to sealing the buildings exits proctor would be trapped this changed the dynamicsthere was no predicting the behavior of a cornered animal are you listening an almost hysterical ginny asked she said laterin did you get that dart typed it in and hit the enter key the cover page of the clinical trial appeared on his screen dart felt a huge wash of relief it was dated fourteen months earlier the file is seventysix pages long ginny told him he heard a banging behindthe security guard was at his door im not going to get out of here with this disk dart informed her realizing his situation he had a disk in his pocket on which he was supposed to record the information that seemed impossible now after a long beat of silence he asked are you there in his left ear he heard the dispatcher in the command van announce the garden is surrounded the ert team was in place the security guards deep voice attempted to whisper a radioed request but dart overheard it through the door i need a master key asap third floor okay ginny said into the cellular heres what were going to do a fraction of a second later she snapped oh shit hang on youve got visitors glancing toward the door and knowing that the security guard was coming through it any second dart said i cant hang on theres no time mark the complete text ill get back to you ginny dart shouted into the phone there was no answer ginnys second laptop alerted him the moment martinsons password was used to log on to the system many of the commonly used security softwares prevented the duplication of a password if one person was presently on the system ginny had hoped that was the casethat by dart already being on the network martinson or whomever martinson had called would be denied access to her horror the system allowed this other person access onto the network dart guessed that this person was terry proctor and that he might even be in the lobby now following martinsons instructions to erase the files ginny felt helpless the screen followed the intruders every move he traveled past the main menu and along the route ginny now knew only too well in a matter of thirty to sixty seconds the intruder would be on top of dart how the system would perform was anybodys guess ginnys guess was that it would freeze locking up and that only the system operator would be able to correct it and the sysop worked for martinson which meant the files would never be seen again dart couldnt copy the text to a disk because the disk might be confiscated by the security guards and destroyed it left ginny only one choice using a modem line she was going to have to attempt to raid the systems security firewall a second time attempting to avoid her earlier mistake she picked up the phone and said to dart is the text marked im ready dart said into the phone he heard the sound of someone running the master keya real key not some security cardwas seconds away from being delivered ginny said go to the edit menu select cut cut dart barked you mean copy i said cut detective do it now but ill lose the file dart protested edit cut ginny ordered do it now ginnys eyes widened as she followed the activity on the second laptop she watched as proctor typed lat this is not up for discussion do it fucking now darts index finger hesitated above the button on the computers mouse he felt a bead of sweat trickle down his jaw he heard the key in the door and then he heard that same key turn cut would make the blocked text disappear does she know what shes doing now he heard repeated in his ear his index finger punched the button automatically and the seventysix pages of clinical trial reports disappeared from the screen thank god ginny said through the phone now she added if you want to see those files again theres something youve got to do not right now dart interrupted dropping the cellular phone and springing out of the office chair and dragging it to the door just as the doorknob turned dart blocked the door with his foot flipped the chair upside down wheels in the air and wedged it inside the handle to prevent the door from opening he glanced up at the ceiling large rectangular panes suspended by an angleiron aluminum frame it offered one possibility of escape the door came partially open encountering the chair the guards on the other side leaned their weight into it the sound was deafening a bead of sweat slipped into darts eyes stinging him dart considered going out the window the golfballlike architecture crowned at the top of each module being on the top floor this offices windowpanes were more parallel to the ground than those of the floors below and would be easier to climb dart was not one for heights but it seemed to offer him the fastest exit he took two steps toward the window and reached it before identifying the hollow thump underfoot he stooped to inspect the source of that sound behind him the office chair slipped the door popped open two or three inches and several fingers appeared in the crack groping to remove the chair dart flung himself across the room drove his shoulder into the door and broke all four of the mans fingers an animal cry erupted from the far side of the door dart hiked the chair back into position and leaped over to the windows along the offices perimeter a series of floor panels covered spaces created to house phone lines transmission lines computer cables and electrical conduit to allow easy access the office carpet had not been glued here and dart pulled it back he yanked up the firstfloor panel and found himself staring down into a darkened dead space through a tangle of wires three feet below him was the suspended acoustical tile of a fifthflooroffice ceiling steel ibeams supported the floor of the office dart was currently inside he didnt hesitate he sat down forced his toes through the mesh of wires and lowered himself down the door banged and the chair slipped again dart kicked at the pressboard panel beneath him broke it in pieces and could see through to a desktop in the office below he let go his purchase and fell through the dead space and down into the office below landing awkwardly on the desk driving a sharp pain into his injured ankle he heard the chair explode above him they were inside dart jumped off the desk ignoring his pain and ran for the door a moment later he was running quickly toward the fire stairs hoping he had enough of a lead that sounded ugly the voice said in his left ear patch me through to ginny dart said ive lost the phone like it or not proctors people would now hear every word on ginnys instructions dart headed for the bottom of the stairs as dart ran she talked nonstop ginnys detected raid on the roxin server had triggered the mainframe to adopt a defensive position eliminating an outsiders ability to access the machine through modem and pulling the system temporarily offline the situation could be reversed but only from the sysop terminal inside roxins data processing center which ginny guessed was likely to be located on the facilitys basement level how can you possibly be sure about this dart questioned on the run there are three different systems they could be using and i know every one of them they all share the ability to take modem communications offline by definition they cannot be put back online using software they require someone to throw a physical switcha button its what keeps them secure the front panels are all basically the same some system indicators and either one or two buttons i know the way this works joe this is my area of expertise ginny reminded youre going to have to trust me and listen joe once were back online i need a couple minutes minimum what am i looking for he asked it will be a plain vanilla boxmaybe a stack of them depending how many incoming lines there are if theres more than one youll have to trip each master the front panel will show a series of seven small lights across it red probably in all likelihood only the farthest righthand light will be lit on the far righthand side of the box itself will be a vertical stack of red lightsone for each incoming linethese are actually buttons not lights below these lights she emphasized there is another button off by itself then editing herself she said on two of the machines it is below on the black box model it is above but it will either read master or group online or all master group online or all he repeated yes and that is the one you want one or more of those masters is going to be red when you push it it will change to green or amber at that point were back online she asked is that enough of a description sounds good you can describe things to me and ask once youre there i missed that last bit dart said finally arriving at the bottom of the stairs ginny repeated herself okay dart said cowering from the time pressure im on the basement level what room am i looking for data processing ginny replied dart reevaluated his situation there were at the very minimum three guards after him proctor and anyone accompanying him had to be thrown into the mix that made four or more after him they had lost track of him with proctor running things dart felt certain they would do the smart thing conduct a floorbyfloor search at the same time at least one guard would watch the computer monitoring the system to see if dart attempted to use a security card to gain access anywhere this person would guide the search team the voice of the lookout scratched into darts ear like fingernails down a blackboard theyre taking their time but theyre working their way down im showing them at the second floor by going to the basement level he had in all likelihood trapped himself he ran down the hall where instead of the cryptic color system the doors actually carried titles several were marked service personnel only another read food services he passed two bathrooms something marked high voltage do not enter dart turned right down a long corridor the basement was a rabbit warren he passed a door marked technical services ginny he said into the air right here she spoke into his ear im looking at technical services havent seen anything like data processing basement level right security you bet dart confirmed wondering how he could get inside check the crack below the door ginny advised the gap at the bottom of the door cold air sinks he said the computer room will be real cold dart dropped to his knees and poked his fingers through you got it real cold lets give it a try she said dart stood back up his knees killing him he stared at the door in confusion it was a heavy steel door and it was locked he pulled his gun out of his holster it was all he could think of whatever you do ginny said as if standing there dont break that door down i have to dart replied you cant same reason we cant have your bad boys breaking in she said referring to the ert team that kind of illegal access will cause the mainframe to suspend the only person able to undo that is the sysop himself shit dart replied he glanced up acoustic panels hold on dart said you need a security card ginny advised its the only way trust me maybe not dart corrected heading back down the hallway toward the bathrooms that he had passed the lookout interrupted and said theyre descending fire stairs north and south approaching level one dart pushed into the mens room and flicked on the light he glanced up acoustical panels hung in a suspended frame he ran back into the hallway down to the intersection of the other corridor and made a mental note of distance and angle he returned to the bathroom pulled himself up onto the sinks countertop and pushed up on the panel it moved out of his way im going for it dart announced going for what well see securing a handhold on a pipe within the area above the suspended ceiling dart hooked a foot over the stall partition and pulled himself up and through the dead space occupied an area about four feet highabove dart was the support structure for the first floor below the suspended ceiling through which he had just entered the area was claustrophobic and vast hallway ceiling fixtures threw enough light around for dart to see a series of black plastic plumbing pipes and heavy steel sprinkler pipes that were suspended from the overhead ibeams he took the time to replace the acoustic panel he had come through to hide the way he had come he hoped the security team would pass up the mens room and continue their search elsewhere on another level the flimsy false ceiling supported by strands of twisted wire was not strong enough to hold him dart flat on his stomach distributed his weight between a plumbing pipe where he hooked his left leg and a fire sprinkler holding his right his fingers groping for purchase on the overhead ibeams if he slipped and fell he would crash down into whatever room and unseen hazards lay below the parallel pipes were his only support and he had to stay with them despite the fact that they appeared to follow the direction of the hallwayeast westrather than the angle that dart had projected to reach the computer room he crawled carefully all the while attempting to maintain his bearings the pipes and conduit were suspended by metal plumbers tape and lengths of wire requiring dart to pause and navigate around them reaching around each obstruction taking hold of one pipe and shifting his weight onto the opposing one dart suddenly realized he heard only static in his left ear either the radio had gone dead or the combination of the sublevel basement and the abundance of metal was causing interference if he wasnt hearing them then they werent hearing him he had to hurry if the command van lost track of him for too long they would order the ert team to hit the building and according to ginny such unauthorized entry would shut down the mainframe rendering it inaccessible the files lost a series of lights came on immediately to darts left blinding him at the same time he heard the frantic footfalls of people running immediately below himclose enough to touch dart remained still as two men stopped directly beneath him and he recognized the tensionfilled voice of terry proctor doesnt make sense proctor said out of breath maybe he can get inside the rooms without the system knowing it the man with him suggested there was a long pause dart could feel proctor thinking putting himself in darts position proctor said we stay with the plan all rooms that arent secure get a thorough search dart heard the men separate the guard said to proctor where are you going theres nothing down that way i need to do something proctor said just do your fucking job he chastised rentacops dart thought with equal disdain as far as joe could tell the guard headed back down toward the bathrooms while proctor hurried up the corridor the noise level in the tight space was amazing despite their name the acoustic panels did little to muffle any of the sounds when the guard entered the mens room twenty feet behind dart every sound could be heard the man stopped to urinate and dart could hear him work his zipper fly he banged the stall door open a moment later he was inspecting the womens room not long after dart heard the clatter of brooms and mops and knew the guard was in a custodial closet the detective used the cover of this noise to continue with the hallway lights ablaze he could see throughout the tight crawl space and he plotted which pairs of pipes might support him en route to the computer room just guard it he heard proctor say somewhere off ahead of him im good at finding people a deep voice replied this is a waste of my talents listen alverez if you had any talent we wouldnt be here proctor objected you gonna insult me the man objected and i wont do the business for you do not fuck with me get in there and stay there if and when we need your talents ill send someone for you he wont talk and he wont walk the other man said i owe this fucker dart felt a chill pass through him alverez the man zeller had wanted to avoid was guarding the computer room alverez continued make it look like he took a tumble down some stairs no problem down rambo proctor said disparagingly just guard the fucking room aint no problem and you dont leave for any reason proctor added dart heard a door open and thump shut it seemed twenty to thirty feet to his right the computer room he studied the pipes to see how to make it over there then he plotted a course straight ahead ten feet that connected with a single sprinkler pipe he would use to take him over the room minutes later he crossed over to that single pipe he put his butt on it his feet out in front of him hands overhead on an ibeam and lying back scooted himself forward a few inches at a time alverez he was thinking hearing zellers voice a guy hired to break my knees without thought dart automatically reached down to pat the weapon that haite had issued him to make sure it was still there in the process he lost his balance his left hand slipping off the ibeam he reached out instinctively to block his fall and punched his right hand through an acoustical panel as his left hand saved him he froze dangling billy he heard a voice call out hey billy that you footsteps coming toward him dart was looking down onto a set of plastic recycling bins just on the other side of the wall from the corridor he gently fingered the broken piece of panel that hung like a flap and drew it back up silently partially patching his error the footsteps went past him billy the voice called out again growing more distant he heard a walkietalkie belch as this man complained whoevers up on one is making too much fucking noise keep it down up there a second later a heavy door thumped shut and dart imagined that this man had left the basement for good dart wondered or to get some backup he pulled himself back up and continued down the pipe his butt sore his fingers cramping each of the iron clamps and supports that hung the sprinkler system from the ibeams presented dart with an obstacle around which he had to maneuver five minutes later he was directly over the computer room the only sounds the scraping shoes of alverez as he paced a bulldog confined to his pen all at once the space went dark againthe basement hallway lights had timed out and had turned themselves off the only light came in cones and shafts as it escaped the computer room below from holes created to carry conduit and computer and telephone cables dart allowed time for his eyes to adjust and then edged forward toward the nearest peephole the pipe shifted in a way that dart had not experienced a subtle movement that he didnt understand until he heard a regular ticking sound he sourced that sound and discovered a leak directly beneath hima pipe joint had failed under his weight the sprinkler water dripped like the ticking of a clock in a moment it would seep through the panel and begin dripping into the room where alverez paced dart reached down and ran his hand along the underside of the pipe smearing the leaking water and briefly stopping the drip with his hand still on the pipe he craned himself down to get a look through the peephole the escaping light flooding his face it was no use he couldnt control the leak drip drip drip it started up again through the hole in the ceiling panel he could make out a pair of large boxes the size of small refrigerators and the corner edge of a desk directly below him was vinyl tile flooring as he was peering down through the hole he saw the first drop of water like a small jewel cascade from the ceiling to the floor where it exploded another and another dart worked his hand on the pipe furiously to try to stop it but the break was worse the flow greater the cold water seeped through his fingers and down to the room below ironically alverez came over to inspect the leak it was as if dart had issued the man an invitation and in a heartbeat dart understood what had to happen there was no time to plan to organize to waste zeller would have called this a hot spotan instant in time that demands reaction not thought or consideration one of those opportunities that comes around only once and to think about it is to lose it alverez stepped beneath the leak joe dart let go his grip and jumped chapter alverez looked up toward the ceiling dart understood intuitively that this moment of surprise was and would be his only advantage over an ape like this he anticipated his landing the gun coming out of the holster and firing into the mans legs if necessary he landed on his bad ankle the room swirled in a thick blue haze as nausea erupted inside him he lost his balance and went down onto his back alverez stood there fighting to get pieces of acoustical tile out of his eyes dart glanced over and saw a bank of computer equipment he searched for the gear that ginny had described plain vanillia box he didnt see what she had described to him a good deal of the equipment was down an aisle behind the bank of keyboards between dart and that aisle stood alverez dart dared not use his gun for that would alert proctorif his fall through the ceiling had not already done soand more important bring the ert team through the door locking up the computer alverez was big and stocky and yet lightning quick he attacked dart as a boxer would cagey and shifting side to side light on his feet ready to tangle enjoying this dart came to his feet woozy despite his reasoning he reached for his gun and brought it out aimed at the mans huge thighs better make it count the man said grinning cause im going to take it away from you he faked to his rightdart pivoting to followand then cut left so quickly that dart never saw him coming one second dart was holding the gun not wanting to fire it the next the weapon was skidding across the vinyl floor and darts wrist felt extremely hot and limp alverez bodypunched dart low and on the side below the ribs stinging a kidney and buckling the detective over in agony dart swung his bad foot wildly and connected the instep with the side of alverezs knee as if pushing a door shut he heard something snap and the thugs eyes went wide and dart kicked the same spot again and alverez leaned away like a tree from the wind and then he grimaced showing off his brown ugly teeth like a mean dog his arms were apelike unexpectedly long for such a compact body he punched out at dart ramming a ball of hard knuckles into the center of his chest stunning his diaphragm and stealing his breath dart staggered back and smacked into a desk knowing instantly that to allow himself to be pinned by a gorilla like alverez was the endthe man would pick him to pieces breaking bones and taking him apart like a turkey carcass after the feast darts right hand wouldnt respondit flapped at the end of his arm like a rag he couldnt feel it at all his left landed painfully on something cool and hard and dart seized it and lashed out at alverez who preparing to step closer and finish dart mistakenly anticipated darts attempt to come from his right the detective smashed the stapler into the mans jaw like a set of brass knuckles breaking the joint and leaving the man looking like a halloween mask his jaw grotesquely distorted buying himself a moment dart flung himself off the desk and hobbled awkwardly around the bank of keyboards and monitors and down the aisle there not ten feet away its red lights flashing was the exact box that ginny had described a couple of minutes he remembered ginny saying fat chance dart thought wondering if he could even buy himself thirty seconds he placed his weight onto his bad ankle fell down and reached out with his broken wrist crying out loudly with the impact they heard that he thought alverez spun around his broken jaw preventing any perverse grin his nose bleeding profusely his eyes damp and seething with fury dart had never seen that look but it had been described dozens of times and it registered into his core that alverez would either kill him or change him forever this was a hot spot a defining moment alverez charged like a wrecking ballbut the wrecking ball owned a switchblade the knife sank into darts left shoulder alverez removed it just as quickly with a sickening sucking sound and lowered it again but dart rolled hard the switchblade punched the floor broke the springed hinge and folded up on the mans fingers slicing all four to the bone alverez roared released the knife and had to shake his hand to break the blade from its grip blood flew like water from a hose dart lunged for the communications box a vertical row of red lights the button marked master was at the bottom of the device alverez growled dart punched the red button and it immediately changed to green the system was online alverez crawled across the floor the gun dart realized as alverez reached for it dart kicked out and caught the mans jaw with the toe of his shoe a loud crack filled the room like a gunshot and alverez slumped to the floor his wounded hand bleeding badly he was down but not finished dart rolled painfully to his left the button remained green perhaps twenty seconds had passed it felt to dart like half an hour he fished for his handcuffs and got one end around the wrist of alverezs bleeding hand and dragging the man across the floor the other to the foot of a giant piece of computer machinery dart heard the chaos out in the hall reacting to it before he gave it any thought he dove for the bloody gun and took hold of it just as the door swung open freeze one of the three uniformed guards shouted excitedly training a weapon on dart dart lying on his back held his weapon with his left hand aiming toward the man but knowing he couldnt hit the broad side of a barn police dart said attempting authority the look of surprise that swept over the mans face convinced dart that they had no idea who he was his only hope now was to separate proctor from his own employees bullshit the guard snapped checking furtively over his shoulder drop the fucking piece rentacops were notorious for shooting widows and dogs and children they had no excuse to carry loaded weapons with so little training dart didnt like that barrel being aimed at him one minute he estimated he needed to stall for several more he felt only a swelling pain in his right hand you shoot a cop and youre dead the building is surrounded what a fucking windbag the blond man said he looked about twentyone he too held a weapon on dart i say we tap him right here no came a recognizable voice from behind youre in a bad situation here officer dartelli proctor said confirming to his subordinates that dart was in fact a cop it struck dart as a curious move dont do anything stupid anything well all regret proctor showed himself then stepping past his uniformed guards his hands in the air im unarmed and defenseless he took another tentative step forward are you going to shoot me his eyes wandered over darts shoulder and he gave away that he had spotted the green button he knew more about the computer system than dart would have given him credit for back dart challenged waving the barrel of the weapon slightly two minutes he thought are you really going to shoot me proctor asked hands still out away from his body his forehead was beaded with sweat his suit pitted below the arms dart felt a dizzying drain to his system as he paled and felt cold his shoulder was losing blood badly im not armed the man reminded he smiled as if to calm dart he kept walking sliding one foot tentatively ahead of the other he wasnt interested in reaching dart he wanted the mainframe darts dulled mind could barely think the man took another step forward and dart said overly loudly yes i copy into the room the words startled proctor who stopped in his tracks his eyes swept over dart looking but not finding the microphone video and audio dart lied unsure if either was working any longer he watched as the color drained from the mans face anything that youd like to say to the command van if that were true proctor said taking another step forward they would have long since come to your help nice try dart couldnt tell him why they couldnt come so instead he said i havent given them the signal i dont think so proctor said taking yet another step dont dart warned put the gun down the unsteady guard cautioned his arms were tiring from holding the weapon dart noted his aim would be off because of this three minutes how much longer all the lights failed at once leaving only the computers tiny lights ablaze dart saw a white flash as the guard fired and missed through ringing ears he heard the unmistakable sound of glass breaking and metal ripping as the ert team set off explosive charges at five entrances theyve ruined it he thought angry that haite had authorized the raid knowing as he did that this would jeopardize their evidence not knowing where the strength or reserve came from dart lunged in the dark to block proctor from reaching the computer every muscle every tendon screaming he collided with the man and went down hard just as the first glow of the emergency lighting seeped into the room from the wall sconces proctor pushed away hard and struggled to his feet dart raised the weapon and slipped his finger inside the trigger guard the blond security man trained his weapon on dart there was a loud pop that occurred just before dart went blind with pain his face seemed to explode at the same time as his ears failed him and he wailed into the room along with the others he screamed for zeller and lost friends for his mother and lost souls consumed by an overpowering white light and deprived of his hearing he folded into a ball and fell away from the world as would a man thrown from a cliff weightless and sublime chapter a dusty image of haite loomed above dart wearing a look of concern and dart wondered why his first experience of death should be an image of his former sergeant a man with whom he had never been particularly close he would have preferred an image of abby a conversation with zeller a bronzed and naked body perhaps anything but haite he felt as if he were at sea rocking in a light chop he found the sensation comforting and pleasant can you hear me yet the sergeant asked loudly he remained cloudy a vaporous apparition go away dart said wanting a dream not a nightmare leave me alone stun bombs and phosphorus grenades the sergeant explained in an apologetic voice ert toys he said the rocking dart realized was the stretcher being carried up the stairs by a couple of paramedics with buzz cuts he still couldnt see very well your hearing will come back haite said loudly and then the pain hit a headache like a ton of bricks your head may hurt he heard a voice suggest from behind him no shit said joe dart he blinked away some of the pain and tried to identify which orb was the sergeant he picked the one leaning over him why why after all that did you abort jesus his thoughts trailed off with his voice rage surged through him but without any physical energy to support it it dried up defeated he felt on the verge of tears exhaustion selfpity no no haite said for me you did it to save me youve wrecked me dart said he wanted haite to hurt for this he wanted someone to pay he wanted to be left alone to cry ginny solved it haite said she couldnt download the file as long as it was in the buffer a techies young voice explained from behind him it took dart a moment to identify it as the voice of the command van technician when you cut the text it was captured in ram you had to do this to keep the other person attempting access from deleting the files there it was this chunk of text floating in the computers memorybut in a buffer not on disk not somewhere that ginny could grab it haite said he should rest the techie added excitedly the mainframe was set up to save all buffers to disk in the event of a power failure ginny realized thisrealized the only thing to do at that point was to cut the power they cleared the stairs and dart felt the legs of the stretcher released and suddenly found himself being wheeled the bumps hurt every inch of him later one of the paramedics complained to haite let him rest ignoring him the technician continued the machine itself is protected by a backup power supply so once we cut the juice it dumped its buffers to disk and ginny waiting for it grabbed the file it took her a couple of seconds is all seconds dart thought after that haite said it was all ert wed lost you on the radio we werent happy campers we got the file we got everything haite confirmed ginnys a fucking genius chapter arielle martinson looked much smaller much older in the capers interrogation room even with her highpriced attorney sitting next to her dart was familiar with bernie wormsers reputation but had never faced him wormser had worked hard to arrange the interview elsewhere but there they were in a cramped windowless room with a linoleum floor just the way dart had wanted it dart carried a tape recorder with him his left arm was in a sling he plugged the machine into a wall outlet turned it on and recorded the names of those present the location the date and time martinson appeared restless wormser dead calm as you know dart addressed martinson weve charged you with interfering in a criminal investigation in so much as terrance proctor and therefore proctor securities acted as your agent in this regard there is also the charge of firstdegree murder for the shooting death of walter zeller and attempted murder for the actions taken against myself there are federal charges concerning the rigging of certain clinical trial results you dont know anything martinson said venomously wormser touched her arm lightly she glared at her attorney and as he attempted to speak cut him off no bernie ill dig my own grave thank you just the same i really dont think wormser attempted quiet she said silencing him and burning his face scarlet to dart she said have you ever dealt with a victim of sexual assault detective physical abuse do you have any clue what youre dealing with here do you understand the traumathe permanent damage done to a woman and to boys as wellby such violation do you someone elses body inside yours the sense of helplessness the pain disease someone striking you drooling onto you slobbering onto you arielle wormser chastised oh shut up she roared back at him darts voice cracked as he explained he was shot five times the last of which penetrated his skull just below the left eye and killed him ignoring him she said what if you possessed the knowledge the ability to reduce sexual assaultrapeby ten percent spousal and child abuse by twenty percent sixty percent what if you knew you had that within your grasp and what if the government in all its banality had structured a set of rules so confining so slow so difficult to maneuver through that you came to understand it might be decades before you could bring this technology to market what then do you sit back and wait in this country a woman is beaten every twelve seconds she glanced at her rolex since weve been sitting here over ten women have had a fist raised to them would you wait decades if you were in my shoes dart was flooded with a dozen images of zeller walter zeller discovered your treatment of the documentation for the clinical trials he uncovered proctors tampering with the facts subsequent to that discovery he was pursued his life was threatened day and night for over twelve months interrupting him she said who are you are you listening to what im telling you do you hear what im saying so what if i altered some of the paperwork thats all it waspaperwork arielle i have to interrupt objected wormser shut up bernie youre being paid either way addressing dart she continued would i have put laterin on the market despite lessthanperfect results you bet i would meeting eyes with him she said i will if i get the chance id rather stop fifteen twenty thirty percent of such beasts than stand by and do nothing every twelve seconds dont forget and would i have resorted to such means for the sake of greed no for the sake of science detective for the sake of the victim every new generation of laterin that we developed showed a five to seventeenpercent improvement but theres no way to test it given the rules you cant test laterin on rats or monkeys who are you kidding this is a human aberrationand in large part a genetic defect you know who should be in this room should be here instead of me the fda she nodded you bet thats who should be in this chair not me am i guilty of trying to do something you bet i am and damn proud of it youll go to jail for your actions dart told her but by cooperating nowas mr wormser will tell youspecial consideration will be given your case i dont want your special consideration how many dead womenbeaten wives raped childrenequal one walter zeller you tell me how to fit that into an equation zeller broke the law repeatedly in the end he committed acts of murder you are the murderer dart shouted regretting immediately the outburst he collected himself met eyes with her and said you rigged the data the results of the trials and then tried to and eventually did kill the man who uncovered your deceit you not proctor not his shooter you her mouth moved but no words came out finally she whined this is important work a silence settled over them martinsons chest heaved from the stress dart knew hed broken out in a sweat dart said you cant balance one against the other it doesnt work that way he felt himself softening twentypercent fewer sex offenders was it possible she said you do what you have to detective we all do what we feel we have to ill take my chances she paused glanced at the annoyed wormser and then back to dart you want to know something dont forget that juries are made up of men and women theres not a jury in this country that would convict me for what ive done it was zeller that committed murder not me a desperate man driven by the loss of his wife i was trying to help the men he killed they wanted that helpthat much is documentedwhich is why they participated in the trials she looked over at wormser again martinson had spent her life in control she edged to the front of her seat dart informed the attorney terry proctor is going to testify against your client you might want to keep that in mind stay where you are arielle wormser advised she stood up though feebly she ran a hand down her smooth navy blue suit and meeting eyes with dart said weakly i was trying to help solve a serious social problem condemn me if you will she walked past him and continued out the door dart did nothing to stop her chapter they called you a genius dart told her ginnys favorite walk was a section of the appalachian trail well it shows that at least sometimes cops are right she teased it was awkward for dart walking with his arm in a slinghe hadnt realized how much walking depended on swinging his arms his ankle was good enough for this hike though it occasionally glowed with a twinge of pain she had asked to see him and he was in no mood to deny her once on the trail she found an overlook where an outcropping of rock faced north and they perched there wrapped in their winter coats their breath fogging darts heart pounding the afternoon sun was muted by clouds she said that was fun what we did he thought that she was referring to the raid at roxin but he wasnt sure yeah he could tell when she was nervous by the way she chewed her lip where do you stand with abby she asked not surprising him one bit he had known what this talk would be about why i need to know he wanted to ask why for a second time but thought better of it he said where do i stand or where do we stand is there a we very much so thats part of what i need to know she said shes not going back with her husband if thats what youre asking ultimately it was for the kids that she ever considered itand i think shes pretty clear that if she sacrifices herself for her kids and ends up unhappy then thats maybe harder on the kids than the way it is now and you this isnt easy you know i can make it easier she told him michaelim sure youve heard about michaelhas asked me to move to new hampshire with him im tempted because it offers a chance to start over you know and i can do my computer work from just about anywherei dont need to be in an office it works for me but theres this part of me that is still holding on to usis still thinking that we might try againand i need to put that part away if im going to do this i owe that to michael i cant be leading one life and hoping for another no thats no good he said the wind blew across them whistling in darts ears and singing in the shrubs and treetops the view was a vast sea of gray dart felt gray so she asked i dont want to lose touch he answered it was difficult for him to say and his body ached with it no she looked into the wind and when she looked back at him her eyes were shiny with tears and she gave him a smile that made his heart tight and a lump form in his throat its okay she said one tear escaping down her cheek so much has happened he said yes it has she agreed looking away again she was a strong person and he admired her he wanted to reach over and touch her to show her the compassion he felt but he did not he would not confuse things it was difficult enough as it was im sorry she said into the wind me too they walked a little while longer and somewhere high above a town that he didnt recognize she took his gloved hand in hers and did not let go she held hands with him for the remainder of the walk right until they reached their cars at which point they finally released each others grip she looked into his eyes and said we were good together he nodded he could feel the tears coming from deep within him and he fought to hold them off a good fit she said he nodded again she kissed him once lightly on the lips climbed into her car and was gone chapter it seemed strange to dart that he should know so many people in a graveyard patrolman bernie denton was buried on the west side in a family site the victim of a gang shooting and recipient of a funeral covered on national news a few years earlier there were two plaques among hundreds on a long cement wall erected for those choosing cremation rather than burial walter zellers name was there alongside luckys though luckys avoided the nickname he wasnt sure what he believed about an afterlifebut if there were such a thing zeller was in a tough place the sun had risen and set several dozen times since hed walked out of the hospital a decorated cop and yet he was still joe dart confused lonely restless no charges had been filed against kowalski and although dart had expected him to return to the department the same man there were subtle but discernable differences in his acerbic behaviorsomething had changed news stories had filled the screen for a while the collapse of roxin laboratories and the endless ethical debate that the news of a drug like laterin had caused some were calling dr arielle martinson a saint among them a senator from michigan some others were saying her case would never reach trialthat only proctor and alverez would serve any time for her part martinson had disappeared fueling a bevy of rumorsone being that she had signed on with a french company that had bought several of the genetic patents through the bankruptcy court another that she had committed suicide following in the steps of her test subjects it was all too sensational for dart the world was changing so fastthere was no predicting anything todays fear was tomorrows promise he had no flowers to leave her he had brought her nothing he owed her nothingthat was how he felt about it but he stopped at the foot of her grave anyway because he couldnt pass it up he needed her he needed that connection to the woman who had birthed him to the person however godawful it had been she was down there under the snow and grass and earth and dart felt grateful for that we are all where we belong he thought he felt his throat constrict and he cursed her for maintaining any hold over him any power how dare she his eyes brimmed with tears and he wanted to hate her but he could not he reached down and placed his cast in the snow leaving an unexplained print behind he closed his eyes and he hated her briefly but it passed i forgive you he whispered the tears beginning to fall met with an unsettling silence and the distant sound of the interstates overpass he stood and walked away dragging his face against the shoulder of his coat cursing his weakness he followed his own prints back through the deep snow painfully aware that there were no other prints to follow its okay he thought glancing over at the wall that bore zellers name abby had kept the engine running kept things warm mac slept in the backseat she was driving dart was no good with the cast you all right she asked reaching over and touching his face lightly wiping away one of his tears better answered joe dartelli all right was still a little ways off
