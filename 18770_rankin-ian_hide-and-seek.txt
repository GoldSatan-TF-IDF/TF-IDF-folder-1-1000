ian rankin hide and seek hide he was shrieking now frantic his face drained of all colour she was at the top of the stairs and he stumbled towards her grabbing her by the arms propelling her downstairs with unfocussed force so that she feared they would both fall she cried out ronnie hide from who hide he shrieked again hide theyre coming theyre coming he had pushed her all the way to the front door now shed seen him pretty strung out before but never this bad a fix would help him she knew it would and she knew too that he had the makings upstairs in his bedroom the sweat trickled from his chilled ratstails of hair only two minutes ago the most important decision in her life had been whether or not to dare a trip to the squats seething lavatory but now theyre coming he repeated his voice a whisper now hide ronnie she said youre scaring me he stared at her his eyes seeming almost to recognise her then he looked away again into a distance all of his own the word was a snakelike hiss hide and with that he yanked open the door it was raining outside and she hesitated but then fear took her and she made to cross the threshold but his hand grabbed at her arm pulling her back inside he embraced her his sweat seasalty his body throbbing his mouth was close to her ear his breath hot theyve murdered me he said then with sudden ferocity he pushed her again and this time she was outside and the door was slamming shut leaving him alone in the house alone with himself she stood on the garden path staring at the door trying to decide whether to knock or not it wouldnt make any difference she knew that so instead she started to cry her head slipped forward in a rare show of selfpity and she wept for a full minute before breathing hard three times she turned and walked quickly down the garden path such as it was someone would take her in someone would comfort her and take away the fear and dry her clothes someone always did john rebus stared hard at the dish in front of him oblivious to the conversation around the table the background music the flickering candles he didnt really care about house prices in barnton or the latest delicatessen to be opened in the grassmarket he didnt much want to speak to the other guests a female lecturer to his right a male bookseller to his left about well whatever theyd just been discussing yes it was the perfect dinner party the conversation as tangy as the starter course and he was glad rian had invited him of course he was but the more he stared at the half lobster on his plate the more an unfocussed despair grew within him what had he in common with these people would they laugh if he told the story of the police alsatian and the severed head no they would not they would smile politely then bow their heads towards their plates acknowledging that he was well different from them vegetables john it was rians voice warning him that he was not taking part was not conversing or even looking interested he accepted the large oval dish with a smile but avoided her eyes she was a nice girl quite a stunner in an individual sort of way bright red hair cut short and pageboyish eyes deep striking green lips thin but promising oh yes he liked her he wouldnt have accepted her invitation otherwise he fished about in the dish for a piece of broccoli that wouldnt break into a thousand pieces as he tried to manoeuvre it onto his plate gorgeous food rian said the bookseller and rian smiled accepting the remark her face reddening slightly that was all it took john that was all you had to say to make this girl happy but in his mouth he knew it would come out sounding sarcastic his tone of voice was not something he could suddenly throw off like a piece of clothing it was a part of him nurtured over a course of years so when the lecturer agreed with the bookseller all john rebus did was smile and nod the smile too fixed the nod going on a second or two too long so that they were all looking at him again the piece of broccoli snapped into two neat halves above his plate and splattered onto the tablecloth shite he said knowing as the word escaped his lips that it was not quite appropriate not quite the right word for the occasion well what was he a man or a thesaurus sorry he said couldnt be helped said rian my god her voice was cold it was the perfect end to a perfect weekend hed gone shopping on saturday ostensibly for a suit to wear tonight but had baulked at the prices and bought some books instead one of which was intended as a gift to rian doctor zhivago but then hed decided hed like to read it himself first and so had brought flowers and chocolates instead forgetting her aversion to lilies had he known in the first place and the diet she was in the throes of starting damn and to cap it all hed tried a new church this morning another church of scotland offering not too far from his flat the last one hed tried had seemed unbearably cold promising nothing but sin and repentance but this latest church had been the oppressive opposite all love and joy and what was there to forgive anyway so hed sung the hymns then buggered off leaving the minister with a handshake at the door and a promise of future attendance more wine john this was the bookseller proffering the bottle hed brought himself it wasnt a bad little wine actually but the bookseller had talked about it with such unremitting pride that rebus felt obliged to decline the man frowned but then was cheered to find this refusal left all the more for himself he replenished his glass with vigour cheers he said the conversation returned to how busy edinburgh seemed these days here was something with which rebus could agree this being the end of may the tourists were almost in season but there was more to it than that if anyone had told him five years ago that in people would be emigrating north from the south of england to the lothians hed have laughed out loud now it was fact and a fit topic for the dinner table later much later the couple having departed rebus helped rian with the dishes what was wrong with you she said but all he could think about was the ministers handshake that confident grip which bespoke assurances of an afterlife nothing he said lets leave these till morning rian stared at the kitchen counting the used pots the halfeaten lobster carcasses the wine glasses smudged with grease okay she said what did you have in mind instead he raised his eyebrows slowly then brought them down low over his eyes his lips broadened into a smile which had about it a touch of the leer she became coy why inspector she said is that supposed to be some kind of a clue heres another he said lunging at her hugging her to him his face buried in her neck she squealed clenched fists beating against his back police brutality she gasped help police help yes madam he inquired carrying her by the waist out of the kitchen towards where the bedroom and the end of the weekend waited in shadow late evening at a building site on the outskirts of edinburgh the contract was for the construction of an office development a fifteenfoothigh fence separated the works from the main road the road too was of recent vintage built to help ease traffic congestion around the city built so that commuters could travel easily from their countryside dwellings to jobs in the city centre there were no cars on the road tonight the only sound came from the slow chugchugging of a cement mixer on the site a man was feeding it spadefuls of grey sand and remembering the far distant days when he had laboured on a building site hard graft it had been but honest two other men stood above a deep pit staring down into it should do it one said yes the other agreed they began walking back to the car an ageing purple mercedes he must have some clout i mean to get us the keys to this place to set all this up some clout ours is not to ask questions you know that the man who spoke was the oldest of the three and the only calvinist he opened the car boot inside the body of a frail teenager lay crumpled obviously dead his skin was the colour of pencil shading darkest where the bruises lay what a waste said the calvinist aye the other agreed together they lifted the body from the boot and carried it gently towards the hole it dropped softly to the bottom one leg wedging up against the sticky clay sides a trouser leg slipping to show a naked ankle all right the calvinist said to the cement man cover it and lets get out of here im starving monday for close on a generation no one had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages what a start to the working week the housing estate what he could see of it through the rainlashed windscreen was slowly turning back into the wilderness that had existed here before the builders had moved in many years ago he had no doubt that in the s it like its brethren clustered around edinburgh had seemed the perfect solution to future housing needs and he wondered if the planners ever learned through anything other than hindsight if not then perhaps todays ideal solutions were going to turn out the same way the landscaped areas comprised long grass and an abundance of weeds while childrens tarmacadamed playgrounds had become bombsites shrapnel glass awaiting a tripped knee or stumbling hand most of the terraces boasted boardedup windows ruptured drainpipes pouring out teeming rainwater onto the ground marshy front gardens with broken fences and missing gates he had the idea that on a sunny day the place would seem even more depressing yet nearby a matter of a few hundred yards or so some developer had started building private apartments the hoarding above the site proclaimed this a luxury development and gave its address as muir village rebus wasnt fooled but wondered how many young buyers would be this was pilmuir and always would be this was the dumping ground there was no mistaking the house he wanted two police cars and an ambulance were already there parked next to a burntout ford cortina but even if there hadnt been this sideshow rebus would have known the house yes it had its boardedup windows like its neighbours on either side but it also had an open door opening into the darkness of its interior and on a day like this would any house have its door flung wide open were it not for the corpse inside and the superstitious dread of the living who were incarcerated with it unable to park as close to this door as he would have liked rebus cursed under his breath and pushed open the car door throwing his raincoat over his head as he made to dash through the stiletto shower something fell from his pocket onto the verge scrap paper but he picked it up anyway screwing it into his pocket as he ran the path to the open door was cracked and slick with weeds and he almost slipped and fell but reached the threshold intact shaking the water from him awaiting the welcoming committee a constable put his head around a doorway frowning detective inspector rebus said rebus by way of introduction in here sir ill be there in a minute the head disappeared again and rebus looked around the hall tatters of wallpaper were the only mementoes of what had once been a home there was an overpowering fragrance of damp plaster rotting wood and behind all that a sense of this being more of a cave than a house a crude form of shelter temporary unloved as he moved further into the house passing the bare stairwell darkness embraced him boards had been hammered into all the windowframes shutting out light the intention he supposed had been to shut out squatters but edinburghs army of homeless was too great and too wise they had crept in through the fabric of the place they had made it their den and one of their number had died here the room he entered was surprisingly large but with a low ceiling two constables held thick rubber torches out to illuminate the scene casting moving shadows over the plasterboard walls the effect was of a caravaggio painting a centre of light surrounded by degrees of murkiness two large candles had burnt down to the shapes of fried eggs against the bare floorboards and between them lay the body legs together arms outstretched a cross without the nails naked from the waist up near the body stood a glass jar which had once contained something as innocent as instant coffee but now held a selection of disposable syringes putting the fix into crucifixion rebus thought with a guilty smile the police doctor a gaunt and unhappy creature was kneeling next to the body as though about to offer the last rites a photographer stood by the far wall trying to find a reading on his light meter rebus moved in towards the corpse standing over the doctor give us a torch he said his hand commanding one from the nearest constable he shone this down across the body starting at the bare feet the bedenimed legs a skinny torso ribcage showing through the pallid skin then up to the neck and face mouth open eyes closed sweat looked to have dried on the forehead and in the hair but wait wasnt that moisture around the mouth on the lips a drop of water suddenly fell from nowhere into the open mouth rebus startled expected the man to swallow to lick his parched lips and return to life he did not leak in the roof the doctor explained without looking up from his work rebus shone the torch against the ceiling and saw the damp patch which was the source of the drip unnerving all the same sorry i took so long to get here he said trying to keep his voice level so whats the verdict overdose the doctor said blandly heroin he shook a tiny polythene envelope at rebus the contents of this sachet if im not mistaken theres another full one in his right hand rebus shone his torch towards where a lifeless hand was half clutching a small packet of white powder fair enough he said i thought everyone chased the dragon these days instead of injecting the doctor looked up at him at last thats a very naive view inspector go talk to the royal infirmary theyll tell you how many intravenous abusers there are in edinburgh it probably runs into hundreds thats why were the aids capital of britain aye we take pride in our records dont we heart disease false teeth and now aids the doctor smiled something you might be interested in he said theres bruising on the body not very distinct in this light but its there rebus squatted down and shone the torch over the torso again yes there was bruising all right a lot of bruising mainly to the ribs the doctor continued but also some to the face maybe he fell rebus suggested maybe said the doctor sir this from one of the constables his eyes and voice keen rebus turned to him yes son come and look at this rebus was only too glad of the excuse to move away from the doctor and his patient the constable was leading him to the far wall shining his torch against it as he went suddenly rebus saw why on the wall was a drawing a fivepointed star encompassed by two concentric circles the largest of them some five feet in diameter the whole had been well drawn the lines of the star straight the circles almost exact the rest of the wall was bare what do you think sir asked the constable well its not just your usual graffiti thats for sure witchcraft or astrology a lot of druggies go in for all sorts of mysticism and hoodoo it goes with the territory the candles lets not jump to conclusions son youll never make cid that way tell me why are we all carrying torches because the electrics been cut off right ergo the need for candles if you say so sir i do say so son who found the body i did sir there was a telephone call female anonymous probably one of the other squatters they seem to have cleared out in a hurry so there was nobody else here when you arrived no sir any idea yet who he is rebus nodded the torch towards the corpse no sir and the other houses are all squats too so i doubt well get anything out of them on the contrary if anyone knows the identity of the deceased theyre the very people take your friend and knock on a few doors but be casual make sure they dont think youre about to evict them or anything yes sir the constable seemed dubious about the whole venture for one thing he was sure to get an amount of hassle for another it was still raining hard on you go rebus chided but gently the constable shuffled off collecting his companion on the way rebus approached the photographer youre taking a lot of snaps he said i need to in this light to make sure at least a few come out bit quick off the mark in getting here werent you superintendent watsons orders he wants pictures of any drugsrelated incidents part of his campaign thats a bit gruesome isnt it rebus knew the new chief superintendent had met him full of social awareness and community involvement full of good ideas and lacking only the manpower to implement them rebus had an idea listen while youre here take one or two of that far wall will you no problem thanks rebus turned to the doctor how soon will we know whats in that full packet later on today maybe tomorrow morning at the latest rebus nodded to himself what was his interest maybe it was the dreariness of the day or the atmosphere in this house or the positioning of the body all he knew was that he felt something and if it turned out to be just a damp ache in his bones well fair enough he left the room and made a tour of the rest of the house the real horror was in the bathroom the toilet must have blocked up weeks before a plunger lay on the floor so some cursory attempt had been made to unblock it but to no avail instead the small splattered sink had become a urinal while the bath had become a dumping ground for solids upon which crawled a dozen large and jetblack flies the bath had also become a skip filled with bags of refuse bits of wood rebus didnt stick around pulling the door tight shut behind him he didnt envy the council workmen who would eventually have to come and fight the good fight against all this decay one bedroom was completely empty but the other boasted a sleeping bag damp from the drips coming through the roof some kind of identity had been imposed upon the room by the pinning of pictures to its walls up close he noticed that these were original photographs and that they comprised a sort of portfolio certainly they were well taken even to rebuss untrained eye a few were of edinburgh castle on damp misty days it looked particularly bleak others showed it in bright sunshine it still looked bleak one or two were of a girl age indeterminate she was posing but grinning broadly not taking the event seriously next to the sleeping bag was a binliner half filled with clothes and next to this a small pile of dogeared paperbacks harlan ellison clive barker ramsey campbell science fiction and horror rebus left the books where they were and went back downstairs all finished the photographer said ill get those photos to you tomorrow thanks i also do portrait work by the way a nice family group for the grandparents sons and daughters here ill give you my card rebus accepted the card and pulled his raincoat back on heading out to the car he didnt like photographs especially of himself it wasnt just that he photographed badly no there was more to it than that the sneaking suspicion that photographs really could steal your soul on his way back to the station travelling through the slow midday traffic rebus thought about how a group photograph of his wife his daughter and him might look but no he couldnt visualise it they had grown so far apart ever since rhona had taken samantha to live in london sammy still wrote but rebus himself was slow at responding and she seemed to take umbrage at this writing less and less herself in her last letter she had hoped gill and he were happy he hadnt the courage to tell her that gill templer had left him several months ago telling samantha would have been fine it was the idea of rhonas getting to hear of it that he couldnt stand another notch in his bow of failed relationships gill had taken up with a disc jockey on a local radio station a man whose enthusing voice rebus seemed to hear whenever he entered a shop or a filling station or passed the open window of a tenement block he still saw gill once or twice a week of course at meetings and in the stationhouse as well as at scenes of crimes especially now that he had been elevated to her rank detective inspector john rebus well it had taken long enough hadnt it and it was a long hard case full of personal suffering which had brought the promotion he was sure of that he was sure too that he wouldnt be seeing rian again not after last nights dinner party not after the fairly unsuccessful bout of lovemaking yet another unsuccessful bout it had struck him lying next to rian that her eyes were almost identical to inspector gill templers a surrogate surely he was too old for that getting old john he said to himself certainly he was getting hungry and there was a pub just past the next set of traffic lights what the hell he was entitled to a lunch break the sutherland bar was quiet monday lunchtime being one of the lowest points of the week all money spent and nothing to look forward to and of course as rebus was quickly reminded by the barman the sutherland did not exactly cater for a lunchtime clientele no hot meals he said and no sandwiches a pie then begged rebus anything just to wash down the beer if its food you want theres plenty of cafes around here this particular pub happens to sell beers lagers and spirits were not a chippie what about crisps the barman eyed him for a moment what flavour cheese and onion weve run out well ready salted then no theyre out too the barman had cheered up again well said rebus in growing frustration what in the name of god have you got two flavours curry or egg bacon and tomato egg rebus sighed all right give me a packet of each the barman stooped beneath the counter to find the smallest possible bags past their sellby dates if possible any nuts it was a last desperate hope the barman looked up dry roasted salt and vinegar chilli flavour he said one of each then said rebus resigned to an early death and another half of eightyshillings he was finishing this second drink when the bar door shuddered open and an instantly recognisable figure entered his hand signalling for refreshment before he was even halfway through the door he saw rebus smiled and came to join him on one of the high stools hello john afternoon tony inspector anthony mccall tried to balance his prodigious bulk on the tiny circumference of the bar stool thought better of it and stood instead one shoe on the footrail and both elbows on the freshly wiped surface of the bar he stared hungrily at rebus give us one of your crisps when the packet was offered he pulled out a handful and stuffed them into his mouth where were you this morning then said rebus id to take one of your calls the one at pilmuir ach sorry about that john heavy night last night i had a bit of a hangover this morning a pint of murky beer was placed in front of him hair of the dog he said and took four slow gulps reducing it to a quarter of its former size well id nothing better to do anyway said rebus sipping at his own beer christ those houses down there are a mess though mccall nodded thoughtfully it wasnt always like that john i was born there really well to be exact i was born on the estate that was there before this one it was so bad so they said that they levelled it and built pilmuir instead bloody hell on earth it is now funny you should say that said rebus one of the young uniformed kids thought there might be some kind of occult tiein mccall looked up from his drink there was a blackmagic painting on the wall rebus explained and candles on the floor like a sacrifice mccall offered chuckling my wifes dead keen on all those horror films gets them out of the video library i think she sits watching them all day when im out i suppose it must go on devil worship witchcraft it cant all be in the imagination of the sunday newspaper editors i know how you might find out how the university said mccall rebus frowned disbelieving im serious theyve got some kind of department that studies ghosts and all that sort of thing set up with money from some dead writer mccall shook his head incredible what people will do rebus was nodding i did read about that now you mention it arthur koestlers money wasnt it mccall shrugged arthur daleys more my style he said emptying his glass rebus was studying the pile of paperwork on his desk when the telephone rang di rebus they said you were the man to talk to the voice was young female full of unfocussed suspicion they were probably right what can i do for you miss tracy the voice fell to a whisper on the last syllable of the name she had already been tricked into revealing herself never mind who i am she had become immediately hysterical but calmed just as quickly im phoning about that squat in pilmuir the one where they found the voice trailed off again oh yes rebus sat up and began to take notice was it you who phoned the first time what to tell us that someone had died there yes it was me poor ronnie ronnie being the deceased rebus scribbled the name onto the back of one of the files from his intray beside it he wrote tracy caller yes her voice had broken again near to tears this time can you give me a surname for ronnie no she paused i never knew it im not sure ronnie was even his real name hardly anyone uses their real name tracy id like to talk to you about ronnie we can do it over the telephone but id rather it was face to face dont worry youre not in any trouble but i am thats why i called ronnie told me you see told you what tracy told me hed been murdered the room around rebus seemed suddenly to vanish there was only this disconnected voice the telephone and him he said that to you tracy yes she was crying now sniffing back the unseen tears rebus visualised a frightened little girl just out of school standing in a distant callbox ive got to hide she said at last ronnie said over and over that i should hide shall i bring my car and fetch you just tell me where you are no then tell me how ronnie was killed you know how we found him lying on the floor by the window thats where he was not quite oh yes thats where he was by the window lying wrapped up into a little ball i thought he was just sleeping but when i touched his arm he was cold i went to find charlie but hed gone so i just panicked you say ronnie was lying in a ball rebus had begun to draw pencilled circles on the back of the file yes and this was in the living room she seemed confused what no not in the living room he was upstairs in his bedroom i see rebus kept on drawing effortless circles he was trying to imagine ronnie dying but not really dead crawling downstairs after tracy had fled ending up in the living room that might explain those bruises but the candles he had been so perfectly positioned between them and when was this late last night i dont know exactly when i panicked when i calmed down i phoned for the police what time was it when you phoned she paused thinking about seven this morning tracy would you mind telling this to some other people why ill tell you when i pick you up just tell me where you are there was another pause while she considered this im back in pilmuir she said finally ive moved into another squat well said rebus you dont want me to come down there do you but you must be quite close to shore road what about us meeting there well theres a pub called the dock leaf continued rebus giving her no time to debate do you know it ive been kicked out of it a few times me too okay ill meet you outside it in an hour all right all right she didnt sound overenthusiastic and rebus wondered if she would keep the appointment well what of it she sounded straight enough but she might just be another casualty making it up to draw attention to herself to make her life seem more interesting than it was but then hed had a feeling hadnt he all right she said and the connection was severed shore road was a fast road around the north coast of the city factories warehouses and vast diy and home furnishing stores were its landmarks and beyond them lay the firth of forth calm and grey on most days the coast of fife was visible in the distance but not today with a cold mist hanging low on the water on the other side of the road from the warehouses were the tenements fourstorey predecessors of the concrete highrise there was a smattering of comer shops where neighbour met neighbour and information was passed on and a few small unmodernised pubs where strangers did not go unnoticed for long the dock leaf had shed one generation of lowlife drinkers and discovered another its denizens now were young unemployed and living six to a threebedroom rented flat along shore road petty crime though was not a problem you didnt mess your own nest the old community values still held rebus early for the meeting just had time for a half in the saloon bar the beer was cheap but bland and everyone seemed to know if not who he was then certainly what he was their voices turned down to murmurs their eyes averted when at three thirty he stepped outside the sudden daylight made him squint are you the policeman thats right tracy she had been standing against the pubs exterior wall he shaded his eyes trying to make out her face and was surprised to find himself looking at a woman of between twenty and twentyfive her age was transparent in her face though her style marked her out as the perennial rebel cropped peroxide hair two stud earrings in her left ear but none in the right tiedye tshirt tight faded denims and red basketball boots she was tall as tall as rebus as his eyes adjusted to the light he saw the teartracks on either cheek the old acne scars but there were also crowsfeet around her eyes evidence of a life used to laughter there was no laughter in those olivegreen eyes though somewhere in tracys life a wrong turning had been made and rebus had the idea that she was still trying to reverse back to that fork in the road the last time he had seen her she had been laughing laughing as her semblance curled from the wall of ronnies bedroom she was the girl in the photographs is tracy your real name sort of they had begun to walk she crossed the road at a zebra crossing not bothering to check whether any cars were approaching and rebus followed her to a wall where she stopped staring out across the forth she wrapped her arms around herself examining the lifting mist its my middle name she said rebus leaned his forearms against the wall how long have you known ronnie three months thats how long ive been in pilmuir who else lived in that house she shrugged they came and went wed only been in there a few weeks sometimes id go downstairs in the morning and thered be half a dozen strangers sleeping on the floor nobody minded it was like a big family what makes you think somebody killed ronnie she turned towards him angrily but her eyes were liquid i told you on the phone he told me hed been off somewhere and come back with some stuff he didnt look right though usually when hes got a little smack hes like a kid at christmas but he wasnt he was scared acting like a robot or something he kept telling me to hide telling me they were coming for him who were i dont know was this after hed taken the stuff no thats whats really crazy this was before he had the packet in his hand he pushed me out of the door you werent there while he was fixing god no i hated that her eyes drilled into his im not a junkie you know i mean i smoke a little but never you know was there anything else you noticed about ronnie like what well the state he was in you mean the bruises yes he often came back looking like that never talked about it got in a lot of fights i suppose was he shorttempered not with me rebus sunk his hands into his pockets a chill wind was whipping up off the water and he wondered whether she was warm enough he couldnt help noticing that her nipples were very prominent through the cotton of her tshirt would you like my jacket he asked only if your wallets in it she said with a quick smile he smiled back and offered a cigarette instead which she accepted he didnt take one for himself there were only three left out of the days ration and the evening stretched ahead of him do you know who ronnies dealer was he asked casually helping her to light the cigarette with her head tucked into his open jacket the lighter shaking in her hand she shook her head eventually the windbreak worked and she sucked hard at the filter i was never really sure she said it was something else he didnt talk about what did he talk about she thought about this and smiled again not much now you mention it that was what i liked about him you always felt there was more to him than he was letting on such as she shrugged might have been anything might have been nothing this was harder work than rebus had anticipated and he really was getting cold it was time to speed things up he was in the bedroom when you found him yes and the squat was empty at the time yes earlier on thered been a few people there but theyd all gone one of them was up in ronnies room but i didnt know him then there was charlie you mentioned him on the telephone yes well when i found ronnie i went looking for him hes usually around somewhere in one of the other squats or in town doing a bit of begging christ hes strange in what way didnt you see what was on the livingroom wall you mean the star yes that was charlie he painted it hes keen on the occult then mad keen what about ronnie ronnie jesus no he couldnt even stand to watch horror films they scared him but he had all those horror books in his bedroom that was charlie trying to get ronnie interested all they did was give him more nightmares and all those did was push him into taking more smack how did he finance his habit rebus watched a small boat come gliding through the mist something fell from it into the water but he couldnt tell what i wasnt his accountant who was the boat was turning in an arc slipping further west towards queensferry nobody wants to know where the money comes from thats the truth it makes you an accessory doesnt it that depends rebus shivered well i didnt want to know if he tried to tell me i put my hands over my ears hes never had a job then i dont know he used to talk about being a photographer thats what hed set his heart on when he left school it was the only thing he wouldnt pawn even to pay for his habit rebus was lost what was his camera it cost him a small fortune every penny saved out of his social security social security now there was a phrase but rebus was sure there had been no camera in ronnies bedroom so add robbery to the list tracy ill need a statement she was immediately suspicious what for just so ive got it on record so we can do something about ronnies death will you help me do that it was a long time before she nodded the boat had disappeared there was nothing floating in the water nothing left in its wake rebus put a hand on tracys shoulder but gently thanks he said the cars this way after she had made her statement rebus insisted on driving her home dropping her several streets from her destination but knowing her address now not that i can swear to be there for the next ten years she had said it didnt matter he had given her his work and home telephone numbers he was sure she would keep in touch one last thing he said as she was about to close the car door she leaned in from the pavement ronnie kept shouting theyre coming who do you think he meant she shrugged then froze remembering the scene he was strung out inspector maybe he meant the snakes and spiders yes thought rebus as she closed the door and he started the car and then maybe he meant the snakes and spiders whod supplied him back at greater london road station there was a message that chief superintendent watson wanted to see him rebus called his superiors office ill come along now if i may the secretary checked and confirmed that this would be okay rebus had come across watson on many occasions since the superintendents posting had brought him from the far north to edinburgh he seemed a reasonable man if just a little well agricultural for some tastes there were a lot of jokes around the station already about his aberdonian background and he had earned the whispered nickname of farmer watson come in john come in the superintendent had risen from behind his desk long enough to point rebus in the vague direction of a chair rebus noticed that the desk itself was meticulously arranged files neatly piled in two trays nothing in front of watson but a thick newish folder and two sharp pencils there was a photograph of two young children to one side of the folder my two watson explained theyre a bit older than that now but still a handful watson was a large man his girth giving truth to the phrase barrelchested his face was ruddy hair thin and silvered at the temples yes rebus could picture him in galoshes and a troutfishing hat stomping his way across a moor his collie obedient beside him but what did he want with rebus was he seeking a human collie you were at the scene of a drugs overdose this morning it was a statement of fact so rebus didnt bother to answer it should have been inspector mccalls call but he was well wherever he was hes a good copper sir watson stared up at him then smiled inspector mccalls qualities are not in question thats not why youre here but your being on the scene gave me an idea you probably know that im interested in this citys drugs problem frankly the statistics appal me its not something id encountered in aberdeen with the exception of some of the oil workers but then it was mostly the executives the ones they flew in from the united states they brought their habits if youll pardon the pun with them but here he flicked open the folder and began to pick over some of the sheets here inspector its hades plain and simple yes sir are you a churchgoer sir rebus was shifting uncomfortably in his chair its a simple enough question isnt it do you go to church not regularly sir but sometimes i do yes like yesterday rebus thought and here again he felt like fleeing someone said you did then you should know what im talking about when i say that this city is turning into hades watsons face was ruddier than ever the infirmary has treated addicts as young as eleven and twelve your own brother is serving a prison sentence for dealing in drugs watson looked up again perhaps expecting rebus to look shamed but rebuss eyes were a fiery glare his cheeks red not with embarrassment with respect sir he said voice level but as taut as a wire what has this got to do with me simply this watson closed the folder and settled back in his chair im putting into operation a new antidrugs campaign public awareness and that sort of thing coupled with funding for discreet information ive got the backing and whats more ive got the money a group of the citys businessmen are prepared to put fifty thousand pounds into the campaign very publicspirited of them sir watsons face became darker he leaned forward in his chair filling rebuss vision you better bloody believe it he said but i still dont see where i john the voice was anodyne now youve had experience personal experience id like you to help me front our side of the campaign no sir really good thats agreed then watson had already risen rebus tried to stand too but his legs had lost all power he pushed against the armrests with his hands and managed to heave himself upright was this the price they were demanding public atonement for having a rotten brother watson was opening the door well talk again go through the details but for now try to tie up whatever youre working on casenotes up to date that sort of thing tell me what you cant finish and well find someone to take it off your hands yes sir rebus clutched at the proffered hand it was like steel cool dry and crushing goodbye sir rebus said standing in the corridor now to a door that had already closed on him that evening still numb he grew bored with television and left his flat planning to drive around a bit no real destination in mind marchmont was quiet but then it always was his car sat undisturbed on the cobbles outside his tenement he started it up and drove entering the centre of town crossing to the new town at canonmills he stopped in the forecourt of a petrol station and filled the car adding a torch some batteries and several bars of chocolate to his purchases paying by credit card he ate the chocolate as he drove trying not to think of the next days cigarette ration and listened to the car radio gill templers lover calum mccallum began his broadcast at eight thirty and he listened for a few minutes it was enough the mockcheery voice the jokes so lame they needed wheelchairs the predictable mix of old records and telephonelinked chatter rebus turned the tuning knob until he found radio three recognising the music of mozart he turned up the volume he had always known that it would end here of course he drove through the illlit and winding streets threading his way further into the maze a new padlock had been fitted to the door of the house but rebus had in his pocket a copy of the key switching on his torch he walked quietly into the living room the floor was bare there was no sign that a corpse had lain there only ten hours before the jar of syringes had gone too as had the candlesticks ignoring the far wall rebus left the room and headed upstairs he pushed open the door of ronnies bedroom and walked in crossing to the window this was where tracy said she had found the body rebus squatted resting on his toes and shone the torch carefully over the floor no sign of a camera nothing it wasnt going to be made easy for him this case always supposing there was a case he only had tracys word for it after all he retraced his steps out of the room and towards the stairwell something glinted against the top step right in at the corner of the stairs rebus picked it up and examined it it was a small piece of metal like the clasp from a cheap brooch he pushed it into his pocket anyway and took another look at the staircase trying to imagine ronnie regaining consciousness and making his way to the ground floor possible just possible but to end up positioned like that much less feasible and why bring the jar of syringes downstairs with him rebus nodded to himself sure that he was wandering the maze in something like the right direction he went downstairs again and into the living room it had a smell like the mould on an old jar of jam earthy and sweet at the same time the earth sterile the sweetness sickly he went over to the far wall and shone his torchlight against it then came up short blood pounding the circles were still there and the fivepointed star within them but there were fresh additions zodiac signs and other symbols between the two circles painted in red he touched the paint it was tacky bringing his fingers away he shone the torch further up the wall and read the dripping message hello ronnie superstitious to his core rebus turned on his heels and fled not bothering to relock the door behind him walking briskly towards his car his eyes turned back in the direction of the house he fell into someone and stumbled the other figure fell awkwardly and was slow to rise rebus switched on his torch and confronted a teenager eyes sparkling face bruised and cut jesus son he whispered what happened to you i got beat up the boy said shuffling away on a painful leg rebus made the car somehow his nerves as thin as old shoelaces inside he locked the door and sat back closing his eyes breathing hard relax john he told himself relax soon he was even able to smile at his momentary lapse of courage tomorrow hed come back in daylight hed seen enough for now tuesday i have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature of man and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle of hatred sleep did not come easy but eventually slumped in his favourite chair a book propped open on his lap he must have dozed off because it took a nine oclock call to bring him to life his back legs and arms were stiff and aching as he scrabbled on the floor for his new cordless telephone yes lab here inspector rebus you wanted to know first thing what have you got rebus slumped back into the warm chair pulling at his eyes with his free hand trying to engage their cooperation in this fresh and waking world he glanced at his watch and realised just how late hed slept well its not the purest heroin on the street he nodded to himself confident that his next question hardly needed asking would it kill whoever injected it the reply jolted him upright not at all in fact its very clean all things considered a bit watered down from its pure form but thats not uncommon in fact its mandatory but it would be okay to use i imagine it would be very good to use i see well thank you rebus pressed the disconnect button he had been so sure so sure he reached into his pocket found the number he needed and pushed the seven digits quickly before the thought of morning coffee could overwhelm him inspector rebus for doctor enfield he waited doctor fine thanks how about you good good listen that body yesterday the druggie on the pilmuir estate any news he listened yes ill hold pilmuir what had tony mccall said it had been lovely once a place of innocence something like that the old days always were though werent they memory smoothed the comers as rebus himself knew well hello he said to the telephone yes thats right paper was rustling in the background enfields voice dispassionate bruising on the body fairly extensive result of a heavy fall or some kind of physical confrontation the stomach was almost completely empty hiv negative which is something as for the cause of death well the heroin rebus prompted mmm ninetyfive percent impure really rebus perked up what had it been diluted with still working on that inspector but an educated guess would be anything from groundup aspirin to rat poison with the emphasis strictly on rodent control youre saying it was lethal oh absolutely whoever sold the stuff was selling euthanasia if theres more of it about well i dread to think more of it about the thought made rebuss scalp tingle what if someone were going around poisoning junkies but why the one perfect packet one perfect one as rotten as could be it didnt make sense thanks doctor enfield he rested the telephone on the arm of the chair tracy had been right in one respect at least they had murdered ronnie whoever they were and ronnie had known known as soon as hed used the stuff no wait known before hed used the stuff could that be possible rebus had to find the dealer had to find out why ronnie had been chosen to die been indeed sacrificed it was tony mccalls backyard all right so he had moved out of pilmuir had eventually bought a crippling mortgage which some people called a house it was a nice house too he knew this because his wife told him it was told him continually she couldnt understand why he spent so little time there after all as she told him it was his home too home to mccalls wife it was a palace home didnt quite cover it and the two children son and daughter had been brought up to tiptoe through the interior not leaving crumbs or fingerprints no mess no breakages mccall who had lived a bruising childhood with his brother tommy thought it unnatural his children had grown up in fear and in a swaddling of love a bad combination now craig was fourteen isabel eleven both were shy introspective maybe even a bit strange bang had gone mccalls dream of a professional footballer for a son an actress for a daughter craig played chess a lot but no physical sports he had won a small plaque at school after one tournament mccall had tried to learn to play after that but had failed isabel liked knitting they sat in the tooperfect living room created by their mother and were almost silent the clackclack of needles the soft movement of chess pieces christ was it any wonder he kept away so here he was in pilmuir not checking on anything exactly just walking taking some air from his own ultramodern estate all detached shoeboxes and volvos he had to cross some waste ground avoid the traffic on a busy arterial road pass a school playingfield and manoeuvre between some factory units to find himself in pilmuir but it was worth the effort he knew this place knew the minds that festered here he was one of them after all hello tony he swirled not recognising the voice expecting hassle john rebus stood there smiling at him hands in pockets john christ you made me jump sorry stroke of luck bumping into you though rebus checked around them as though looking for someone i tried phoning but they said it was your day off aye thats right so what are you doing here just walking we live over that way he jerked his head towards the southwest its not far besides this is my patch dont forget got to keep an eye on the boys and girls thats why i wanted to speak to you actually oh rebus had begun to walk along the pavement and mccall still rattled by his sudden appearance followed yes rebus was saying i wanted to ask if you know someone a friend of the deceaseds the name is charlie thats all charlie rebus shrugged what does he look like rebus shrugged again ive no idea tony it was ronnies girlfriend tracy who told me about him ronnie tracy mccalls eyebrows met who the hell are they ronnie is the deceased that junkie we found on the estate everything was suddenly clear in mccalls mind he nodded slowly you work quickly he said the quicker the better ronnies girlfriend told me an interesting story oh she said ronnie was murdered rebus kept on walking but mccall had stopped wait a minute he caught rebus up murdered come on john you saw the guy true with a needles worth of rat poison scuppering his veins mccall whistled softly jesus quite said rebus and now i need to talk to charlie hes young could be a bit scared and interested in the occult mccall sorted through a few mental files i suppose there are one or two places we could try looking he said at last but itd be a slog the concept of neighbourhood policing hasnt quite stretched this far yet youre saying we wont be made very welcome something like that well just give me the addresses and point me in the right direction its your day off after all mccall looked slighted youre forgetting john this is my patch by rights this should be my case if there is a case it wouldve been your case if you hadnt had that hangover they smiled at this but rebus was wondering whether in tony mccalls hands there would have been anything to investigate wouldnt tony just have let it slip should he rebus let it slip too anyway mccall was saying on cue surely you must have better things to do rebus shook his head nothing all my works been farmed out with the emphasis on farmed you mean superintendent watson he wants me working on his antidrugs campaign me for christs sake that could be a bit embarrassing i know but the idiot thinks ive got personal experience hes got a point i suppose rebus was about to argue but mccall got in first so youve nothing to do not until summoned by farmer watson no you jammy bugger well that does change things a bit but not enough im sorry to say youre my guest here and youre going to have to put up with me until i get bored that is rebus smiled i appreciate it tony he looked around them so where to first mccall inclined his head back the way they had just come they turned around and walked so tell me said rebus whats so awful at home that youd think of coming here on your day off mccall laughed is it so obvious then only to someone whos been there himself ach i dont know john i seem to have everything ive never wanted and its still not enough it was a simple statement of belief i mean sheilas a wonderful mother and all that and the kids never get into trouble but the grass is always greener said rebus thinking of his own failed marriage of the way his flat was cold when he came home the way the door would close with a hollow sound behind him now tommy my brother i used to think he had it made plenty of money house with a jacuzzi automaticopening garage mccall saw that rebus was smiling and smiled himself electric blinds rebus continued personalised number plate car phone time share in malaga said mccall close to laughter marbletopped kitchen units it was too ridiculous they laughed out loud as they walked adding to the catalogue but then rebus saw where they were and stopped laughing stopped walking this was where hed been heading all along he touched the torch in his jacket pocket come on tony he said soberly theres something i want to show you he was found here rebus said shining the torch over the bare floorboards legs together lying on his back arms outstretched i dont think he got into that position by accident do you mccall studied the scene they were both professionals now and acting almost like strangers and the girlfriend says she found him upstairs thats right you believe her why would she lie there could be a hundred reasons john would i know the girl she hasnt been in pilmuir long bit older than youd imagine midtwenties maybe more so this ronnies already dead and hes brought downstairs and laid out with the candles and everything thats right im beginning to see why you need to find the friend whos into the occult right now come and look at this rebus led mccall to the far wall and shone the torch onto the pentagram then further up the wall hello ronnie mccall read aloud and this wasnt here yesterday really mccall sounded surprised kids john thats all kids didnt draw that pentagram no agreed charlie drew that pentagram right mccall slipped his hands into his pockets and drew himself upright point taken inspector lets go squat hunting but the few people they found seemed to know nothing and to care even less as mccall pointed out it was the wrong time of day everyone from the squats was in the city centre stealing purses from handbags begging shoplifting doing deals reluctantly rebus agreed that they were wasting their time since mccall wanted to listen to the tape rebus had made of his interview with tracy they headed back to great london road mccall had the idea that there might be some clue on the tape that would lead them to charlie something that would help him place the guy something rebus had missed rebus was a weary step or two ahead of mccall as they climbed the front steps to the stations heavy wooden door a fresh duty officer was beginning his shift at the desk still fussing with his shirt collar and his clipon tie simple but clever rebus thought to himself simple but clever all uniformed officers wore clipon ties so that in a clinch if the attacker tried to yank the officers head forwards the tie would simply come away in his hands likewise the desk sergeants glasses had special lenses which if hit would slip out of their frame without shattering simple but clever rebus hoped that the case of the crucified junkie would be simple he didnt feel very clever hello arthur he said passing the desk making towards the staircase any messages for me give me a break john ive only been on two minutes fair enough rebus pushed his hands deep into his pockets where the fingers of his right hand touched something alien metal he brought the broochclip out and studied it then froze mccall looked at him puzzled go on up rebus told him ill just be a second right you are john back at the desk rebus held his left hand out to the sergeant do me a favour arthur give me your tie what you heard me knowing that he would have a story to tell tonight in the canteen the desk sergeant pulled at his tie as it came away from his shirt the clip made a single snapping sound simple but clever thought rebus holding the tie between finger and thumb thanks arthur he said anytime john the sergeant called watching carefully as rebus walked back towards the stairs anytime know what this is tony mccall had seated himself in rebuss chair behind rebuss desk he had one fist in a drawer and looked up startled rebus was holding the necktie out in front of him mccall nodded then brought his hand out of the drawer it was curved around a bottle of whisky its a tie he said got any cups rebus placed the tie on the desk he went to a filing cabinet and searched amongst the many cups which sat unloved and uncleaned on top of it finally one seemed to satisfy him and he brought it to the desk mccall was studying the cover of a file lying on the desk ronnie he read out tracy caller i see your casenotes are as precise as ever rebus handed the cup to mccall wheres yours asked mccall pointing to the cup i dont feel like drinking to tell you the truth i hardly touch the stuff now rebus nodded at the bottle thats for visitors mccall pursed his lips his eyes opening wide besides rebus went on ive got the mother and father of a headache inlaws too kids neighbours town and country he noticed a large envelope on the desk photographs do not bend you know tony when i was a sergeant this sort of thing would take days to arrive its like royalty being an inspector he opened the envelope and took out the set of prints ten by eights black and white he handed one to mccall look rebus said no writing on the wall and the pentagrams unfinished today it was complete mccall nodded and rebus took back the picture handing over another in its place the deceased poor little sod said mccall it could be one of our kids eh john no said rebus firmly he rolled the envelope into the shape of a tube and put it in his jacket pocket mccall had picked up the tie he waved it towards rebus demanding an explanation have you ever worn one of those rebus asked sure at my wedding maybe a funeral or a christening i mean like this a clipon when i was a kid i remember my dad decided id look good in a kilt he bought me the whole getup including a little tartan bow tie it was a clipon ive worn one said mccall everybody has we all came through the ranks didnt we no said rebus now get out of my bloody chair mccall found another chair dragging it over from the wall to the desk rebus meantime sat down picking up the tie police issue what is clipon ties said rebus who else wears them christ i dont know john rebus threw the clip across to mccall who was slow to react it fell to the floor from where he retrieved it its a clipon he said i found it in ronnies house said rebus at the top of the stairs so so someones tie broke maybe when they were dragging ronnie downstairs maybe a police constable someone you think one of our lot just an idea said rebus of course it could belong to one of the lads who found the body he held out his hand and mccall gave him back the clip maybe ill talk to them john what the hell mccall ended with a sort of choking sound unable to find words for the question he wanted to ask drink your whisky said rebus solicitously then you can listen to that tape see if you think tracys telling the truth what are you going to do i dont know he put the desk sergeants tie in his pocket maybe ill tie up a few loose ends mccall was pouring out a measure of whisky as rebus left but the parting shot called from the staircase was loud enough for him to hear maybe ill just go to the devil yes a simple pentangle the psychologist dr poole who wasnt really a psychologist but rather he had explained a lecturer in psychology quite a different thing studied the photographs carefully bottom lip curling up to cover his top lip in a sign of confident recognition rebus played with the empty envelope and stared out of the office window the day was bright and some students were lying in george square gardens sharing bottles of wine their text books forgotten rebus felt uncomfortable institutes of higher education from the simplest college up to the present confines of the university of edinburgh made him feel stupid he felt that his every movement every utterance was being judged and interpreted marking him down as a clever man who could have been cleverer given the breaks when i returned to the house he said someone had drawn some symbols between the two circles signs of the zodiac that sort of thing rebus watched as the psychologist went over to the bookshelves and began to browse it had been easy to find this man making use of him might be more difficult probably the usual arcana dr poole was saying finding the page he wanted and bringing it back to the desk to show rebus this sort of thing yes thats it rebus studied the illustration the pentagram was not identical to the one he had seen but the differences were slight tell me are many people interested in the occult you mean in edinburgh poole sat down again pushing his glasses back up his nose oh yes plenty look at how well films about the devil do at the box office rebus smiled yes i used to like horror films myself but i mean an active interest the lecturer smiled i know you do i was being facetious so many people think thats what the occult is about bringing old nick back to life theres much more to it believe me inspector or much less to it depending on your point of view rebus tried to work out what this meant you know occultists he said meantime i know of occultists practising covens of white and black witches here in edinburgh poole smiled again oh yes right here there are six working covens in and around edinburgh he paused and rebus could almost see him doing a recount seven perhaps fortunately most of these practise white magic thats using the occult as a supposed force for good right quite correct and black magic the lecturer sighed he suddenly became interested in the scene from his window a summers day rebus was remembering something a long time ago hed bought a book of paintings by hr giger paintings of satan flanked by vestal whores he couldnt say why hed done it but it must still be somewhere in the flat he remembered hiding it from rhona there is one coven in edinburgh poole was saying a black coven tell me do they do they make sacrifices dr poole shrugged we all make sacrifices but seeing that rebus was not laughing at his little joke he straightened in his chair his face becoming more serious probably they do some token a rat a mouse a chicken it may not even go that far they could use something symbolic i really dont know rebus tapped one of the photographs which were spread across the desk in the house where we found this pentagram we also found a body a dead body in case you were wondering he brought these photographs out now dr poole frowned as he glanced at them dead from a heroin overdose laid out with legs together arms apart the body was lying between two candles which had burned down to nothing mean anything to you poole looked horrorstruck no he said but you think that satanists i dont think anything sir im just trying to piece things together going through all the possibilities poole thought for a moment one of our students might be of more use to you than i can id no idea we were talking about a death a student yes i only know him vaguely he seems very interested in the occult wrote rather a long and knowledgeable essay this term wants to do some project on demonism hes a secondyear student they have to do a project over the summer yes maybe he can give you more help than im able to and his name is well his surname escapes me for the moment he usually just calls himself by his first name charles charles or maybe charlie yes charlie thats it ronnies friends name the hair on rebuss neck began to prickle thats right charlie poole confirmed to himself nodding bit of an eccentric you can probably find him in one of the student union buildings i believe hes addicted to these video machines no not video machines pinball machines the ones with all the extras all the little tricks and treats that made a game a game charlie loved them with a vengeance it was the kind of love which was all the more fervent for having come to him late in life he was nineteen after all life was streaming past and he wanted to hang on to any piece of driftwood he could pinball had played no part in his adolescence that had belonged to books and music besides there had been no pinball machines at his boarding school now released into university he wanted to live and to play pinball and do all the other things he had missed out on during the years of prep sensitive essaywriting and introspection charlie wanted to run faster than anyone had ever run to live not one life but two or three or four as the silver ball made contact with the left flipper he threw it back up the table with real ferocity there was a pause while the ball sat in one of the bonus craters collecting another thousand points he picked up his lager took a gulp of it and then returned his fingers to the buttons in another ten minutes hed have the days high score charlie he turned at the sound of his name a bad mistake a naive mistake he turned back to the game again but too late the man was striding towards him the serious man the unsmiling man id like a word charlie okay how about carbohydrate that was always one of my favourites john rebuss smile lasted less than a second very clever he said yes thats what we call a smart answer we lothian cid my names inspector rebus pleased to meet you likewise charlie no youre mistaken my names not charlie he comes in here sometimes though ill tell him you called charlie was just about to hit the high score five minutes ahead of schedule when rebus gripped his shoulder and spun him around there were no other students in the games room so he kept squeezing the shoulder while he spoke youre about as funny as a maggot sandwich charlie and patience isnt my favourite card game so youll excuse me if i become irritable shorttempered that sort of thing hands off charlies face had taken on a new sheen but not of fear ronnie rebus said calmly now releasing his grip on the young mans shoulder the colour drained from charlies face what about him hes dead yes charlies voice was quiet his eyes unfocussed i heard rebus nodded tracy tried to find you tracy there was venom in the word shes no idea no idea at all have you seen her rebus nodded yeah what a loser that woman is she never understood ronnie never even tried as charlie spoke rebus was learning more about him his accent was scottish private school which was the first surprise rebus didnt know what he had expected he knew he hadnt expected this charlie was well built too a product of the rugbyplaying classes he had curly dark brown hair cut not too long and was dressed in traditional student summer wear training shoes denims and a tshirt the tshirt was black torn loose at the arms so charlie was saying ronnie did the big one eh well its a good age to die live fast die young do you want to die young charlie me charlie laughed a highpitched squeal like a small animal hell i want to live to be a hundred i never want to die he looked at rebus something sparkling in his eyes do you rebus considered the question but wasnt about to answer he was here on business not to discuss the death instinct the lecturer dr poole had told him about the death instinct i want to know what you know about ronnie does that mean youre going to take me away for questioning if you like we can do it here if youd prefer no no i want to go to the police station come on take me there there was a sudden eagerness about charlie which made him seem much younger than his years who the hell wanted to go to a police station for questioning on the route to the car park and rebuss car charlie insisted on walking a few paces ahead of rebus and with his hands behind his back head slumped rebus saw that charlie was pretending to be handcuffed he was doing a good impersonation too drawing attention to rebus and himself someone even called out bastard in rebuss direction but the word had lost all meaning over the years they would have disturbed him more by wishing him a pleasant trip can i buy a couple of these charlie asked examining the photographs of his work his pentagram the interview room was bleak it was its purpose to be bleak but charlie had settled in like he was planning to rent it no rebus said lighting a cigarette he didnt offer one to charlie so why did you paint it because its beautiful he still studied the photographs dont you think so full of meaning how long had you known ronnie charlie shrugged for the first time he looked in the direction of the cassette recorder rebus had asked if he minded having the dialogue recorded he had shrugged now he seemed a little pensive maybe a year he said yes a year i met him around the time of my firstyear exams that was when i started to get interested in the real edinburgh the real edinburgh yes not just the piper on the ramparts or the royal mile or the scott monument rebus recalled ronnies photographs of the castle i saw some photos on ronnies wall charlie screwed up his face god those he had the idea he was going to be a professional photographer taking bloody tourist snaps for postcards that didnt last long like most of ronnies schemes nice camera he had though what oh yes his camera yes it was his pride and joy charlie crossed his legs rebus continued to stare into the young mans eyes but charlie was busily studying the photographs of the pentagram so what was that you were telling me about the real edinburgh deacon brodie said charlie suddenly interested again burke and hare justified sinners the lot but its all been cleaned up for the tourists you see and i thought hang on all this lowland lowlife still exists that was when i started touring the housing estates wester hailes oxgangs craigmillar pilmuir and sure enough its all still here the past replaying itself in the present so you started hanging around pilmuir yes in other words you became a tourist yourself rebus had seen charlies kind before though usually the older model the prosperous businessman debasing himself for kicks visiting sleazy rooms for a dry cough of pleasure he didnt like the species i wasnt a tourist charlies anger rose a trout snapping a hooked worm i was there because i wanted to be there and they wanted me there his voice began to sound sulky i belong there no you dont son you belong in a big house somewhere with parents interested in your university career crap charlie pushed back his chair and walked to the wall resting his head against it rebus thought for a moment that he might be about to beat himself senseless then claim police brutality but he seemed merely to need something cool against his face the interview room was stifling rebus had removed his jacket now he rolled up his sleeves before stubbing out the cigarette okay charlie the young man was soft now pliable it was time to ask some questions the night of the overdose you were in the house with ronnie right thats right for a little while who else was there tracy was there she was there when i left anyone else some guy visited earlier in the evening he didnt stay long id seen him with ronnie before a couple of times when they were together they kept to themselves was this person his dealer do you think no ronnie could always get stuff well up until recently past couple of weeks he found it tough they seemed pretty close though really close if you get my meaning go on close as in loving as in gay but tracy yeah yeah but whats that supposed to prove huh you know how most addicts make their money how theft yeah theft muggings whatever and doing a bit of business over by calton hill calton hill large sprawling lying to the east of princes street yes rebus knew all about calton hill and about the cars which sat much of the night at the foot of it along regent road he knew about calton cemetery too about what went on there youre saying ronnie was a rent boy the phrase sounded ridiculous out loud it was tabloid talk im saying he used to hang around there with a load of other guys and im saying he always had money at the end of the night charlie swallowed money and maybe a few bruises jesus rebus added this information to what was becoming a very grubby little dossier in his head how far would you sink for a fix the answer was all the way and then a little lower he lit another cigarette do you know this for a fact he asked no was ronnie from edinburgh by the way stirling and his surname was mcgrath i think what about this guy he was so chummy with have you a name for him he called himself neil ronnie called him neilly neilly did you get the impression theyd known one another for a while yeah a goodish while a nickname like thats a sign of affection right rebus studied charlie with new admiration i dont do psychology for nothing inspector right rebus checked that the small cassette recorder still had some tape left to run give me a physical description of this neil character will you tall skinny short brown hair kind of spotty face but always clean usually wore jeans and a denim jacket carried a big black holdall with him any idea what was in it i got the feeling it was just clothes okay anything else lets talk about the pentagram someone has been back to the house and added to it since these photographs were taken charlie said nothing but did not look surprised it was you wasnt it charlie nodded how did you get in through the downstairs window those wooden slats couldnt keep out an elephant its like an extra door lots of people used to come into the house that way why did you go back it wasnt finished was it i wanted to add the symbols and the message charlie smiled to himself yes the message hello ronnie rebus quoted whats that all about just what it says his spirits still in the house his souls still there i was just saying hello i had some paint left besides i thought it might give somebody a fright rebus remembered his own shock at seeing the scrawl he felt his cheeks redden slightly but covered the fact with a question do you remember the candles charlie nodded but was becoming restless helping police with their inquiries was not as much fun as he had hoped what about your project said rebus changing tack what about it its on demonism isnt it maybe i havent decided yet what aspect of demonism i dont know maybe the popular mythology how old fears become new fears that sort of thing do you know any of the covens in edinburgh i know people who claim to be in some of them but youve never been along to one no worse luck charlie seemed suddenly to come to life look what is all this ronnie odd hes history why all the questions what can you tell me about the candles charlie exploded what about the candles rebus was all calmness he exhaled smoke before responding there were candles in the living room he was getting close to telling charlie something charlie didnt seem to know all during the interview he had been spiralling inwards towards this moment thats right big candles ronnie got them from some shop that specialises in candles he liked candles they gave the place ambience tracy found ronnie in his bedroom she thinks he was already dead rebuss voice became lower still and as flat as the desktop but by the time shed phoned us and an officer had turned up at the house ronnies body had been moved downstairs it was laid out between two candles which had been burnt down to nothing there wasnt much left of those candles anyway not when i left you left when just before midnight there was supposed to be a party somewhere on the estate i thought i might get invited in how long would the candles have burned for an hour two hours god knows how much smack did ronnie have christ i dont know well how much would he normally use at any one time i really dont know im not a user you know i hate all that stuff ive got two friends who were in my sixth form theyre both in private clinics thats nice for them like i said ronnie hadnt been able to find any stuff for days he was a bit whacked out just about to fall right over the edge then he came back with some end of story isnt there much about then so far as i know theres plenty but dont bother asking for names so if theres plenty how come ronnie was finding it so hard god knows he didnt know himself it was like hed suddenly become bad news then he was good news again and he got that packet it was time rebus picked an invisible thread from his shirt he was murdered he said or as good as charlies mouth opened the blood drained from his face as though a tap had been opened somewhere what he was murdered his body was full of rat poison selfinflicted but supplied by someone who probably knew it was lethal a lot of work was then done to manoeuvre his body into some kind of ritualistic position in the living room where your pentagram is now wait how many covens are there in edinburgh charlie what six seven i dont know look do you know them any of them i mean know them personally christ man youre not going to pin this on me why not rebus stubbed out his cigarette because its crazy seems to me it all fits charlie string him out rebus was thinking hes already stretched to snapping point unless you can convince me otherwise charlie walked to the door purposefully then paused go on rebus called its not locked walk out of here if you like then ill know you had something to do with it charlie turned his eyes seemed moist in the hazy light a sunbeam from the barred window penetrating the frosted glass caught motes of dust and turned them into slowmotion dancers charlie moved through them as he returned to the desk i didnt have anything to do with it honest sit down said rebus a kindly uncle now lets talk some more but charlie didnt like uncles never had he placed his hands on the desk and leaned down looming over rebus something had hardened somewhere within him his teeth when he spoke glistened with venom go to hell rebus i see what youre up to and im damned if im going to play along arrest me if you like but dont insult me with cheap tricks i did those in my first term then he walked and this time opened the door and left it open behind him rebus got up from the desk switched off the recorder took out the tape and pushing it into his pocket followed by the time he reached the entrance hall charlie had gone he approached the desk the duty sergeant looked up from his paperwork you just missed him he said rebus nodded it doesnt matter he didnt look too happy would i be doing my job if they all left here laughing and holding their sides the sergeant smiled i suppose not so what can i do for you the pilmuir overdose ive got a name for the corpse ronnie mcgrath originally from stirling lets see if we can find his parents eh the sergeant scribbled the name onto a pad im sure theyll be delighted to hear how their son is doing in the big city yes said rebus staring towards the front door of the police station im sure they will john rebuss flat was his castle once through the door he would pull up the drawbridge and let his mind go blank emptying himself of the world for as long as he could he would pour himself a drink put some tenor sax music on the cassette machine and pick up a book many weeks ago in a crazed state of righteousness he had put up shelves along one wall of the living room intending his sprawling collection of books to rest there but somehow they managed to crawl across the floor getting under his feet so that he used them like steppingstones into the hallway and the bedroom he walked across them now on his way to the bay window where he pulled down the dusty venetian blinds the slats he left open so that strawberry slants of evening light came pouring through reminding him of the interview room no no no that wouldnt do he was being sucked back into work again he had to clear his mind find some book which would pull him into its little universe far away from the sights and smells of edinburgh he stepped firmly on the likes of chekhov heller rimbaud and kerouac as he made his way to the kitchen seeking out a bottle of wine there were two cardboard boxes beneath the kitchen worktop taking up the space where the washing machine had once been rhona had taken the washing machine which was fair enough he called the resultant space his wine cellar and now and then would order a mixed case from a good little shop around the corner from his flat he put a hand into one of the boxes and brought out something called chateau potensac yes hed had a bottle of this before it would do he poured a third of the bottle into a large glass and returned to the living room plucking one of the books from the floor as he went he was seated in his armchair before he looked at its cover the naked lunch no bad choice he threw the book down again and groped for another dr jekyll and mr hyde fair enough hed been meaning to reread it for ages and it was blissfully short he took a mouthful of wine sloshed it around before swallowing and opened the book with the timing of a stageplay there was a rapping at the front door the noise rebus made was somewhere between a sigh and a roar he balanced the book its covers open on the arm of the chair and rose to his feet probably it was mrs cochrane from downstairs telling him that it was his turn to wash the communal stairwell she would have the large imperative card with her it is your turn to wash the stairs why she couldnt just hang it on his door like everyone else seemed to do he tried to arrange a neighbourly smile on his face as he opened the door but the actor in him had left for the evening so there was something not unlike pain rippling his lips as he stared at the visitor on his doormat it was tracy her face was red and there were tears in her eyes but the redness was not from crying she looked exhausted her hair cloying with sweat can i come in there was an all too visible effort in her voice rebus hadnt the heart to say no he pushed the door open wide and she stumbled in past him walking straight through to the living room as though shed been here a hundred times rebus checked that the stairwell was empty of inquisitive neighbours then closed the door he was tingling not a pleasant feeling he didnt like people visiting him here especially he didnt like work following him home by the time he reached the living room tracy had drained the wine and was exhaling with relief her thirst quenched rebus felt the discomfort in him increase until it was almost unbearable how the hell did you find this place he asked standing in the doorway as though waiting for her to leave not easy she said her voice a little more calm you told me you lived in marchmont so i just wandered around looking for your car then i found your name on the bell downstairs he had to admit it shed have made a good detective footwork was what it was all about somebodys been following me she said now i got scared following you he stepped into the room now curious his sense of encroachment easing yes two men i think there were two theyve been following me all afternoon i was up princes street just walking and they were always there a little way behind me they mustve known i could see them what happened i lost them went into marks and spencer ran like hell for the rose street exit then dived into the ladies in a pub stayed in there for an hour that seemed to do the trick then i headed here why didnt you telephone me no money thats why i was up princes street in the first place she had settled in his chair her arms hanging over its sides he nodded towards the empty glass do you want another no thanks i dont really like plonk but i was thirsty as hell i could manage a cup of tea though tea right plonk she had called it he turned and walked through to the kitchen his mind half on the idea of tea half on her story in one of his sparsely populated cupboards he found an unopened box of teabags there was no fresh milk in the flat but an old tin yielded a spoonful or two of powdered substitute now sugar music came suddenly from the living room a loud rendering of the white album god hed forgotten he still had that old tape he opened the cutlery drawer looking for nothing more than a teaspoon and found several sachets of sugar stolen from the canteen at some point in his past serendipity the kettle was beginning to boil this flats huge she startled him he was so unused to other voices in this place he turned and watched her lean against the doorjamb her head angled sideways is it he said rinsing a mug christ yes look how high your ceilings are i could just about touch the ceiling in ronnies squat she stood on tiptoe and stretched an arm upwards waving her hand rebus feared that she had taken something some pills or powders while hed been on the trail of the furtive teabag she seemed to sense his thoughts and smiled im just relieved she said i feel lightheaded from the running and from being scared i suppose but now i feel safe what did the men look like i dont know i think they looked a bit like you she smiled again one had a moustache he was sort of fat going thin on top but not old i cant remember the other one he wasnt very memorable i suppose rebus poured water into the mug and added the teabag milk no just sugar if youve got it he waved one of the sachets at her great back in the living room he went to the stereo and turned it down sorry she said back in the chair now sipping tea her legs tucked under her i keep meaning to find out whether my neighbours can hear the stereo or not rebus said as if to excuse his action the walls are pretty thick but the ceiling isnt she nodded blew onto the surface of the drink steam covering her face in a veil so said rebus pulling his directors foldaway chair out from beneath a table and sitting down what can we do about these men whove been following you i dont know youre the policeman it all sounds like something out of a film to me i mean why should anyone want to follow you to scare me she offered and why should they want to scare you she thought about this then shrugged her shoulders by the way i saw charlie today he said oh do you like him charlie her laughter was shrill hes horrible always hanging around even when its obvious nobody wants him anywhere near everybody hates him everybody yes did ronnie hate him she paused no she said at last but then ronnie didnt have much sense that way what about this other friend of ronnies neil or neilly what can you tell me about him is that the guy who was there last night yes she shrugged her shoulders i never saw him before she seemed interested in the book on the arm of the chair picked it up and flipped its pages pretending to read and ronnie never mentioned a neil or a neilly to you no she waved the book at rebus but he did talk about someone called edward seemed angry with him about something used to shout the name out when he was alone in his room after a fix rebus nodded slowly edward his dealer maybe i dont know maybe ronnie got pretty crazy sometimes after he fixed he was like a different person but he was so sweet at times so gentle her voice died away eyes glistening rebus checked his watch okay what about if i drive you back to the squat now we can check that theres no one watching i dont know the fear had returned to her face erasing years from her turning her into a child again afraid of shadows and ghosts ill be there rebus added well can i do something first what she pulled at her damp clothes take a bath she said then she smiled i know its a bit brassnecked but i really could use one and theres no water at all in the squat rebus smiled too nodding slowly my bathtub is at your disposal he said while she was in the bath he hung her clothes over the radiator in the hall turning the central heating on made a sauna of the flat and rebus struggled with the sash windows in the living room trying without success to open them he made more tea in a pot this time and had just carried it into the living room when he heard her call from the bathroom when he came out into the hall she had her head around the bathroom door steam billowing out around her her hair face and neck were gleaming no towels she explained sorry said rebus he found some in the cupboard in his room and brought them to her pushing them through the gap in the door feeling awkward despite himself thanks she called he had swopped the white album for some jazz barely audible and was sitting with his tea when she came in one large red towel was expertly tied around her body another around her head he had often wondered how women could be so good at wearing towels her arms and legs were pale and thin but there was no doubting that her shape was pleasing and the glow from the bath gave her a kind of nimbus he remembered the photographs of her in ronnies room then he recalled the missing camera was ronnie still keen on photography i mean of late the choice of words was accidentally unsubtle and he winced a little but tracy appeared not to notice i suppose so he was quite good you know he had a good eye but he didnt get the breaks how hard did he try bloody hard there was resentment in her voice perhaps rebus had allowed too much professional scepticism to creep into his tone yes im sure not an easy profession to get into id imagine too true and there were some who knew how good ronnie was they didnt want the competition put obstacles in his way whenever and wherever they could you mean other photographers thats right well when ronnie was going through his really keen spell before disillusionment set in he didnt know quite how to get the breaks so he went to a couple of studios showed some of his work to the guys who worked there he had some really inspired shots you know everyday things seen from weird angles the castle waverley monument calton hill calton hill yes the whatsit the folly thats it the towel was slipping a little from around her shoulders and as tracy sat with her legs tucked beneath her sipping tea it also fell away to reveal more than enough thigh rebus tried to concentrate his eyes on her face it wasnt easy well she was saying a couple of his ideas got ripped off hed see a photo in one of the local rags and itd be exactly the angle hed used the same time of day same filters those bastards had copied his ideas hed see their names beneath the pictures the same guys hed shown his portfolio to what were their names i dont remember now she readjusted the towel there seemed something defensive in the action was it so hard to remember a name she giggled he tried to get me to pose for him i saw the results no not those ones you know nude shots he said he could sell them for a fortune to some of the magazines but i wasnt having it i mean the money wouldve been all well and good but these mags get passed around dont they i mean they never get thrown away id always be wondering if anybody could recognise me on the street she waited for rebuss reaction and when it was one of thoughtful bemusement laughed throatily so its not true what they say you can embarrass a copper sometimes rebuss cheeks were tingling he put a hand selfconsciously to one of them he had to do something about this so he said was ronnies camera worth much then she seemed nonplussed by this turn in the conversation and pulled the towel even tighter around her depends i mean worth and value theyre not the same thing are they arent they well he might have paid only a tenner for the camera but that doesnt mean it was only worth a tenner to him do you see so he paid a tenner for the camera no no no she shook her head dislodging the towel i thought you had to be brainy to get in the cid what i mean is she raised her eyes to the ceiling and the towel slipped from her head so that bedraggled ratstails of hair strung themselves out across her forehead no never mind the camera cost about a hundred and fifty quid okay fine interested in photography are you only since recently more tea he poured from the teapot then added a sachet of sugar she liked lots of sugar thanks she said cradling the mug listen she was bathing her face in the steam from the surface of the tea can i ask you a favour here it comes thought rebus money he had already made a mental note to check whether anything in the flat was missing before letting her leave what her eyes were on his now can i stay the night her words came out in a torrent ill sleep on the couch on the floor i dont mind i just dont want to go back to the squat not tonight its been getting pretty crazy lately and those men following me she shivered and rebus had to admit that if this were all an act she was a topoftheform drama student he shrugged was about to speak but rose and went to the window instead deferring a decision the orange street lamps were on casting a hollywood filmset glow over the pavement there was a car outside directly opposite the flat being two floors up rebus couldnt quite see into the car but the drivers side window had been rolled down and smoke oozed from it well the voice said behind him it had lost all confidence now what rebus said distractedly can i he turned towards her can i stay she repeated sure rebus said making for the door stay as long as you like he was halfway down the curving stairwell before he realised that he was not wearing any shoes he paused considering no to hell with it his mother had always warned him about catching chilblains and he never had now was as good a time as any to find out whether his medical luck was holding he was passing a door on the first floor when it rattled open and mrs cochrane thrust her whole frame out blocking rebuss path mrs cochrane he said after the initial shock had passed here she shoved something towards him and he could do nothing but take it from her it was a piece of card about ten inches by six rebus read it it is your turn to wash the stairs by the time he looked up again mrs cochranes door was already closing he could hear her carpet slippers shuffling back towards her tv and her cat smelly old thing rebus carried the card downstairs with him the cold steps penetrating his stockinged soles the cat didnt smell too good either he thought maliciously the front door was on the latch he eased it open trying to keep the aged mechanism as silent as possible the car was still there directly opposite him as he stepped outside but the driver had already seen him the cigarette stub was flicked onto the road and the engine started rebus moved forward on his toes the cars headlamps came on suddenly their beam as full as a stalag searchlight rebus paused screwing his eyes and the car started forward then swerved to the left racing downhill to the end of the street rebus stared after it trying to make out the number plate but his eyes were full of white fuzziness it had been a ford escort of that much he was sure looking down the road he realised that the car had stopped at the junction with the main road waiting for a space in the traffic it was less than a hundred yards away rebus made up his mind he had been a handy sprinter in his youth good enough for the school team when they had been a man short he ran now with a kind of drunken euphoria and remembered the wine he had opened his stomach turned sour at the mere thought and he slowed just then he slipped skidding on something on the pavement and brought up short he saw the car slip across the junction and roar away never mind that first glimpse as hed opened the door had been enough hed seen the constabulary uniform not the drivers face but the uniform for sure a policeman a constable driving an escort two young girls were approaching along the pavement they giggled as they passed rebus and he realised that he was standing panting on the pavement without any shoes but holding a sign telling him it was his turn to wash the stairs when he looked down he saw what it was he had skidded on cursing silently he removed his socks tossed them into the gutter and walked back on bare feet towards the flat dectective constable brian holmes was drinking tea he had turned this into something of a ritual holding the cup to his face and blowing on it then sipping blowing then sipping swallowing then releasing a steamy breath of air he was chilled tonight as cold as any tramp on any park bench bed he didnt even have a newspaper and the tea tasted revolting it had come out of one or other of the thermos flasks piping hot and smelling of plastic the milk wasnt of the freshest but at least the brew was warming not warming enough to touch his toes supposing he still had toes anything happening he hissed towards the sspca officer who held binoculars to his eyes as though to hide his embarrassment nothing the officer whispered it had been an anonymous tipoff the third this month and to be fair the first nonstarter dog fighting was back in vogue several arenas had been found in the past three months small dirt pits enclosed by lengths of sheet tin scrap yards seemed the main source of these arenas which gave an added meaning to the term scrap yard but tonight they were watching a piece of waste ground goods trains clattered past nearby heading towards the centre of the city but apart from that and the low hum of distant traffic the place was dead yes there was a makeshift pit all right theyd taken a look at it in daylight pretending to walk their own alsatian dogs which were in fact police dogs pit bull terriers that was what they used in the arenas brian holmes had seen a couple of excombatants their eyes maddened with pain and fear he hadnt stuck around for the vet with his lethal injection hold on two men were walking hands in pockets across the wilderness picking their way carefully over the uneven surface wary of sudden craters they seemed to know where they were headed straight towards the shallow pit once there they took a final look around brian holmes stared directly back at them knowing he could not be seen like the sspca officer he was crouching behind thick bracken behind him one remaining wall of what had been a building of sorts though there was some light over towards the pit itself there was precious little here and so as with a twoway mirror he could see without being seen got you said the sspca man as the two men jumped down into the pit wait said holmes suddenly getting a funny feeling about all of this the two men had begun to embrace and their faces merged in a slow lingering kiss as they sank down towards the ground christ exclaimed the sspca man holmes sighed staring down at the damp rockhard earth beneath his knees i dont think pit bulls enter the equation he said or if they do bestiality rather than brutality might be the charge the sspca officer still held his binoculars to his eyes horrorstruck and riveted you hear stories he said but you never well you know get to watch holmes suggested getting slowly painfully to his feet he was talking with the night duty officer when the message came through inspector rebus wanted a word rebus what does he want brian holmes checked his watch it was two fifteen am rebus was at home and he had been told to phone him there he used the duty officers telephone hello he knew john rebus of course had worked with him on several cases still middleofthenight calls were something else entirely is that you brian yes sir have you a sheet of paper write this down fumbling with pad and biro holmes thought he could hear music playing on the line something he recognised the beatles white album ready yes sir right there was a junkie found dead in pilmuir yesterday or a couple of days ago now strictly speaking overdose find out who the constables who found him were get them to come into my office at ten oclock got that yes sir good now when youve got the address where the body was found i want you to pick up the keys from whoevers got them and go to the house upstairs in one of the bedrooms theres a wall covered in photographs some are of edinburgh castle take them with you and go to the local newspapers office theyll have files full of photographs if youre lucky they might even have a little old man on duty with a memory like an elephant i want you to look for any photographs that have been published in the newspaper recently and look to have been taken from the same angle as the ones on the bedroom wall got that yes sir said holmes scribbling furiously good i want to know who took the newspaper photographs therell be a sticker or something on the back of each print giving a name and address anything else sir it came out as sarcasm meant or not yes rebus seemed to drop his voice a decibel on the bedroom wall youll also find some photos of a young lady id like to know more about her she says her middle name is tracy thats what she calls herself ask around show the picture to anyone you think might have an inkling right sir one question go ahead why me why now whats all this in aid of thats three questions ill answer as many of them as i can when i see you tomorrow afternoon be in my office at three and with that the line went dead on brian holmes he stared at the drunken rows of writing on his pad his own shorthand of a weeks worth of work delivered to him in a matter of minutes the duty officer was reading it over his shoulder rather you than me he said with sincerity john rebus had chosen holmes for a whole bundle of reasons but mostly because holmes didnt know much about him he wanted someone who would work efficiently methodically without raising too much fuss someone who didnt know rebus well enough to complain about being kept in the dark about being used as a shunting engine a message boy and a bloodhound and a dogsbody rebus knew that holmes was gaining a reputation for efficiency and for not being a complaining sod that was enough to be going on with he carried the telephone back from the hall into the living room placed it on the bookshelves and went across to the hifi where he switched off the tape machine then the amplifier he went to the window and looked out on an empty street whose lamplight was the colour of red leicester cheese the image reminded him of the midnight snack he had promised himself a couple of hours ago and he decided to make himself something in the kitchen tracy wouldnt be wanting anything he was sure of that he stared at her as she lay along the settee her head at an angle towards the floor one hand across her stomach the other hanging down to touch the wool carpet her eyes were unseeing slits her mouth open in a pout revealing a slight gap between her two front teeth she had slept soundly as he had thrown a blanket over her and was sleeping still her breathing regular something niggled him but he couldnt think what it was hunger perhaps he hoped the freezer would yield a pleasant surprise but first he went to the window and looked out again the street was absolutely dead which was just how rebus himself was feeling dead but active he picked dr jekyll and mr hyde from the floor and carried it through to the kitchen wednesday the more it looks like queer street the less i ask police constables harry todd and francis orourke were standing outside rebuss office when he arrived next morning they had been leaning against the wall enjoying a lazy conversation seemingly unconcerned that rebus was twenty minutes late he was damned if he was going to apologise he noted with satisfaction that as he reached the top of the stairs they pulled themselves up straight and shut their mouths that was a good start he opened the door walked into the room and closed the door again let them stew for another minute now theyd have something really to talk about he had checked with the desk sergeant and brian holmes wasnt in the station he took a slip of paper from his pocket and rang holmess house the telephone rang and rang holmes must be out working the good run was continuing there was mail on his desk he flipped through it stopping only to extract a note from superintendent watson it was an invitation to lunch today at twelve thirty hell he was meeting holmes at three the lunch was with some of the businessmen who were putting up the hard cash for the drugs campaign hell and it was in the eyrie which meant wearing a tie and a clean shirt rebus looked down at his shirt it would do but the tie would not hell the smile left his soul it had been too good to last tracy had woken him with breakfast on a tray orange juice toast and honey strong coffee shed gone out early she explained taking with her a little money she found on the shelves in the living room she hoped he didnt mind she had found a comer shop open made the purchases come back to the flat and made him breakfast im surprised the smell of burning toast didnt wake you she had said youre looking at the man who slept through towering inferno he had replied and she had laughed sitting on the bed taking dainty bites of toast with her exposed teeth while rebus chewed his slices slowly thoughtfully luxuriously how long had it been since hed been brought breakfast in bed it frightened him to think come in he roared now though no one had knocked tracy had left without complaint too she felt all right she said she couldnt stay cooped up forever could she he had driven her back towards pilmuir then had done something stupid given her ten pounds it wasnt just money as he realised a second after handing it over it was a bond between them a bond he shouldnt be making it lay there in her hand and he felt the temptation to snatch it back but then she was out of the car and walking away her body fragile as bone china her gait determined full of strength sometimes she reminded him of his daughter sammy other times other times of gill templer his exlover come in he roared again this time the door opened an inch then another ten or eleven a head looked into the room nobodys been knocking sir the head said nervously is that so said rebus in his best stage voice well in that case id better just speak to you two instead so why dont you come in a moment later they shuffled through the doorway a bit less cocky now rebus pointed to the two chairs on the other side of his desk one of them sat immediately the other stood to attention id rather stand sir he said the other one looked suddenly fearful terrified that he had broken some rule of protocol this isnt the bloody army rebus said to the standing one just as the sitting one was rising so sit down they both sat rebus rubbed his forehead pretending a headache truth be told he had almost forgotten who these constables were and why they were here right he said why do you think ive called you here this morning corny but effective is it to do with the witches sir witches rebus looked at the constable who had said this and remembered the keen young man who had shown him the original pentagram thats right witches and overdoses they blinked at him he sought frantically for a route into the interrogation if interrogation this was to be he should have thought more about it before coming in he should have at least remembered that it had been arranged he saw a tenpound note a smile could smell burning toast he looked at the pentagram constables tie whats your name son todd sir todd thats german for dead did you know that todd yes sir i did german at school up to highers rebus nodded pretending to be impressed damn he was impressed they all had highers these days it seemed all these extraordinarily younglooking constables some had gone further college university he had the feeling holmes had been to university he hoped he hadnt enlisted the aid of a smart arse rebus pointed to the tie that looks a bit squint todd todd immediately looked down towards his tie his head angled so sharply rebus feared the neck would snap sir that tie is it your usual one yes sir so you havent broken a tie recently broken a tie sir broken the clip explained rebus no sir and whats your name son rebus said quickly turning to the other constable who looked completely stunned by proceedings so far orourke sir irish name rebus commented yes sir what about your tie orourke is that a new tie not really sir i mean ive got about half a dozen of these things kicking around rebus nodded he picked up a pencil examined it set it down again he was wasting his time id like to see the reports you made of finding the deceased yes sir they said nothing unusual in the house was there i mean when you first arrived nothing out of the ordinary only the dead man sir said orourke and the painting on the wall said todd did either of you bother to check upstairs no sir the body was where when you arrived in the downstairs room sir and you didnt go upstairs todd looked towards orourke i think we shouted to see if anyone was up there but no we didnt go up so how could the tie clip have got upstairs rebus exhaled then cleared his throat what kind of car do you drive todd do you mean police car sir no i bloody well dont rebus slapped the pencil down against the desk i mean for private use todd seemed more confused now than ever a metro sir colour white rebus turned his gaze to orourke i dont have a car orourke admitted i like motorbikes just now ive got a honda sevenfifty rebus nodded no ford escorts then nobody hurtling away from his road at midnight well thats all right then isnt it and with a smile he dismissed them picked up the pencil again examined its point and very deliberately broke it against the edge of his desk rebus was thinking of charlie as he stopped his car in front of the tiny oldfashioned menswear shop off george street he was thinking of charlie as he grabbed the tie and paid for it back in the car he thought of charlie as he knotted the tie started the ignition and drove off heading towards lunch with some of the wealthiest businessmen in the city all he could think of was charlie and how charlie could probably still choose to be like those businessmen one day hed leave university use his family connections to land a good job and progress smoothly through to upper management in the space of a year or two he would forget all about his infatuation with decadence and would become decadent himself the way only the rich and successful ever can true decadence not the secondhand stuff of witchcraft and demonism drugs and violence that bruising on ronnies body could it really have been rough trade a sadomasochistic game gone wrong a game played perhaps with the mysterious edward whose name ronnie had screamed or a ritual carried too far had he dismissed the satanism angle too readily wasnt a policeman supposed to keep an open mind perhaps but satanism found him with his mind well and truly closed he was a christian after all he might not attend church often detesting all the hymnsinging and the bald sermonising but that didnt mean he didnt believe in that small dark personal god of his everyone had a god tagging along with them and the god of the scots was as ominous as he came midday edinburgh seemed darker than ever reflecting his mood perhaps the castle appeared to be casting a shadow across the expanse of the new town but that shadow did not could not reach as high as the eyrie the eyrie was the citys most expensive restaurant and also the most exclusive rumour had it that lunchtime was solidly booked twelve months in advance while dinner entailed the small wait of eight to ten weeks the restaurant itself was situated on the entire top floor of a georgian hotel in the heart of the new town away from the city centres human bustle not that the streets here were exactly quiet a steady amount of through traffic pausing long enough to make parking a problem but not to a detective rebus stopped his car on a double yellow line directly outside the hotels main door and despite the doormans warnings about wardens and fines left it there and entered the hotel he squeezed his stomach as the lift carried him four floors high and was satisfied that he felt hungry these businessmen might well bore the pants off him and the thought of spending two hours with farmer watson was almost too much to bear but he would eat well yes he would eat exceedingly well and given his way with the wine list hed bankrupt the buggers to boot brian holmes left the snack bar carrying a polystyrene cup of grey tea and studied it trying to remember when he had last had a cup of good tea of real tea of tea he had brewed himself his life seemed to revolve around polystyrene cups and thermos flasks unexciting sandwiches and chocolate biscuits blow sip blow sip swallow for this he had given up an academic career which was to say that he had careered around academia for some eight months studying history at the university of london the first month he had spent in awe of the city itself trying to come to terms with its size the complexities of actually trying to live and travel and survive with dignity the second and third months he had spent trying to come to terms with university life with new friends the persistent openings for discussion argument for inclusion in this or that group he tested the water each time before joining in all of them nervous as children learning to swim by months four and five he had become a londoner commuting to the university every day from his digs in battersea suddenly his life had come to be ruled by numbers by the times of trains and buses and tube connections the times too of late buses and tubes which would whisk him away from coffeebar politics towards his noisy single room again missing a train connection began to be agony suffering the rushhour tube a season spent in hell months six and seven he spent isolated in battersea studying from his room hardly attending lectures at all and in month eight may with the sun warming his back he left london and returned north back to old friends and a sudden emptiness in his life that had to be filled by work but why in the name of god had he chosen the police he screwed up the now empty polystyrene cup and threw it towards a nearby bin it missed so what he thought then caught himself went to the cup stooped picked it up and deposited it in the bin youre not in london now brian he told himself an elderly woman smiled at him so shines a good deed in a naughty world a naughty world all right rebus had landed him in a soup of melted humanity pilmuir hiroshima of the soul he couldnt escape quickly enough fear of radiation he had a little list with him copied down neatly from last nights scrawled telephone conversation and he took this from his pocket now to examine it the constables had been easy to locate rebus would have seen them by now then he had gone to the house in pilmuir in his inside pocket he had the photographs edinburgh castle good shots too unusual angles and the girl she looked quite pretty he supposed hard to tell her age and her face seemed tempered by hard living but she was bonny enough in a rough and ready way he had no idea how he would find out anything about her all he had to go on was that name tracy true there were people he could ask edinburgh was his home turf an enormous advantage in this particular line of work he had contacts all right old friends friends of friends hed reestablished contact after the london fiasco theyd all told him not to go theyd all been pleased to see him again so soon after their warnings pleased because they could boast of their foresight that had only been five years ago it seemed longer somehow why had he joined the force his first choice had been journalism that went way back back to his schooldays well childhood dreams could come true if only momentarily his next stop would be the offices of the local daily see if he could find some more unusual angles on the castle with any luck hed get a decent cup of tea too he was about to walk on when he saw an estate agents window across the street he had always assumed that this particular agency would because of its name be expensive but what the hell he was a desperate man he manoeuvred his way through the queue of unmoving traffic and stopped in front of the window of bowyer carew after a minute his shoulders slightly more hunched than before he turned away again and stalked towards the bridges and this is james carew of bowyer carew james carew lifted his wellupholstered bottom a millimetre off his wellupholstered chair shook rebuss hand then sat again throughout the introduction his eyes had not left rebuss tie finlay andrews continued superintendent watson and rebus shook another firm masonic hand he didnt need to know the secret pressure spots to be able to place a freemason the grip itself told you everything lasting as it did a little longer than normal the extra time it took the shaker to work out whether you were of the brotherhood or not you might know mr andrews he has a gaming establishment in duke terrace whats it called again watson was trying too hard too hard to be the host too hard to get along with these men too hard for everyones comfort its just called finlays finlay andrews supplied releasing his grip on rebus tommy mccall said the final luncheon guest making his own introduction and giving rebuss hand a quick cool shake rebus smiled and sat down joining them at the table thankful to be sitting down at last not tony mccalls brother he asked conversationally thats right mccall smiled you know tony then pretty well said rebus watson was looking bemused inspector mccall rebus explained watson nodded vigorously so said carew shifting in his seat what will you have to drink inspector rebus not while on duty sir said rebus unfolding his prettily arranged napkin he saw the look on carews face and smiled just a joke ill have a gin and tonic please they all smiled a policeman with a sense of humour it usually surprised people it would have surprised them even more had they known how seldom rebus made jokes but he felt the need to conform here to mix in that unhappy phrase there was a waiter at his shoulder another gin and tonic ronald carew told the waiter who bowed and moved off another waiter replaced him and started handing out huge leatherbound menus the thick cloth napkin was heavy on rebuss lap where do you live inspector the question was carews his smile seemed more than a smile and rebus was cautious marchmont he said oh carew enthused thats always been a very good area used to be a farming estate back in the old days you know really mmm lovely neighbourhood what james means interrupted tommy mccall is that the houses are worth a few bob so they are carew answered indignantly handy for the centre of town close to the meadows and the university james finlay andrews warned youre talking shop am i carew seemed genuinely surprised he gave rebus that smile again sorry i recommend the sirloin said andrews when the waiter returned to take their order rebus made a point of ordering sole he tried to be casual not to stare at the other diners not to examine the minutiae of the tablecloth the implements unknown to him the finger bowls the hallmarked cutlery but then this was one of those onceinalifetime things wasnt it so why not stare he did and saw fifty or so wellfed happy faces mostly male with the occasional decorative female for the sake of decency of elegance prime fillet thats what everyone else seemed to be having and wine who wants to choose the wine said mccall flourishing the list carew looked eager to snatch and rebus held back it wouldnt do would it to grab the list to say me me me to look with hungry eyes at the prices wishing if i may said finlay andrews lifting the wine list from mccalls hand rebus studied the hallmark on his fork so said mccall looking at rebus superintendent watson has roped you in on our little mission eh i dont know that any rope was needed said rebus im glad to help if i can im sure your experience will be invaluable watson said to rebus beaming at him rebus stared back evenly but said nothing as luck would have it andrews seemed to know a bit about wine himself and ordered a decent claret and a crisp chablis rebus perked up a bit as andrews did the ordering what was the name of the gaming club again andrews finlays yes that was it finlays hed heard of it a small casino quiet there had never been any cause for rebus to go there either on business or for pleasure what pleasure was there in losing money is your chinaman still haunting the place finlay asked mccall now while two waiters ladled a thin covering of soup into widecircumferenced victorian soup plates he wont get in again management reserves the right to refuse entry et cetera mccall chuckled turned to rebus finlay had a bad run back there the chinese are terrible for gambling you know well this one chinaman was taking finlay for a ride i had an inexperienced croupier andrews explained the experienced eye and i do mean experienced could tell pretty much where the ball was going to land on the roulette wheel just by watching carefully how this youngster was flicking the ball remarkable said watson before blowing on a spoonful of soup not really said andrews ive seen it before its simply a matter of spotting the type before they manage to lay on a really heavy bet but then you have to take the rough with the smooth this has been a good year so far a lot of money moving north finding theres not so much to do up here so why not simply gamble it away money moving north rebus was interested people jobs london executives with london salaries and london habits havent you noticed i cant say i have rebus confessed not around pilmuir at any rate there were smiles at this my estate agency has certainly noticed it said carew larger properties are in great demand corporate buyers in some cases businesses moving north opening offices they know a good thing when they see it and edinburgh is a good thing house prices have gone through the roof i see no reason for them to stop he caught rebuss eye theyre even building new homes in pilmuir finlay mccall interrupted tell inspector rebus where the chinese players keep their money not while were eating please said watson and when mccall chuckling to himself looked down at his soup plate rebus saw andrews flash the man a hateful look the wine had arrived chilled and the colour of honey rebus sipped carew was asking andrews about some planning permission to do with an extension to the casino it seems to be all right andrews tried not to sound smug tommy mccall laughed ill bet it does he said would your neighbours find the going as smooth if they tried to stick a big bloody extension on the back of their premises andrews gave a smile as cold as the chablis each case is considered individually and scrupulously tommy so far as i know maybe you know better no no mccall had finished his first glass of wine and was reaching for a second im sure its all totally above board finlay he looked conspiratorially at rebus i hope youre not going to tell tales john no rebus glanced towards andrews who was finishing his soup over lunch my ears are closed watson nodded agreement hello there finlay a large man heavily built but with the accent on muscularity was standing by the table he was wearing the most expensivelooking suit rebus had ever seen a silken sheen of blue with threads of silver running through it the mans hair was silvered too though his face looked to be fortyish no more beside him leaning in towards him stood a delicate oriental woman more girl than woman she was exquisite and everyone at the table rose in a kind of awe the man waved an elegant hand demanding they be seated the woman hid her pleasure beneath her eyelashes hello malcolm finlay andrews gestured towards the man this is malcolm lanyon the advocate the last two words were unnecessary everyone knew malcolm lanyon the gossip columns friend his very public lifestyle provoked either hatred or envy he was at the same time all that was most despised about the law profession and a walking tv miniseries if his lifestyle occasionally scandalised the prurient it also satisfied a deep need in the readers of sunday tabloids he was also to rebuss sure knowledge an extraordinarily good lawyer he had to be otherwise the rest of his image would have been wallpaper nothing more it wasnt wallpaper it was bricks and mortar these andrews said gesturing now to the occupants of the table are the working members of that committee i was telling you about ah lanyon nodded the campaign against drugs an excellent idea superintendent watson almost blushed at the compliment the compliment was that lanyon knew who watson was finlay lanyon continued youve not forgotten tomorrow night firmly etched in my diary malcolm excellent lanyon glanced over the table in fact id like you all to come just a little gathering at my house no real reason for it i just felt like having a party eight oclock very casual he was already moving off an arm around the porcelain waist of his companion rebus caught his final words his address heriot row one of the most exclusive streets in the new town this was a new world although he couldnt be sure that the invitation was serious rebus was tempted to take it up once in a lifetime and all that a little later conversation moved to the antidrugs campaign itself and the waiter brought more bread bread the nervous young man said carrying another bound file of newspapers over to the counter where holmes stood thats what worries me everybodys turning into a bread head you know nothing matters to them except getting more than anyone else guys i went to school with knew by the age of fourteen that they wanted to be bankers or accountants or economists lives were over before theyd begun these are may what holmes was shifting his weight from one leg to another why couldnt they have chairs in this place he had been here over an hour his fingers blackened by old newsprint as he flicked through each days editions one daytime one evening now and then a headline or some football story hed missed first time around would attract his attention but soon enough he had tired and now it was merely routine whats more his arms were aching from all that page turning may the youth explained these are the may editions right thanks finished with june yes thanks the youth nodded buckled shut two leather straps on the open end of the bound file and heaved the whole up into his arms shuffling out of the room here we go again thought holmes unbuckling this latest batch of old news and space fillers rebus had been wrong there had been no old retainer to act as a computer memory and no computer either so it was down to hard graft and page turning looking for photographs of familiar places made fresh through the use of odd camera angles why he didnt know even that yet and the thought frustrated him hed find out later this afternoon hopefully when he met with rebus there was a shuffling sound again as the youth reentered arms dangling now jaw hanging so why didnt you do the same as your friends holmes said conversationally you mean go in for banking the youth wrinkled his nose wanted something different im learning journalism got to start somewhere havent you indeed you have thought holmes turning another page indeed you have well its a start said mccall rising they were crumpling their used napkins tossing them onto the dishevelled tablecloth what had once been pristine was now covered with breadcrumbs and splashes of wine a dark patch of butter a single dripped coffee stain rebus felt woozy as he pulled himself out of the chair and full his tongue was furred from too much wine and coffee and that cognac christ now these men were about to go back to work or so they claimed rebus too he had a meeting at three with holmes didnt he but it was already gone three oh well holmes wouldnt complain couldnt complain thought rebus smugly not a bad spread that said carew patting his girth rebus couldnt be sure whether this or the food itself was the spread he meant and we covered a lot of ground said watson lets not forget that indeed not said mccall a very useful meeting andrews had insisted on paying the bill a good three figures worth by rebuss hasty calculation andrews was studying the bill now lingering over each item as though checking it against his own mental price list not only a businessman thought rebus unkindly but a bloody good scot then andrews called over the brisk maitre d and told him quietly about one item for which they had been overcharged the maitre d took andrews word for it and altered the bill there and then with his own ballpoint pen apologising unreservedly the restaurant was just beginning to empty a nice lunch hour over for all the diners rebus felt sudden guilt overwhelm him he had just eaten and drunk his share of about two hundred pounds forty quids worth in other words some had dined better and were noisily laughingly making their way out of the dining room old stories cigars red faces mccall put an unwelcome arm around rebuss back nodding towards the leavetaking if there were only fifty tory voters left in scotland john theyd all be in this room i believe it said rebus andrews turning from the maitre d had heard them i thought there were only fifty tories left up here he said there rebus noted were those quiet confident smiles again i have eaten ashes for bread he thought ashes for bread cigar ash burned red all around him and for a moment he thought he might be sick but then mccall stumbled and rebus had to hold him up until he found his balance bit too much to drink tommy said carew just need a breath of air said mccall johnll help me wont you john of course said rebus glad of this excuse for the very thing he needed mccall turned back towards carew got your new car with you carew shook his head i left it in the garage mccall nodding turned to rebus the flash buggers just bought himself a vtwelve jag he explained nearly forty thousand and im not talking about miles on the clock one of the waiters was standing by the lift nice to have seen you gentlemen again he said his voice as automatic as the lift doors which closed when rebus and mccall stepped inside i must have arrested him some time rebus said because ive never been here before so he cant have seen me here before this place is nothing said mccall screwing up his face nothing you want some fun you should come to the club one night just say youre a friend of finlays thatll get you in great place it is i might do that said rebus as the lift doors opened just as soon as my cummerbund comes back from the dry cleaners mccall laughed all the way out of the building holmes was stiff as he left the building by its staff entrance the youth having shown him through the maze of corridors had already turned back inside hands in pockets whistling holmes wondered if he really would end up with a career in journalism stranger things had happened he had found the photographs he wanted one in each of three consecutive wednesday daytimes editions from these the photographic library had traced the originals and on the backs of the originals was the same golden rectangular sticker denoting that the photos were the property of jimmy hutton photographic studios the stickers bless them even mentioned an address and phone number so holmes allowed himself the luxury of a stretch cracking his spine back into some semblance of shape he thought about treating himself to a pint but after leaning over the study table for the best part of two hours the last thing he wanted to do was lean against a bar as he drank besides it was three fifteen he was already thanks to a quickwitted but slowmoving photo library late for his meeting his first with inspector rebus he didnt know how rebus stood on the issue of punctuality he feared the stand would be hard well if the days work so far didnt cheer him up he wasnt human but then that was the rumour anyway not that holmes believed rumours well not always as it turned out rebus was the later of the two for the meeting though he had phoned ahead to apologise which was something holmes was seated in front of rebuss desk when rebus finally arrived pulling off rather a gaudy tie and dumping it into a drawer only then did he turn to holmes stare at him smile and stretch out a hand which holmes accepted well thats something thought rebus hes not a mason either your first name is brian isnt it said rebus sitting down thats right sir good ill call you brian and you can keep on calling me sir that seem fair enough holmes smiled very fair sir right any progress so holmes started at the beginning as he spoke he noticed that rebus though trying his damnedest to be attentive was drowsy his breath across the table was strongsmelling whatever hed had for lunch had agreed with him too well finishing his report he waited for rebus to speak rebus merely nodded and was silent for some time collecting his thoughts holmes felt the need to fill the vacuum whats the problem sir if you dont mind my asking youve every right to ask said rebus at last but he stopped at that well sir im not sure brian thats the truth okay heres what i know and i stress know because theres plenty i think which isnt quite the same thing in this case there is a case then you tell me as soon as youve listened and it was rebuss turn to make his report of sorts fixing it again in his mind as he told the story but it was too fragmented too speculative he could see holmes struggling with the pieces trying to see the whole picture was there a picture there to see so you see rebus ended weve got a junkie full of poison selfinflicted someone who supplied the poison bruising on the body and the hint of a witchcraft connection weve got a missing camera a tie clip some photographs and a girlfriend being followed you see my problem too much to go on exactly so what do we do now that we caught rebuss attention for the first time he realised that he was no longer in this alone whatever this was the thought cheered him a little though the hangover was starting now the sleepy slow thumping either side of his forehead im going to see a man about a coven he said sure now of the next steps and youre going to visit huttons photographic studios that sounds reasonable said holmes so it bloody well should said rebus im the one with the brains brian youre the one with the shoeleather call me later on to let me know how you get on meantime bugger off rebus didnt mean to be unkind but there had been something just too cosy and conspiratorial in the younger mans tone towards the end and hed felt the need to reestablish boundaries his own mistake he realised as the door closed behind holmes his own mistake for coming on so chattily for telling all for confiding and for using holmess first name that bloody lunch had been to blame call me finlay call me james call me tommy never mind it would all work out they had begun well then less well things could only get worse which was fine by rebus he enjoyed a measure of antagonism of competition they were distinct bonuses in this line of work so rebus was a bastard after all brian holmes stalked out of the station with hands in pockets tightened to fists knuckles red youre the one with the shoeleather that had really brought him down with a thump just when hed thought they were getting on so well almost like human beings rather than coppers shouldve known better brian and as for the reason behind all this work well it hardly bore thinking about it was so flimsy so personal to rebus it wasnt police work at all it was an inspector with nothing to do for a while trying to fill the time by playing at being philip marlowe jesus they both had better things they could be doing well holmes did anyway he wasnt about to head some cushy antidrugs campaign and what a choice rebus was for that brother inside peterhead doing time for pushing biggest dealer in fife hed been that should have screwed up rebuss career forever and anon but instead theyd given him promotion a naughty world all right he had to visit a photographer maybe he could get some passport shots done at the same time pack his bags and fly off to canada australia the states sod his flat hunting sod the police force and sod detective inspector john rebus and his witch hunt there it was done rebus found some aspirin in one of his chaotic drawers and crunched them to a bitter powder as he made his way downstairs bad mistake they removed every fleck of saliva from his mouth and he couldnt even swallow couldnt speak the desk sergeant was sipping a polystyrene beaker of tea rebus grabbed it from him and gulped at the tepid liquid then squirmed how much sugar did you put in that jack if id known you were coming to tea john id have made it just the way you like it the desk sergeant always had a smart answer and rebus could never think of a smarter rejoinder he handed back the cup and walked away feeling the sugar cloy inside him ill never touch another drop he was thinking as he started his car honest to god only the occasional glass of wine allow me that but no more indulgence and no more mixing wine and spirits okay so give me a break god and lift this hangover i only drank the one glass of cognac maybe two glasses of claret one of chablis one gin and tonic it was hardly the stuff of legend hardly a case for the detox ward the roads were quiet though which was a break not enough of a break but a break so he made good time to pilmuir and then remembered that he didnt know where charlie boy lived charlie the person he needed to talk to if he was going to find an address for a coven a white coven he wanted to doublecheck the witchcraft story he wanted to doublecheck charlie too come to that but he didnt want charlie to know he was being checked the witchcraft thing niggled rebus believed in good and evil and believed stupid people could be attracted towards the latter he understood pagan religions well enough had read about them in books too thick and intense for their own good he didnt mind people worshipping the earth or whatever it all came down to the same thing in the end what he did mind was people worshipping evil as a force and as more than a force as an entity especially he disliked the idea of people doing it for kicks without knowing or caring what it was they were involved in people like charlie he remembered that book of giger prints again satan poised at the centre of a pair of scales flanked by a naked woman left and right the women were being penetrated by huge drills satan was a goats head in a mask but where would charlie be now hed find out stop and ask knock on doors hint at retribution should information be withheld hed act the big bad policeman if that was what it took he didnt need to do anything as it happened he just had to find the police constables who were loitering outside one of the boardedup houses not too far from where ronnie had died one of the constables held a radio to his mouth the other was writing in a notebook rebus stopped his car stepped out then remembered something leaned back into the car and drew his keys from out of the ignition you couldnt be too careful around here a second later he actually locked his drivers side door too he knew one of the constables it was harry todd one of the men who had found ronnie todd straightened when he saw rebus but rebus waved this acknowledgment aside so todd continued with his radio conversation rebus concentrated on the other officer instead whats the score here the constable turned from his writing to give rebus that suspicious nearhostile look almost unique to the constabulary inspector rebus rebus explained he was wondering where todds irish sidekick orourke was oh said the constable well he started to put away his pen we were called to a domestic sir in this house a real screaming match but by the time we got here the man had fled the woman is still inside shes got herself a black eye nothing more not really your territory sir is that right said rebus well thank you for telling me sonny its nice to be told what is and isnt my territory thank you so much now may i have your permission to enter the premises the constable was blushing furiously his cheeks an almighty red against his bloodless face and neck no even his neck was blushing now rebus enjoyed that he didnt even mind that behind the constable but in full view of rebus himself todd was smirking at this encounter well rebus prompted sorry sir said the constable right said rebus walking towards the door but before he reached it it was opened from the inside and there stood tracy both eyes reddened from crying one eye bruised a deep blue she didnt seem surprised to see rebus standing in front of her she seemed relieved and threw herself at him hugging him her head against his chest the tears beginning all over again rebus startled and embarrassed returned the embrace only lightly with a patting of his hands on her back a fathers there there to a frightened child he turned his head to look at the constables who were pretending to have noticed nothing then a car drew up beside his own and he saw tony mccall put on his handbrake before pushing open the drivers door stepping out and seeing rebus there and the girl rebus laid his hands on tracys arms and pushed her away from him a little but still retaining that contact between them his hands her arms she looked at him and began to fight against the tears finally she pulled one arm away so that she could wipe her eyes then the other arm relaxed and rebuss hand fell from it the contact broken for now john it was mccall close behind him yes tony why is it my patch has suddenly become your patch just passing said rebus the interior of the house was surprisingly neat and tidy there were numerous if uncoordinated sticks of furniture two wellworn settees a couple of dining chairs trellis table half a dozen pouffes burst at the seams and oozing stuffing and most surprising of all the electricity was connected wonder if the electric board know about that said mccall as rebus switched on the downstairs lights for all its trappings the place had an air of impermanence there were sleeping bags laid out on the livingroom floor as though ready for any stray waifs and passersby tracy went to one of the settees and sat down wrapping her hands around her knees is this your place tracy said rebus knowing the answer no its charlies how long have you known i only found out today he moves around all the time it wasnt easy tracking him down it didnt take you long she shrugged her shoulders what happened i just wanted to talk to him about ronnie mccall watched rebus as he said this mccall was concentrating now aware that rebus was trying to fill him in on the situation while at the same time questioning tracy tracy nodded stupid maybe but i needed to talk to someone and and we got into an argument he started it told me i was the cause of ronnies death she looked up at them not pleadingly but just to show that she was sincere its not true but charlie said i should have looked after ronnie stopped him taking the stuff got him away from pilmuir how could i have done that he wouldnt have listened to me i thought he knew what he was doing nobody could tell him otherwise is that what you told charlie she smiled no i only thought of it just now thats what always happens isnt it you only think of the clever comeback after the arguments finished i know what you mean love said mccall so you started a slanging match i never started the slanging match she roared at rebus okay he said quietly charlie started shouting at you and you shouted back then he hit you yes yes she seemed subdued and maybe rebus prompted you hit him back i gave as good as i got thats my girl said mccall he was touring the room turning up cushions on the settees opening old magazines crouching to pat each sleeping bag dont patronise me you bastard said tracy mccall paused looked up surprised then smiled and patted the next sleeping bag along ahha he said lifting the sleeping bag and shaking it a small polythene bag fell out onto the floor he picked it up satisfied a little bit of blaw he said makes a house into a home eh i dont know anything about that said tracy looking at the bag we believe you said rebus charlie did a runner then yes the neighbours mustve phoned for the pigs i mean the police she averted her eyes from them weve been called worse said mccall havent we john thats for sure so the constables arrived at one door and charlie left by another right out of the back door yes well said rebus while were here we might as well have a look at his room if such a thing exists good idea said mccall pocketing the polythene bag theres no smoke without fire charlie had a room all right it consisted of a single sleeping bag a desk anglepoise lamp and more books than rebus had ever seen in such an enclosed space they were piled against the walls reaching in precarious pillars from floor to ceiling many were library books well overdue must owe the city fathers a small fortune said mccall there were books on economics politics and history as well as learned and not so learned tomes on demonism devil worship and witchcraft there was little fiction and most of the books had been read thoroughly with much underlining and pencilled marginalia on the desk sat a halfcompleted essay part of charlies university course work no doubt it seemed to be trying to link magick to modern society but was mostly to rebuss eye rambling nonsense hello this was shouted from downstairs as the two constables started to climb the staircase hello yourselves mccall called back then he shook the contents of a large supermarket carrier bag onto the floor so that pens toy cars cigarette papers a wooden egg a spool of cotton a personal cassette player a swiss army knife and a camera fell out mccall stooped to pick up the camera between thumb and middle finger nice model thirtyfivemillimetre slr good make he gestured with it towards rebus who took it from him having first produced a handkerchief from his pocket with which he held it rebus turned towards tracy who was standing against the door with her arms folded she nodded back at him yes she said thats ronnies camera the constables were at the top of the stairs now rebus accepted mccalls offer of the supermarket carrier and dropped the camera into it careful not to mess up any prints todd he said to the constable he knew take this young lady down to great london road station tracys mouth opened its for your own protection rebus said go on with them ill see you later soon as i can she still seemed ready to voice a complaint but thought better of it nodded and turned leaving the room rebus listened as she went downstairs accompanied by the officers mccall was still searching though without real concern two finds were quite enough to be going on with no smoke without fire he said i had lunch with tommy today said rebus my brother tommy mccall looked up rebus nodded then thats one up to you hes never taken me to lunch these past fifteen years we were at the eyrie now mccall whistled to do with watsons antidrugs campaign yes tommys shelling out for it isnt he ach i shouldnt be hard on him hes done me a few favours in his time he had a few too many mccall laughed gently he hasnt changed then still he can afford it that transport company of his it runs itself he used to be there twentyfour hours a day fiftytwo weeks of the year nowadays he can take off as long as he likes his accountant once told him to take a year off can you imagine that for tax purposes if only we had those kinds of problem eh john youre right there tony rebus was still holding the supermarket bag mccall nodded towards it does this tie it up it makes things a bit clearer said rebus i might get it checked for prints i can tell you what youll find said mccall the deceaseds and this guy charlies youre forgetting someone who you tony you picked the camera up with your fingers remember ah sorry i didnt think never mind anyway its something isnt it something to celebrate i mean i dont know about you but im starved as they left the room one pillar of books finally gave way slewing down across the floor like dominoes waiting to be shuffled rebus opened the door again to look in ghosts said mccall thats all just ghosts it wasnt much to look at not what hed been expecting okay so there was a potted plant in one corner and black roller blinds over the windows and even a word processor gathering dust on a newish plastic desk but it was still the second floor of a tenement still designed as somebodys home and never meant to be used as office studio workplace holmes gave the room the socalled front office a tour as the cute little schoolleaver went off to fetch his highness that was what shed called him if your staff didnt hold you in esteem or at the very least in frightened awe there was something wrong with you certainly as the door opened and his highness walked in it was evident to holmes that there was something wrong with jimmy hutton for a start he was the other side of fifty yet what hair he still had was long thin strands covering his forehead almost down to his eyes he was also wearing denims a mistake easily made by those aspiring to youth from the wrong side and he was short five foot two or three now holmes began to see the relevance of the secretarys pun his highness indeed he had a harassed look on his face but had left the camera through in the back bedroom or box room or whichever room of the smallish flat served as his studio he stuck out a hand and holmes shook it detective constable holmes he announced hutton nodded took a cigarette from the packet on his secretarys desk and lit it she frowned openly at this as she sat down again smoothing her tight skirt beneath her hutton had not yet looked at holmes his eyes seemed to be mirroring some distraction in his mind he went to the window looked out arched his neck to blow a plume of smoke towards the high dark ceiling then let his head go limp leaning against the wall get me a coffee christine his eyes met holmess momentarily do you want one holmes shook his head sure said christine kindly rising out of her seat again okay then thanks with a smile she left the room off to the kitchen or darkroom to fill a kettle so said hutton what can i do for you that was another thing about the man his voice was high not shrill or girlish just high and slightly rasping as though he had damaged his vocal cords at some point in his youth and they had never recovered mr hutton holmes needed to be sure hutton nodded jimmy hutton professional photographer at your service youre getting married and you want me to do you a discount no nothing like that a portrait then girlfriend perhaps mum and dad no this is business im afraid my business that is but no new business for me right hutton smiled chanced another glance towards holmes drew on his cigarette again i could do a portrait of you you know nice strong chin decent cheekbones with the proper lighting no thanks i hate having my picture taken im not talking about pictures hutton was moving now circling the desk im talking about art thats why i came here actually what art i was impressed by some of your photos i saw in a newspaper i was wondering whether you might be able to help me oh its a missing person holmes was not a great liar his ears tingled when he told a real whopper not a great liar but a good one a young man called ronnie mcgrath name doesnt mean anything he wanted to be a photographer thats why i was wondering wondering what if hed ever come to you you know asking advice that sort of thing youre an established name after all it was almost too blatant holmes could sense it could sense hutton just about realising what the game was but vanity won in the end well the photographer said leaning against the desk folding his arms crossing his legs sure of himself what did he look like this ronnie tallish short brown hair liked to do studies you know the sort of thing the castle calton hill are you a photographer yourself inspector im only a constable holmes smiled pleased by the error then caught himself what if hutton were trying to play the vanity game with him and no ive never really done much photography holiday snaps that sort of thing sugar christine put her head around the door smiling at holmes again no thanks he said just milk put a drop of whisky in mine said hutton theres a love he winked towards the door as it closed again sounds familiar i have to admit ronnie studies of the castle yes yes i do remember some young guy coming in bloody pest he was i was doing a portfolio some longterm stuff mind had to be one hundred percent on the job he was always coming round asking to see me wanting to show me his work hutton raised his hands apologetically i mean we were all young once i wish i could have helped him but i didnt have the time not right then you didnt look at his work no no time as i say he stopped coming by after a few weeks how long ago was this few months three or four the secretary appeared with their coffees holmes could smell the whisky wafting out of huttons mug and was jealous and repelled in equal measure still the interview was going well enough time for a side road thanks christine he said seeming to please her with the familiarity she sat down not drinking herself and lit a cigarette he thought for a moment of reaching out to light it for her but held back look said hutton id like to be of assistance but youre a busy man holmes nodded agreement i really do appreciate your giving me any time at all anyway that just about wraps it up he took a scalding mouthful of coffee but dared not spit it back into the mug so swallowed hard instead right said hutton rising from the edge of the desk oh said holmes just one thing curiosity really but is there any chance i could have a peek at your studio ive never been in a proper studio before hutton looked at christine who muffled a smile behind her fingers as she pretended to puff on her cigarette sure he said smiling himself why not come on the room was large but otherwise pretty much as holmes had expected excepting one significant detail half a dozen different types of camera stood on half a dozen tripods there were photographs covering three of the walls and against the fourth was a large white backcloth looking suspiciously like a bedsheet this was all obvious enough however in front of the backcloth had been arranged the set for huttons present portfolio two large freestanding sections painted pink and in front of these was a chair against which arms folded stood a young blonde and boredlooking man a man who was naked detective holmes this is arnold said hutton by way of introduction arnold is a male model nothing wrong is there holmes who had been staring now tried not to the blood was rising to his face he turned to hutton no no nothing hutton went to one camera and bent down to squint through the viewfinder aiming in arnolds general direction not at head height the male nude can be quite exquisite hutton was saying nothing photographs quite as well as the human body he clicked the shutter ran the film on clicked again then looked up at holmes smiling at the policemans discomfort what will you do with the holmes searched for some decorous word i mean what are they for my portfolio i told you to show to possible future clients right holmes nodded to show he understood i am an artist you see as well as a portrait snapper right holmes said nodding again not against the law is it i dont think so he went to the heavily draped window and peeked out through a slight opening not unless it disturbs the neighbours hutton laughed even the sober face of the model opened in a momentary grin they queue up said hutton coming to the window and peering out thats why i had to put up the curtains dirty buggers that they were women and men crammed into the width of a window he pointed to a topstorey window in the tenement across the way there i caught them one day took a couple of quick shots of them with the motordrive they didnt like that he turned away from the window holmes was browsing along the walls picking out this and that photograph and nodding praise towards hutton who lapped it up and began to walk with him pointing out this or that angle or trick thats good said holmes gesturing towards one shot of edinburgh castle bathed in mist it was almost identical to the one he had seen in the newspaper which made it a very near relative to the one in ronnies bedroom hutton shrugged thats nothing he said resting a hand on holmess shoulder here have a look at some of my nude work there was a cluster of a dozen black and white tenbyeights pinned to the wall in one corner of the room men and women not all of them young or pretty but well enough taken artistic even holmes supposed these are just the best said hutton the best or the most tasteful holmes tried not to make the remark sound judgmental but even so huttons good humour vanished he went to a large chest of drawers and pulled open the bottom one scooping up an armful of photographs which he threw to the floor have a look he said theres no porn nothing sleazy or disgusting or obscene theyre just bodies posed bodies holmes stood over the photographs not seeming to pay them any attention im sorry he said if i seemed forget it hutton turned away so that his face was towards the male model he rubbed at his eyes shoulders slumped im just tired i didnt mean to snap like that just tired holmes stared at arnold over huttons shoulder then because there was no way it could be done stealthily bent down picked out a photograph from the selection on the floor and coming upright again stuffed the photo into his jacket arnold saw of course and holmes just had time to wink at him conspiratorially before hutton turned back towards him people imagine its easy just taking photos all day hutton said holmes risked a look over the mans shoulder and saw arnold wag an admonitory finger but he was smiling archly he wasnt about to tell youre thinking all the time hutton went on every waking minute of every day every time you look at something every time you use your eyes everythings material you see holmes was at the door now not about to linger yes well id better let you get on he said oh said hutton as though coming out of a dream right thanks for all your help not at all bye arnold holmes called then pulled the door shut behind him and was gone back to work said hutton he stared at the photographs on the floor give me a hand with these arnold youre the boss as they began to scoop the photos back into the drawer hutton commented nice enough bloke for a copper yes said arnold standing naked with his hands full of paper he didnt look like one of the dirty raincoat brigade did he and though hutton asked him what he meant arnold just shrugged it wasnt his business after all it was a shame though the policeman being interested in women a waste of a goodlooking man holmes stood outside for a minute for some reason he was trembling as though a small motor had stuck somewhere inside him he touched a hand to his chest slight heart murmur nothing more everybody got them didnt they he felt as though he had just committed some petty crime which he supposed really he had he had taken someones property away without their knowledge or consent wasnt that theft as a child he had stolen from shops always throwing away whatever he stole ach all kids did it didnt they didnt they he brought from his pocket the gains from this latest pilfering the photograph was curled now but he straightened it between his hands a woman pushing a pram past him glanced at the photograph then hurried on throwing back a disgusted look towards him its all right madam im a police officer he smiled at the thought then studied the nude shot again it was mildly salacious nothing more a young woman stretched out on what appeared to be silk or satin photographed from above as she lay spreadeagled on this sheet her mouth open in an amateurs pout eyes narrowed to slits of fake ecstasy all this was common enough more interesting though was the models identity for holmes was sure it was the girl tracy the one whose photograph he already had from the squat the one whose background he was trying to ascertain the girlfriend of the deceased posed for the camera uncovered not at all shy and enjoying herself what was it that kept bringing him back to this house rebus wasnt sure he turned his torch onto charlies wall painting again trying to make sense of the mind that had created it but why did he want to try to understand a piece of jetsam like charlie anyway perhaps because of the nagging feeling that he was absolutely integral to the case what case there he had actually finally said it aloud what case there was no case not in the sense in which any criminal court would understand the term there were personalities misdeeds questions without answers illegalities even but there was no case that was the frustrating thing if there were only a case only something structured enough tangible enough for him to hold on to some casenotes which he could physically hold up and say look here it is but there was nothing like that it was all as insubstantial as candle wax but candle wax left its mark didnt it and nothing ever vanished not totally instead things altered shape substance meaning a fivepointed star within two concentric circles was nothing in itself to rebus it looked like nothing so much as a tin sheriffs badge hed had as a boy lawman of the texas tin badge state capfiring sixgun in his plastic holster to others it was evil itself he turned his back on it remembering how proudly he had worn that badge and went upstairs here was where the tie clip had lain past it he entered ronnies bedroom and walked over to the window peering out through a chink in the boards covering the glass the car had drawn up now not too far from his own the car that had followed him from the station the car he had recognised at once as the ford escort which had waited outside his flat the one which had roared away now it was here parked next to the burntout cortina it was here its driver was here the car itself was empty he heard the floorboard creak just the once and knew that the man was behind him you must know this place pretty well he said you managed to miss most of the noisy ones he turned from the window and shone his torch onto the face of a young man with short dark hair the man shielded his eyes from the beam and rebus angled the light down onto the mans body it was dressed in a police constables uniform you must be neil said rebus calmly or do you prefer neilly he levelled the torch at the floor there was enough light for him to see and be seen by the young man nodded neils fine only my friends call me neilly and im not your friend rebus said nodding acquiescence ronnie was though wasnt he he was more than that inspector rebus said the constable moving into the room he was my brother there was nowhere in ronnies bedroom for them to sit but that didnt matter since neither could have sat still for more than a second or two anyway they were filled with energy neil needing to tell his story rebus needing to be told rebus chose in front of the window as his territory and paced backwards and forwards without seeming to his head down stopping from time to time to lend more concentration to neils words neil stayed by the door swinging the handle to and fro listening for that moment before the whole door creaked and then pulling or pushing the door through that slow rending sound the torch served the scene well casting unruly shadows over the walls making silhouettes of each mans profile the talker and the listener sure i knew what he was up to neil said he may have been older than me but i always knew him better than he knew me i mean i knew how his mind worked so you knew he was a junkie i knew he took drugs he started when we were at school he was caught once almost expelled they let him back in after three months so he could do his exams he passed the lot of them thats more than i did yes rebus thought admiration could make you turn a blind eye he ran away after the exams we didnt hear anything from him for months my mum and dad almost went crazy then they just shut him out completely switched off it was like he didnt exist i wasnt supposed to mention him in the house but he got in touch with you yes wrote a letter to me care of a pal of mine clever move that so i got the letter without mum and dad knowing he told me he had come to edinburgh that he liked it better than stirling that he had a job and a girlfriend that was it no address or phone number did he write often now and then he lied a lot made things seem better than they were said he couldnt come back to stirling until he had a porsche and a flat so he could prove something to mum and dad then he stopped writing i left school and joined the police and came to edinburgh not straight away but yes eventually specifically to find him neil smiled not a bit of it i was forgetting him too i had my own life to think about so what happened i caught him one night out on my regular beat what beat is that exactly im based out at musselburgh musselburgh not exactly walking distance of here is it so what do you mean caught him well not caught since he wasnt really doing anything but he was high as a kite and hed been bashed up a bit did he tell you what hed been doing no i could guess though what acting as a punchbag for some of the rough traders around calton hill funny someone else mentioned that it happens quick money for people who dont give a shit and ronnie didnt give a shit sometimes he did other times i dont know maybe i didnt know his mind as well as i thought so you started to visit him i had to help him home that first night i came back the next day he was surprised to see me didnt even remember that id helped him home the previous night did you try to get him off drugs neil was silent the door creaked on its hinges at the beginning i did he said at last but he seemed to be in control that sounds stupid i know after what ive said about finding him in such a state that first night but it was his choice after all as he kept reminding me what did he think of having a brother in the force he thought it was funny mind you i never came round here with my uniform on not till tonight thats right anyway yes i visited a few times we stayed up here mostly he didnt want the others to see me he was afraid theyd smell pork it was rebuss turn to smile you didnt happen to follow tracy did you whos tracy ronnies girlfriend she turned up at my flat last night some men had been following her neil shook his head wasnt me but you were at my flat last night yes and you were here the night ronnie died it was blunt but necessarily so neil stopped playing with the door handle was silent this time for twenty or thirty seconds then took a deep breath for a while i was yes you left this behind rebus held out the shiny clip but neil couldnt quite make it out in the torchlight not that he needed to see it to know what it was my tie clip i wondered about that my tie had broken that day it was in my pocket rebus made no attempt to hand over the clip instead he put it back in his pocket neil just nodded understanding why did you start following me i wanted to talk to you i just couldnt pluck up the courage you didnt want news of ronnies death getting back to your parents yes i thought maybe you wouldnt be able to trace his identity but you did i dont know what itll do to my mum and dad i think at worst itll make them happy because theyll know they were right all along right not to give him a seconds thought and at best best neil stared through the gloom searching out rebuss eyes theres no best i suppose not said rebus but theyve still got to be told i know ive always known then why follow me because now youre closer to ronnie than i am i dont know why youre so interested in him but you are and that interests me i want you to find whoever sold him that poison i intend to son dont worry and i want to help thats the first stupid thing youve said which isnt bad going for a pc truth is neil youd be the biggest bloody nuisance i could ask for ive got all the help i need for now too many cooks eh something like that rebus decided that the confession was ending that there was little left to be said he came away from the window and walked to the door stopping in front of neil youve already been a bigger nuisance than i needed its not pork i can smell off you its fish herrings to be precise and guess what colour they are what red son red there was a noise from downstairs pressure on floorboards better than an infrared alarm anyday rebus turned off the torch stay here he whispered then he went to the top of the stairs whos there a shadow appeared below him he switched on the torch and shone it into tony mccalls squinting face christ tony rebus started downstairs what a fright i knew id find you here said mccall i just knew it his voice was nasal and rebus reckoned that since the time theyd parted some three hours before mccall had kept on drinking he stopped on the staircase then turned and headed back up where are you going now called mccall just shutting the door said rebus closing the bedroom door leaving neil inside dont want the ghosts to catch cold do we mccall was chuckling as rebus headed downstairs again thought we might have a wee snifter he said and none of that bloody alcoholfree stuff you were quaffing before fair enough said rebus expertly manoeuvring mccall out of the front door lets do that and he locked the door behind him figuring that ronnies brother would know of the many easy ways in and out of the house everybody else seemed to know them after all everybody wherell it be said rebus i hope you didnt drive here tony got a patrol car to drop me off fine well take my car then we could drive down to leith no i fancy something more central there are a few good pubs in regent road by calton hill mccall was amazed christ john i can think of better places to go for a drink i cant said rebus come on nell stapleton was holmess girlfriend holmes had always preferred tall women tracing the fixation back to his mother who had been five foot ten nell was nearly three quarters of an inch taller than holmess mother but he still loved her nell was more intelligent than holmes or as he liked to think they were more intelligent than one another in different ways nell could crack the guardian cryptic crossword in under quarter of an hour on a good day but she had trouble with arithmetic and remembering names both strengths possessed by holmes people said they looked good together in public looked comfortable with one another which was probably true they felt good together too living as they did by several simple rules no talk of marriage no thoughts of children no hinting at living together and definitely no cheating nell worked as a librarian at edinburgh university a vocation holmes found handy today for example he had asked her to find him some books on the occult she had done even better locating a thesis or two which he could read on the premises if he wished she also had a printed bibliography of relevant materials which she handed to him in the pub when they met that evening the bridge of sighs was at a midweek and midevening cusp as were most of the city centre bars the justoneafterwork brigade had slung their jackets over their arms and headed off while the revitalised nighttime crowd had yet to catch their buses from the housing estates into the middle of town nell and holmes sat at a comer table away from the video games but a bit too close to one of the hifi systems loudspeakers holmes at the bar to buy another half for himself an orange juice and perrier for nell asked if the volume could be turned down sorry cant the customers like it we are the customers holmes persisted youll have to speak to the manager fine hes not in yet holmes shot the young barmaid a filthy look before turning towards his table what he saw made him pause nell had opened his briefcase and was examining the photograph of tracy who is she nell said closing the case as he placed her drink on the table part of a case im working on he said frostily sitting down who said you could open my briefcase rule seven brian no secrets all the same pretty isnt she what i havent really ive seen her around the university he was interested now you have mmm in the library cafeteria i remember her because she always seemed a little bit older than the other students she was with shes a student then not necessarily anybody can go into the cafe its students only in the library itself but i cant recall having seen her there only in the cafe so whats she done nothing so far as i know so why is there a nude photo of her in your briefcase its part of this thing im doing for inspector rebus youre collecting dirty pictures for him she was smiling now and he smiled too the smile vanished as rebus and mccall walked into the pub laughing at some shared joke as they made for the bar holmes didnt want rebus and nell to meet he tried very hard to leave his police life behind him when he was spending the evening with her favours such as the occult booklist notwithstanding he was also planning to keep nell very much up his sleeve so that he could have a booklist ready to hand should rebus ever need such a thing now it looked as though rebus was going to spoil everything and there was something else another reason he didnt want rebus to come sauntering across to their table he was afraid rebus would call him shoeleather he kept his eyes to the table as rebus took in the bar with a single sweep of his head and was relieved when the two senior officers drinks purchased wandered off towards the distant pool table where they started another argument about who shouldnt and should provide the two twentypence pieces for the game whats wrong nell was staring at him to do so she had brought herself to his level her head resting against the table nothing he turned towards her offering the rest of the room a hard profile are you hungry i suppose so yes good me too i thought you said youd eaten not enough come on ill treat you to an indian let me finish my drink first she did so in three swallows and they left together the door swinging shut silently behind them heads or tails rebus asked mccall flipping a coin tails rebus examined the coin tails it is you break as mccall angled his cue down onto the table closing one eye as he concentrated on the distant triangle of balls rebus stared at the door of the bar fair enough he supposed holmes was off duty and had a girl with him too he supposed that gave him grounds for ignoring his senior officer perhaps there had been no progress nothing to report fair enough again but rebus couldnt help thinking that the whole thing was meant to be taken as a snub he had given holmes a mouthful earlier on and now holmes was sulking you to play john said mccall who had broken without potting right you are tony said rebus chalking the tip of his cue right you are mccall came to rebuss side as he was making ready to play this must be just about the only straight pub in the whole street he said quietly do you know what homophobia means tony dont get me wrong john said mccall straightening up and watching rebuss chosen ball miss the pocket i mean each to his own and all that but some of those pubs and clubs you seem to know a lot no not really its just what i hear who from mccall potted one striped ball then another come on john you know edinburgh as well as i do everybody knows the gay scene here like you said tony each to his own a voice suddenly sounded in rebuss mind youre the brother i never had no no shut that out hed been there too often before mccall missed on his next shot and rebus approached the table how come he said completely miscuing you can drink so much and play so well mccall chuckled alcohol cures the shakes he said so finish that pint and ill buy you another my treat james carew felt that he deserved his treat he had sold a substantial property on the outskirts of edinburgh to the financial director of a company new to scotland and a husband and wife architects partnership scottish in origin but now relocating from sevenoaks in kent had just made a rather better offer than expected for an estate of seven acres in the borders a good day by no means the best but nevertheless worthy of celebration carew himself owned a pied d terre in one of the loveliest of the new towns georgian streets and a farmhouse with some acreage on the isle of skye these were good days for him london was shifting north it seemed the incomers brimming with cash from properties sold in the southeast wanting bigger and better and prepared to pay he left his george street offices at six thirty and returned to his splitlevel flat flat it seemed an insult to term it such five bedrooms living room dining room two bathrooms adequate kitchen walkin cupboards the size of a decent hammersmith bedsit carew was in the right place the only place and the time was right too this was a year to be clutched embraced a year unlike any other he removed his suit in the master bedroom showered and changed into something more casual but without shrugging off the mark of wealth though he had walked home he would need the car for tonight it was garaged in a mews to the rear of his street the keys were hanging on their appointed hook in the kitchen was the jaguar an indulgence he smiled locking the flat as he left perhaps it was but then his list of indulgences was long and about to grow longer rebus waited with mccall until the taxi arrived he gave the driver mccalls address and watched the cab pull away damn he felt a little groggy himself he went back into the pub and headed for the toilets the bar was busier now the jukebox louder the bar staff had grown in strength from one to three and they were working hard to cope the toilets were a cool tiled haven free from much of the bars cigarette smoke pine disinfectant caught in rebuss nostrils as he leaned over into one of the sinks two fingers sought out his tonsils pausing there at the back of his throat until he retched bringing up half a pint of beer then another half he breathed deeply feeling a little better already then washed his face thoroughly with cold water drying himself off with a fistful of paper towels you all right the voice lacked real sympathy its owner had just pushed open the door to the gents and was already seeking the closest urinal never felt better said rebus thats good good he didnt know about that but at least his head was clearer the world more in focus he doubted if hed fail a breathalyser which was just as well since his next port of call was his car parked on a darkened side road he was still wondering how tony mccall shaky on his pins after half a dozen pints had managed to play pool with such a steady eye and steady hand the man was miraculous hed beaten rebus six straight games and rebus had been trying by the end hed really been trying after all it didnt look good when a man barely able to stand upright could pot ball after ball cleaning up and roaring to yet another victory it didnt look good it hadnt felt good it was eleven oclock perhaps a little early yet he allowed himself one cigarette in the stationary car window open picking up the sounds from the world around him the honest sounds of the late evening traffic heightened voices laughter the clatter of shoes on cobblestones one cigarette that was all then he started the car and slowly drove the half mile or so to his destination there was still some light in the sky typical of the edinburgh summer further north he knew it never got truly dark at this time of year but the night could be dark in other ways he spotted the first one on the pavement outside the scottish assembly building there was no reason for the teenager to be standing there it was an unlikely time of night to have arranged to meet friends and the nearest bus stop was a hundred yards further up waterloo place the lad stood there smoking one foot up behind him resting against the stone wall he watched rebus as the car slowly went past and even lowered his head forward a little so that he could peer in as though inspecting the driver rebus thought there was a smile there but couldnt be sure further along the road he turned the car and came back another car had stopped beside the boy and a conversation was taking place rebus kept driving two young men were talking together outside the scottish office building on this side of the road a little way past them a line of three cars stood outside calton cemetery rebus cruised one more circuit then parked near these cars and walked the night was fresh no cloud cover there was a slight breeze nothing more the lad outside the assembly building had gone off in the car no one stood there now rebus crossed the road stopped by the wall and waited biding his time he watched one or two cars drove past him slowly the drivers turning to stare at him but nobody stopped he tried memorising the number plates unsure why got a light mister he was young no more than eighteen or nineteen dressed in jeans training shoes a shapeless tshirt and denim jacket his hair had been razored short face cleanshaven but scarred with acne there were two gold studs in his left ear thanks he said as rebus held out a box of matches then whats happening then with an amused glance towards rebus before lighting the cigarette not much rebus said taking back the matchbox the young man blew smoke out through his nostrils he didnt seem about to go rebus wondered if there were any codes he should be using he felt clammy beneath his thin shirt despite the gooseflesh nah theres never much happens around here fancy a drink at this time whereabouts the young man nodded a vague direction calton cemetery you can always get a drink there no thanks anyway rebus was appalled to find himself blushing he hoped the street lighting would disguise it fair enough see you around then the young man was moving off yes rebus said relieved see you and thanks for the light rebus watched him go walking slowly purposefully turning from time to time at the sign of an approaching car a hundred yards or so on he crossed the road and began walking back paying rebus no attention his mind on other things it struck rebus that the boy was sad lonely certainly no hustler but no victim either rebus stared at the wall of calton cemetery broken only by its metal gates hed taken his daughter in there once to show her the graves of the famous david hume the publisher constable the painter david allan and the statue of abraham lincoln shed asked him about the men who walked briskly from the cemetery their heads bowed down one older man two teenagers rebus had wondered about them too but not too much no he couldnt do it couldnt go in there it wasnt that he was afraid jesus no not that not for one minute he was just he didnt know what but he was feeling giddy again unsteady on his pins ill go back to the car he thought he went back to the car he had been sitting in the drivers seat smoking another cigarette thoughtfully for about a minute before he caught sight of the figure out of the comer of his eye he turned and looked towards where the boy was seated no not seated crouching against a low wall rebus turned away and resumed smoking only then did the boy rise to his feet and walk towards the car he tapped on the passenger side window rebus took a deep breath before unlocking the door the boy got in without a word closing the door solidly behind him he sat there staring out through the windscreen silent rebus unable to think of a single sensible thing to say stayed silent too the boy cracked first hiya it was a mans voice rebus turned to examine the boy he was maybe sixteen dressed in leather jacket opennecked shirt torn jeans hello he said in reply got a cigarette rebus handed over the packet the boy took one and swopped the packet for a box of matches he inhaled the cigarette smoke deeply holding it for a long time then exhaling almost nothing of it back into the atmosphere take without give thought rebus the creed of the street so what are you up to tonight then the question had been on rebuss own lips but the boy had given voice to it just killing time said rebus i couldnt sleep the boy laughed harshly yeah couldnt sleep so you came for a drive got tired driving so you just happened to stop here this particular street this time of night then you went for a walk a stretch of the legs and came back to the car right youve been watching me rebus admitted i didnt need to watch you ive seen it all before how often often enough james the words were tough the voice was tough rebus had no cause to doubt the teenager certainly he was as dissimilar to the first boy as chalk to cheese the names not james he said of course it is everybodys called james makes it easier to remember a name even if you cant recall the face i see the boy finished the cigarette in silence then flicked it out of the window so whats it to be i dont know said rebus sincerely a drive maybe fuck that he paused seeming to change his mind okay lets drive to the top of calton hill take a look out over the water eh fine said rebus starting the car they drove up the steep and winding road to the top of the hill where the observatory and the folly a copy of one side of greeces parthenon sat silhouetted against the sky they were not alone at the top other darkened cars had parked facing across the firth of forth towards the dimly lit coast of fife rebus trying not to look too closely at the other cars decided to park at a discreet distance from them but the boy had other ideas stop next to that jag he ordered what a greatlooking car rebus felt his own car take the insult with as much pride as it could muster the brakes squealed in protest as he pulled to a halt he turned off the ignition what now he asked whatever you want said the boy cash on delivery of course of course what if we just talk depends on the kind of talk you want the dirtier it is the more itll cost i was just thinking about a guy i met here once not so long ago havent seen him around i was wondering what happened to him the boy suddenly placed his hand on rebuss crotch rubbing hard and fast against the material rebus stared at the hand for a full second before calmly but with a deliberate grip removing it the boy grinned leaning back in his seat whats his name james rebus tried to stop himself trembling his stomach was filling with bile ronnie he said at last clearing his throat not too tall dark hair quite short used to take a few pictures you know keen on photography the boys eyebrows rose youre a photographer are you like to take a few snaps i see he nodded slowly rebus doubted that he did see but wasnt about to say more than was necessary and yes that jag was nice newlooking paintwork brightly reflective someone with a bit of money and dear god why did he have an erection i think i know which ronnie you mean now said the boy i havent seen him around much myself so what can you tell me about him the boy was staring out of the windscreen again great view from here isnt it he said even at night especially at night amazing i hardly ever come here in the daytime it all looks so ordinary youre a copper arent you rebus looked towards him but the boy was still staring out of the windscreen smiling unconcerned thought you were he went on right from the start so why did you get in the car curious i suppose besides and now he looked towards rebus some of my best customers are officers of the law well thats none of my concern no it should be im underage you know i guessed yeah well the boy slumped in his seat putting his feet up on the dashboard for a moment rebus thought he was about to do something and jerked himself upright but the boy just laughed what did you think think i was going to touch you again eh no such luck james so what about ronnie rebus wasnt sure whether he wanted to punch this rather ugly little kid in the gut or take him to a good and a caring home but he knew above all that he wanted answers give me another ciggie rebus obliged ta why are you so interested in him because hes dead happens all the time he overdosed ditto the stuff was lethal the boy was silent for a moment now that is bad news has there been any poisoned stuff going around recently no he smiled again only good stuff got any on you rebus shook his head thinking i do want to punch him in the gut pity said the boy whats your name by the way no names james and no pack drill he put out his hand palm up i need some money i need some answers first so give me the questions but first a little goodwill eh the hand was still there expectant as any fathertobe rebus found a crumpled tenner in his jacket and handed it over the boy seemed satisfied this gets you the answers to two questions rebuss anger ignited it gets me as many answers as i want or so help me rough trade that your game the boy seemed unconcerned maybe hed heard it all before rebus wondered is there much rough stuff goes on he asked not much the boy paused but still too much ronnie was into it wasnt he thats your second question stated the boy and the answer is i dont know dont knows dont count said rebus and ive got plenty of questions left okay if thats the way the boy was reaching for the door handle ready to walk away from it all rebus grabbed him by the neck and brought his head down against the dashboard right between where both feet were still resting jesus christ the boy checked for blood on his forehead there was none rebus was pleased with himself maximum shock minimum visible damage you cant i can do anything i like son and that includes tipping you over the edge of the highest point in the city now tell me about ronnie i cant tell you about ronnie there were tears in his eyes now he rubbed at his forehead trying to erase the hurt i didnt know him well enough so tell me what you do know okay okay he sniffed wiping his nose on the sleeve of his jacket all i know is that a few friends of mine have gotten into a scene what scene i dont know something heavy they dont talk about it but the marks are there bruises cuts one of them ended up in the infirmary for a week said he fell down the stairs christ he looked like he fell down a whole highrise but nobodys talking there must be good money in it somewhere anything else it may not be important the kid had broken rebus could hear it in his voice hed talk from now till judgment day good rebus didnt have too many ears in this part of the city a fresh pair might make all the difference what he barked enjoying his role now photographs somebodys putting a whisper around that theres interest in photographs not faked ones either the real mccoy porn shots i suppose so the rumours have been a bit vague rumours get that way when theyve gone past being secondhand chinese whispers said rebus he was thinking this whole thing is like a game of chinese whispers everything at second and third remove nothing absolutely proof positive what never mind anything else the boy shook his head rebus reached into his pocket and to his own surprise found yet another tenner then he remembered that hed visited a cashpoint machine somewhere during the drinking session with mccall he handed the money over here and ill give you my name and phone number im always open to bits of information no matter how small sorry about your head by the way the boy took the money thats all right ive seen worse pay then he smiled can i give you a lift the bridges maybe no problem whats your name james really rebus was smiling yes really the boy was smiling too listen there is one other thing go ahead james its just a name ive been hearing maybe it doesnt mean anything yes hyde rebus frowned hide hide what no hyde hyde what about hyde i dont know like i said its just a name rebus gripped the steering wheel hyde hyde was that what ronnie had been telling tracy not just to hide but to hide from some man called hyde trying to think he found himself staring at the jag again or rather staring at the profile of the man in the drivers seat the man with his hand up around the neck of the much younger occupant of the passenger seat stroking and all the time talking in a low voice stroking talking all very innocent a wonder then that james carew of bowyer carew estate agents should look so startled when being stared at he returned the stare and found himself eye to eye with dectective inspector john rebus rebus was taking all this in as carew fumbled with his ignition key revved up the new v engine and reversed out of the car park as though cutty sark herself were after him hes in a hurry said james have you seen him before didnt really catch his face havent seen the car before though no well its a new car isnt it said rebus lazily starting his own the flat was still redolent of tracy she lingered in the living room and the bathroom he saw her with a towel falling down around her head legs tucked beneath her bringing him breakfast the dirty dishes were still lying beside his unmade bed she had laughed to find that he slept on a mattress on the floor just like in a squat she had said the flat seemed emptier now emptier than it had felt for a while and rebus could do with a bath he returned to the bathroom and turned the hot tap on he could still feel jamess hand on his leg in the living room he looked at a bottle of whisky for a full minute but turned his back on it and fetched a lowalcohol lager from the fridge instead the bath was filling slowly an archimedean screw would have been more efficient still it gave him time to make another telephone call to the station to check on how they were treating tracy the news was not good she was becoming irritable refusing to eat complaining of pains in her side appendicitis more likely cold turkey he felt a fair amount of guilt at not having gone to see her before now another layer of guilt wouldnt do any harm so he decided to put off the visit until morning just for a few hours he wanted to be away from it all all the sordid tinkering with other peoples lives his flat didnt feel so secure any more didnt feel like the castle it had been only a day or two ago and there was internal damage as well as the structural kind he was feeling soiled in the pit of his gut as though the city had scraped away a layer of its surface grime and forcefed him the lot to hell with it he was caught all right he was living in the most beautiful most civilised city in northern europe yet every day had to deal with its flipside with the minor matter of its animus animus now there was a word he hadnt used in a while he wasnt even sure now what it meant exactly but it sounded right he sucked from the beer bottle holding the foam in his mouth like a child playing with toothpaste this stuff was all foam no substance all foam now there was another idea he would put some foaming bath oil in the water bubblebath who the hell had given him this stuff oh yes gill templer he remembered now remembered the occasion too she had been gently chiding him about how he never cleaned the bath then had presented him with this bath oil it cleans you and your bath she had said reading from the bottle and puts the fun back into bathtime he had suggested that they test this claim together and they had jesus john youre getting morbid again just because shes gone off with some vacuumheaded disc jockey with the unlikely name of calum mccallum it wasnt the end of anybodys world the bombs werent falling there were no sirens in the sky nothing but ronnie tracy charlie james and the rest and now hyde rebus was beginning to know now the meaning of the term dead beat he rested his naked limbs in the nearscalding water and closed his eyes thursday that house of voluntary bondage with its inscrutable recluse dead beat holmes yawned again dead on his feet for once he had actually beaten the alarm so that he was returning to bed with instant coffee when the radio blared into action what a way to wake up every day when he had a spare half hour hed retune the bloody thing to radio three or something except he knew radio three would send him straight back to sleep whereas the voice of calum mccallum and the grating records he played in between hoots and jingles and enthusiastic bad jokes brought him awake with a jolt ready teeth gritted to face another day this morning he had beaten the smug little voice he switched the radio off here he said coffee and time to get up nell turned her head from the pillow squinting up at him has it gone nine not quite she turned back into the pillow again moaning softly good wake me up again when it does drink your coffee he chided touching her shoulder her shoulder was warm tempting he allowed himself a wistful smile then turned and left the bedroom he had gone ten paces before he paused turned and went back nells arms were long tanned and open in welcome despite the breakfast he had brought her in the cell tracy was furious with rebus and especially when he explained to her that she could leave whenever she wanted that she wasnt under arrest this is called protection he told her protection from the men who were chasing you protection from charlie charlie she calmed a little at the sound of his name and touched her bruised eye but why didnt you come to see me sooner she complained rebus shrugged things to do he said he stared at her photograph now while brian holmes sat on the other side of the desk warily sipping coffee from a chipped mug rebus wasnt sure whether he hated holmes or loved him for bringing this into the office for laying it flat on the desktop in front of him not saying a word no good morning no hail fellow well met just this this photograph this nude shot of tracy rebus had stared at it while holmes made his report holmes had worked hard yesterday and had achieved a result so why had he snubbed rebus in the bar if hed seen this picture last night it would not now be ruining his morning not now be eroding the memory of a good nights sleep rebus cleared his throat did you find out anything about her no sir said holmes all i got was that he nodded towards the photograph his eyes unblinking ive given you that what more do you want from me i see said rebus his voice level he turned the photo over and read the small label on the back hutton studios a business telephone number right well leave this with me brian ill have to give it some thought okay said holmes thinking he called me brian hes not thinking straight this morning rebus sat back sipping from his own mug coffee milk no sugar he had been disappointed when holmes had asked for his coffee the same way it gave them something in common a taste in coffee hows the househunting going he said conversationally grim how did you holmes remembered the houses for sale list folded in his jacket pocket like a tabloid newspaper he touched it now rebus smiled nodded i remember buying my flat he said i scoured those freesheets for weeks before i found a place i liked liked holmes snorted that would be a bonus the problem for me is just finding somewhere i can afford that bad is it havent you noticed holmes was slightly incredulous so involved was he in the game it was hard to believe that anyone wasnt prices are going through the roof in fact a roofs about all i can afford near the centre of the city yes i remember someone telling me about it rebus was thoughtful at lunch yesterday you know i was with the people putting up the money for farmer watsons drugs campaign one of them was james carew he wouldnt be anything to do with carew bowyers the head honcho do you want me to have a word see about a discount on your house holmes smiled some of the glacier between them had been chipped away that would be great he said maybe he could arrange for a summertime sale bargains in all departments holmes started this sentence with a grin but it trailed away with his words rebus wasnt listening was lost somewhere in thought yes rebus said quietly ive got to have a word with mr carew anyway oh to do with some soliciting thinking of moving houses yourself rebus looked at holmes not comprehending anyway he said i suppose we need a plan of attack for today ah holmes looked uncomfortable i wanted to ask you about that sir i had a phone call this morning ive been working for some months on a dogfighting ring and theyre about to arrest the gang dog fighting yes you know put two dogs in a ring let them tear each other to shreds place bets on the result i thought that died with the depression theres been a revival of late vicious it is too i could show you some photos why the revival who knows people looking for kicks something less tame than a bet at the bookies rebus was nodding now almost lost to his own thoughts again would you say it was a yuppie pursuit holmes holmes shrugged hes getting better stopped calling me by my first name well never mind so you want to be in on the arrest holmes nodded if possible sir entirely possible said rebus so wheres it all happening i still have to check that out somewhere in fife though fife home territory for me is it i didnt know whats that saying again ye need a lang spoon tae sup wi a fifer holmes smiled yes thats it theres a similar saying about the devil isnt there all it means is that were close holmes tightly knit we dont suffer fools and strangers gladly now off you go to fife and see what im on about yes sir what about you i mean what will you do about his eyes were on the photograph again rebus picked it up and placed it carefully in the inside pocket of his jacket dont worry about me son ive plenty to keep me busy just keeping out of range of farmer watson is work enough for a day maybe ill take the car out nice day for a drive nice day for a drive tracy was doing her best to ignore him she stared from her passenger side window seemingly interested in the passing parade of shops and shoppers tourists kids with nothing to do now the schools had broken up for summer shed been keen enough to get out of the station though hed held the car door open for her dissuading her from just walking away and shed complied but silently sullenly okay she was in the huff with him hed get over it so would she point taken he said youre pissed off but how many times do i have to tell you it was for your own safety while i was doing some checking up where are we going do you know this part of town she was silent there was to be no conversation only questions and answers her questions were just driving he said you must know this side of town a lot of dealing used to go on around here im not into that it was rebuss turn to be silent he wasnt too old to play a game or two himself he took a left then another then a right weve been here already she commented shed noticed then clever girl still that didnt matter all that mattered was that slowly by degrees by left and right then left and right again he was guiding them towards the destination he pulled into the kerb abruptly and yanked on the handbrake right he said were here here she looked out of the side window up at the tenement building the red stone had been cleaned in the past year giving it the look of a childs plasticine pinky ochre and malleable here she repeated the word choking off as she recognised the exact address and then tried not to let that recognition show the photograph was on her lap when she turned from the window she flicked it from her with a squeal as though it were an insect rebus plucked the photo from the floor of the car and held it out to her yours i believe where the hell did you get that do you want to tell me about it her face was as red as the stonework now her eyes flitting in panic like a birds she fumbled with the seatbelt desperate to be out of the car but rebuss hand on the catch was rock hard let me go she yelled thumping down on his fist then she pushed open the door but the camber of the road pulled it shut again there was not enough give in the seatbelt anyway she was securely bound i thought wed pay mr hutton a call rebus was saying his voice like a blade ask him about this photo about how he paid you a few quid to model for him about how you brought him ronnies pictures looking for a few bob more maybe or just to spite ronnie is that how it was tracy ill bet ronnie was pissed off when he saw hutton had stolen his ideas couldnt prove it though could he and how was he to know how the hell hutton got them in the first place i suppose you put the blame on charlie and thats why the two of you arent exactly on speaking terms some friend to ronnie you were sweetheart some friend she broke down at that and gave up trying to free herself from the seatbelt her head angled forward into her hands and she wept loudly and at length while rebus caught his breath he wasnt proud of himself but it had needed saying she had to stop hiding from the truth it was all conjecture of course but rebus was sure hutton could confirm the details if pressed she had modelled for money maybe happened to mention that her boyfriend was a photographer had taken the photos to hutton giving away ronnies glimmer of a chance his creativity for a few more pound notes if you couldnt trust your friends who could you trust he had left her overnight in the cells to see if she would crack she hadnt so he supposed she must be clean but that didnt mean she didnt have some kind of habit if not needles then something else everybody needed a little something didnt they and the money was needed too so she had ripped off her boyfriend did you plant that camera in charlies squat no it was as though after all that had gone before the accusation still hurt rebus nodded so charlie had taken the camera or someone else had planted it there for him to find no not quite because he hadnt found it mccall had and very easily at that the way he had blithely found the dope in the sleeping bag a true coppers nose or something else a little information perhaps inside information if you cant trust your friends did you see the camera the night ronnie died it was in his room im sure it was she blinked back the tears and wiped her nose on the handkerchief rebus gave her her voice was cracked still her throat a little clogged but she was recovering from the shock of the photo and the greater shock that rebus knew now of her betrayal that guy who came to see ronnie he was in ronnies room after me you mean neil i think that was his name yes too many cooks rebus was thinking he was going to have to revise his definition of circumstantial he had very little so far that wasnt circumstantial it felt like the spiral was widening taking him further and further away from the central crucial point the point where ronnie lay dead on a damp bare floor flanked by candles and dubious friends neil was ronnies brother really her voice was disinterested the safety curtain between her and the world was coming down again the matinee was over yes really rebus felt a sudden chill if nobody nobody cares what happened to ronnie except neil and me why am i bothering charlie always thought they had some kind of gay thing going i never asked ronnie i dont suppose he would have told me she rested her head against the back of the seat seeming to relax again oh god she released a whistle of breath from her lungs do we have to stick around here her hands were rising slowly ready to clasp her head and rebus was beginning to answer in the negative when he saw those same hands come swiftly down curling into tiny fists there was no room to escape them and so they hit him full in the groin a flashgun exploded somewhere behind his eyes the world turning into nothing but sound and blinding pain he was roaring doubled up in agony head coming to rest on the steering wheel which was also the cars horn it was blaring lazily as tracy undid her seatbelt opened the door and swivelled out of the car she left the door wide open as she ran rebus watched through eyes brimming with tears as if he were in a swimming pool watching her running along the edge of the pool away from him chlorine stinging his pupils jesus almighty christ he gasped still hunched over the wheel and not about to move for some considerable time think like tarzan his father had told him once one of the old mans few pieces of advice he was talking about fights about onetoone scrapes with the lads at school four oclock behind the bike shed and all that think like tarzan youre strong king of the jungle and above all else youre going to protect your nuts and the old boy had raised a bent knee towards young johns crotch thanks dad rebus hissed now thanks for reminding me then the reaction hit his stomach by lunchtime he could just about walk so long as he kept his feet close to the ground moving as though he had wet himself people stared of course and he tried to improvise a limp specially for them ever the crowd pleaser the thought of the stairs to his office was too much and driving the car had been excruciating the foot pedals impossible to operate so he had taken a taxi to the sutherland bar three quartergill measures of whisky later he felt the pain replaced by a drowsy numbness as though of hemlock he muttered to himself he wasnt worried about tracy anyone with a punch like that could look after herself there were probably kids on the street harder than half the bloody police force not that tracy was a kid he still hadnt found out anything about her that was supposed to be holmess department but holmes was off on a wild dog chase in fife no tracy would be all right probably there had been no men chasing her but then why come to him that night there could be a hundred reasons after all shed conned a bed the best part of a bottle of wine a hot bath and breakfast out of him not bad going that and him supposed to be a hardened old copper too old maybe too much the copper not enough the police officer maybe where to next he already had the answer to that legs permitting and pray god he could drive he parked at a distance from the house not wanting to scare off anyone who might be there then he simply walked up to the door and knocked standing there awaiting a response he remembered tracy opening that door and running into his arms her face bruised her eyes welling with tears he didnt think charlie would be here he didnt think tracy would be here he didnt want tracy to be here the door opened a bleary teenage boy squinted up at rebus his hair was lank lifeless falling into his eyes what is it is charlie in ive got a bit of business with him naw havenae seen him the day all right if i wait a while aye the boy was already closing the door on rebuss face rebus stuck a hand up against the door and peered round it i meant wait indoors the boy shrugged and slouched back inside leaving the door ajar he slipped back into his sleeping bag and pulled it over his head just passing through and catching up on lost sleep rebus supposed the boy had nothing to lose by letting a stranger into this way station he left him to his sleep and after a cursory check that there was no one else in the downstairs rooms climbed the steep staircase the books were still slewed like so many felled dominoes the contents of the bag mccall had emptied still lying in a clutter on the floor rebus ignored these and went to the desk where he sat studying the pieces of paper in front of him he had flicked on the light switch beside the door of charlies room and now switched on the desk lamp too the walls were miraculously free from posters postcards and the like it wasnt like a students room its identity had been left suspended which was probably exactly the way charlie wanted it he didnt want to look like a student to his dropout friends he didnt want to look like a dropout to his student friends he wanted to be all things to all people chameleon then as well as tourist the essay on magick was rebuss main interest but he gave the rest of the desk a good examination while he was here nothing out of the ordinary nothing to suggest that charlie was pushing bad drugs around the city streets so rebus picked up the essay opened it and began to read nell liked the library when it was quiet like this during term time a lot of the students used it as a meeting place a sort of glorified youth club then the firstfloor reading room was filled with noise books tended to be left lying everywhere or to go missing to be shifted out of their proper sections all very frustrating but during the summer months only the most determined of the students came in the ones with a thesis to write or work to catch up on or those precious few who were passionate about their chosen fields and who were giving up sunshine and freedom to be here indoors in studied silence she got to know their faces and then their names conversations could be struck up in the deserted coffee shop authors names swopped and at lunchtime one could sit in the gardens or walk behind the library building onto the meadows where more books were being read more faces rapt in thought of course summer was also the time for the librarys most tedious jobs the check on stock the rebinding of misused volumes reclassification computer updating and so on the atmosphere more than made up for all this all traces of hurry and haste were gone no more complaints about there being too few copies of this or that title desperately needed by a class of two hundred for some overdue essay but after the summer there would be a new intake and with every years fresh intake she felt that whole year older and more distanced from the students they already seemed hopelessly young to her a glow surrounding them reminding her of something she could never have she was sorting through request forms when the commotion began the guard on the library entrance had stopped someone who was trying to get in without any identification normally nell knew the guard wouldnt have worried but the girl was so obviously distraught so obviously not a reader not even a student she was loudly argumentative where a real student would have quietly explained that they had forgotten to bring their matriculation card with them there was something else too nell frowned trying to place the girl catching her profile she remembered the photograph in brians briefcase yes it was the same girl no girl really but a fully grown if youthful woman the lines around the eyes were the giveaway no matter how slender the body how fashionably young the clothes but why was she making this fuss shed always gone to the coffee shop had never to nells knowledge tried to get into the library proper before now nells curiosity was aroused the guard was holding tracy by the arm and she was shrieking abuse at him her eyes frantic nell tried to be authoritarian in her walk as she approached the pair of them is there some problem mr clarke i can handle it miss his eyes betrayed his words he was sweating past retirement age neither used to this sort of physical struggle nor knowing what to do about it nell turned to the girl you cant just barge in here you know but if you want a message passed on to one of the students inside ill see what i can do the girl struggled again i just want to come in all reasoning had gone now she knew only that if someone was stopping her getting in then she had to get in somehow well you cant nell said angrily she should not have interfered she was used to dealing with quiet sane rational people okay some of them might lose their tempers momentarily when frustrated in their search for a book but they would always remember their place the girl stared at her and the stare seemed absolutely malevolent there was no trace of human kindness in it at all nell felt the hairs on her neck bristle then the girl gave a banshee wail throwing herself forward loosing the guards grip her forehead smashed into nells face sending the librarian flying feet rooted to the spot so that she fell like so much timber tracy stood there for a moment seeming to come to herself the guard made to grab her but she gave another yell and he backed off then she pushed past him out of the library doors and started running again head down arms and legs uncoordinated the guard watched her fearful still then turned his attention to the bloody and unconscious face of nell stapleton the man who answered the door was blind yes he asked holding the door sightless eyes discernible behind the dark green lenses of his glasses the hallway behind him was in deep shadow what need had it of light mr vanderhyde the man smiled yes he repeated rebus couldnt take his own eyes off those of the elderly man those green lenses reminded him of claret bottles vanderhyde would be sixtyfive maybe seventy his hair was silvery yellow thick well groomed he was wearing an opennecked shirt brown waistcoat a watch chain hanging from one pocket and he was leaning ever so slightly on a silvertopped stick for some reason rebus had the idea that vanderhyde would be able to handle that cane swiftly and effectively as a weapon should anyone unpleasant ever come calling mr vanderhyde im a police officer rebus was reaching for his wallet dont bother with identification unless its in braille vanderhydes words stopped rebus short his hand frozen in his inside jacket pocket of course he mumbled feeling ever so slightly ridiculous funny how people with disabilities had that special gift of making you seem so much less able than them youd better come in inspector thank you rebus was in the hall before it hit him how did you vanderhyde shook his head a lucky guess he said leading the way a shot in the dark you might say his laughter was abrasive rebus studying what he could see of the hall was wondering how even a blind man could make such a botched job of interior decoration a stuffed owl stared down from its dusty pedestal next to an umbrella stand which seemed to consist of a hollowed elephants foot an ornately carved occasional table boasted a pile of unread mail and a cordless telephone rebus gave this latter item most attention technology has made such progress dont you agree vanderhyde was saying invaluable for those of us who have lost one of the senses yes rebus replied as vanderhyde opened the door to another room almost as dark to rebuss eyes as the hall in here inspector thank you the room was musty and smelled of old peoples medicaments it was comfortably furnished with a deep sofa and two robust armchairs books lay behind glass along one wall some uninspired watercolours stopped the other walls from seeming bare there were ornaments everywhere those on the mantelpiece caught rebuss eye there wasnt a spare centimetre of space on the deep wooden mantelpiece and the ornaments were exotic rebus could identify african caribbean asian and oriental influences without being able to pinpoint any one country for any one piece vanderhyde flopped into a chair it struck rebus that there were no occasional tables scattered through the room no extraneous furniture into which the blind man might bump nicknacks inspector gewgaws collected on my travels as a younger man evidence of a lot of travel evidence of a magpie mind vanderhyde corrected would you care for some tea no thank you sir something a little stronger perhaps thank you but no rebus smiled id a bit too much last night your smile comes over in your voice you dont seem curious as to why im here mr vanderhyde perhaps thats because i know inspector or perhaps its because my patience is limitless time doesnt mean as much to me as to most people im in no hurry for your explanations im not a clock watcher you see he was smiling again eyes fixed somewhere just right of rebus and above him rebus stayed silent inviting further speculation then again vanderhyde continued since i no longer go out and have few visitors and since i have never to my knowledge broken the laws of the land that certainly narrows the possible reasons for your visit youre sure you wont have some tea dont let me stop you making some for yourself rebus had spotted the nearempty mug sitting on the floor beside the old mans chair he looked down around his own chair another mug sat on the muted pattern of the carpet he reached a silent arm down towards it there was a slight warmth on the base of the mug a warmth on the carpet beneath no vanderhyde said i had one just recently as did my visitor visitor rebus sounded surprised the old man smiled giving a slight and indulgent shake of his head rebus feeling caught decided to push on anyway i thought you said you didnt get many visitors no i dont recall quite saying that still it happens to be true today is the exception that proves the rule two visitors might i ask who the other visitor was might i ask inspector why youre here it was rebuss turn to smile nodding to himself the blood was rising in the old mans cheeks rebus had succeeded in riling him well there was impatience in vanderhydes voice well sir rebus deliberately pulled himself out of the chair and began to circuit the room i came across your name in an undergraduate essay on the occult does that surprise you the old man considered this it pleases me slightly i do have an ego that needs feeding after all but it doesnt surprise you vanderhyde shrugged this essay mentioned you in connection with the workings of an edinburghbased group a sort of coven working in the nineteen sixties coven is an inexact term but never mind you were involved in it i dont deny the fact well while were dealing in fact you were more correctly its guiding light light may be an inexact term vanderhyde laughed a piping discomfiting sound touche inspector indeed touche do continue finding your address wasnt difficult not too many vanderhydes in the phone book my kin are based in london the reason for my visit mr vanderhyde is a murder or at the very least a case of tampering with evidence at the scene of a death intriguing vanderhyde put his hands together fingertips to his lips it was hard to believe the man was sightless rebuss movements around the room were failing to have any effect on vanderhyde at all the body was discovered lying with arms stretched wide legs together naked no not quite shirtless candles had been burning either side of the body and a pentagram had been painted on one wall anything else no there were some syringes in a jar by the body the death was caused by an overdose of drugs yes hmm vanderhyde rose from his chair and walked unerringly to the bookcase he did not open it but stood as though staring at the titles if were dealing with a sacrifice inspector i take it thats your theory one of many sir well if we are dealing with a sacrifice then the means of death are quite unusual no more than that are unheard of to begin with very few satanists would ever contemplate a human sacrifice plenty of psychopaths have carried out murder and then excused it as ritual but thats something else again but in any case a human sacrifice a sacrifice of any kind requires blood symbolic in some rites as in the blood and body of christ real in others a sacrifice without blood that would be original and to administer an overdose no inspector surely the more plausible explanation is that as you say someone muddied the water as it were after the life had expired vanderhyde turned into the room again picking out rebuss position he raised his arms high to signal that this was all he had to offer rebus sat down again the mug when he touched it was no longer warm the evidence had cooled dissipated vanished he picked up the mug and looked at it it was an innocent thing patterned with flowers there was a single crack running downwards from its rim rebus felt a sudden surge of confidence in his own abilities he got to his feet again and walked to the door are you leaving he did not reply to vanderhydes question but walked smartly to the bottom of the dark oak staircase halfway up it twisted in a ninetydegree angle from the bottom rebuss view was of this halfway point this small landing a second before there had been someone there someone crouching listening he hadnt seen the figure so much as sensed it he cleared his throat a nervous rather than necessary action come down here charlie he paused silence but he could still sense the young man just beyond that turning on the stairs unless you want me to come up i dont think you want that do you just the two of us up there in the dark more silence broken by the shuffling of vanderhydes carpetslippered feet the walking cane tapping against the floor when rebus looked round the old mans jaw was set defiantly he still had his pride rebus wondered if he felt any shame then the single creak of a floorboard signalled charlies presence on the stair landing rebus broke into a smile of conquest of relief he had trusted himself and had proved worthy of that trust hello charlie he said i didnt mean to hit her she had a go at me first the voice was recognisable but charlie seemed rooted to the landing his body was slightly hunched his face in silhouette his arms hanging by his side the educated voice seemed discorporate somehow not part of this shadowpuppet why dont you join us are you going to arrest me whats the charge the question was rebuss his voice tinged with amusement that should be your question charles vanderhyde called out making it sound like an instruction rebus was suddenly bored with these games come on down he commanded lets have another mug of earl grey rebus had pulled open the crimson velvet curtains in the living room the interior seemed less cramped in what was left of the daylight less overpowering and certainly a lot less gothic the ornaments on the mantelpiece were revealed as just that ornaments the books in the bookcase were revealed as by and large works of popular fiction dickens hardy trollope rebus wondered if trollope was still popular charlie had made tea in the narrow kitchen while vanderhyde and rebus sat in silence in the living room listening to the distant sounds of cups chinking and spoons ringing you have good hearing vanderhyde stated at last rebus shrugged he was still assessing the room no he couldnt live here but he could at least imagine visiting some aged relative in such a place ah tea said vanderhyde as charlie brought in the unsteady tray placing it on the floor between chairs and sofa his eyes sought rebuss they had an imploring look rebus ignored it accepting his cup with a curt nod of the head he was just about to say something about how well charlie seemed to know his way around his chosen bolthole when charlie himself spoke he was handing a mug to vanderhyde the mug itself was only half filled a wise precaution and charlie sought out the old mans hand guiding it to the large handle there you go uncle matthew he said thank you charles said vanderhyde and if he had been sighted his slight smile would have been directed straight at rebus rather than a few inches over the detectives shoulder cosy rebus commented sipping the dry perfume of earl grey charlie sat on the sofa crossing his legs almost relaxed yes he knew this room well was slipping into it the way one slipped into an old comfortable pair of trousers he might have spoken but vanderhyde seemed to want to put his points forward first charles has told me all about it inspector rebus well when i say that i mean he has told me as much as he deems it necessary for me to know charlie glared at his uncle who merely smiled knowing the frown was there ive already told charles that he should talk to you again he seems unwilling seemed unwilling now the choice has been taken away from him how did you know asked charlie so much more at home here rebus was thinking than in some ugly squat in pilmuir know said rebus know where to find me know about uncle matthew oh that rebus picked at invisible threads on his trousers your essay it was sitting on your desk handy that what doing an essay on the occult and having a warlock in the family vanderhyde chuckled not a warlock inspector never that i think ive only ever met one warlock one true warlock in my whole life local he is mind uncle matthew charlie interrupted i dont think the inspector wants to hear on the contrary said rebus its the reason im here oh charlie sounded disappointed not to arrest me then no though you deserve a good slap for that bruise you gave tracy she deserved it charlies voice betrayed petulance his lower lip filling out like a childs you struck a woman vanderhyde sounded aghast charlie looked towards him then away as if unable to hold a stare that didnt couldnt exist yes charlie hissed but look he pulled the polonecked jumper down from around his neck there were two huge weals there the result of prising fingernails nice scratches rebus commented for the blind mans benefit you got the scratches she got a bruise on her eye i suppose that makes it neck and neck in the eyeforaneye stakes vanderhyde chuckled again leaning forward slightly on his cane very good inspector he said yes very good now he lifted the mug to his lips and blew what can we do for you i saw your name in charlies essay there was a footnote quoting you as an interview source i reckoned that made you local and reasonably extant and there arent too many vanderhydes in the phone book finished the old man yes you said but youve already answered most of my questions concerning the black magic connection that is however i would just like to clear up a few points with your nephew would you like me to vanderhyde was already rising to his feet rebus waved for him to stay then realised the gesture was in vain however vanderhyde had already paused as though anticipating the action no sir rebus said now as vanderhyde seated himself again thisll only take a couple of minutes he turned to charlie who was almost sinking into the deep padded cushions of the sofa so charlie rebus began ive got you down this far as thief and as accessory to murder any comments to make rebus watched with pleasure as the young mans face lost its tealike colour and became more like uncooked pastry vanderhyde twitched but with pleasure too rather than discomfort charlie looked from one man to the other seeking friendly eyes the eyes he saw were blind to his pleas ii yes rebus prompted ill just fill my cup charlie said as though only these five meagre words were left in his vocabulary rebus sat back patiently let the bugger fill and refill and boil another brew but hed have his answers hed make charlie sweat tannin and hed have his answers is fife always this bleak only the more picturesque bits the rests no bad at a the sspca officer was guiding brian holmes across a twilit field the area around almost completely flat a dead tree breaking the monotony a fierce wind was blowing and it was a cold wind too the sspca man had called it an aist wind holmes assumed that aist translated as east and that the mans sense of geography was somewhat askew since the wind was clearly blowing from the west the landscape proved deceptive seeming flat the land was actually slanting they were climbing a slope not steep but perceptible holmes was reminded of some hill somewhere in scotland the electric brae where a trick of natural perspective made you think you were going uphill when in fact you were travelling down or was it vice versa somehow he didnt think his companion was the man to ask soon over the rise holmes could see the black grainy landscape of a disused mineworking shielded from the field by a line of trees the mines around here were all worked out had been since the s now money had appeared from somewhere and the longsmouldering bings were being levelled their mass used to fill the chasms left by surface mining the mine buildings themselves were being dismantled the landscape reseeded as though the history of mining in fife had never existed this much brian holmes knew his uncles had been miners not here perhaps but nevertheless they had been great deep workings of information and anecdote the child brian had stored away every detail grim he said to himself as he followed the sspca officer down a slight slope towards the trees where a cluster of half a dozen men stood shuffling turning at the sound of approach holmes introduced himself to the most seniorlooking of the plainclothes men dc brian holmes sir the man smiled nodded then jerked his head in the direction of a much younger man everyone uniformeds plainclothes even the sspca judas was smiling enjoying holmess mistake he felt a rush of blood to his face and was rooted to the spot the young man saw his discomfort and stuck out a hand im ds hendry brian sometimes im in charge here there were more smiles holmes joined in this time sorry sir im flattered actually nice to think im so younglooking and harry heres so old he nodded towards the man holmes had mistaken for the senior officer right brian ill just tell you what ive been telling the lads we have a good tip that theres going to be a dog fight here tonight its secluded half a mile from the main road a mile from the nearest house perfect really theres a track the lorries take from the main road up to the site here thats the way theyll come in probably three or four vans carrying the dogs and then who knows how many cars with the punters if it gets to ibrox proportions well call in reinforcements as it is were not bothered so much about nabbing punters as about catching the handlers themselves the word is that davy brightmans the main man owns a couple of scrap yards in kirkcaldy and methil we know he keeps a few pit bulls and we think he fights them there was a blast of static from one of the radios then a call sign ds hendry responded do you have a detective constable holmes with you came the message hendry stared at holmes as he handed him the radio holmes could only look apologetic dc holmes speaking dc holmes weve a message for you go ahead said holmes its to do with a miss nell stapleton sitting in the hospital waiting room eating chocolate from a vending machine rebus went over the days events in his mind remembering the incident with tracy in the car his scrotum began to rise up into his body in an act of selfprotection painful still like a double hernia not that hed ever had one but the afternoon had been very interesting indeed vanderhyde had been interesting and charlie well charlie had sung like a bird what is it you want to ask me he had said bringing more tea into the living room im interested in time charlie your uncle has already told me that hes not interested in time he isnt ruled by it but policemen are especially in a case like this you see the chronology of events isnt quite right in my mind thats what i want to clear up if possible all right charlie said how can i help you were at ronnies that night yes for a while and you left to look for some party or other thats right leaving neil in the house with ronnie no hed left by then you didnt know of course that neil was ronnies brother the look of surprise on charlies face seemed authentic but then rebus knew him for an accomplished actor and was taking nothing for granted not any more no i didnt know that shit his brother why didnt he want any of us to meet him neil and i are in the same profession rebus explained charlie just smiled and shook his head vanderhyde was leaning back thoughtfully in his chair like a meticulous juror at some trial now rebus continued neil says he left quite early ronnie was being uncommunicative i can guess why why easy hed just scored hadnt he he hadnt seen any stuff for ages and suddenly hed scored charlie suddenly remembered that his aged uncle was listening and stopped short looking towards the old man vanderhyde shrewd as ever seemed to sense this and waved his hand regally before him as if to say ive been too long on this planet and cant be shocked any more i think youre right rebus said to charlie one hundred percent so in an empty house ronnie shoots up the stuffs lethal when tracy comes in she finds him in his room so she says interrupted charlie rebus nodded acknowledging his scepticism lets accept for the moment thats what happened hes dead or seems so to her she panics and runs off right so far so good now it begins to get hazy and this is where i need your help charlie thereafter someone moves ronnies body downstairs i dont know why maybe they were just playing silly buggers or as mr vanderhyde put it so succinctly trying to muddy the water anyway around this stage in the chronology a second packet of white powder appears tracy only saw one rebus saw that charlie was about to interrupt again so she says so ronnie had one packet and shot up with it when he died his body came downstairs and another packet magically appeared this new packet contains good stuff not the poison ronnie used on himself and to add a little more to the concoction ronnies camera disappears to turn up later in your squat charlie in your room and in your black polythene bag charlie had stopped looking at rebus he was looking at the floor at his mug at the teapot his eyes still werent on rebus when he spoke yes i took it you took the camera i just said i did didnt i okay rebuss voice was neutral charlies smouldering shame might at any moment catch light and ignite into anger when did you take it well i didnt exactly stop to look at my watch charles vanderhydes voice was loud the word coming from his mouth like a bite charlie took notice he straightened in his chair reduced to some childhood fear of this imposing creature his uncle the magician rebus cleared his throat the taste of earl grey was thick on his tongue was there anyone in the house when you got back no well yes if youre counting ronnie was he upstairs or down he was at the top of the stairs if you must know just lying there like hed been trying to come down them i thought he was crashed out but he didnt look right i mean when someones sleeping theres some kind of movement but ronnie was rigid his skin was cold damp and he was at the top of the stairs yes what did you do then well i knew he was dead and it was like i was dreaming that sounds stupid but it was like that i know now that i was just trying to shut it out i went into ronnies room was the syringe jar there i cant remember never mind go on well i knew that when tracy got back yes god this is going to make me sound like a monster what is it well i knew that when she came back shed see ronnie was dead and grab what she could of his i knew she would i just felt it so i took something i thought hed have wanted me to have for sentimental reasons then asked rebus archly not totally charlie admitted rebus had a sudden cooling thought this is going too easily it was the only thing ronnie had that was worth any money rebus nodded yes that was more like it not that charlie was short of a few bob he could always rely on uncle matthew but it was the illicit nature of the act that appealed something ronnie would have wanted him to have some chance so you lifted the camera rebus said charlie nodded then you left went straight back to my squat somebody said tracy had come looking for me said shed been in a right state so i assumed she already knew about ronnie and she hadnt made off with the camera shed come looking for you instead yes charlie seemed almost contrite almost rebus wondered what vanderhyde was making of all this what about the name hyde does it mean anything to you a character in robert louis stevenson apart from that charlie shrugged what about someone called edward a character in robert louis stevenson i dont understand sorry im being facetious edward is hydes first name in jekyll and hyde no i dont know anyone called edward fair enough do you want to know something charlie what rebus looked to vanderhyde who sat impassively actually i think your uncle already knows what im going to say vanderhyde smiled indeed correct me if im wrong inspector rebus but you were about to say that the young mans corpse having moved from the bedroom to the stairs you can only assume that the person who moved the body was actually in the house when charles arrived charlies jaw dropped open rebus had never witnessed the effect in real life before quite right he said id say you were lucky charlie id say that someone was moving the body downstairs and heard you arrive then they hid in one of the other rooms maybe even that stinking bathroom until youd left they were in the house all the time you were charlie swallowed then closed his mouth then let his head fall forward and began to weep not quite silently so that his uncle caught the action and smiled nodding towards rebus with satisfaction rebus finished the chocolate it had tasted of antiseptic the same strong flavour of the corridor outside the wards themselves and this waiting room where anxious faces buried themselves in old colour supplements and tried to look interested for more than a second or two the door opened and holmes came in looking anxious and exhausted hed had the distance of a fortyminute car journey in which to mentally live his worst fears and the result was carved into his face rebus knew that swift treatment was needed shes fine you can see her whenever you like theyre keeping her in overnight for no good reason at all and shes got a broken nose a broken nose thats all no concussion no blurred vision a good old broken nose curse of the bareknuckle fighter rebus thought for one moment that holmes was about to take offence at his levity but then relief flooded the younger man and he smiled his shoulders relaxing head dropping a little as though from a sense of anticlimax albeit a welcome one so rebus said do you want to see her yes come on ill take you he placed a hand on holmess shoulder and guided him out of the door again but how did you know holmes asked as they walked up the corridor know what know it was nell know about nell and me well now youre a detective brian think about it rebus could see holmess mind take on the puzzle he hoped the process was therapeutic finally holmes spoke nells got no family so she asked for me well she wrote asking for you the broken nose makes it hard to understand what shes saying holmes nodded dully but i couldnt be located and you were asked if you knew where i was thats close enough well done how was fife anyway i only get back there once a year april th he thought to himself fife it was okay id to leave before the bust that was a shame and i dont think i exactly impressed the team i was supposed to be part of who was in charge a young ds called hendry rebus nodded i know him im surprised you dont at least by reputation holmes shrugged i just hope they nab those bastards rebus had stopped outside the door of a ward this it holmes asked rebus nodded want me to come in with you holmes stared at his superior with something approaching gratitude then shook his head no its all right i wont stay if shes asleep one last thing though yes who did it who did it that was the hardest part to understand walking back along the corridor rebus saw nells puffy face saw her distress as she tried to talk and couldnt she had signalled for some paper he had taken a notebook from his pocket and handed her his pen then she had written furiously for a full minute he stopped now and took out the notebook reading it through for the fourth or fifth time that evening i was working at the library a woman tried to push her way into the building past the guard talk to him if you want to check this woman then butted me on the face i was trying to help to calm her down she must have thought i was interfering but i wasnt i was trying to help she was the girl in that photograph the nude photograph brian had in his briefcase last night in the pub you were there werent you in the same pub as us not easy not to notice the place was empty after all wheres brian out chasing more salacious pictures for you inspector rebus smiled now as he had smiled then she had guts that one he rather liked her her face taped eyes blackened she reminded him a lot of gill so tracy was leaving a silvery snails trail of chaos by which to follow her little bitch had she simply flipped or was there a real motive for her trip to the university library rebus leaned against the wall of the corridor god what a day he was supposed to be between cases supposed to be tidying things up before starting full time on the drugs campaign he was supposed for the sake of christ to be having things easy thatd be the day the ward doors swung shut alerting him to the figure of brian holmes in the corridor holmes seemed lacking direction then spotted his superior and came walking briskly up the hall rebus wasnt sure yet whether holmes was invaluable or a liability could you be both things at once is she all right he asked solicitously yes i suppose so shes awake face looks a bit of a mess though just bruises they say the nose will heal youll never know it was broken yes thats what nell said she talking thats good she also told me who did it holmes looked at rebus who looked away whats this all about whats nell got to do with it nothing so far as i know she just happened to be in the wrong place et cetera chalk it down to coincidence coincidence thats a nice easy word to say put it down to coincidence and then we can forget all about it is that it i dont know what your game is rebus but im not going to play it any longer holmes turned and stalked off along the hall rebus almost warned him that there was no exit at that end of the building but favours werent what holmes wanted he needed a bit of time a break so did rebus but he had some thinking to do and the station was the best place for that by taking them slowly rebus managed the stairs to his office he had been at his desk fully ten minutes before a craving for tea had him reaching for the telephone then he sat back holding in front of him a piece of paper on which he had attempted to set out the facts of the case he was chilled by the thought that he might be wasting time and effort a jury would have to work hard to see any crime there at all there was no suggestion that ronnie had not injected himself however he had been starved of his supply despite there being no shortage of dope in the city and someone had moved his body and left behind a packet of good heroin hoping perhaps that this would be tested found clean and therefore death by misadventure would be recorded a simple overdose but the rat poison had been found rebus looked at the paper already perhapses and conjecture had entered the picture maybe the frame wasnt right so turn the picture another way round john and start again why had someone gone to the trouble of killing ronnie after all the poor bugger would have topped himself given time ronnie had been starved of a fix then given some but had known this stuff to be less than pure so doubtless he had known that the person who supplied it wanted him dead but he had taken it anyway no viewed this way round it was making even less sense start again why would someone want ronnie dead there were several obvious answers because he knew something he shouldnt because he possessed something he shouldnt because he didnt possess something he should which was correct rebus didnt know nobody seemed to know the picture still lacked meaning there was a knock on the door and the door itself was pushed open by a constable carrying a mug of tea the constable was harry todd rebus recognised him you get around a bit son yes sir said todd placing the tea on a corner of the desk the only three square inches of wood visible from beneath a surface covering of paperwork is it quiet tonight the usual sir a few drunks couple of breakins nasty car crash down near the docks rebus nodded reaching for the tea do you know another constable name of neil mcgrath raising the mug to his lips rebus stared up at todd who had begun to blush yes sir he said i know him mmhm rebus tested the tea seeming to relish the bland flavour of milk and hot water told you to keep an eye on me did he sir if you happen to see him todd tell him everythings fine yes sir todd was turning to leave oh and todd yes sir dont let me see you near me again understood yes sir todd was clearly downhearted at the door he paused seeming to have a sudden plan that would ingratiate himself with his superior smiling he turned back to rebus did you hear about the action across in fife sir what action rebus sounded uninterested the dog fight sir rebus tried hard to still look unmoved they broke up some dog fight guess who got arrested malcolm rifkind guessed rebus this deflated todd totally the smile left his face no sir he said turning again to leave rebuss patience was short well who then he snapped that disc jockey calum mccallum todd said closing the door after him rebus stared at the door for a count of five before it struck home calum mccallum gill templers lover rebus raised his head and let out a roar which mixed laughter with a kind of twisted victory cry and when he had stopped laughing and was wiping his eyes with a handkerchief he looked towards the door again and saw that it was open there was someone standing in the doorway watching his performance with a look of puzzlement on their face it was gill templer rebus checked his watch it was nearly one in the morning working the late shift gill he said to cover his confusion i suppose youve heard she said ignoring him heard what she walked into the room pushed some papers off the chair onto the floor and sat down looking exhausted rebus looked at all that paper slewed across the floor the cleaners come in in the morning anyway he said then ive heard is that what all the screaming was about oh that rebus tried to shrug it off but could feel the blood tingling in his cheeks no he said that was just something well something else not very convincing rebus you bastard her words were tired he wanted to buoy her up tell her she was looking well or something but it wouldnt have been true and she would just scowl at him again so he left it she was looking drawn not enough sleep and no fun left any more shed just had her world locked up in a cell somewhere in fife they would be photographing and fingerprinting it perhaps ready to file it away her life calum mccallum life was full of surprises so what can i do for you she looked up at him studying his face as though she wasnt sure who he was or why she was here then she shook herself awake with a twitch of the shoulders it sounds corny but i really was just passing i dropped into the canteen for a coffee before going home and then i heard she shivered again the twitch which wasnt quite a twitch rebus could see how fragile she was he hoped she wasnt going to shake apart i heard about calum how could he do that to me john keep a secret like that i mean wheres the fun in watching dogs ripping each other thats something youll have to ask him yourself gill can i get you some more coffee christ no im going to find it hard enough getting to sleep as it is tell you what i would like though if its not too much trouble name it a lift home rebus was already nodding agreement and a hug rebus got up slowly donned his jacket put the pen and piece of paper in his pocket and met her in the middle of the room she had already risen from her chair and standing on reports to be read paperwork to be signed arrest statistics and the rest they hugged their arms strong she buried her head in his shoulder he rested his chin on her neck staring at the closed door rubbing her back with one hand patting with the other eventually she pulled away head first then chest but still holding him with her arms her eyes were moist but it was over now she was looking a little better thanks she said i needed it as much as you did said rebus come on lets get you home friday the inhabitants were all doing well it seemed and all emulously hoping to do better still and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry someone was knocking on his door an authoritarian knock using the old brass knocker that he never cleaned rebus opened his eyes the sun was streaming into his living room a records runout track crackling another night spent in the chair fully clothed hed be as well selling the mattress in the bedroom would anyone buy a mattress without a bedframe knockity knock knock again still patient still waiting for him to answer his eyes were gummy and he pushed his shirt back into his trousers as he walked from the living room to the door he felt not too bad considering not stiff no tightness in the neck a wash and a shave and he might even feel human he opened the door just as holmes was about to knock again brian rebus sounded genuinely pleased morning mind if i come in not at all is nell okay i phoned this morning they say she had a good night they were walking in the direction of the kitchen rebus leading holmes had imagined the flat would smell of beer and cigarettes a typical bachelor pad in fact it was tidier than hed expected furnished with a modicum of taste there were a lot of books rebus had never struck him as a reader mind you not all the books looked as though theyd been read bought with a rainy dead weekend in mind the weekend that never came rebus pointed vaguely in the direction of kettle and cupboards make us some coffee will you ill just take a quick shower right holmes thought that his news could probably wait at least until rebus was fully awake he sought in vain for instant coffee but found in one cupboard a vacuum pack of ground coffee several months past its sellby date he opened it and spooned some into the teapot while the kettle was boiling sounds of running water came from the bathroom and above these the tinny sound of a transistor radio voices some talk show holmes supposed while rebus was in the bathroom he took the opportunity to wander through the flat the living room was huge with a high corniced ceiling holmes felt a pang of jealousy hed never be able to buy a place like this he was looking around easter road and gorgie near the football grounds of hibs and hearts respectively he could afford a flat in both these parts of the city a decentsized flat too three bedrooms but the rooms were small the areas mean he was no snob hell yes he was he wanted to live in the new town in dean village here in marchmont where students philosophised in pretty coffee shops he wasnt overcareful with the stylus when he lifted the arm off the record the record itself was by some jazz combo it looked old and he sought in vain for its sleeve the noises from the bathroom had stopped he walked stealthily back to the kitchen and found a tea strainer in the cutlery drawer so he was able to keep the grounds out of the coffee he now poured into two mugs rebus came in wrapped in a bathtowel rubbing at his head with another smaller towel he needed to lose weight or to exercise what weight he had his chest was beginning to hang pale like a carcass he picked up a mug and sipped mmm the real mccoy i found it in the cupboard no milk though never mind this is fine you say you found it in the cupboard we might make a detective of you yet ill just put on some togs and he was off again for only two minutes this time the clothes he came back wearing were clean but unironed holmes noticed that though there was plumbing in the kitchen for a washing machine there was no machine rebus seemed to read his mind my wife took it when she moved out took a lot of stuff thats why the place looks so bare it doesnt look bare it looks planned rebus smiled lets go into the living room rebus motioned for holmes to sit then sat down himself the chair was still warm from his nights sleep i see youve already been in here holmes looked surprised caught he remembered that hed lifted the stylus off the record yes he said thats what i like to see rebus said yes well make a detective of you yet brian holmes wasnt sure whether rebus was being flattering or condescending he let it go something i thought you might like to know he began i already know said rebus sorry to spoil the surprise but i was at the station late last night and somebody told me last night holmes was confused but they only found the body this morning the body you mean hes dead yes suicide jesus poor gill gill gill templer she was going out with him inspector templer holmes was shocked i thought she was living with that disc jockey now rebus was confused isnt that who were talking about no said holmes the surprise was still intact he felt real relief so who are we talking about asked rebus with a growing sense of dread whos committed suicide james carew carew yes found him in his flat this morning overdose apparently overdose of what i dont know some kind of pills rebus was stunned he recalled the look on carews face that night atop calton hill damn he said i wanted a word with him i was wondering said holmes what i dont suppose you ever got round to asking him about getting me a flat no said rebus i never got the chance i was only joking holmes said realising that rebus had taken his comment literally was he a friend i mean i know you met him for lunch but i didnt realise did he leave a note i dont know well who would know holmes thought for a second i think inspector mccall was at the scene right come on rebus was up on his feet what about your coffee sod the coffee i want to see tony mccall what was all that about calum mccallum said holmes rising now you mean you havent heard holmes shook his head ill tell you on the way and then rebus was on the move grabbing jacket getting out his keys to lock the front door holmes wondered what the secret was what had calum mccallum done god he hated people who hung on to secrets rebus read the note as he stood in carews bedroom it was elegantly written with a proper nib pen but in one or two of the words fear could be clearly read the letters trembling uncontrollably scribbled out to be tried again goodquality writing paper too thick and watermarked the v was in a garage behind the flat the flat itself was stunning a museum for art deco pieces modern art prints and valuable first editions locked behind glass this is the flipside of vanderhydes home rebus had thought as he moved through the flat then mccall had handed him the suicide note if i am the chief of sinners i am the chief of sufferers also was that a quote from somewhere certainly it was a bit prolix for a suicide note but then carew would have gone through draft upon draft until satisfied it had to be exact had to stand as his monument some day you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this not that rebus needed to seek too hard he had the queasy feeling reading the note that carews words were directed straight at him that he was saying things only rebus could fully understand funny sort of note to leave behind said mccall yes said rebus you met him recently didnt you said mccall i remember you saying did he seem okay then i mean he wasnt depressed or anything ive seen him since then oh i was sniffing around calton hill a couple of nights back he was there in his car ahha mccall nodded everything was starting to make a little bit of sense rebus handed back the note and went over to the bed the sheets were rumpled three empty pill bottles stood in a neat line on the bedside table on the floor lay an empty cognac bottle the man went out in style mccall said pocketing the note hed gone through a couple of bottles of wine before that yes i saw them in the living room lafite sixtyone the stuff of a very special occasion they dont come more special john both men turned as a third presence became evident in the room it was farmer watson breathing heavily from the effort of the stairs this is bloody awkward he said one of the linchpins of our campaign tops himself and by taking a bloody overdose hows that going to look eh awkward sir replied rebus just as you say i do say i do say watson thrust a finger out towards rebus its up to you john to make sure the media dont make a meal of this or of us yes sir watson looked over towards the bed waste of a bloody decent man what makes someone do it i mean look at this place and theres an estate somewhere on one of the islands own business expensive car things we can only dream about makes you wonder doesnt it yes sir right watson took a last glance towards the bed then slapped a hand on rebuss shoulder im depending on you john yes sir mccall and rebus watched their superior go bloody hell whispered mccall he didnt look at me not once i might as well have not been there you should thank your lucky stars tony i wish i had your gift of invisibility both men smiled seen enough mccall asked just one more circuit said rebus then ill get out of your hair whatever you say john just one thing whats that what the hell were you doing up calton hill in the middle of the night dont ask said rebus blowing a kiss as he headed for the living area it would be big news locally of course there was no getting away from the fact the radio stations and newspapers would have trouble deciding which headline deserved most prominence disc jockey arrested at illegal dog fight or suicide shock of estate agent giant well something along those lines jim stevens would have loved it but then jim stevens was in london and married by all accounts to some girl half his age rebus admired that kind of dangerous move he had no admiration for james carew none watson was right in at least one respect carew had everything going for him and rebus was finding it difficult to believe that he would commit suicide solely because he had been spotted by a police officer on calton hill no that might have been the trigger but there had to be something more something perhaps in the flat or in the offices of bowyer carew on george street james carew owned a lot of books a quick examination showed that they were for the most part expensive impressive titles but unread their spines crackling as they were opened by rebus for the first time the top right hand section of the bookcase held several titles which interested him more than the others books by genet and alexander trocchi copies of forsters maurice and even last exit to brooklyn poems by walt whitman the text of torchlight trilogy a mixed bag of predominantly gay reading nothing wrong in that but their positioning in the bookshelves right at the top and separated from the other titles suggested to rebus that here was a man ashamed of himself there was no reason for this not these days who was he kidding aids had squeezed homosexuality back into the darker comers of society and by keeping the truth a secret carew had laid himself open to feelings of shame and therefore to blackmail of all kinds yes blackmail suicides were occasionally victims of blackmail who could see no way out of their dilemma just maybe there would be some evidence a letter or a note or something anything just so rebus could prove to himself he wasnt completely paranoid then he found it in a drawer a locked drawer to be sure but the keys were in carews trousers he had died in his pyjamas and his other clothes had not been taken away with the corpse rebus got the keys from the bedroom and headed back to the desk in the living room a gorgeous writing desk antique for sure its surface was barely large enough to accommodate a sheet of a paper and an elbow what had been once a useful piece of furniture now found itself an ornament in a rich mans apartment rebus opened the drawer carefully and drew out a leatherbound desk diary a page a day the pages large not a diary for appointments not locked away in darkness like that a personal diary then eagerly rebus flipped it open his disappointment was immediate the pages were blank for the most part a line or two of pencil per page was as much as there was rebus cursed all right john its better than nothing he rested at one of the pages with some writing on it the pencil marking was faint neatly written jerry pm a simple appointment rebus flipped to the day on which they had all met for lunch at the eyrie the page was blank good that meant the appointments werent of the business lunch variety there werent many of them rebus felt sure that carews diary at his office would be crammed this was a much more private affair lindsay marks iiam an early start that day and what about that name two individuals each named mark or one individual whose surname was marks maybe even the department store the other names jerry lindsay were androgynous anonymous he needed a telephone number a location he turned another page and had to look twice at what was written there his finger ran along the letters hyde iopm hyde what had ronnie said to tracy the night hed died hide hes after me yes and james had given him the name too not hide but hyde hyde rebus whooped here was a connection no matter how tenuous a connection between ronnie and james carew something more than a fleeting business transaction on calton hill a name he hurried through the other pages there were three more mentions of hyde always in the late evening when calton hill was starting its trade always on a friday sometimes the second friday of the month sometimes the third four mentions in the course of six months anything it was mccall leaning over rebuss shoulder for a peek yes rebus said then he changed his mind no not really tony just an old diary but the bugger wasnt much of a writer mccall nodded and moved away he was more interested in the hifi system the old guy had taste mccall said scrutinising it linn turntable know how much one of those costs john hundreds theyre not showy theyre just bloody good at what they do a bit like us then said rebus he was thinking of pushing the diary into his trousers it wasnt allowed he knew and what good would it do him but with tony mccalls back turned so conveniently no no he couldnt he threw it noisily back into its drawer shut the drawer again and locked it he handed the key to mccall who was still squatting in front of the hifi thanks john nice piece of equipment this you know i didnt know you were interested in all that stuff since i was a kid had to get rid of my system when we got married too noisy he straightened are we going to find any answers here do you think rebus shook his head i think he kept all his secrets in his head he was a very private man after all no i think hes taken the answers with him to the grave oh well makes it nice and clearcut then doesnt it clear as crystal tony said rebus what was it the old man vanderhyde had said something about muddying the water rebus had the gnawing feeling that the solution to these many conundrums was a simple one as crystal clear as one could wish the problem was that extraneous stories were being woven into the whole do i mix my metaphors very well then i mix my metaphors all that counted was getting to the bottom of the pool muddied or no and bringing up that tiny cache of treasure called the truth he knew too that the problem was one of classification he had to break the interlinked stories into separate threads and work from those at the moment he was guilty of trying to weave them all into a pattern a pattern that might not be there by separating them all maybe hed be in with a chance of solving each ronnie committed suicide so did carew that gave them a second thing in common to add to the name of hyde some client of carews perhaps buying a substantial piece of property with money made through the dealing of hard drugs that would be a link for sure hyde the name couldnt be real how many hydes were there in the edinburgh directory it could always be an assumed name male prostitutes seldom used their own names after all hyde jekyll and hyde another coincidence rebus had been reading stevensons book the night tracy had visited maybe he should be looking for someone called jekyll jekyll the respectable doctor admired by society hyde his alter ego small and brutish a creature of the night he remembered the shadowy forms hed encountered by calton hill could the answer be so obvious he parked in the only vacant bay left outside great london road station and climbed the familiar steps they seemed to grow larger with the passing years and he could swear there were more of them now than there had been when hed first come to this place all of what was it six years ago that wasnt so long in the span of a mans life was it so why did it feel so bloody sisyphean hello jack he said to the desk sergeant who watched him walk past without the usual nod of the head strange rebus thought jack had never been a cheery bugger but hed usually had the use of his neck muscles he was famous for his slight bow of the head which he could make mean anything from approbation to insult but today for rebus nothing rebus decided to ignore the slight and went upstairs two constables in the act of coming down fell quiet as they passed him rebus began to redden but kept walking sure now that he had forgotten to zip his fly or had somehow contrived to get a smudge on his nose something like that hed check in the privacy of his office holmes was waiting for him seated in rebuss chair at rebuss desk some property details spread across the tabletop he began to rise as rebus entered gathering together the sheets of paper like a kid caught with a dirty book hello brian rebus took off his jacket hanging it on the back of the door listen i want you to get me the names and addresses of all edinburgh inhabitants whose names are jekyll or hyde i know that may sound daft but just do it then i think you should sit down sir said holmes tremulously rebus stared at him saw the fear in the young mans eyes and knew that the worst had happened rebus pushed open the door of the interview room his face was the colour of pickled beetroot and holmes following feared that his superior was about to suffer a coronary there were two cid men in the room both in their shirtsleeves as though after a hard session they turned at rebuss entrance and the one who was seated rose as if for combat on the other side of the table the weaselfaced teenager known to rebus as james actually squealed and flew to his feet knocking the chair with a clatter onto the stone floor dont let him near me he yelled now john started one detective a sergeant dick rebus held up a hand to show that he was not here to cause violence the detectives eyed one another not sure whether to believe him then rebus spoke his eyes on the teenager youre going to get whats coming to you so help me there was calm lucid anger in rebuss voice im going to have you by your balls for this son you better believe that really you better the teenager saw now that the others would restrain rebus that the man himself presented an empty physical threat he sneered yeah sure he said dismissively rebus lurched forward but holmess hand was rigid against his shoulder pulling him back leave it be john the other detective dc cooper cautioned just let the wheels grind round it wont take long too long though rebus hissed as holmes pulled him out of the room closing the door after them rebus stood in the shadowy corridor all rage spent head bowed it was so very hard to believe inspector rebus rebus and holmes both jerked their heads towards the voice it belonged to a wpc she looked scared too yes rebus managed swallowing the super wants to see you in his office i think its urgent im sure it is said rebus walking towards her with such menace that she retreated hurriedly back towards the reception area and daylight its a bloody setup with all due respect sir remember the golden rule john rebus thought to himself never swear at a superior without adding that with all due respect it was something hed learned in the army as long as you added that coda the brass couldnt have you for insubordination john watson interlaced his fingers studying them as if they were the latest craze john weve got to investigate it thats our duty i know its daft and everyone else knows its daft but weve got to show that its daft thats our duty all the same sir watson cut him off with a wave of his hand then started twining fingers again god knows youre already suspended from duty as it is until our little campaign gets into full swing yes sir but this is just what he wants he some man called hyde he wants me to stop poking about in the ronnie mcgrath case thats what this is all about thats why its a setup job thats as maybe the fact remains a complaint has been made against you by that little bastard downstairs he says you gave him money twenty pounds i believe i did give him twenty quid but not for a shag for chrissake for what then rebus made to answer but was defeated why had he handed the teenager called james that money hed set himself up all right hyde couldnt have done it better himself and now james was downstairs spilling his carefully rehearsed story to cid and say what you liked mud stuck by christ it didnt half no amount of soap and water would clean it off the little toerag this is playing right into hydes hands sir rebus tried one last shot if his storys true why didnt he come in yesterday why wait till today but watson was decided no john i want you out of here for a day or two a week even take a break do whatever you like but leave well alone well clear it up dont worry well break his story down into pieces so small he wont be able to see them any more one of those pieces will snap and with it his whole story dont you worry rebus stared at watson what he said made sense more than that it was actually fairly subtle and shrewd maybe the farmer wasnt so agricultural in his ways after all he sighed whatever you say sir watson nodded smiling by the way he said remember that fellow andrews ran a club called finlays we had lunch with him sir thats right hes invited me to apply for membership good for you sir apparently the waiting lists about a year long all these rich sassenachs coming north but he said he could do a bit of pruning in my case i told him not to bother i seldom drink and i certainly dont gamble still a nice gesture all the same maybe i should ask him to consider you in my place thatd give you something to do with your time off eh yes sir rebus seemed to consider the suggestion booze and gambling not a bad combination his face brightened yes sir he said that would be very kind of you ill see what i can do then one last thing yes sir are you intending to go to malcolm lanyons party tonight remember he invited us at the eyrie id forgotten all about it sir would it be more proper for me to stay away not at all i may not manage along myself but i see no reason why you shouldnt attend but not a word about watson nodded towards the door and by implication to the interview room beyond understood sir thank you oh and john yes sir dont swear at me ever with respect or otherwise okay rebus felt his cheeks reddening not in anger but in shame yes sir he said making his exit holmes was waiting impatiently in rebuss office what did he want then who rebus was supremely nonchalant oh watson you mean he wanted to tell me that hes put my name forward for finlays finlays club holmes face was quizzical this wasnt what hed been expecting at all thats right at my age i think i deserve a club in town dont you i dont know oh and he also wanted to remind me about a party tonight at malcolm lanyons place the lawyer thats him rebus had holmes at a disadvantage and knew it i hope youve been busy while ive been having a chinwag eh hydes and jekylls brian i asked you for addresses ive got the list here not too long thank the lord i suppose im going to be shoeleather on this one rebus looked flabbergasted not at all youve got better things to be doing with your time no i think this time the shoeleather ought to be mine but with respect shouldnt you be keeping out of things with respect brian thats none of your bloody business from home rebus tried phoning gill but she couldnt be reached keeping out of things no doubt she had been quiet during the drive home last night and hadnt invited him in fair enough he supposed he wasnt about to take advantage so why was he trying to telephone her of course he was trying to take advantage he wanted her back he tidied the living room did some washing up and took a binbagsworth of dirty washing to the local laundrette for a service wash the attendant mrs mackay was full of outrage about calum mccallum yons a celebrity and a they should ken better rebus smiled and nodded agreement back in the flat he sat down and picked up a book knowing he wouldnt be able to keep his mind on it he didnt want hyde to win and kept away from the case thats exactly what would happen he took the slip of paper from his pocket there were no people with the surname jekyll in the lothians and a scant dozen with the surname hyde at least those were the ones he could be sure about what if hyde possessed an unlisted number hed get brian holmes to check the possibility he reached for the telephone and was halfway through the number before he realised he was calling gills office he punched in the rest of the number what the hell she wouldnt be there anyway hello it was gill templers voice sounding as unflappable as ever yes but that sort of trick was easy by phone all the oldest tricks were its john hello there thanks for the lift home how are you im fine honestly i just feel a bit i dont know confused doesnt seem to cover it i feel as though ive been conned thats as near as i can get to an explanation are you going to see him what in fife no i dont think so its not that i couldnt face him i want to see him its the thought of walking into the station with everyone knowing who i was why i was there id go with you gill if you wanted thanks john maybe in a day or two but not yet understood he became aware that he was gripping the receiver too hard that his fingers were hurting god this was hurting him all over did she have any inkling of his feelings right this minute he was sure he couldnt put them into words the words hadnt been coined he felt so close to her and yet so far away like a schoolkid whod lost his first girlfriend thanks for phoning john i appreciate it but id better be getting oh right right you are well youve got my number gill take care bye j he broke the connection dont crowd her john he was thinking thats how you lost her the first time dont go making any assumptions she doesnt like that give her space maybe he had made a mistake phoning in the first place hell and damn with respect that little weasel called james that little toerag hed rip his head from his shoulders when he got him he wondered how much hyde had paid the kid considerably more than two tenpound notes that was for sure the telephone rang rebus here john its gill again ive just heard the news why didnt you tell me tell you what he affected indifference knowing shed see through it immediately about this complaint against you oh that come on gill you know this sort of thing happens from time to time yes but why didnt you say why did you let me prattle on like that you werent prattling dammit she was almost in tears now why do you always have to try and hide things from me like that whats the matter with you he was about to explain when the line went dead he stared at the receiver dumbly wondering just why he hadnt told her in the first place because she had worries of her own because he was embarrassed because he hadnt wanted the pity of a vulnerable woman there were reasons enough werent there of course there were it was just that none of them seemed to make him feel any better why do you always have to try and hide things from me there was that word again hide a verb an action and a noun a place and a person faceless but rebus was beginning to know him so well the adversary was cunning there was no doubting that but he couldnt hope to tie up all the loose threads the way hed tied up ronnie and carew the way he was trying to tie up john rebus the telephone rang again rebus here its superintendent watson im glad i caught you at home because rebus added silently it means im not out on the street causing trouble for you yes sir any problem quite the reverse theyre still questioning this male prostitute shouldnt be too long now but meantime the reason i called is because ive been on to the casino casino sir you know finlays oh yes and they say that youll be welcome there anytime should you wish to pop in youve just to mention finlay andrews name and thats your ticket right sir well thanks for that my pleasure john shame youre having to take it easy what with this suicide business and all the press are all over it sniffing around for any little piece of dirt they can find what a job eh yes sir mccalls fielding their questions i just hope he doesnt appear on the box not exactly photogenic is he watson made this sound like rebuss fault and rebus was on the point of apologising when the superintendent placed a hand over the mouthpiece at his end while he had a few words with someone and when he came on again it was to say a hasty goodbye press conference apparently he said and that was that rebus stared at the receiver for a full minute if there were to be any more calls let them come now they didnt he threw the instrument onto the floor where it landed heavily secretly he was hoping to break it one of these days so he could go back to an oldstyle handset but the blasted thing seemed tougher than it looked he was opening the book when the doorknocker sounded tappity tap tap a business call then and not mrs cochrane wondering why he hadnt washed the communal stairwell yet it was brian holmes can i come in i suppose so rebus felt no real enthusiasm but left the door open for the young detective to follow him through to the living room if he so desired he so desired following rebus with mock heartiness i was just looking at a flat near tollcross and thought id skip the excuses brian youre checking up on me sit down and tell me whats been happening in my absence rebus checked his watch while holmes seated himself an absence for the record of just under two hours ach i was concerned thats all rebus stared at him simple direct and to the point maybe rebus could learn something from holmes after all its not farmers orders then not at all and as it happens i did have a flat to look at what was it like ghastly beyond speech cooker in the living room shower in a wee cupboard no bath no kitchen how much did they want for it no on second thoughts dont tell me it would just depress me it certainly depressed me you can always make an offer on this place when they throw me inside for corrupting a minor holmes looked up saw that rebus was smiling and gave a relieved grin the guys storys already coming apart at the seams did you ever doubt it of course not anyway i thought these might cheer you up holmes brandished a large manilla envelope which had been discreetly tucked inside his cord jacket rebus hadnt seen this cord jacket before and supposed it to be the detective constables flatbuying uniform what are they said rebus accepting the packet pics last nights raid thought you might be interested rebus opened the envelope and withdrew a set of tenbyeight black and whites they showed the more or less blurred shapes of men scrambling across waste ground what light there was had about it a halogen starkness sending up huge black shadows and capturing some faces in chalky states of shock and surprise where did you get these that ds hendry sent them across with a note sympathising over nell he thought these might cheer me up i told you he was a good bloke any idea which one of these goons is the dj holmes leapt from his seat and crouched beside rebus who was holding a photograph at the ready no holmes said theres a better shot of him he thumbed through the set until he found the picture he was looking for here we are that one there thats mccallum rebus studied the fuzzy semblance before him the look of fear so distinct against the blurred face could have been drawn by a child wide eyes and a mouth puckered into an o arms suspended as though between rapid flight and final surrender rebus smiled a smile that reached all the way up to his eyes youre sure this is him one of the pcs at the station recognised him he said he once got mccallum to sign an autograph for him im impressed shouldnt think hell be signing too many more though where are they holding him everybody they arrested has gone to dunfermline nick thats nice for them by the by did they nab the ringleaders each and every one including brightman he was the boss davy brightman the scrappie thats him i played against that bugger at football a couple of times when i was at school he played left back for his team when i was on the wing for ours he gave me a good studding one match revenge is sweet said holmes it is that brian rebus was studying the photograph again it is that actually a couple of the punters did scarper apparently but theyre all on film the camera never lies eh sir rebus began to sift through the other pictures a powerful tool the camera he said his face suddenly changed sir are you all right rebuss voice was reduced to a whisper ive just had a revelation brian a whatsit epiphany is it no idea sir holmes was sure now that something inside his superior had snapped epiphany yes i know where this has all been leading brian im sure of it that bastard on calton hill said something about pictures some pictures everybody was interested in theyre ronnies pictures what the ones in his bedroom no not those the ones at huttons studio then not quite no i dont know exactly where these particular pictures are but ive got a bloody good idea hide can be a noun brian come on where holmes watched as rebus sprang from his chair heading for the door he started to collect the photographs which rebus had let fall from his hands never mind those rebus ordered slipping on a jacket but where the hell are we going you just answered your own question rebus said turning back to grin at holmes thats exactly where were going but where to hell of course come on it was turning cold the sun had just about tired itself out and was retiring from the contest the clouds were stickingplaster pink two great final sunbeams shone down like torchlight upon pilmuir and picked out just the one building leaving the other houses in the street untouched rebus sucked in breath he had to admit it was quite a sight like the stable at bethlehem said holmes a damned queer stable rebus retorted gods got a funny sense of humour if this is his idea of a joke you did say we were going to hell i wasnt expecting cecil b demille to be in on it though whats going on there almost hidden by the days last gasp of sunlight a van and a hire skip were parked directly in front of ronnies house the council holmes suggested probably cleaning the place up why in gods name theres plenty that need housing holmes replied rebus wasnt listening as the car pulled to a stop he was out and walking briskly towards the skip it was filling up with the detritus of the squats interior there were sounds of hammering from within in the back of the van a workman supped from a plastic cup his thermos clutched in his other hand whos in charge here rebus demanded the workman blew on the contents of his cup then took another swig before replying me i suppose his eyes were wary he could smell authority a mile off this is a legitimate teabreak never mind that whats going on who wants to know cid wants to know he looked hard at rebuss harder face and made up his mind instantly well we got word to come and clean this place up make it habitable on whose orders i dont know somebodys we just take the chitty and go do the job right rebus had turned from the man and was walking up the path to the front door holmes having smiled apologetically at the foreman followed in the living room two workmen in overalls and thick red rubber gloves were whitewashing the walls charlies pentagram had already been covered its outline barely visible through the drying layer of paint the men looked towards rebus then to the wall well cover it up next coat said one dont worry yourself about that rebus stared at the man then marched past holmes out of the room he started to climb the stairs and turned into ronnies bedroom another workman much younger than the two downstairs was gathering ronnies few belongings together into a large black plastic bag as rebus entered the room the boy was caught frozen stuffing one of the paperbacks into the pocket of his overalls rebus pointed to the book theres a next of kin son put it in the bag with the rest something about his tone persuaded the teenager to obey come across anything else interesting rebus asked now hands in pockets approaching the teenager nothing the boy said guiltily in particular rebus went on as though the teenager had not spoken photographs maybe just a few maybe a whole packet hmm no nothing like that youre sure sure right get down to the van and bring up a crowbar or something i want these floorboards up eh you heard me son do it holmes just stood and watched in silent appreciation rebus seemed to have grown in physical stature becoming broader taller holmes couldnt quite fathom the trick maybe it had something to do with the hands in the pockets the way the elbows jarred outwards lending apparent substance to the frame whatever it was it worked the young workman stumbled out of the door and down the stairs youre sure theyll be here said holmes quietly he tried to keep his tone level not wishing to sound too sceptical but rebus was way past that stage in rebuss mind the photographs were already in his hand im certain brian i can smell them youre sure thats not just the bathroom rebus turned and looked at him as though seeing him for the very first time you might have a point brian you just might holmes followed rebus to the bathroom as rebus kicked open the door the stench embraced both men arching them forward in a convulsive fit of gagging rebus brought a handkerchief from his pocket pushed it to his face and leaned towards the door handle pulling the door shut again id forgotten about that place he said then wait here he returned with the foreman a plastic dustbin a shovel and three small white facemasks one of which he handed to holmes an elasticated band held the cardboard snout in place and holmes breathed deeply testing the apparatus he was just about to say something about the smell still being noticeable when rebus toed open the door again and as the foreman angled an industrial lamp into the bathroom walked over the threshold rebus pulled the dustbin to the rim of the bath and left it there gesturing for the lamp to be shone into the bath itself holmes nearly fell backwards out of the room a fat rat caught in the act of feasting upon the rotten contents of the bath squealed red eyes burning directly into the light rebus swung the shovel down and cut the animal in two neat halves holmes spun from the room and lifting the mask retched against the damp wall he tried taking gulps of air but the smell was overpowering the nausea returning in quickening floods back inside the room the foreman and rebus exchanged a smile which wrinkled their eyes above the facemasks they had seen worse than this much worse in their time then neither man naive enough to want to linger they set to work the foreman holding the lamp while rebus shovelled the contents of the bath slowly into the dustbin the mess of raw sewage ran slickly from the shovel spattering rebuss shirt and trousers he ignored it ignored everything but the task at hand he had done dirtier jobs in the army dirtier jobs by far during his failed training in the sas this was routine and at least here there was some purpose to the task some end in view or so he hoped holmes meantime was wiping his moist eyes with the back of his hand through the open door he could see the progress being made eerie shadows cast across the wall and ceiling by the lamp as one silhouette shovelled shit into a bin filling it noisily it was like a scene from some latterday inferno lacking only the devils to goad the damned workers on but these men looked if not happy in their work then at least well professional sprang to mind dear god all he wanted was a flat to call his own and the occasional holiday and a decent car and nell of course this would make a funny story for her one day but the last thing he felt like doing was smiling then he heard the cackle of laughter and looking around him it took several moments to realise that it was coming from the bathroom that it was john rebuss laugh and that rebus was dipping his hand into the mess drawing it out again with something clinging to it holmes didnt even notice the thick rubberised gloves which protected rebus up to his elbows he simply turned and walked downstairs on brittle legs got you rebus cried theres a hose outside the foreman said lead on said rebus shaking the packet free of some of its clots lead on macduff the names macbeth the foreman called back heading for the stairway in the cool fresh air they hosed down the package standing it up against the front wall of the house as they did so rebus peered at it closely a red plastic bag like the carrier from a record shop had been wrapped around some cloth a shirt or the like the whole had been stuck down with a rolls worth of sellotape then tied with string knotted resolutely in the middle clever little tyke werent you ronnie rebus said to himself as he picked up the package cleverer than they could ever have thought at the van he threw down the rubber gloves shook the foremans hand and exchanged the names of local watering holes with him making promises of a drink a nippy sweetie some night in the future then he headed for the car holmes following sheepishly all the way back to rebuss flat holmes didnt once dare to suggest that they open a window and let in some fresh air rebus was like a child on a birthday morning who has just found his surprise he clutched the parcel to him staining his shirt even more yet seemed loath to open it now that he possessed it he could forestall the revelation it would happen that was all that mattered when they arrived at the flat however rebuss mood changed again and he dashed to the kitchen for some scissors holmes meantime made his excuses and went to the bathroom scrubbing his hands bared arms and face thoroughly his scalp itched and he wished he could throw himself into the shower and stand beneath it for an hour or two as he was coming out of the bathroom he heard the sound from the kitchen it was the antithesis of the laughter he had heard earlier a kind of exasperated wail he walked quickly to the kitchen and saw rebus standing there head bowed hands held out against the worktop as though supporting himself the packet was open in front of him john whats wrong rebuss voice was soft suddenly tired theyre just pictures of a bloody boxing match thats all they are just bloody sports photos holmes came forward slowly fearing noise and movement might crack rebus completely maybe he suggested peering over rebuss slumped shoulder maybe theres somebody in the crowd in the audience this hyde could be one of the spectators the spectators are just a blur take a look holmes did there were twelve or so photographs two featherweights no love lost were slugging it out there was nothing subtle about the contest but nothing unusual about it either maybe its hydes boxing club maybe said rebus not really caring any more he had been so sure that he would find the pictures and so sure that they would prove the final clinching piece of the puzzle why were they hidden away so carefully so cunningly and so well protected there had to be a reason maybe said holmes who was becoming irritating again maybe theres something were missing the cloth theyre wrapped in the envelope dont be so bloody thick holmes rebus slammed a hand against the worktop and immediately calmed sorry jesus sorry thats all right holmes said coldly ill make some coffee or something then why dont we take a good look at those snaps eh yes rebus said pushing himself upright good idea he headed towards the door im going to take a shower he turned and smiled at holmes i must stink to high heaven a very agricultural smell sir holmes said smiling also they laughed at the shared reference to farmer watson then rebus went to have his shower and holmes made the coffee jealous of the sounds from the bathroom he took another look at the photographs a close look hoping for something something he could use to impress rebus with to cheer rebus up just a little the boxers were young photographed from ringside or near as dammit but the photographer ronnie mcgrath presumably hadnt used a flash depending instead upon the smoky lights above the ring consequently neither boxers nor audience were recognisable as distinct individuals their faces were grainy the outlines of the combatants themselves blurred with sluggish movement why hadnt the photographer used a flash in one photo the righthand side of the frame was dark cut off at an angle by something getting in the way of the lens what a passing spectator somebodys jacket it struck holmes with sudden clarity the photographers jacket had got in the way and it had done so because the photos were being taken surreptitiously from beneath a jacket this would explain the poor quality of the photos and the uneven angles of most of them so there had to be a reason for them and they had to be the clue rebus was seeking all they had to do now was discover just what kind of clue the shower became a drip then died altogether a few moments later rebus appeared clad only in a towel holding it around his gut as he went to the bedroom to change he was balancing with one foot poised above a trouser leg when holmes burst in waving the photographs i think ive got it he exclaimed rebus looked up surprised then slipped on the trousers yes he said i think ive worked it out too it came to me just now in the shower oh so fetch us a coffee said rebus and lets go into the living room and see if weve worked out the same thing okay right said holmes wondering again why it was that hed joined the police when there were so many more rewarding careers out there to be had when he arrived in the living room carrying the two mugs of coffee rebus was pacing up and down his telephone handset wedged against his ear right he was saying ill wait no no i wont call back i said ill wait thank you taking the coffee from holmes he rolled his eyes exhibiting disbelief at the stupidity of the person on the other end of the telephone who is it holmes mouthed silently the council said rebus aloud i got a name and an extension number from andrew whos andrew andrew macbeth the foreman i want to find out who authorised the cleaning out of the house a bit of a coincidence that dont you think cleaning it out just as we were about to do a bit of poking around he turned his attention to the handset yes thats right oh i see he looked at holmes his eyes betraying nothing how might that have happened he listened again yes i see oh yes i agree it does seem a bit curious still these things happen eh roll on computerisation thanks for your help anyway he pressed a button kiling the connection you probably caught the gist of that theyve no record of who authorised the clearout quite so brian the documentation is all in order but for the little matter of a signature they cant understand it any handwriting to go on the chitty andrew showed me was typed so what are you saying that mr hyde seems to have friends everywhere in the council for starters but probably in the police too not to mention several less savoury institutions what now those pictures what else is there to go on they studied each frame closely taking their time pointing out this or that blur or detail trying ideas out on one another it was a painstaking business and throughout rebus was muttering to himself about ronnie mcgraths final words to tracy about how they had been the key throughout the triple meaning make yourself scarce beware a man called hyde and ive hidden something away so clever so compact almost too clever for ronnie maybe the meanings had been there without his realising it himself at the end of ninety minutes rebus threw the final photograph down onto the floor holmes was half lying along the settee rubbing his forehead with one hand as he held up one of the pictures in the other his eyes refusing to focus any longer its no use brian no use at all i cant make sense out of any of them can you not a lot holmes admitted but i take it hyde wanted wants these pictures badly meaning meaning he knows they exist but he doesnt know how crude they are he thinks they show something they dont yes but what ill tell you something ronnie mcgrath had bruises on his body the night he died not surprising when you remember that someone dragged his body down the stairs no he was already dead then this was before his brother noticed tracy noticed but nobody ever asked somebody said something to me about rough trade he pointed towards the scattering of snapshots maybe this is what they meant a boxing match an illegal bout two unmatched kids knocking blue hell out of one another for what rebus stared at the wall looking for the word he lacked then he turned to holmes the same reason men set up dog fights for kicks it all sounds incredible maybe it is incredible the way my mind is just now i could believe bombers have been found on the moon he stretched what time is it nearly eight arent you supposed to be going to malcolm lanyons party jesus rebus sprang to his feet im late i forgot all about it well ill leave you to get ready theres not much we can do about this holmes gestured towards the photographs i should visit nell anyway yes yes off you go brian rebus paused and thanks holmes smiled and shrugged his shoulders one thing rebus began yes i dont have a clean jacket can i borrow yours it wasnt a great fit the sleeves being slightly too long the chest too small but it wasnt bad either rebus tried to seem casual about it all as he stood on malcolm lanyons doorstep the door was opened by the same stunning oriental who had been by lanyons side at the eyrie she was dressed in a lowcut black dress which barely reached down to her upper thighs she smiled at rebus recognising him or at least pretending to do so come in i hope im not late not at all malcolms parties arent run by the clock people come and go as they please her voice had a cool but not unpleasant edge to it looking past her rebus was relieved to see several male guests wearing lounge suits and some wearing sports jackets lanyons personal rebus wondered just how personal assistant led him into the dining room where a barman stood behind a table laden with bottles and glasses the doorbell rang again fingers touched rebuss shoulder if youll excuse me she said of course said rebus he turned towards the barman gin and tonic he said then he turned again to watch her pass through the large hallway towards the main door hello john a much firmer hand slapped rebuss shoulder it belonged to tommy mccall hello tommy rebus accepted a drink from the barman and mccall handed over his own empty glass for a refill glad you could make it of course its not quite as lively as usual tonight everyones a bit subdued subdued it was true the conversations around them were muted then rebus noticed a few black ties i only came along because i thought james would have wanted it that way of course rebus said nodding hed forgotten all about james carews suicide christ it had only happened this morning it seemed like a lifetime ago and all these people had been carews friends or acquaintances rebuss nostrils twitched had he seemed depressed lately he asked not especially hed just bought himself that car remember hardly the act of a depressed man i suppose not did you know him well i dont think any of us knew him well he kept himself pretty much to himself and of course he spent a lot of time away from town sometimes on business sometimes staying on his estate he wasnt married was he tommy mccall stared at him then took a large mouthful of whisky no he said i dont believe he ever was its a blessing in a way yes i see what you mean said rebus feeling the gin easing itself into his system but i still dont understand why he would do it its always the quiet ones though isnt it malcolm was just saying that a few minutes ago rebus looked around them i havent seen our host yet i think hes in the lounge shall i give you the tour yes why not its quite a place mccall turned to rebus shall we start upstairs in the billiards room or downstairs at the swimming pool rebus laughed and shook his empty glass i think the first place to visit is the bar dont you the house was stunning there was no other word for it rebus thought briefly of poor brian holmes and smiled you and me both kid the guests were nice too he recognised some of them by face some by name a few by reputation and many by the titles of the companies they headed but of the host there was no sign though everyone claimed to have spoken with him earlier in the evening later as tommy mccall was becoming noisy and inebriated rebus by no means on his steadiest legs himself decided on another tour of the house but alone this time there was a library on the first floor which had received cursory attention on the first circuit but there was a working desk in there and rebus was keen to take a closer look on the landing he glanced around him but everyone seemed to be downstairs a few guests had even donned swimsuits and were lounging by or in the twentyfootlong heated pool in the basement he turned the heavy brass handle and slipped into the dimly lit library in here there was a smell of old leather a smell which took rebus back to past decades the twenties say or perhaps the thirties there was a lamp on the desktop illuminating some papers there rebus was at the desk before he realised something the lamp had not been lit on his first visit here he turned and saw lanyon standing against the far wall with his arms folded grinning inspector he said his voice as rich as his tailoring what an interesting jacket that is saiko told me youd arrived lanyon walked forward slowly and extended a hand which rebus took he returned the firm grip i hope im not he began i mean it was kind of you good lord not at all is the superintendent coming rebus shrugged his shoulders feeling the jacket tight across his back no well never mind i see that like me you are a studious man lanyon surveyed the shelves of books this is my favourite room in the whole house i dont know why i bother holding parties it is expected i suppose and thats why i do it also of course it is interesting to note the various permutations whos talking with whom whose hand just happened to squeeze whose arm a touch too tenderly that sort of thing you wont see much from here rebus said but saiko tells me shes marvellous at catching that sort of thing no matter how subtle people think they are being for example she told me about your jacket beige she said cord neither matching the rest of your wardrobe nor quite fitting your figure therefore borrowed am i right rebus applauded silently bravo he said i suppose thats what makes you such a good lawyer no years and years of study are what have made me a good lawyer but to be a known lawyer well that demands a few simple party tricks such as the one ive just shown you lanyon walked past rebus and stopped at the writing desk he sifted through the papers was there anything special you were interested in no said rebus just this room lanyon glanced towards him smiling not quite believing there are more interesting rooms in the house but i keep those locked oh one doesnt want everyone to know just what paintings one has collected for example yes i see lanyon sat at the desk now and slipped on a pair of halfmoon glasses he seemed interested in the papers before him im james carews executor he said thats what ive been trying to sort out who will benefit from his will a terrible business lanyon seemed not to understand then he nodded yes yes tragic i take it you were close to him lanyon smiled again as though he knew this same question had been asked of several people at the party already i knew him fairly well he said at last did you know he was homosexual rebus had been hoping for a response there was none and he cursed having played his trump card so soon in the game of course lanyon said in the same level voice he turned towards rebus i dont believe its a crime that all depends sir as you should know what do you mean as a lawyer you must know that there are still certain laws yes yes of course but i hope youre not suggesting that james was involved in anything sordid why do you think he killed himself mr lanyon id appreciate your professional opinion he was a friend professional opinions dont count lanyon stared at the heavy curtains in front of his desk i dont know why he committed suicide im not sure well ever know i wouldnt bet on that sir said rebus going to the door he stopped hand on the handle id be interested to know who will benefit from the estate when youve worked it all out of course lanyon was silent rebus opened the door closed it behind him and paused on the landing breathing deeply not a bad performance he thought to himself at the very least it was worthy of a drink and this time he would toast in silence the memory of james carew nursemaid was not his favourite occupation but hed known all along that it would come to this tommy mccall was singing a rugby song in the back of the car while rebus waved a hasty goodbye to saiko who was standing on the doorstep she even managed a smile well after all he was doing her a favour in quietly removing the loud drunkard from the premises am i under arrest john mccall yelled interrupting his song no now shut up for christs sake rebus got into the car and started the engine he glanced back one last time and saw lanyon join saiko on the doorstep she seemed to be filling him in on events and he was nodding it was the first rebus had seen of him since their confrontation in the library he released the handbrake pulled out of the parking space and drove off left here then next right tommy mccall had had too much to drink but his sense of direction seemed unimpaired yet rebus had a strange feeling along to the end of this road and its the last house on the corner but this isnt where you live rebus protested quite correct inspector this is where my brother lives i thought wed drop in for a nightcap jesus tommy you cant just rubbish hell be delighted to see us as rebus pulled up in front of the house he looked out of his side window and was relieved to see that tony mccalls living room was still illuminated suddenly tommys hand thrust past him and pushed down on the horn sending a loud blare into the silent night rebus pushed the hand away and tommy fell back into his seat but hed done enough the curtains twitched in the mccall living room and a moment later a door to the side of the house opened and tony mccall came out glancing back nervously rebus wound down the window john tony mccall seemed anxious whats the matter but before rebus could explain tommy was out of the car and hugging his brother its my fault tony all mine i just wanted to see you thats all sorry though sorry tony mccall took the situation in glanced towards rebus as if to say i dont blame you then turned to his brother well this is very thoughtful of you tommy long time no see youd better come in tommy mccall turned to rebus see i told you thered be a welcome waiting for us at tonys house always a welcome at tonys youd better come in too john said tony rebus nodded unhappily tony directed them through the hall and into the living room the carpet was thick and yielding underfoot the furnishings looking like a showroom display rebus was afraid to sit for fear of denting one of the puffedup cushions tommy however collapsed immediately into a chair wheres the wee ones he said in bed tony answered keeping his voice low ach wake them up then tell them their uncle tommys here tony ignored this ill put the kettle on he said tommys eyes were already closing his arms slumped either side of him on the arms of the chair while tony was in the kitchen rebus studied the room there were ornaments everywhere along the length of the mantelpiece covering the available surfaces of the large wallunit arranged on the surface of the coffee table small plaster figurines shimmering glass creations holiday souvenirs the arms and backs of chairs and sofa were protected by antimacassars the whole room was busy and ill at ease relaxation would be almost impossible he began to understand now why tony mccall had been out walking in pilmuir on his day off a womans head peered round the door its lips were thin and straight eyes alert but dark she was staring at the slumbering figure of tommy mccall but caught sight of rebus and prepared a kind of smile the door opened a little wider showing that she was wearing a dressing gown a hand clutched this tight around her throat as she began to speak im sheila tonys wife yes hello john rebus rebus made to stand but a nervous hand fluttered him back down oh yes she said tonys talked about you you work together dont you thats right yes her attention was wandering and she turned her gaze back to tommy mccall her voice became like damp wallpaper would you look at him the successful brother his own business big house just look at him she seemed about to launch into a speech on social injustice but was interrupted by her husband who was now squeezing past her carrying a tray no need for you to get up love he said i could hardly sleep through that horn blaring could i her eyes now were on the tray youve forgotten the sugar she said critically i dont take sugar rebus said tony was pouring tea from the pot into two cups milk first tony then tea she said ignoring rebuss remark it doesnt make a blind bit of difference sheila said tony he handed a cup to rebus thanks she stood for a second or two watching the two men then ran a hand down the front of her dressing gown right then she said good night good night concurred rebus try not to be too long tony right sheila they listened sipping tea as she climbed the stairs to her bedroom then tony mccall exhaled sorry about that he said what for said rebus if a couple of drunks had walked into my home at this time of night you wouldnt want to hear the reception id give them i thought she stayed remarkably calm sheilas always remarkably calm on the outside rebus nodded towards tommy what about him hell be all right where he is let him sleep it off are you sure i can take him home if you no no christ hes my brother i think a chair for the night is called for tony looked across towards tommy look at him you wouldnt believe the tricks we got up to when we were kids we had the neighbourhood terrified of what wed do next chapdoorrun setting bonfires putting the football through somebodys window we were wild i can tell you now i never see him unless hes like this you mean hes pulled this stunt before once or twice turns up in a taxi crashes out in the chair when he wakes up the next morning he cant believe where he is has breakfast slips the kids a few quid and hes off never phones or visits then one night we hear the taxi chugging outside and there he is i didnt realise ach i dont know why im telling you john its not your problem after all i dont mind listening but tony mccall seemed reluctant to go further how do you like this room he asked instead its nice rebus lied a lot of thoughts gone into it yes mccall sounded unconvinced a lot of money too see those little glass bauble things you wouldnt believe how much one of those can cost really mccall was examining the room as though he were the visitor welcome to my life he said at last i think id rather have one of the cells down the station he got up suddenly and walked across to tommys chair then crouched down in front of his brother one of whose eyes was open but glazed with sleep you bugger tony mccall whispered you bugger you bugger and he bowed his head so as not to show the tears it was growing light as rebus drove the four miles back to marchmont he stopped at an all night bakery and bought warm rolls and refrigerated milk this was the time when he liked the city best the peaceful camaraderie of early morning he wondered why people couldnt be happy with their lot ive got everything ive never wanted and it isnt enough all he wanted now was sleep and in his bed for a change rather than on the chair he kept playing the scene over and over tommy mccall dead to the world saliva on his chin and tony mccall crouched in front of him body shaking with emotion a brother was a terrible thing he was a lifelong competitor yet you couldnt hate him without hating yourself and there were other pictures too malcolm lanyon in his study saiko standing at the door james carew dead in his bed nell stapletons bruised face ronnie mcgraths battered torso old vanderhyde with his unseeing eyes the fear in calum mccallums eyes tracy with her tiny fists if i am the chief of sinners i am the chief of sufferers also carew had stolen that line from somewhere but where who cares john who cares it would just be another bloody thread and there were far too many of those already knotted into an impenetrable tangle get home sleep forget one thing was for sure hed have some wild dreams saturday or if you shall so prefer to choose a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you here in this room upon the instant in fact he didnt dream at all and when he woke up it was the weekend the sun was shining and his telephone was ringing hello john its gill oh hello gill how are you im fine what about you great this was not a lie he hadnt slept so well in weeks and there was not a trace of hangover within him sorry to ring so early any progress on the smear smear the things that kid was saying about you oh that no i havent heard anything yet he was thinking about lunch about a picnic about a drive in the country are you in edinburgh he asked no fife fife what are you doing there calums here remember of course i remember but i thought you were steering clear of him he wanted to see me actually thats why im calling oh rebus wrinkled his brow curious calum wants to talk to you to me why hell tell you that himself i suppose he just asked me to tell you rebus thought for a moment do you want me to talk to him cant say im much bothered either way i told him id pass on the message and i told him it was the last favour he could expect from me her voice was as slick and cool as a slate roof in the rain rebus felt himself sliding down that roof wanting to please her wanting to help oh yes she said and he said that if you sounded dubious i was to tell you its to do with hydes hydes rebus stood up sharply hydeapostrophes hydes what she laughed i dont know john but it sounds as if it means something to you it does gill are you in dunfermline calling from the stations front desk okay ill see you there in an hour fine john she sounded unconcerned bye he cut the connection put his jacket on and left the flat the traffic was busy towards tollcross busy all the way down lothian road and winding across princes street towards queensferry road since the deregulation of public transport the centre of the city had become a black farce of buses double deckers single deckers even minibuses all vying for custom locked behind two claretcoloured lrt double deckers and two green single deckers rebus began to lose his tiny cache of patience he slammed his hand down hard on the horn and pulled out revving past the line of stalled traffic a motorcycle messenger squeezing through between the two directions of slower traffic had to swerve to avoid the imminent accident and slewed against a saab rebus knew he should stop he kept on going if only hed had one of those magnetic flashing sirens the kind cid used on the roofs of their cars whenever they were late for dinner or an engagement but all he had were his headlights fullbeam and the horn having cleared the tailback he eased his hand off the horn switched off the lamps and cruised into the outside lane of the widening road despite a pause at the dreaded barnton roundabout he made good time to the forth road bridge paid the toll and drove across not too fast wanting as ever to take in the view rosyth naval dockyard was below him on the left a lot of his schoolfriends lot being relative hed never made that many friends had slipped easily into jobs at rosyth and were probably still there it seemed to be about the only place in fife where work was still available the mines were closing with enforced regularity somewhere along the coast in the other direction men were burrowing beneath the forth scooping out coal in a decreasingly profitable curve hyde calum mccallum knew something about hyde knew too that rebus was interested so word must have got around his foot pressed down further on the accelerator mccallum would want a trade of course charges dropped or somehow jigged into a shape less damning fine fine hed promise him the sun and the moon and the stars just so long as he knew knew who hyde was knew where hyde was just so long as he knew the main police station in dunfermline was easy to find situated just off a roundabout on the outskirts of the town gill was easy to find too she was sitting in her car in the spacious car park outside the station rebus parked next to her got out of his car and into the passenger side of hers morning he said hello john are you okay this was on reflection perhaps the most unnecessary question he had ever posed her face had lost colour and substance and her head seemed to be shrinking into her shoulders while her hands gripped the steering wheel fingernails rapping softly against the top of the dashboard im fine she said and they both smiled at the lie i told them at the desk that you were coming anything you want me to tell our friend her voice was resonant nothing okay rebus pushed open the car door and closed it again but softly then he headed towards the station entrance she had wandered the hospital corridors for over an hour it was visiting time so no one much minded as she walked into this and that ward passing the beds smiling down occasionally on the sick old men and women who stared up at her with lonely eyes she watched families decide who should and should not take turns at grandpas bedside there being two only at a time allowed she was looking for one woman in particular though she wasnt sure she would recognise her all she had to go on was the fact that the librarian would have a broken nose maybe she hadnt been kept in maybe shed already gone home to her husband or boyfriend or whatever maybe tracy would be better off waiting and going to the library again except that theyd be watching and waiting for her the guard would know her the librarian would know her but would she know the librarian a bell rang out drilling into her the fact that visiting hours were coming to an end she hurried to the next ward wondering what if the librarians in a private room or in another hospital or no there she was tracy stopped dead turned in a halfcircle and walked to the far end of the ward visitors were saying their goodbyes and take cares to the patients everybody looked relieved both visitors and visited she mingled with them as they put chairs back into stacks and donned coats scarves gloves then she paused and looked back towards the librarians bed there were flowers all around it and the single visitor a man was leaning over the librarian to kiss her lingeringly on the forehead the librarian squeezed the mans hand and and the man looked familiar to tracy shed seen him before at the police station he was some friend of rebuss and he was a policeman she remembered him checking on her while she was being held in the cells oh jesus shed attacked a policemans wife she wasnt sure now wasnt sure at all why had she come could she go through with it now she walked with one family out of the ward then rested against the wall in the corridor outside could she yes if her nerve held yes she could she was pretending to examine a drinks vending machine when holmes sauntered through the swinging ward doors and walked slowly down the corridor away from her she waited a full two minutes counting up to one hundred and twenty he wasnt coming back he hadnt forgotten anything tracy turned from the vending machine and made for the swing doors for her visiting time was just beginning she hadnt even reached the bed when a young nurse stopped her visiting hours finished now the nurse said tracy tried to smile tried to look normal it wasnt easy for her but lying was i just lost my watch i think i left it at my sisters bed she nodded in nells direction nell hearing the conversation had turned towards her her eyes opened wide as she recognised tracy well be as quick as you can eh said the nurse moving away tracy smiled at the nurse and watched her push through the swing doors now there were only the patients in their beds a sudden silence and her she approached nells bed hello she said she looked at the chart attached to the end of the iron bedstead nell stapleton she read what do you want nells eyes showed no fear her voice was thin coming from the back of her throat her nose having no part in the process i want to tell you something tracy said she came close to nell and crouched on the floor so that she would be barely visible from the doors of the ward she thought this made her look as though she were searching for a lost watch yes tracy smiled finding nells imperfect voice amusing she sounded like a puppet on a childrens programme the smile vanished quickly and she blushed remembering that the reason she was here was because she was responsible for this woman being here at all the plasters across the nose the bruising under the eyes all her doing i came to say im sorry thats all really just im sorry nells eyes were unblinking and tracy continued well nothing tell me said nell but it was too much for her shed done most of the talking while brian holmes had been in and her mouth was dry she turned and reached for the jug of water on the small cupboard beside the bed here ill do that tracy poured water into a plastic beaker and handed it to nell who sipped coating the inside of her mouth nice flowers said tracy from my boyfriend said nell between sips yes i saw him leaving hes a policeman isnt he i know he is because im a friend of inspector rebuss yes i know you do tracy seemed shocked so you know who i am i know your names tracy if thats what you mean tracy bit her bottom lip her face reddened again it doesnt matter does it nell said oh no tracy tried to sound nonchalant it doesnt matter i was going to ask yes tracy seemed keen for a change of subject what were you going to do in the library this wasnt quite to tracys liking she thought about it shrugged and said i was going to find ronnies photographs ronnies photographs nell perked up what little brian had said during visiting hour had been limited to the progress of ronnie mcgraths case and especially the discovery of some pictures at the dead boys house what was tracy talking about yes she said ronnie hid them in the library what were they exactly i mean why did he need to hide them tracy shrugged all he told me was that they were his life insurance policy thats exactly what he said life insurance policy and where exactly did he hide them on the fifth floor he said inside a bound volume of something called the edinburgh review i think its a magazine thats right said nell smiling it is brian holmes was made lightheaded by nells telephone call his first reaction however was pure shock and he chastised her for being out of bed im still in bed she said her voice becoming indistinct in her excitement they brought the payphone to my bedside now listen thirty minutes later he was being shown down an aisle on the fifth floor of edinburgh university library the member of staff checked complicated decimal numbers exhibited at each stack until satisfied she led him down one darkened row of large bound titles at the end of the aisle seated at a study desk by a large window a student stared disinterestedly towards holmes a pencil crunching in his mouth holmes smiled sympathetically towards the student who stared right through him here we are said the librarian edinburgh review and new edinburgh review it becomes new in as you can see of course we keep the earlier editions in a closed environment if you want those years specifically it will take a little time no these are fine really these are just what i need thank you the librarian bowed slightly accepting his thanks you will remember us all to nell wont you she said ill be talking to her later today i wont forget with another bow the librarian turned and walked back to the end of the stack she paused there and pressed a switch strip lighting flickered above holmes and stayed on he smiled his thanks but she was gone her rubber heels squeaking briskly towards the lift holmes looked at the spines of the bound volumes the collection was not complete which meant that someone had borrowed some of the years a stupid place to hide something he picked up held its spine by the forefingers of both his right and left hands and rocked it no scraps of paper no photographs were shaken free he put the volume back on the shelf and selected its neighbour shook it then replaced it the student at the study desk was no longer looking through him he was looking at him and doing so as if holmes were mad another volume yielded nothing then another holmes began to fear the worst hed been hoping for something with which to surprise rebus something to tie up all the loose ends hed tried contacting the inspector but rebus wasnt to be found wasnt anywhere he had vanished the photos made more noise than hed expected as they slid from the sheaves and hit the polished floor hit it with their glossy edges producing a sharp crack he bent and began to gather them up while the student looked on in fascination from what he could see of the images strewn across the floor holmes already felt disappointment curdling his elation they were copies of the boxing match pictures nothing more there were no new prints no revelations no surprises damn ronnie mcgrath for giving him hope all they were was life insurance on a life already forfeit he waited for the lift but it was busy elsewhere so he took the stairs winding downwards steeply and found himself on the ground floor but in a part of the library he didnt know a sort of antiquarian bookshop corridor narrow with mouldering books stacked up against both walls he squeezed through feeling a sudden chill he couldnt place and found himself opening a door onto the main concourse the librarian who had shown him around was back behind her desk she saw him and waved frantically he obeyed the command and hurried forward she picked up a telephone and pressed a button call for you she said stretching across the desktop to hand him the receiver hello he was quizzical who the hell knew he was here brian where in gods name have you been it was rebus of course ive been trying to find you everywhere im at the hospital holmess heart deflated within his chest nell he said so dramatically that even the librarians head shot up what growled rebus no no nells fine its just that she told me where to find you im phoning from the hospital and its costing me a fortune in confirmation the pips came and were followed by the chankling of coins in a slot the connection was reestablished nells okay brian told the librarian she nodded relieved and turned back to her work of course she is said rebus having caught the words now listen there are a few things i want you to do have you got a pen and paper brian found them on the desk he smiled remembering the first telephone conversation hed ever had with john rebus so similar to this a few things to be done christ so much had been done since got that holmes started sorry sir he said my mind was elsewhere could you repeat that there was an audible sound of mixed anger and excitement from the receiver then rebus started again and this time brian holmes heard every word tracy couldnt say why it was that shed visited nell stapleton or why shed told nell what she had she felt some kind of bond not merely because of what shed done there was something about nell stapleton something wise and kind something tracy had lacked in her life until now maybe thats why she was finding it so hard to leave the hospital she had walked the corridors drunk two cups of coffee in a cafe across the road from the main building wandered in and out of casualty xray even some clinic for diabetics shed tried to leave had walked as far as the citys art college before turning round and retreading the two hundred paces to the hospital and she was entering the side gates when the men grabbed her hey if youll just come with us miss they sounded like security men policemen even so she didnt resist maybe nell stapletons boyfriend wanted to see her to give her a good kicking she didnt care they were taking her towards the hospital entrance so she didnt resist not until it was too late at the last moment they stopped short turned her and pushed her into the back of an ambulance whats hey come on the doors were closing locking leaving her alone in the hot dim interior she thumped on the doors but the vehicle was already moving off as it pulled away she was thrown against the doors then back onto the floor when she had recovered herself she saw that the ambulance was an old one no longer used for its original purpose its insides had been gutted making it merely a van the windows had been boarded over and a metal panel separated her from the driver she clawed her way to this panel and began hitting it with her fists teeth gritted yelling from time to time as she remembered that the two men who had grabbed her at the gates were the same two men whod been following her that day on princes street that day shed run to john rebus oh god she murmured oh god oh god theyd found her at last the evening was sticky with heat the streets quiet for a saturday rebus rang the doorbell and waited while he waited he looked to left and right an immaculate double row of georgian houses stone frontages dulled black through time and car fumes some of the houses had been turned into offices for writers to the signet chartered accountants and small anonymous finance businesses but a few a precious few were still very comfortable and wellappointed homes for the wealthy and the industrious rebus had been to this street before a long time ago now in his earliest cid days investigating the death of a young girl he didnt remember much about the case now he was too busy getting ready for the evenings pleasures he tugged at the black bow tie around his throat the whole outfit dinner jacket shirt bow tie and patent shoes had been hired earlier in the day from a shop on george street he felt like an idiot but had to admit that examining himself in his bathroom mirror he looked pretty sharp he wouldnt be too out of place in an establishment like finlays of duke terrace the door was opened by a beaming woman young dressed exquisitely and greeting him as though wondering why he didnt come more often good evening she said will you come in he would he did the entrance hall was subtle cream paint deep pile carpeting a scattering of chairs which might have been designed by charles rennie mackintosh high backs and looking extraordinarily uncomfortable to sit in i see youre admiring our chairs the woman said yes rebus answered returning her smile the names rebus by the way john rebus ah yes finlay told me you were expected well as this is your first visit would you like me to show you around thank you but first a drink and the first drink is always on the house rebus tried not to be nosey but he was a policeman after all and not being nosey would have gone against all that he held most dear so he asked a few questions of his hostess whose name was paulette and pointed to this and that part of the gaming club being shown the direction of the cellars finlay has their contents insured for quarter of a million kitchen our chef is worth his weight in beluga and guest bedrooms the judges are the worst there are one or two who always end up sleeping here too drunk to go home the lower ground floor housed the cellars and kitchen while the ground floor comprised a quiet bar area and the small restaurant with cloakrooms and an office on the first floor up the carpeted staircase and past the collection of eighteenthand nineteenthcentury scottish paintings by the likes of jacob more and david allan was the main gaming area roulette blackjack a few other tables for card games and one table given over to dice the players were businessmen their bets discreet nobody losing big or winning big they held their chips close to them paulette pointed out two closed rooms private rooms for private games of what poker mainly the serious players book them once a month or so the games can go on all night just like in the movies yes she laughed just like the movies the second floor consisted of the three guest bedrooms again locked and finlay andrews own private suite off limits of course paulette said of course rebus concurred as they started downstairs again so this was it finlays club tonight was quiet he had seen only two or three faces he recognised an advocate who did not acknowledge him though theyd clashed before in court a television presenter whose dark tan looked fake and farmer watson hello there john watson stuffed into suit and dress shirt looked like nothing more than a copper out of uniform he was in the bar when paulette and rebus went back in his hand closed around a glass of orange juice trying to look comfortable but instead looking distinctly out of place sir rebus had not for one moment imagined that watson despite the threat he had made earlier would turn up here he introduced paulette who apologised for not being around to greet him at the door watson waved aside her apology revolving his glass i was well enough taken care of he said they sat at a vacant table the chairs here were comfortable and well padded and rebus felt himself relax watson however was looking around keenly finlay not here he asked hes somewhere around said paulette finlays always around funny thought rebus that they hadnt bumped into him on their tour whats the place like then john watson asked impressive rebus answered accepting paulettes smile like praise from a teacher to a doting pupil very impressive its much bigger than youd think wait till you see upstairs and theres the extension too said watson oh yes id forgotten rebus turned to paulette thats right she said were building out from the back of the premises building said watson i thought it was a fait accompli oh no she smiled again finlay is very particular the flooring wasnt quite right so he had the workmen rip it all up and start again now were waiting on some marble arriving from italy that must be costing a few bob watson said nodding to himself rebus wondered about the extension towards the back of the ground floor past toilets cloakroom offices walkin cupboards there must be another door ostensibly the door to the back garden but now the door to the extension perhaps another drink john watson was already on his feet pointing at rebuss empty glass gin and fresh orange please he said handing over the glass and for you paulette no really she was rising from the chair work to do now that youve seen a bit of the club id better get back to door duties if you want to play upstairs the office can supply chips a few of the games accept cash but not the most interesting ones another smile and she was gone in a flurry of silk and a glimpse of black nylon watson saw rebus watching her leave at ease inspector he said laughing to himself as he headed for the bar where the barman explained that if he wanted drinks he only had to signal and an order would be taken at the gentlemens table and brought to them directly watson slumped back into his chair again this is the life eh john yes sir whats happening back at base you mean the little sodomite who made the complaint hes buggered off disappeared gave us a false address the works so im off the butchers hook just about rebus was about to remonstrate give it a few more days john thats all im asking time for it to die a natural death you mean people are talking a few of the lads have had a laugh about it i dont suppose you can blame them in a day or so therell be something else for them to joke about and itll all be forgotten theres nothing to forget i know i know its all some plot to keep you out of action and this mysterious mr hydes behind it all rebus stared at watson his lips clamped shut he could yell could scream and shout he breathed hard instead and snatched at the drink when the waiter placed the tray on the table hed taken two gulps before the waiter informed him that he was drinking the other gentlemans orange juice his own gin and orange was the one still on the tray rebus reddened as watson laughing again placed a fivepound note on the tray the waiter coughed in embarrassment your drinks come to six pounds fifty sir he told watson ye gods watson searched in his pocket for some change found a crumpled pound note and some coins and placed them on the tray thank you sir the waiter lifted the tray and turned away before watson had the chance to ask about any change that might be owing he looked at rebus who was smiling now well watson said i mean six pounds fifty that would feed some families for a week this is the life rebus said throwing the superintendents words back at him yes well said john i was in danger of forgetting there can be more to life than personal comfort tell me which church do you attend well well come to take us all in have you both men turned at this new voice it was tommy mccall rebus checked his watch eight thirty tommy looked as though hed been to a few pubs en route to the club he sat down heavily in what had been paulettes chair whatre you drinking he snapped his fingers and the waiter a frown on his face came slowly towards the table sirs tommy mccall looked up at him hello simon same again for the constabulary and ill have the usual rebus watched the waiter as mccalls words sank in thats right son rebus thought to himself were the police now why should that fact frighten you so much the waiter turned seeming to read rebuss mind and headed stiffly back to the bar so what brings you two here mccall was lighting a cigarette glad to have found some company and ready to make a night of it it was johns idea watson said he wanted to come so i fixed it with finlay then reckoned i might as well come along too quite right mccall looked around him nobody much in tonight though not yet leastways the place is usually packed to the gunnels with faces youd recognise names youd know like you know your own this is tame tonight he had offered round his pack of cigarettes and rebus had taken one which he now lit inhaling gratefully regretting it immediately as the smoke mixed with the alcohol fumes in his chest he needed to think fast and hard watson and now mccall he had planned on dealing with neither by the way john tommy mccall said thanks for the lift last night his tone made the subtext clear to rebus sorry if it was any trouble no trouble tommy did you sleep well i never have trouble sleeping me neither interrupted farmer watson the benefits of a clear conscience eh tommy turned to watson shame you couldnt get to malcolm lanyons party we had a pretty good time didnt we john tommy smiled across at rebus who smiled back a group at the next table were laughing at some joke the men drawing on thick cigars the women playing with their wrist jewellery mccall leaned across towards them hoping perhaps to share in the joke but his shining eyes and uneven smile kept him apart from them had many tonight tommy rebus asked mccall hearing his name turned back to rebus and watson one or two he said a couple of my trucks didnt deliver on time drivers on the piss or something lost me two big contracts drowning my sorrows im sorry to hear that watson said with sincerity rebus nodded agreement but mccall shook his head theatrically its nothing he said im thinking of selling the business anyway retiring while im still young barbados spain who knows buy a little villa his eyes narrowed his voice dropping to a whisper and guess whos interested in buying me out youll never guess in a million years finlay finlay andrews the same mccall sat back drew on his cigarette blinking into the smoke finlay andrews he leaned forward again confidentially hes got a finger in quite a few pies you know its not just this place hes got this and that directorship shares here there and everywhere you name it your drinks the waiters voice had more than a note of disapproval in it he seemed to want to linger even after mccall had pitched a tenpound note onto the tray and waved him away aye mccall continued after the waiter had retreated fingers in plenty of pies all strictly above board mind youd have a hellish job proving otherwise and he wants to buy you out rebus asked mccall shrugged hes made a good price not a great price but i wont starve your change sir it was the waiter again his voice cold as a chisel he held the salver out towards mccall who stared up at him i didnt want any change he explained it was a tip still he winked at rebus and watson scooping the coins from the tray if you dont want it son i suppose i might as well have it back thank you sir rebus loved this the waiter was giving mccall every kind of danger signal there was but mccall was too drunk or too naive to notice at the same time rebus was aware of complications which might be about to result from the presence of superintendent watson and tommy mccall at finlays on the night finlays erupted there was a sudden commotion from the entrance hall raised voices boisterous rather than angry and paulettes voice too pleading then remonstrative rebus glanced at his watch again eight fifty right on time whats going on everybody in the bar was interested and a few had risen from their seats to investigate the barman pushed a button on the wall beside the optics then made for the hall rebus followed just inside the front door paulette was arguing with several men dressed in business suits but far the worse for wear one was telling her that she couldnt refuse him because he was wearing a tie another explained that they were in town for the evening and had heard about the club from someone in a bar philip his name was he told us to say philip had said it was okay and we could come in im sorry gentlemen but this is a private club the barman was joining in now but his presence was unwanted talking to the lady here pal okay all we want is a drink and maybe a wee flutter isnt that right rebus watched as two more waiters hard young men with angular faces came quickly down the stairs from the first floor now look just a wee flutter in town for the night im sorry watch the jacket pal hey neil mcgrath struck the first blow catching one of the heavies with a solid right to the gut doubling the man over people were gathering in the hallway now leaving the bar and the restaurant untended rebus still watching the fight began to move backwards through the crowd past the door to the bar past the restaurant towards the cloakroom the toilets the office door and the door behind that tony is that you it had to happen tommy mccall had noticed his brother tony as one of the apparent outoftown drunks tony his attention diverted received a blow to the face which sent him flying back against the wall thats my brother youre punching tommy was in there now too mixing it with the best of them constables neil mcgrath and harry todd were fit and healthy young men and they were holding their own but when they saw superintendent watson they automatically froze even though he could have no idea who they were each was caught with a sickening blow which woke them to the fact that this was for real they forgot about watson and struck out for all they were worth rebus noticed that one of the fighters was hanging back just a little not really throwing himself into it he stayed near the door too ready to flee when necessary and he kept glancing towards the back of the hallway where rebus stood rebus waved an acknowledgment detective constable brian holmes did not wave back then rebus turned and faced the door at the end of the hallway the door to the clubs extension he closed his eyes screwed up his courage made a fist of his right hand and brought it flying up into his own face not full strength some selfprotection circuit wouldnt let him do that but hard he wondered how people managed to slit their wrists then opened his watering eyes and checked his nose there was blood smeared over his top lip dripping from both nostrils he let it drip and hammered on the door nothing he hammered again the noise of the fight was at its height now come on come on he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and held it below his nostrils catching droplets of brightest crimson the door was unlocked from within it opened a couple of inches and eyes peered out at rebus yeah rebus pulled back a little so the man could see the commotion at the front door the eyes opened wide with surprise and the man glanced back at rebuss bloody face before opening the door wider the man was hefty not old but with hair unnaturally thin for his age as if to compensate for this he had a copious moustache rebus remembered tracys description of the man who had followed her the night shed come to his flat this man would fit that description we need you out here rebus said come on the man paused thinking it over rebus thought he was about to close the door again and was getting ready to kick out with all his might but the man pulled open the door and stepped out passing rebus rebus slapped the mans muscular back as he went the door was open rebus stepped through sought the key and locked it behind him there were bolts top and bottom he slid the top one across let nobody in he was thinking and nobody out then and only then did he look around him he was at the top of a narrow flight of stairs concrete uncarpeted maybe paulette had been right maybe the extension wasnt finished after all it didnt look like it was meant to be part of finlays club though this staircase it was too narrow almost furtive slowly rebus moved downwards the heels of his hired shoes making alltooaudible sounds against the steps rebus counted twenty steps and figured that he was now below the level of the buildings lower ground floor somewhere around cellar level or a bit below that even maybe planning restrictions had got finlay andrews after all unable to build up he had built down the door at the bottom of the stairs looked fairly solid again a utilitarianlooking construction rather than decorative it would take a good twentypound hammer to break through this door rebus tried the handle instead it turned and the door opened utter darkness rebus shuffled through the door using what light there was from the top of the stairs to make out what he could which was to say nothing it looked like he was in some kind of storage area some big empty space then the lights came on four rows of strip lights on the ceiling high above him their wattage low they still gave enough illumination to the scene a small boxing ring stood in the centre of the floor surrounded by a few dozen stiffbacked chairs this was the place then the disc jockey had been right calum mccallum had needed all the friends he could get he had told rebus all about the rumours hed heard rumours of a little club within a club where the citys increasingly jaded begetters of wealth could place some interesting bets a bit out of the ordinary mccallum had said yes like betting on two rent boys junkies paid handsomely to knock the daylights out of one another and keep quiet about it afterwards paid with money and drugs there was no shortage of either now that the high rollers had spun north hydes club named after robert louis stevensons villain edward hyde the dark side of the human soul hyde himself was based on the citys deacon brodie businessman by day robber by night rebus could smell guilt and fear and rank expectation in this large room stale cigars and spilt whisky splashes of sweat and amongst it all moved ronnie and the question which still needed to be answered had ronnie been paid to photograph the influential and the rich without their knowing they were being snapped of course or had he been freelancing summoned here only as a punchbag but stealthy enough to bring a hidden camera with him the answer was perhaps unimportant what mattered was that the owner of this place the puppetmaster of all these base desires had killed ronnie had starved him of his fix and then given him some rat poison had sent one of his minions along to the squat to make sure it looked like a simple case of an overdose so they had left the quality powder beside ronnie and to muddy the water they had moved the body downstairs leaving it in candlelight thinking the tableau shockingly effective but by candlelight they hadnt seen the pentagram on the wall and they hadnt meant anything by placing the body the way they had rebus had made the mistake of reading too much into the situation all along he had blurred the picture himself seeing connections where there were none seeing plot and conspiracy where none existed the real plot was so much bigger the size of a haystack to his needle finlay andrews the shout echoed around the room hanging emptily in air rebus hauled himself up into the boxing ring and looked around at the chairs he could almost see the gleaming gloating faces of the spectators the canvas floor of the ring was pockmarked with brown stains dried blood it didnt end here of course there were also the guest bedrooms the locked doors behind which private games were played yes he could visualise the whole sodom held on the third friday of the month judging by james carews diary boys brought back from calton hill to service the clients on a table in bed wherever and ronnie had perhaps photographed it all but andrews had found out that ronnie had some insurance some photos stashed away he couldnt know of course that they were next to useless as weapons of blackmail or evidence all he knew was that they existed so ronnie had died rebus climbed out of the ring and walked past one row of chairs at the back of the hall lurking in shadow were two doors he listened outside one then outside the other no sounds yet he was sure he was about to open the door on the left but something some instinct made him choose the righthand door instead he paused turned the handle pushed there was a light switch just inside the door rebus found it and two delicate lamps either side of the bed came on the bed was against the side wall there wasnt much else in the room apart from two large mirrors one against the wall opposite the bed and one above the bed the door clicked shut behind rebus as he walked over to the bed sometimes he had been accused by his superiors of having a vivid imagination right now he shut his imagination out altogether stick to the facts john the fact of the bed the fact of the mirrors the door clicked again he leapt forwards and yanked at the handle but it was fast the door locked tight shit he stood back and kicked out hitting the belly of the door with the heel of his shoe the door trembled but held his shoe did not the heel flapping off great bang went his deposit on the dress hire hold on though think it through someone had locked the door therefore someone was down here with him and the only other place they could have been hiding was the other room the room next to this he turned again and studied the mirror opposite the bed andrews he yelled to the mirror andrews the voice was muffled by the wall sounding distant but still lucid hello inspector rebus nice to see you rebus almost smiled but managed to hide it i wish i could say the same he stared into the mirror visualising andrews standing directly behind it watching him a nice idea he said making conversation needing time to gather his strength and his thoughts people screwing in one room while everyone else is free to watch through a twoway mirror free to watch the voice seemed closer no not free inspector everything costs i suppose you set the camera up in there too did you photographed and framed framed being quite apt under the circumstances dont you think blackmail it was an observation nothing more favours merely often given without question but a photograph can be a useful tool when favours are being withheld thats why james carew committed suicide oh no that was your doing really inspector james told me youd recognised him he thought you might be able to follow your nose from him back to hydes you killed him we killed him john which is a pity i liked james he was a good friend well you have lots of friends dont you there was laughter now but the voice was level elegiac almost yes i suppose theyd have a job finding a judge to try me an advocate to prosecute me fifteen good men and true to stand as jury theyve all been to hydes all of them looking for a game with just a little more edge than those played upstairs i got the idea from a friend in london he runs a similar establishment though perhaps with a less sharp edge than hydes theres a lot of new money in edinburgh john money for all would you like money would you like a sharper edge to your life dont tell me youre happy in your little flat with your music and your books and your bottles of wine rebuss face showed surprise yes i know quite a bit about you john information is my edge andrews voice fell theres a membership available here if you want it john i think maybe you do want it after all membership has its privileges rebus leaned his head against the mirror his voice was a near whisper your fees are too high whats that andrews voice seemed closer than ever his breathing almost audible rebuss voice was still a whisper i said your fees are too high suddenly he pulled back an arm made a fist and pushed straight through the mirror shattering it another trick from his sas training dont punch at something always punch through even if its a brick wall youre attacking glass splintered around him digging into the sleeve of his jacket seeking flesh his fist uncurled became a claw just through the mirror he found andrews throat clamped it and hauled the man forward andrews was shrieking glass was in his face flakes of it in his hair his mouth prickling his eyes rebus held him close teeth gritted i said he hissed your fees are too high then he brought his other hand into a fresh new fist and placed a blow on andrews chin releasing him so that the unconscious figure fell back into the room rebus pulled off the useless shoe and tapped away the shards of glass which still clung around the edges of the frame then carefully he hauled himself through into the room went to the door and opened it he saw tracy immediately she was standing hesitantly in the middle of the boxing ring arms hanging by her sides tracy he said she may not hear you inspector rebus heroin can do that you know rebus watched as malcolm lanyon stepped out from the shadows behind him were two men one was tall well built for a man of his mature years he had thick black eyebrows and a thick moustache tinged with silver his eyes were deepset his whole face louring he was the most calvinistlooking thing rebus had ever seen the other man was stouter less justified in his sinning his hair was curly but thinning his face scarred like a knuckle a labourers face he was leering rebus stared at tracy again her eyes were like pinpoints he went to the ring and climbed in hugging her to him her body was totally compliant her hair damp with sweat she might have been a lifesized rag doll for all the impetus in her limbs but when rebus held her face so that she had to look back at him her eyes glimmered and he felt her body twitch my edge lanyon was saying it seems i needed it he glanced towards the room where andrews was lying unconscious finlay said he could handle you himself having seen you last night i doubted that he beckoned to one of the men see if finlays going to be all right the man headed off rebus liked the way the odds were going would you care to step into my office and talk he said lanyon considered this saw that rebus was a strong man but that he had his hands full with the girl also of course lanyon had his men while rebus was alone he walked to the ring grabbed onto a rope and hauled himself up and in now face to face with rebus he saw the cuts on rebuss arm and hand nasty he said if you dont get those seen to i might bleed to death exactly rebus looked down at the canvas where his own blood was making fresh stains beside those of nameless others how many of them died in the ring he asked i really dont know not many were not animals inspector rebus there may have been the occasional accident i seldom came to hydes i merely introduced new members into it so when do they make you a judge lanyon smiled not for a considerable time yet but it will happen i once attended a club similar to hydes in london actually thats where i met saiko rebuss eyes widened oh yes lanyon said shes a very versatile young woman i suppose hydes has given you and andrews carte blanche throughout edinburgh it has helped with the odd planning application the odd court case just happening to go the right way that sort of thing so what happens now that i know all about it ah well you neednt worry there finlay and i see a longterm future for you in the development of edinburgh as a great city of commerce and industry the guard below chuckled what do you mean asked rebus he could feel tracys body tensing growing strong again how long it would last he couldnt know i mean lanyon was saying that you could be preserved in concrete supporting one of the new orbital roads youve done that before have you the question was rhetorical the goons chuckle had already answered it once or twice yes when there was something that needed clearing away rebus saw that tracys hands were slowly closing into fists then the goon who had gone to see andrews came back mr lanyon he called i think mr andrews is pretty bad just then as lanyon turned from them tracy flew from rebus with a terrifying shriek and swung her fists in a low arc catching lanyon with a sickening thump between his legs he didnt so much fall as deflate gagging as he went while tracy stumbled the effort having been too great and fell to the canvas rebus was quick too he grabbed lanyon and pulled him upright locking his arm behind his back with one hand while the other hand went to his throat the two heavies made a move towards the ring but rebus dug his fingers into lanyons flesh just a little deeper and they hesitated there was a moments stalemate before one of them made a dash for the stairs closely followed by his partner rebus was breathing heavily he released his grip on lanyon and watched him crumple to the floor then standing in the centre of the ring he counted softly to ten referee style before raising one arm high into the air upstairs things had quietened down the staff were tidying themselves up but held their heads high having acquitted themselves well the drunks holmes mccall mcgrath and todd had been seen off and paulette was smoothing the rumpled atmosphere with offers of free drinks all round she saw rebus coming through the door of hydes and froze momentarily then turned back into the perfect hostess but with her voice slightly less warm than before and her smile counterfeit ah john it was superintendent watson glass still in hand wasnt that a tussle where did you disappear to is tommy mccall around sir somewhere around yes heard the offer of a free drink and headed in the direction of the bar what have you done to your hand rebus looked down and saw that his hand was still bleeding in several places seven years bad luck he said do you have a minute sir theres something id like to show you but first i need to phone for an ambulance but why for gods sake the rumpus is over surely rebus looked at his superior i wouldnt bet on that sir he said not even if the chips were on the house rebus made his way home wearily not from any real physical tiredness but because his mind felt abused the stairwell almost defeated him he paused on the first floor outside mrs cochranes door for what seemed minutes he tried not to think about hydes about what it meant what it had been what emotions it had serviced but not consciously thinking of it bits of it flew around inside his head anyway little jagged pieces of horror mrs cochranes cats wanted out he could hear them on the other side of the door a catflap would have been the answer but mrs cochrane didnt believe in them like leaving your door open to strangers she had said any old moggie could just waltz in how true somehow rebus found that little unwrapped parcel of strength which was necessary to climb the extra flight he unlocked his door and closed it again behind him sanctuary in the kitchen he munched on a dry roll while he waited for the kettle to boil watson had listened to his story with mounting unease and disbelief he had wondered aloud just how many important people were implicated but then only andrews and lanyon could answer that theyd found some video film as well as an impressive selection of still photographs watsons lips had been bloodless though many of the faces meant nothing to rebus still a few of them did andrews had been right about the judges and the lawyers thankfully there were no policemen on display except one rebus had wanted to clear up a murder and instead had stumbled into a nest of vipers he wasnt sure any of it would come to light too many reputations would fall the publics faith in the beliefs and institutions of the city of the country itself would be shattered how long would it take to pick up the pieces of that broken mirror rebus examined his bandaged wrist how long for the wounds to heal he went into the living room carrying his tea tony mccall was seated in a chair waiting hello tony rebus said hello john thanks for your help back there what are friends for earlier in the day when rebus had asked for tony mccalls help mccall had broken down i know all about it john he had confessed tommy took me along there once it was hideous and i didnt stick around but maybe there are pictures of me i dont know maybe there are rebus hadnt needed to ask any more it had come spilling out like beer from a tap things bad at home bit of fun couldnt tell anyone about it because he didnt know who already knew even now he thought it best to keep quiet about it rebus had accepted the warning im still going ahead he had said with you or without your choice tony mccall had agreed to help rebus sat down placed the tea on the floor and reached into his pocket for the photograph he had lifted from the files at hydes he threw it in mccalls direction mccall lifted it stared at it with fearful eyes you know rebus said andrews was after tommys haulage company hed have had it too and at a bargainbasement price rotten bastard mccall said tearing the photograph methodically into smaller and smaller pieces why did you do it tony i told you john tommy took me along just a bit of fun no i mean why did you break into the squat and plant that powder on ronnie me mccalls eyes were wider than ever now but the look in them was still fear rather than surprise it was all guesswork but rebus knew he was guessing right come on tony do you think finlay andrews is going to let any names stay secret hes going down and hes got no reason to let anyones head stay above water mccall thought about this he let the bits of the photograph flutter into the ashtray then set light to them with a match they dissolved to blackened ash and he seemed satisfied andrews needed a favour it was always favours with him i think hed seen the godfather too many times pilmuir was my beat my territory wed met through tommy so he thought to ask me and you were happy to oblige well he had the picture didnt he there mustve been more well mccall paused again crushed the ash in the ashtray with his forefinger a fine dust was all that was left yes hell i was happy enough to do it the guy was a junkie after all a piece of rubbish and he was already dead all i had to do was place a little packet beside him thats all you never questioned why ask no questions and all that he smiled finlay was offering me membership you see membership of hydes well i knew what that meant id be on nodding terms with the big boys wouldnt i i even started to dream about career advancement something i hadnt done in quite some time lets face it john were tiny fish in a small pool and hyde was offering you the chance to play with the sharks mccall smiled sadly i suppose that was it yes rebus sighed tony tony tony where would it have ended eh probably with you having to call me sir mccall answered his voice firming up instead of which i suppose the trial will see me on the front of the scum sheets not quite the kind of fame i was looking for he rose from the chair see you in court he said leaving john rebus to his flavourless tea and his thoughts rebus slept fitfully and was awake early he showered but without any of his usual vocal accompaniment he telephoned the hospital and ascertained that tracy was fine and that finlay andrews had been patched up with the loss of very little blood then he drove to great london road where malcolm lanyon was being held for questioning rebus was still officially a nonperson and ds dick and dc cooper had been assigned to the interrogation but rebus wanted to be close by he knew the answers to all their questions knew the sorts of trick lanyon was capable of pulling he didnt want the bastard getting away with it because of some technicality he went to the canteen first bought a bacon roll and seeing dick and cooper seated at a table went to join them hello john dick said staring into the bottom of a stained coffee mug you lot are early birds rebus noted you must be keen farmer watson wants it out of the way as soon as poss sooner even ill bet he does look im going to be around today if you need me to back up anything we appreciate that john said dick in a voice which told rebus his offer was as welcome as a dunces cap well rebus began but bit off the sentence and ate his breakfast instead dick and cooper seemed dulled by the enforced early rise certainly they were not the most vivacious of table companions rebus finished quickly and rose to his feet mind if i take a quick look at him not at all said dick well be there in five minutes passing through the groundfloor reception area rebus almost bumped into brian holmes everyones after the worm today rebus said holmes gave him a puzzled sleepy look never mind im off to take a peek at lanyonaliashyde fancy a bit of voyeurism holmes didnt answer but fell in stride with rebus actually rebus said lanyon might appreciate that image holmes gave him a more puzzled look yet rebus sighed never mind sorry sir bit of a late night yesterday oh yes thanks for that by the way i nearly died when i saw the bloody farmer staring at the lot of us him in his undertakers suit and us pretending to be pissed dundonians they shared a smile okay the plan had been lame conceived by rebus during the course of his fiftyminute drive back from calum mccallums cell in fife but it had worked theyd got a result yes rebus said i thought you looked a bit nervy last night what do you mean well you were doing your italian army impression werent you advancing backwards and all that holmes stopped dead his jaw dropping is that the thanks i get we put our careers on the line for you last night all four of us youve used me as your gofer go find this go check that as a bit of bloody shoeleather half the time for jobs that werent even official youve had my girlfriend half killed now wait just one second and all to satisfy your own curiosity okay so there are bad guys behind bars thats good but look at the scales youve got them the rest of us have got sod all except a few bruises and no bloody soles on our shoes rebus stared at the floor almost contrite the air flew from his nostrils as from a spanish bulls i forgot he said at last i meant to take that bloody suit back this morning the shoes are ruined it was you talking about shoeleather that reminded me then he set off again along the corridor towards the cells leaving holmes speechless in his wake outside the cell lanyons name had been printed in chalk on a board rebus went up to the steel door and pulled aside the shutter thinking how it reminded him of the shutter on the door of some prohibition club give the secret knock and the shutter opened he peered into the cell started and groped for the alarm bell situated beside the door holmes hearing the siren forgot to be angry and hurt and hurried forward rebus was pulling at the edge of the locked door with his fingernails weve got to get in its locked sir holmes was afraid his superior looked absolutely manic here they come a uniformed sergeant came at an undignified trot keys jangling from his chain quick the lock gave and rebus yanked open the door inside malcolm lanyon lay slumped on the floor head resting against the bed his feet were splayed like a dolls one hand lay on the floor some thin nylon wire like a fishingline wrapped around the knuckles which were blackened the line was attached to lanyons neck in a loop which had embedded itself so far into the flesh that it could hardly be seen lanyons eyes bulged horribly his swollen tongue obscene against the blooddarkened face it was like a last macabre gesture and rebus watched the tongue protruding towards him seeming to take it as a personal insult he knew it was way too late but the sergeant loosened the wire anyway and laid the corpse flat on the floor holmes was resting his head against the cold metal door screwing shut his eyes against the parody inside the cell he mustve had it hidden on him the sergeant said seeking excuses for the monumental blunder referring to the wire which he now held in his hands jesus what a way to go rebus was thinking hes cheated me hes cheated me i wouldnt have had the guts to do that not slowly choke myself i could never do it something inside would have stopped me whos been in here since he was brought in the sergeant stared at rebus uncomprehending the usual lot i suppose he had a few questions to answer last night when you brought him in yes but after that well he had a meal when you lot went thats about it sonofabitch growled rebus stalking out of the cell and back along the corridor holmes his face white and slick was a few steps behind and gaining theyre going to bury it brian rebus said his voice an angry vibrato theyre going to bury it i know they are and therell be no cross marking the spot nothing a junkie died of his own volition an estate agent committed suicide now a lawyer tops himself in a police cell no connection no crime committed but what about andrews where do you think were headed they arrived at the hospital ward in time to witness the efficiency of the staff in a case of emergency rebus hurried forward pushing his way through finlay andrews lying on his bed chest exposed was being given oxygen while the cardiac apparatus was installed a doctor held the pads in front of them then pushed them slowly against andrews chest a moment later a jolt went through the body there was no reading from the machine more oxygen more electricity rebus turned away hed seen the script he knew how the film would end well said holmes heart attack rebuss voice was bland he began to walk away lets call it that anyway because thats what the record will say so what next holmes kept pace with him he too was feeling cheated rebus considered the question probably the photos will disappear the ones that matter at any rate and whos left to testify testify to what theyve thought of everything except one thing brian i know who they are holmes stopped will that matter he called to his superiors retreating figure but rebus just kept walking there was a scandal but it was a small one soon forgotten shuttered rooms in elegant georgian terraces soon became light again in a great resurrection of spirit the deaths of finlay andrews and malcolm lanyon were reported and journalists sought what muck and brass they could yes finlay andrews had been running a club which was not strictly legitimate in all of its dealings and yes malcolm lanyon had committed suicide when the authorities had begun to close in on this little empire no there were no details of what these activities might have been the suicide of local estate agent james carew was in no way connected to mr lanyons suicide though it was true the two men were friends as for mr lanyons connection with finlay andrews and his club well perhaps we would never know it was no more than a sad coincidence that mr lanyon had been appointed mr carews executor still there were other lawyers werent there and so it ended the story petering out the rumours dying a little less slowly rebus was pleased when tracy announced that nell stapleton had found her a job in a cafedeli near the university library one evening however having spent some time in the rutherford bar rebus decided to opt for a takeaway indian meal before home in the restaurant he saw tracy holmes and nell stapleton at a corner table sharing a joke with their meal he turned and left without ordering back in his flat he sat at the kitchen table for the umpteenth time writing a rough draft of his letter of resignation somehow the words failed to put across any of his emotions adequately he crumpled the paper and tossed it towards the bin he had been reminded in the restaurant of just how much hydes had cost in human terms and of how little justice there had been there was a knock at the door he had hope in his heart as he opened it gill templer stood there smiling in the night he crept through to the living room and switched on the desk lamp it threw light guiltily like a constables torch onto the small filing cabinet beside the stereo the key was hidden under a comer of the carpet as secure a hiding place as a grannys mattress he opened the cabinet and lifted out a slim file which he carried to his chair the chair which had for so many months been his bed there he sat composed remembering the day at james carews flat back then he had been tempted to lift carews private diary and keep it for himself but he had resisted temptation not the night at hydes though there alone in andrews office for a moment he had filched the photograph of tony mccall tony mccall a friend and colleague with whom these days he had nothing in common except perhaps a sense of guilt he opened the file and took out the photographs he had taken them along with the one of mccall four photographs lifted at random he studied the faces again as he did most nights when he found sleep hard to come by faces he recognised faces attached to names and names to handshakes and voices important people influential people hed thought about this a lot indeed he had thought about little else since that night in hydes club he brought out a metal wastepaper bin from beneath the desk dropped the photographs into it and lit a match holding it over the bin as he had done so many times before the end
