lucky to have you in our lives to all those who choose to remain in the shadows thank you to all those whom i may have forgotten my sincere apologies to my amazing wife lysa after ten years you still take my breath away chapter new york city it was nearing ten oclock in the evening when mitch rapp decided it was time to move he stepped from the sedan into the april night popped his umbrella clutched the collar of his black trench coat and set out across a rainsoaked east twentieth street he navigated the puddles and swollen gutter without complaint the weather was a blessing not only did it clear the streets of potential witnesses it also gave him a reasonable excuse to hide his face from the citys everincreasing array of security cameras rapp had traveled to new york city to decide the fate of a man at an earlier point he had debated the wisdom of handling the situation himself in addition to the inherent risk of getting caught there was another more pressing problem just six days earlier a series of explosions had torn through washington dc killing and wounding hundreds three of the terrorists were still at large and rapp had been ordered unofficially to find them by any means necessary so far however the investigation had been painfully complicated and had yet to yield a single solid lead the three men had up and disappeared which suggested a level of sophistication that few of them had thought the enemy capable of the last thing rapp expected though was that he would still be dealing with this other issue in light of the attacks in washington he thought the fool would have come to his senses beyond the significance of deciding if the man should live or die there was the aftermath to consider killing him had the very real potential to cause more problems than it would solve if the guy failed to show up for work there would be a lot of questions and the majority of them would be directed at rapp and his boss irene kennedy the director of the central intelligence agency one tiny misstep and the shit storm of all shit storms would be brought down on them the head of the surveillance team had tried to talk him out of it but rapp wasnt the kind of man who was going to start pulling the trigger from a climatecontrolled office a couple hundred miles away he needed to see with his own eyes if they were missing somethingif there wasnt some unseen or unpredictable factor that had caused the bureaucrat to jump the tracks rapp was keenly aware of the universal disdain for the man he had followed to new york there were plenty of people on the clandestine side of the business who had cause to wish the prick dead and that was another reason rapp needed to be absolutely certain he was guilty of what they suspected his dislike for the man would make it all that much easier to pull the trigger and rapp knew he had to fight that urge he needed to give this idiot every last chance to save himself before they did something that could never be undone it would be a mistake to read too deeply into rapps cautious attitude though if he found the proof he was looking for there would be no handwringing or queasiness hed killed too many people to begin acting like an amateur and although the man was a fellow american he was also very likely a traitor and not some lowlevel paperpushing traitor this guy had one of the highest security clearances in the federal government and his hypocrisy had likely gotten one of rapps agents killed rapp moved down the sidewalk toward park avenue at a casual pace he was dressed in a fashion similar to that of the thousandplus executive car drivers who were shuffling their clients around the city on this rainsoaked eveningblack shoes black suit white shirt black tie and a black trench coat to anyone who happened to notice him he would look like just another driver out stretching his legs trying to kill a little time before his client finished his meal and was ready to head someplace else or call it a night as rapp took up a position across the street and one door down from the gramercy tavern he reached into his pocket and fished out a pack of marlboros standing in the rain in new york city doing nothing might get you noticed but throw in a cigarette and you looked like all the other addicts battling the elements to get their fix rapp turned away from the street and faced the blank fa√ßade of the building behind him he tilted the umbrella so it looked as if he was trying to block the wind and flicked his lighter he was not worried about the wind but he was worried about one of the other drivers catching a glimpse of his face in the glow of the flame after a deep pull off the cigarette rapp casually looked out from under the rainsoaked umbrella and across the street the target was sitting in one of the restaurants big windows sharing a meal a lot of booze and too much conversation with a man rapp had never met and hoped to keep that way the other man was a concern to be sure but rapp was not in the habit of killing private citizens simply because they were witnesses to the ramblings of a bitter man who was past his prime despite every effort to find a different solution rapps mood was decidedly fatalistic the surveillance team had the restaurant wired for sound and for the last two hours he had been sitting in a parked lincoln town car listening to his coworker trashtalk the agency as rapp watched him take a drink of wine he wasnt sure what bothered him more the mans selfserving criticism or his reckless behavior one would think that anyone who worked at the cia would be a little more careful about when and where he decided to commit treason so far his associate had done little more than espouse his political and philosophical views bad form to be sure but nothing that had risen to the level of outright sedition rapp however could sense that it was coming the man had been drinking heavily hed downed two gin martinis and four glasses of red wine and that wasnt counting the bump or two hed probably had on the flight up from dc and possibly at the hotel bar rapp had ordered his surveillance people to steer clear of the airports there were too many cameras and trained law enforcement types who would eventually be interviewed by the fbi if the night went the way it was looking every moment of this guys life would be rewound and scrutinized and theyd start with that us airways commuter flight hed taken out of reagan national up to laguardia earlier in the day rapp casually took another drag from the cigarette and watched as the waiter placed two snifters of cognac in front of the men a few minutes earlier rapp had listened as the other man tried to pass on the afterdinner drink rapp got the feeling the man was starting to think the dinner meeting had been a waste of his time rapps coworker however insisted that they both have a drink he told the other man he was going to need it after he heard what he was about to tell him now with the rain softly pelting his umbrella rapp watched the waiter place two snifters on the table the waiter was still within earshot when the man from langley leaned in and began to tell his story rapp heard every word via a wireless earpiece for the first few minutes it was all innuendo rapps coworker put his information on the table in a series of hypotheticals and while rapp had no doubt that the lawyers at the justice department would have found wiggle room in the statements rapp saw them as further proof of the mans reckless intent anyone who had been read in at this level of national security knew what could be discussed and what was strictly off limits rapp was in the midst of lighting his second cigarette when the conversation moved from the abstract to the concrete it started with the specific mention of an operation that was known to only a handful of people including the president this is it he thought to himself the idiot is really going to do it as casually as he could rapp brought his eyes back to the big window of the restaurant there the two men sat hunched over the table their faces no more than a foot apart one speaking in hushed tones the other looking more horrified with each word the classified designations came pouring out in a rapidfire staccato of dates and targets one secret after another was tossed onto the pile as if they were inconsequential nuggets of gossip the breadth of the damage was even worse than rapp had dared imagine so bad in fact that he began wondering if he shouldnt simply march across the street pull out his gun and execute the idiot on the spot as quickly as things had heated up though they came to an abrupt halt like some belligerent drunk whod consumed one ounce too much of alcohol the man from langley put away his wares and announced that hed divulged only a fraction of what he knew and that before he said anything further they needed to come to an agreement up until now rapp had thought his coworkers rigid principles had driven him to take this risky step but as he listened to the two men discuss the financial details of their new relationship that last shred of grudging respect vanished rapp looked through the rain at the traitor and realized that like the hundreds of miscreants who had gone before him his coworkers oftenflaunted idealism came with a price just as with all the other bastards rapp flicked his cigarette into the gutter and watched it bob and swirl its way into the sewer as he turned toward park avenue he felt not even the tiniest bit of remorse over what he had just set in motion without having to look he knew that a man bearing a striking resemblance to the traitor was now climbing into the back of a lincoln town car every detail had been arranged from the eyeglasses to the tie to the hair coloreven the black and orange umbrella from the hotel all that was left for rapp to do was walk a block and a half and wait for the idiot to come to him chapter new york city glen adams drained the last precious drop of remy martin from the bulbous snifter and immediately felt cheated that he wasnt going to get a second glass of the smooth warm cognac his dinner partner and former law school classmate while brilliant was also a bit of a bore and had insisted on the tab theyd graduated from nyus school of law twentysix years earlier and since then theyd run into each other about once or twice a year either at alumni events or at various professional functions every so often theyd grab lunch and catch up but there was no doubt they had drifted apart it was neither mans fault of course between careers and family there was little time left for old friendships the two men had chosen drastically different paths after law school urness scored a coveted job with the public defenders office in new york city after putting in three years of utter servitude he bolted for the private sector and quickly earned a reputation as a fearsome trial attorney by his midthirties hed already argued two cases before the us supreme court at thirtynine he started his own law firm and quickly grew it into one of most well known and successful in a city filled with highpriced law firms adams while not nearly as successful was proud of what hed accomplished following in the footsteps of his father he went to work for the cia his first two years while enlightening were worse than anything he could have imagined since childhood hed dreamed of becoming a spook unfortunately it didnt turn out to be anything even remotely close to what he thought it would be adams had grown up in the house of a father who had fought in world war ii and then gone on to work for the cia in its special activities division his dad was rarely around and that left a lot of time for a young impressionable boy to dream about unseen heroism and daring exploits even in his absence the man managed to cast his huge presence over the house and the aspirations of his only son in the real world adams found the directorate of operations at langley to be staffed by crude rude and dimwitted exmilitary types who were challenged to think of the world in any colors other than black and white having graduated from one of the worlds top law schools adams found it unbearable to work around so many simpletons after two years of service and despite strong protest from his father adams left the cia and went to work for the justice department it was a decision that ended up causing irreparable damage to their relationship it took the younger adams years to come to grips with the rift it had caused and in many ways this evening was a major step in putting the entire thing behind him despite the problems it had caused with his father adams always felt hed made the right decision in leaving the cia while at doj hed tackled a series of increasingly tough jobs and his career steadily advanced then hit and everything changed that first year or two after the attacks adams found himself caught up in the patriotic fervor just like everyone else eventually though he regained his senses and realized elements of his own government were every bit as big a threat as the terrorists a vocal minority on the hill had been screaming for increased oversight at the cia and before adams knew it his name had been thrown into the hopper his reputation as a tough federal prosecutor pleased the politicians and his family history with langley and brief employment there made him what many thought to be the perfect choice for inspector general of americas premier spy agency adams experienced a glimmer of hope that the new post would help mend the rift between him and his father his dad now in his eighties didnt have many years in front of him and adams knew there wouldnt be many opportunities like this he couldnt have been more misguided in his optimistic assessment the afternoon that he told his father of the prodigal sons return ended up being the last time they spoke unknown to adams was his fathers deepseated disdain for the office of the cias top watchdog what was supposed to be a moment of healing ended up being a catastrophe that destroyed any hope of repairing their relationship four short months later the elder adams passed away the surviving son took to his new job with ministerial zeal like a missionary converting the heathens to christianity adams would bring a passion for justice and the rule of law to the wild and uncouth and like the missionaries who had worked the backwaters of south america adams would use force if need beconversion by the sword he would use his considerable talents to usher in a new era at langley an era they could all be proud of at least that was what he had told himself at the time what hed told his wife and his law school classmates like urness his fellow alums had been a great source of strength they saw the cia for what it was a rotten outdated organization if he had known then what he knew now he wondered if he would have taken the job had he been too idealistic no hed told himself on many occasions they were just too corrupt the constitution and the rule of law were more important than a thousand careers a million careers adams gazed into his glass in hopes that there was a drop to be found in the little indentation at the bottom but there wasnt all is not wasted he mumbled to himself tonight was proof of that his plan was good better than goodit was perfect none of them would expect it besides they had their hands full at the moment trying to figure out how theyd fucked up and allowed nearly two hundred of their fellow citizens to get killed in broad daylight they were nothing more than a bunch of goons and these attacks were proof that their methods had served only to hearten the enemy this is a big step urness said as he slid his black american express card back in his wallet are you sure you want to go through with it come on kenny adams said to the other attorney ive never doubted your determination i just want to make sure urness said with a toothy grin theres going to be some very powerful people who are going to be really pissed off no doubt are you sure youre up to it the attorney took a moment and then said im ready for a new challenge a cause i can believe in ive made a shitload of money now id like to make a difference with a raised brow adams said like woodward and bernstein yeah except youll be deep throat lets hope i dont have to wait until im ninety to admit my role in all of this if im reading this right urness said and i usually do i dont think youll have to wait more than two years ill have it all gamed by then and youll be treated as a hero by some urness pushed his chair back and started to stand fuck em adams laughed and stood oblivious that his white dinner napkin had just slid from his lap to the floor im serious fuck em youre never going to get those fascists on the right to understand what were doing so im telling you right now fuck em and forget em youre right adams said with an impish grin as urness came around the table adams put his arm around him he was almost a head taller than his friend youre a good shit kenny i really appreciate this im more than happy to help glen these are strange times if we dont take a stand im afraid what kind of country will be left for our kids the two men moved from the restaurant into the bar and toward the front door adams looked at the booze behind the bar and like one of pavlovs dogs began to salivate he slowed his pace and rubbed his right hand over his belly what do you say we have one more bump before we call it a night urness abruptly stopped looked up at his friend with a seriousness that he usually saved for his clients and blurted out i think you drink too much adams looked away nervously and chuckled come on kenny he said with forced levity a guys in new york for the night whats wrong with wanting to get a little lit up nothing if youre some tire salesman from akron in town for a convention but you my friend are no salesman you have wandered out onto a very dangerous cliff one tiny misstep and splat urness clapped his hands together to emphasize the point i am well aware of what im doing im not so sure if were going to do this i want you to keep your drinking under control hey adams said in an easy tone im not going to tell you that i dont like to drink but im not driving im just trying to blow off a little steam yes you are and as your friend im telling you to tone it down this shit is serious if you fuck this up glen and dont handle it perfectly you could end up in jail or worse message received adams put up his hands feeling a bit embarrassed good because im going to keep an eye on you now lets get you in your car i need to get home and review a case before i go to bed chapter adams and urness found themselves huddled under the small awning outside the restaurant with their umbrellas in hand each man scanned the rainsplattered windows of the closest executive cars in search of a white placard with his name adams was lucky his car was only twenty feet away urness said a rushed goodbye and then hurried away darting between the puddles at each passing sedan he stopped to search for his name adams plotted his own course and bolted for the rear passenger door of his lincoln town car he opened the door closed the umbrella and ducked into the backseat the driver gave him a polite nod and a soft hello followed by a back to the hotel sir adams was half tempted to ask him if he knew of any good bars and then thought better of it urnesss admonition about his drinking had wounded his pride yes my hotel please adams was already looking out the window his mind trying to justify the joy he received from a good glass of booze or bottle of wine a guy like urness didnt understand he was too focused on his career to enjoy the other things life had to offer come to think of it the man didnt have a single hobby or passion other than the law besides adams thought to himself id like to see urness walk in my shoes for a month let alone six years adams felt like general custer at timessurrounded by savages trying to fight the good fight every day brought a new level of duplicity and treachery the entire clandestine service and most of the leadership at langley was staffed by professional liars and manipulators men and women who had not an ounce of respect for the constitution and the coequal branches of the republic there was nothing wrong with the occasional drink he decided he would just have to be a little more discreet about it adams looked out the window as they rolled through a busy intersection despite the concern over his drinking he was pleased with the pact hed made with urness considering how complicated it was he felt the night couldnt have gone better adams smiled at his bold step allowed himself to think how sweet victory would feel when the rotten house of langley came tumbling down on itself adams realized he hadnt felt this good in months it was as if a massive yoke had been lifted from his exhausted shoulders this was going to be funturning it around on them he loved the irony he was going to use one of their own ploys to take them down hed come to think of it as his own little covert operation he would have to continue in his role as inspector general and look with feigned zeal for the leaker hed have to be careful though to not seem too eager the operatives while not bright were at least instinctive if he changed his behavior too much they would sense it so he would have to do his job while letting it be known that he had warned all of them this day would come adams couldnt wait to see the looks on their faces when the news broke the car hit a pothole and began to slow he looked up and was about to ask the driver why he was pulling over when suddenly the driversside rear door opened a dark figure dripping with water glided into the vehicle and took a seat next him before adams had the chance to figure out who it was the door was closed and the car was moving again somewhere in a seemingly distant part of his brain he heard the automatic locks slam into place with an ominous thud his mind was suddenly racing to understand what was going on why was this strange man in his car adams was about to ask him just that when the man turned to face him the alcohol caused a slight delay in connecting the dots but adams knew instantly who he was looking at the jetblack hair with a touch of gray at the temples the olive skin and eyes so dark they looked like two pools of oilthey all belonged to none other than the cias chief thugmitch rapp but what in the hell was rapp doing in new york city let alone his car what adams stammered what in the hell are you doing how was your dinner rapp asked in a casual tone my dinner what in the hell are you doing get out of my car right now panic crept into his voice as his inhibited brain began to comprehend the gravity of the situation easy glen rapp spoke in a deep calm voice youre in no position to be handing out orders the hell im not adams reached inside his jacket rapp made no effort to stop him what do you think youre doing im calling the attorney general is what im doing rapp let out a protracted sigh followed by put your phone down hed figured this was how adams would react rapp took his gloved right hand brought it up by his left shoulder and unleashed a backhanded slap that caught adams square in the nose the blow was just enough to stun rapp did not want him bleedingat least not yet adams yelped like a dog and dropped the phone at the same time he instinctively brought both hands up to cover his face and began complaining loudly rapp grabbed the phone and started patting adams down sliding his hands around his waist to make sure there wasnt another phone or pager that he didnt know about take your hands off me adams demanded stop moving rapp ordered as he quickly searched the jacket pockets this time youve gone too far adams shouted there is no way youre going to be able to weasel your way out of this kidnapping assault rapp ignored the list of charges and told the driver its just the one phone the driver nodded and put out his hand rapp gave him the phone and a second later the driver pulled over rolled down his window six inches and handed the phone to a man standing on the street corner rapp turned his attention back to adams who while done listing the potential charges had now moved on to expressing the joy and satisfaction he would receive from watching rapp brought to justice glen rapp said thats not going to happen the hell it isnt adams said emphatically rapp sighed the chance of your ever seeing me brought to justice is zero you dont know me very well if you think for a minute im somehow going to be talked out of going to the attorney general with this i know you all too well glen but apparently you dont know me very well if you think im going to let you live live adams asked incredulously you wouldnt dare ive dared more times than i can count and for far less than this youre a traitor and unless you can somehow explain to me why in the hell youve been leaking classified information im going to kill you rapp looked into the eyes of the man sitting next to him and said its really not that complicated and if you really believe im the monster you claim you should know im serious the seriousness of his predicament finally sank in adams his jaw slack stared at rapp for a long moment and then blinking looked to the driver and shouted pull over right now the driver ignored him so adams repeated himself but even louder rapp twisted in his seat took a good look at adams picked his spot and then let loose a left jab that caught the inspector general square on the chin adamss head bounced off the window and then his entire body went slack chapter toolesboro iowa the old farmhouse sat nestled in a cusp of trees a few hundred yards from the banks of the mississippi river a creek flowing from the northwest forked and flowed around the rise of land before joining up again and draining into the big river that divided america roughly in half the eightyacre parcel was mostly wooded with some rolling open land to the west most important it offered concealment hakim had found it on his drive north from hannibal missouri the previous fall it had been advertised in the west burlington newspaper as the perfect retreat for solitude and hakim decided it was worth a look after a brief phone call with the local realtor he learned that the family had been selling off parcels of land for over a decade the kids were all goneone in chicago two on the east coast and one on the west coast dad was dead and mom had just been moved into a nursing home all that was left to sell was the old house and two barns that sat on the heavily wooded eighty acres by the river the realtor warned him that the land around the house flooded most springs and the driveway sometimes washed out so it wasnt good for much of anything except hunting hakim told the woman it didnt sound like it would work thanked her for her time and hung up he then drove north on highway until he found the place which proved to be more difficult than he had thought which in the end of course was a good thing from a tactical standpoint the place had a lot of positives there wasnt another house in sight and the local road deadended at the propertys driveway which meant there would be minimal traffic if any hakim took a few photos and then called the lawyer in new york and instructed him to buy the property through a game and wildlife conservancy trust that had already been set up the lawyer handled the closing hakim then directed him to hire someone to put up a gate along with a lock box and some no trespassing signs since then he had been back to the property just twice both times to lay down provisions and make sure everything would be ready for them as it turned out the house ended up being one of the rare parts of the plan he and karim had agreed on they had labored over the best route of escape after the attacks the airports were out of the question as was private aviation the americans were well rehearsed in closing those two avenues next they looked at the seaports on the east coast and then the gulf of mexico during normal times stowing away on a container ship would not be difficult but the americans would be at a heightened state not seen since the towers had been taken down every port would have hundreds of eyes and countless security cameras looking for them they looked at crossing the border into canada or mexico driving through a bordercontrolled checkpoint seemed far too risky so they decided they would have to make the journey on foot hiking through rugged wilderness karim was confident that they could handle the physical aspect of the trip the real problem would be finding someone they could trust on the other side their resources were stretched too thin already they would have to turn outside the group to find help hakim knowing the depth of his friends paranoia offered his counterintuitive suggestion of driving to americas heartland and lying low like saudi arabia america was an immense country with large cities as well as vast open spaces that were sparsely populated while it was true that america was a melting pot especially compared to a closed society like that of saudi arabia it was not exactly as open as it looked on paper all those various groups tended to cluster together which nullified much of the potential for concealment karim had originally thought his friend meant driving to a city like chicago with over ten million people in the metropolitan area they would be the proverbial needles in a haystack having actually spent some time in america hakim had to explain why going to chicago was a bad idea there were too many eyes and ears in a big city and there would surely be reward money offered if everyone was looking for them the best solution was to find someplace where they could let the storm blow over in absolute privacy karim loved the idea and gave his best friend the approval to find such a place hakim stared out the small kitchen window toward the river and the rising sun and watched a single wild turkey strut across the yard toward the woods he looked to his right in search of the others five mornings in a row hed seen the seven turkeys strut along their little trail and into the woods had the others been killed was this one kicked out of the herd or flock or whatever it was that you called a group of turkeys whatever it was hakim could identify with him every morning for the past week hed thought of going it alone just walk down the hill to the river and get into the little boat hed stashed in the underbrush hed fire up the twentyfivehorsepower outboard and push off from the bank head south like huck finn take the big river all the way to the gulf had there been a single incident that had caused the rift or was it a culmination of events hakim had been searching for the answer all week was it when he left his best friend in the mountains of pakistan almost a year ago was it the jungles of south america that had warped his friends brain or had it happened much earlier like most childhood friendships theirs had progressed without question or challenge karim was the student with the best marks he was a naturally gifted athlete with a competitive streak unmatched by any of the other kids in the neighborhood and he had always been the most diligent when it came to prayer he had been intense even then while hakim was far more laid back they had always complemented each other as hakim took a sip of tea he wondered if it had been an illusion of sorts had they ever really been that close hakim wanted to believe they had been the best of friends but it was possible that the relationship had always been onesided it was hard to tell the difference between a driven individual and a selfcentered assmaybe they went hand in hand whatever the case there had been a change although it was possible that it was more of a progression his old friend was proving to be every bit as narcissistic as the rest of the al qaeda leadership with each passing day he was increasingly obsessed with the coverage of the attacks and the aftermath the prophet had warned against such selflove hakim was attempting to reconcile the thorny theological aspects of their struggle when he heard the voice of his friend good morning hakim was not surprised he had long ago grown used to karims ability to move about silently he looked over his shoulder and nodded glancing at the nearby clock he noticed it was am his shift was over and he wouldnt be back on again for eight hours anything interesting happen on your watch karim asked no hakim said honestly any news karim asked pointing at the small tv on the table i did not turn it on reading again yes those same blasphemous american books you read when we were kids karim asked with an edge of disapproval i would hardly call for whom the bell tolls a blasphemous novel do you think imam bin abdullah would approve karim asked as he grabbed the remote and turned on the tv hakim thought of the imam of their local mosque back in makkah saudi arabia the man was perhaps the most unenlightened cleric he had encountered in all of his travels as much as he wanted to tell his friend just that and then some he decided to bite his tongue the week had been peppered with these little fights they were both on edge and hakim was too tired to engage look at this karim announced as he pointed the remote control at the tv and began pressing the volume button hakim looked at the screen it was turned to one of the american news channels it seemed that his friend could not get enough of the coverage of the attacks they had perpetrated the previous week he took an almost perverse joy in keeping track of the death count and the names of those who had been killed he kept a running tally in a small spiralbound notebook two cabinet members and seven senators had perished in the initial explosions the first part of the mission had gone with clocklike precision three car bombs in front of three of washingtons most celebrated haunts all detonated at the height of the lunchtime rush those bombs alone had killed nearly people a fourth bomb was then detonated several hours later during the height of the rescue operation killing many more and dealing a devastating psychological blow to the satanic people of america at least thats how karim chose to describe it hakim however was not so exuberant the secondary explosion had killed dozens of firefighters rescue workers law enforcement officers and civilians who happened to be standing nearby hakim had argued against the tactic he saw no honor in the use of such underhanded moves and that was only the beginning one of his greatest struggles within al qaeda was trying to get his fellow members to take a less myopic view of the world very few of his fellow jihadists were widely traveled and even fewer had spent any real time in america they had no understanding of americas sense of fair play an explosion that was designed to target and kill rescue workers would enrage the american people karim and the others who thought such tactics would weaken the american resolve to fight couldnt have been more wrong dastardly tactics like this would only drive young men to the military recruiting centers this would prolong the war and hurt their cause in the eyes of the international community hakim had stated his case as forcefully as he dared and once again hed lost look karim said almost gleefully this is why they will never win this war i have been telling you this for years what are you talking about hakim was more irritated than interested as he stepped closer to the tv he saw a picture of a man in his late twenties the screen suddenly changed to a still photo of a smiling woman and a baby girl he was supposed to meet them for lunch karim said he works for their treasury department or i should say worked he added with a chuckle he was more than thirty minutes late for the lunch last week the mother and daughter were killed in the explosion he survived and why are you so happy hakim asked he just committed suicide karim started laughing can you imagine such a thing they are so feeble hakim watched him take out his spiralbound notebook he scratched off the previous number and with a selfsatisfied smile wrote down the new tally in a tired voice hakim said and you worry about what im reading karim having not really heard his friend closed the notebook and looked up excuse me what do you think imam bin abdullah would think of your merriment over the pain of others with a dismissive grunt karim said he would thank me for killing another infidel too tired to get into another heated debate with perhaps the most obstinate person he knew hakim ignored his friend and headed down the short hall to a warm bed and what he hoped would be a long and undisturbed sleep chapter lake anna virginia mitch rapp looked down at the calm glassy lake as a bright orange sun began climbing over the trees on the eastern shore pockets of fog clung to the inlets but the middle of the lake was clear somewhere around the bend he could make out the whine of an outboard engine more than likely carrying a fisherman to his favorite early morning spot rapp had been to this place often since the murder of his wife it was always a bit conflicting in the sense that it reminded him of the good times they had shared but also of the harsh reality that she was gone the setting reminded him of both his place on the chesapeake where they had fallen in love and her familys place back in northern wisconsin hed only been there a few times while she was alive and would not go back now that she was gone hed made the one trip to chicago to apologize in person to her parents and brothers hed dreaded every minute of that conversation but knew he would never be able to live with himself if he didnt face them rapp hadnt been the one who killed her but he was the selfish idiot who had pulled her into his shitty little world where all too often innocent people got caught in the crossfire hed been a fool to ever think he could have a normal life he remembered as he looked down at the smooth morning water how she and her brothers liked to ski first thing in the morning he thought of all those family photos that hung on the knotty pine walls of the cozy family cabin shots of anna as a little kid all legs like a fawn skiing knockkneed on two old boardsher golden brown skin and the freckles around her nose those amazing green eyes that still haunted him every night hed never known anyone as beautiful and would have bet everything he had that he never would again he had decided after several years of mourning that it was hopeless to think otherwise thered been a couple brief relationships but he still wasnt over her so each woman was doomed from the start the squeak of a screen door caught his attention and rapp looked over at the main house it was a story and a half with three big dormers on the second floor and a wraparound porch that covered three sides the fourinch siding was painted white and the trim around the windows and the doors matched the green asphalt shingles on the roof the owner stepped out onto the porch and struggled with the zipper on his khaki jacket after a moment he got it started and then stepped forward with the help of a cane his name was stan hurley a seventyeightyearold veteran of the cia hed been officially retired for nineteen years but unofficially he was still very involved the irascible hurley had handled much of rapps training those first few years after he graduated from syracuse university on more than one occasion rapp had wondered if the bastard was trying to kill him most of that training had taken place right here on the banks of lake anna rapp had been an experiment of sorts the clandestine men and women at langley all went through the cia training facility near williamsburg virginia known as the farm a group of veterans at langley however felt the changing political winds and decided they would have to begin hiding things from the opportunists on capitol hill that was when hurley left the agency and set up shop an hour south of washington dc rapp didnt know how many others they had auditioned but he gathered that hurley had chewed up and spat out at least three guys before he arrived on that hot humid summer day almost two decades ago he knew because hurley referred to them as idiot one idiot two and idiot three hed say things like i spent two days trying to teach idiot three how to do this and then the jackass nearly killed himself watching the old prick hobble across the asphalt driveway rapp had to admit that he was still a bit intimidated by the man there werent many guys who could give him that kind of feeling rapp remembered showing up for training as if it were yesterday he was in his early twenties and he thought the best shape of his life after finishing a nearperfect season captaining the orangemen lacrosse team there was nothing as humbling as getting your ass kicked by a chainsmoking bourbondrinking sixtysomeyearold man who was all cock and bones it had happened only a few feet from where rapp was standing in the big barn on the old stinky wrestling mat that rapp had been forced to manhandle seven days a week for nearly four months looking back on the situation now rapp could see hurley had been in complete control but back then he seriously wondered if he was going to survive hurley woke him up at am with a cigarette dangling from his lips when rapp didnt get out of bed fast enough hurley flipped his militaryissue cot and dumped him onto the hard dusty floor of the barn he was told that the barn was where hed be sleeping until he proved himself worthy to sleep in the house the real trouble started when rapp came up swinging in hindsight it had been an extremely stupid move the geezer was far more agile than he looked rapp threw the punch and then next thing he knew he was back on the floor the wind knocked from his lungs gasping for air like a fish flopping around on a dock hurley had announced while standing over him a fighter idiot one was a fighter he only lasted a week but at least he was a fighter rapp made it through that first week despite being knocked to the ground on average probably eight times a day he was also called every dirty name in the book and ordered at least once an hour to quit hurley would tell him over and over in the foulest possible language that rapp was wasting his time rapp had seen enough movies to know what was going on hed also run enough captains practices to understand that hurley was trying to figure out if he had what it took to make the cut knowing it and experiencing it however are two very different things rapp had never quit anything in his life and he sure as hell wasnt going to start now but hurley and his sadomasochistic trials tested him as the tough old spy hobbled along the drive with the help of his cane rapp couldnt help but smile over the fact that the guy used to kick his ass six ways from sunday whats so funny dickhead hurley asked in his throaty threepackaday voice nothing rapps smile got bigger bullshit you think this cane is funny he picked it up and shook it at rapp id like to see how you get along when youre my age doc says most guys are all whacked up on drugs for the first week after they get their hip replaced i havent taken shit thats if you dont count the fifth of bourbon you drink every day hurley stopped his dark eyes zeroing in on rapp are you trying to ruin my life no rapp replied with a grin and threw one of hurleys favorite lines back at him just trying to keep it real stan hurley looked toward the barn with his baggy eyes and stuffed his right hand into his jacket pocket after digging around for a moment he retrieved a soft pack of unfiltered camels yeah well things are about to get as real as they can get you sure youre up for this rapp asked wanting to give him another chance to skip it i can handle it hurley cupped his left hand around the tip of the cigarette and spun the wheel on the old zippo the flame shot up and after a long deep pull he exhaled a cloud of smoke and said i know you can but i need to do this rapp would have preferred to handle it himself but he knew there would be no changing hurleys mind well lets get started i have to be back up at langley by nine chapter the big double doors to the barn were closed so rapp and hurley used the smaller service door around the corner a mediumsized tractor a couple of atvs and a ford f pickup truck were parked on the side closest to the big doors the other side of the floor was dominated by what looked like a large safe but was actually an industrial kiln that hurley used for his incongruous hobby of pottery and a few other things the two men walked to the opposite wall and approached a large oak card catalog cabinet the brown wood was scuffed and dusty and a few of the old brass pulls on the drawers were missing even without all the various screws nuts bolts nails and assorted knickknacks that filled the eighty drawers the thing looked as if it weighed a thousand pounds hurley reached around the back pressed a button and the cabinet began to swing away from the wall revealing a concrete staircase rapp went down first and once hurleys head was clear he punched a code into a keypad the cabinet began sliding back into place once the cabinet was back in place rapp punched in another code when the light turned green and he heard the electric motor release the lock he turned the knob and stepped into a rectangular room with pouredconcrete walls there were two battleshipgray metal desks a couch and a round table with four chairs one man was sitting behind the closest desk he stood when hurley and rapp entered the second man was on the couch lying on his back his feet up a baltimore orioles hat covering his face he was either sleeping or didnt care to look and see who had just arrived the room had the heavy sour smell of nicotine when rapp had gone through his training this place didnt exist hurley used a discreet contracting firm that was run by a former operative and had it built after the floor of the barn was excavated and the foundation underpinned to make room for the basement the walls were poured and spancrete sections were placed on top to create the roof for the new rooms and the floor of the barn within a twohour drive of washington there were three similar facilities all of them built with private funding and each one known by only a handful of individuals necessity was after all the mother of invention in order to fulfill its mission the cia needed to be able to conduct most of what it did away from prying eyes and in secret hurley had explained on many occasions that during the cold war they had more than a dozen such places that they would use to debrief defectors as well as the occasional traitor wheres the doc hurley asked the big man who had been sitting behind the desk the muscular man pointed toward the steel door at the far end of the room and said talking to adams been in there almost two hours the big mans name was joe maslick he was a native of chicago and a former airborne ranger whod done three tours one in iraq and two in afghanistan he was wearing a black under armour tshirt and a pair of jeans hurley looked at rapp and asked is he drunk rapp nodded he was pretty much on his way when we picked him up last night and since then i gave him a few drinks on the plane ride down no problems at the airport rapp shook his head loaded him in the hangar right there at teterboro the pilots hurley asked cockpit door was closed the whole time hurley mumbled something under his breath and then said why didnt you just drive him down hurleys words were less a question than a criticism and rapp did not do well with either if it were anyone other than his old instructor rapp would have asked him why he hadnt gotten his lazy ass out of bed and handled the job himself but it was hurley so he gave him a pass stan these pilots have flown me all over the world theyve seen a lot of shit and if theyre asked at some point who was on that plane theyll say they deadheaded it down to richmond because they had an early hop the next morning and when the feds want to talk to the exec who chartered the plane rapp glanced at his watch it was am the plane is on its way to mobile as we speak and the man on board has no idea i even exist i still dont like it hurley grumbled as he began digging for a pack of cigarettes rapp almost said tough shit but didnt because he knew this was harder on hurley than hed ever admit he had been best friends with adamss father had served all over the world with him wanting to get off the subject rapp asked did you listen to the audio from last night yeah hurley exhaled a fresh cloud of smoke and hurley stepped behind the desk and looked at the flatscreen monitor on the left it showed adams sitting in the next room talking to a fiftyish man with curly blond hair his name was thomas lewis and he was a clinical psychologist hurley wasnt sure who he was more upset with himself or the little turd sitting in the other room hes a fucking traitor an embarrassment to his family name rapp didnt know what to say so he kept his mouth shut and since maslick wasnt much for conversation the three of them stood there in silence watching the screen across the room though the man napping on the couch decided to make himself heard from under his baseball cap he announced embarrassing the family name is no reason to kill a man rapp wasnt surprised by the comment but it still pissed him off hed been arguing with mike nash about this entire mess for the last few hours how about committing treason boy genius hurley asked definitely a capital offense but then again it doesnt exactly fall under our jurisdiction hurleys eyes scanned the surface of the desk his hands beginning to tremble with rage he skipped the stapler grabbed a ceramic coffee mug and whipped it across the room the mug hit the concrete wall just above the leather couch and shattered into a thousand pieces shards raining down on nash nash jumped off the couch shouting what the hell you wanna argue with me sport you do me the courtesy of getting off your ass and looking me in the eye hurley turned to rapp and snarled what kinda shit show are you running if i wanted personal opinions id join a fucking book club hurley set out across the room growling and cursing under his breath when he reached the steel door he banged on it several times with his cane and then punched in the code to release the lock rapp looked at nash and mouthed the words what in the hell is wrong with you nash didnt bother to reply he was too steamed at hurley to deal with rapp a moment later dr lewis joined them and the door to the interrogation room was closed and locked no one took a seat rapp and hurley faced lewis while maslick stayed behind the desk to keep an eye on the monitors and nash stayed on the other side of the room still stewing about his rebuke give it to me straight hurley said to the shrink lewis started to speak and then paused as if deciding where to begin he ran a hand through his curly blond hair and said classic narcissistic personality disorder thats it no its quite a bit more complicated than that lewis hesitated and then asked you knew his parents yep dad not around much none of us were thats how it was back then lewis nodded in understanding and studied hurley with his blue eyes he was in the clandestine service with you yep so he was around even less than the average dad i suppose so was his mother detached marge hurley said as his eyes became unfocused as if trying to remember some distant memory she wasnt exactly the warmest person not very affectionate about as affectionate as that desk over there lewis nodded it all fits the profile adams has an overinflated sense of worth and that carries over into a sense of entitlement the flip side is that his selfesteem is very fragile it would be extremely difficult for him to take criticism to deepen the problem he lacks empathy which enables him to be extremely exploitative of others he feels that he is special and can only be understood by brilliant people that he should only associate with others whom he deems talented enough while at the same time he needs their real talent to validate his underlying insecurities martyr complex always thinks hes getting screwed by someone and needs to let everyone know it very common when he comes across someone like mitch for instance lewis gestured to rapp someone who is strongminded independent resultsoriented not prone to handing out compliments someone who is acknowledged as being at the top of their game when that happens lewis winced he feels that person is the enemy and has to be knocked down to size it is not uncommon for people with this disorder to become lawyers it makes them feel smarter than most other people and they can use their knowledge of the law to bully those who do not validate their imagined genius hurley thought back to some of the family trips theyd taken some forty years ago he remembered his friend mark getting mad as hell at the way his son would pout if he didnt get his way suicidal no virtually unheard of hes too in love with himself might fake it or threaten it but most certainly would not follow through anything else hurley asked hes asked for you he knows im here hurley asked in surprise no he has no idea youre involved in this he claims youll understand what is going on hurley frowned understand how could he possibly think that of all people out there i would understand what hes doing i wouldnt read too much into it as i said he has an overinflated sense of his own importance also remember it is extremely difficult for someone with this disorder to ever accept responsibility for his actions there is always a rationalization lewis looked at rapp and added hes scared to death of mitch because he knows nothing that he can say or do will change his mind with you he looked at hurley and shrugged his shoulders hes hoping that hell find some empathy from an old family friend rapp could see that hurley was having a hard time with this new twist he took no joy in seeing the tough old bastard like this so he touched his arm and said let me take care of it no hurley shook his head and stood up as straight as his seventyeightyearold frame would allow i need to do this chapter wapello iowa ted white slid out of bed and grabbed the pile of clothes sitting on the chair in the corner through the gap in the shades he glimpsed the gray predawn morning he picked up the bundle looked over his shoulder at his wife and began to carefully tiptoe out of the room as he walked past the open door he grabbed the handle and slowly pulled it until the door closed with a soft click safely in the hallway he allowed himself to breathe he waited for a moment to make sure she didnt stir and then he took two steps and entered his son haydens room the seventeenyearold lay there twisted up in his sheets and blankets two of his four pillows on the floor one trapped under his body and the last one on top of his head he was due to graduate from high school in one month white grabbed him by the shoulder and gently shook him nothing he waited five seconds and tried again this continued for another thirty seconds with increasing force until haydens eyes snapped open with a dazed crazy look what he asked still delirious with sleep whats wrong shhhh his dad said if you wake your mother up theres no way shell let you come with me the kid didnt reply he just looked around the room and tried to figure out what was going on grab your hunting gear but mom said i couldnt go i have an english test third period and i have a game tonight hayden was headed to the university of northern iowa on a baseball scholarship youve worked hard enough over the past four years i think youre entitled to a little turkey shoot with your dad but mom i know his father cautioned shushing him with his hand as long as i have you back in school in time to take that test everything will be fine coach doesnt like it if i already talked to your coach he likes to turkey hunt just like me and he knows theyre randy as hell this week he said it was fine just so long as i have you back in school in time for the test well head out to my uncles old place fifteen minutes out and fifteen back if you get your butt in gear we should have no problem getting in a few good hours hayden untwisted himself and put his feet on the floor he raised both arms above his head and groaned moms going to be pissed in a hushed yet forceful voice white said im going to be pissed if you wake her up now get moving ill make us a couple of fried egg sandwiches we can eat them in the truck with that white left his only childs room and made it down the hallway to the kitchen he started the coffee and warmed up the frying pan next came the hard part he found a notepad and a pen and leaned over placing his right elbow on the counter and wondered how best to admit to the crime like most things in life he decided it would be best to be brief and hold his ground honey i checked with coach last night he says its fine if i take hayden hunting i will make sure i have him back in school for third period this is probably our last spring shoot next year hell be away at college where did all the years go love ted chapter toolesboro iowa hakim closed the door to the bedroom and despite wanting to clear his mind he began to think of the attacks the lunchtime explosions the bomb that had decimated the emergency personnel who were sifting through the rubble of the monoclea restaurant that was a favorite haunt of us senators and lobbyistsand then the final bold move hakim considered it a stroke of genius for all his recent disagreements with karim he had to admit that the audacity of the plan was impossible to ignore karim had asked hakim to locate americas national counterterrorism centerthe nerve center for the great satans illegitimate war on terror as he called it without telling any of the senior al qaeda commanders they put together a daring plan to assault the building karim wanted to turn the hunters into the hunted they would hit the national counterterrorism center while the americans were in disarray and focused on the initial attacks and the secondary explosion hakim had been there with karim when their six comrades dressed in swat gear burst into the building having spent a decent amount of time in washington hakim knew it was not uncommon to see big black suvs driving down the street loaded with menacing men armed to the teeth with the confusion created by the initial blasts they would drive right up to the gate of the counterterrorism facility and easily dispatch the light security the men had been trained for months in every detail of the plan and from what they saw it had worked perfectly the suburban drove over the curb and right up to the front door with its emergency lights flashing the men poured out of the vehicle formed up in a singlefile line and entered the building engaging targets as they went they were to avoid the elevators and take the stairs to the top floor where the nerve center was located in addition to the m rifles and glock pistols each man wore a custommade suicide vest that was packed with c plastic explosives and halfinch ball bearings karim had predicted that the attack on the facility would cripple americas ability to effectively attack al qaeda for years to come and it couldnt happen soon enough the hunterkiller teams and the unmanned aerial vehicles with their missiles had decimated the upper ranks of their group they expected casualties to exceed one hundred but something had gone wrong either that or the americans were lying so far only eighteen individuals had been reported dead in the assault on the counterterrorism facility six days later karim still refused to believe the reports he was convinced the americans in an effort to save face and reassure the public were covering up the true damage hakim had noticed one little problem with that theory though news crews had been able to get shots of the buildings upper floors from outside the security fence and they were still intact if the suicide vests had gone off as planned every window would have been blown out and there was a better than fiftyfifty chance that the roof would be nothing more than a jagged hole he had mentioned this to his old friend and had suffered a harsh rebuke he was told he was na√Øve in the ways of the world and the wests ability to manipulate the media hakim was growing tired of his friends inflexibility he was the one who had traveled the world while karim had done little more than hang out at caf√©s and mosques surrounded by likeminded men he had done almost no traveling outside saudi arabia there were things hakim would like to say to his friend but he knew the timing was not right they needed to find a safe way out of the country and then when things had settled down he could confront him when hakim was done washing his face and brushing his teeth he faced east knelt on the floor and began to pray for most of his life he had prayed the required five times a day often spending a total of two hours prostrate in an attempt to prove himself a good muslim it had been several years since hed been that devoted however to accomplish his mission hed been forced to abandon many of his habits and rituals his travels to america and other countries required that he draw as little attention to his faith as possible even now in the secrecy of his room in the middle of america with not a person in sight he rushed through his prayers he offered himself up to allah and asked for his guidance on this dangerous journey and then as was increasingly the case his mind began to wander he was still talking to allah but instead of asking for guidance he was asking questions he was trying to reconcile the irreconcilable he stumbled through it as he did so often latelyasking the question giving half the answer and then moving on to the next thing before completing the thought doing so prevented him from having to face the truth these shortened prayers were turning into bleak sessions almost as if he were jotting down notes with allah and saying when i get through the hardest part of this journey you and i will sit down and sort our way through this mess hakim still believed in allah that was not the problem his lack of confidence had more to do with his followersthe men who claimed to know exactly what allah wanted as he slid under the covers he tried to clear his mind his faith he realized was not in crisis it was his faith in his friend that was causing the problem hakim thought back to the day they had met but quickly stopped himself he had spent too much time wrestling with this of late he was tired and if he was ever going to sit down and discuss his concerns with karim he would need to be rested using an old trick he picked one of his best memories and began to replay it in his mind the sun was glistening off the familiar cool blue water of the florida keys hakim leaned back in the chair and then let himself come forward almost as if he were praying to allah but he wasnt his right hand went round and round in tiny circles on the reel drawing in as much line as he could in the few seconds he had and then he leaned all the way back despite the strain of wrestling with the great big marlin for the better part of an hour he had a look of childlike elation on his face the trip to cuba had been inspired by his reading the old man and the sea by ernest hemingway for hakim it had been the single greatest experience of his life a day didnt pass without that beautiful marlin jumping into his thoughts and rarely did he fall asleep without a glimpse of it he knew it was a coping mechanism there had been a lot of death and dismembermentbullets and bombs that did horrific things to friends strangers and enemies alike hed seen men literally shredded by the shrapnel of an artillery shell so bloody and fleshy and cut to pieces that youd swear there was no way on earth they would ever survive but by gods mercy some of them did and if theyd had the medical facilities that the enemy had even more would have lived and then there were other times where you would find a comrade after an air strike and you would swear he was simply knocked unconscious because he had not a blemish on his body you would nudge him even splash some water on his face and there was no bringing him back hakim learned later it was the concussive blasts of the big twothousandpound american bombs the shock wave from the explosions would cause blunt trauma to the internal organs of individuals without leaving any outward mark of death these were just some of the images hakim tried to suppress every time he attempted to sleep like the six welltrained men assaulting the counterterrorism facility hakim did not like the casual way they convinced other followers to throw their lives away that was why he clung to the memory of his trip to cuba and the unforgettable day he spent chasing the marlin fighting and eventually landing the huge fish the chasm between the two worlds however created a paradox he had either been halfheartedly trying to reconcile the issue or trying very hard to avoid it whichever was the case hakim knew he couldnt put it off much longer now is not the time he told himself he quieted his mind by thinking of the warm sun on his face he remembered the humid salt air and the soft breeze the balletic dance of the big blue fish as it sailed through the air hakim began drifting off to sleep hopeful that he would someday return to cuba that familiar voice in his head was calling him a fool he had no idea if he had been asleep for two minutes or two hours he was still on his back his eyes closed when he heard the heavy footsteps of someone running in the house the door to the bedroom burst open with a thud and hakim startled sat up in complete shock his mind numb from its deep state of rem couldnt quite place the face of the burly man standing in the open doorway they are coming the man said with genuine fear in his voice hakim realized it was ahmed the lethargic moroccan hurry they are here he said in heavily accented english grab your gun and get to your post who is here hakim asked suddenly very alert two men with orange like they put on their vehicles hakim was used to trying to translate the mangled sentences that the men often concocted but this was a new one what are you trying to say get up the moroccan said with genuine panic karim wants you now hurry chapter lake anna virginia adams couldnt figure out where in the hell things had gone wrong his plan had been perfect hed seen what happened to whistleblowers they ended up celebrated by one party and trashed by the other legal bills bankrupted the poor bastards while the slow workings of justice placed their life in a nearpermanent state of limbo no matter how just their accusations they ended up pummeled politics in dc was a blood sport and whistleblowers were cannon fodder adams had thought about it long and hard it would have been like being the first guy off the very first landing barge at omaha beach on dday they would have slaughtered him no he was convinced he had plotted the right course he knew with every fiber of his body that rapp and nash and kennedy and a bunch of others were trampling all over the constitution he had been working feverishly behind the scenes to try to get the right people at justice to stand up and take notice most of the deputy ags wanted nothing to do with rapp and kennedy there was a long list of people in washington who had tried to tangle with them and so far they had proven themselves untouchable more and more people saw it as a careerender adams thought he had finally found an ally in senator lonsdale the senior senator from missouri chaired the judiciary committee and shared adamss dislike of the cia and its cowboy ways then the bombs had shattered the civility of the capital and the mood changed yet again adams had gone to see lonsdale only a few days ago and the meeting had been a disaster after months of working with each other and finally finding an aggressive attorney at justice who was brave enough to go after the criminals at langley she had now lost her nerve she suggested adams drop the issue and focus his energy on tracking down the millions in unaccounted funds the cia had squandered in iraq and afghanistan he desperately tried to get her to see that now was not the time to quit they were so close all adams needed was the political clout and subpoena power of the judiciary committee and they could finally put rapp and the rest of them behind bars adams could not do it by himself despite their overall lack of brainpower rapp and the others were survivors and had gone to great lengths to cover their tracks with lonsdale abandoning him and the rest of the senate and the house too morally bankrupt to lift a finger adams saw no hope in dragging them out of the shadows and into the bright light of court with no support from justice or the hill and the whistleblower option deemed suicidal adams had to find a third way his source of inspiration was none other than mark felt the now deceased assistant deputy fbi director who had brought down president richard nixon by selectively feeding information to bob woodward and carl bernstein while felt was the template adams was not going to be so foolish as to allow some reporter to make millions off his bravery while he retired on his meager federal pension he would publish a scathing expos√© of the cia its illegal programs and the men who ran them he had already picked out a titlea quest for justice he would write it under the pen name jefferson no first name just the last adams had told kenny urness that a cia black ops agent had come to him and was asking for help the fictional agent wanted to shop a tellall manuscript that would expose the cia and its myriad illegal programs urness would set up a blind trust to hold the millions the novel would make and then when things finally settled down five or seven years from now adams would step forward as the brave man who had brought down the fascist wing of the american government there would be uproar for sure but adams knew how to hide his tracks hed already purchased with cash a used laptop that would be destroyed once the book was finished hed even found a software program that would allow him to change his prose to avoid identification by writing experts polygraphs would be administered far and wide but he would pass them as he always did the lie detectors were useless against someone with his iq hed had it all figured out but despite all of the careful planning hed missed something adams fingered the empty glass sitting on the table and silently wished they would get him another drink the vodka was starting to wear off and that was the last thing he needed right now staying calm was no easy thing when you knew a man like mitch rapp was loitering on the other side of a steel door and you had no way of calling for help despite being caught off guard adams had already vowed that he would make rapp pay he would say what he needed to say to win his release and then he would raise hell no sane person would ever kill him at least thats what he kept telling himself he was the inspector general of the cia for gods sake the media would dig the hill would demand answers it would simply be too difficult to cover up thats what his highly rational brain kept telling him but there was another voice in his head one that was far less confident one that had been warning him with increasing seriousness that mitch rapp was a man capable of extreme violence adams was again trying to reassure himself that all would be fine despite his deep forebodings when the door opened he recognized the lined worn face immediately and notwithstanding the fact that he didnt care much for the man he felt a huge sense of relief that he was here regardless of their differences stan hurley was an old family friend a covert ops legend and maybe the only man rapp would listen to adams was confident he could get the old man to sympathize with him uncle stan adams said in a hopefilled voice thank god youre here he stood and moved forward his arms open ready to embrace one of the meanest cusses hed ever known but before he could get close enough something hard poked him in the stomach he froze sit down hurley ordered adams looked down to see the rubber tip of a cane pressed into his belly what happened to you nothing sit hurley nudged him back and pointed at the chair adams slowly retreated and took his seat uncle stan thered better be a hell of a good explanation for this really hurley said with skepticism i was about to say the same thing this is crazy im the inspector general of the cia i cant be kidnapped in the middle of the night and interrogated like this the fact that youre sitting here is proof that youre wrong on both counts adams frowned and said this isnt prague circa neither mitch rapp nor anyone at the cia for that matter has any right to abduct me i suppose from a purely legal standpoint you are correct hurleys admission gave adams a shot of confidence youre damn right i am everyone makes mistakes but this one is a whopper it sure is well adams studied the face of his fathers best friend in a vain attempt to gauge his true intention as a favor to you id be willing to look the other way on most of this but im going to need some reassurances such as for starters rapp and his band of goons need to promise that nothing like this will ever happen again hurley gripped the back of the chair with his free hand he didnt say anything for a long moment his mind flashed through a movie reel of glen adamss life he hadnt put much thought into whether he liked the kid until he was in high school and then only because his friend was worried that his boy didnt quite get it as hurley looked at the younger adams he thought how right his friend had been to worry hurley finally spoke and you think all of this is a mistake youre here through no fault of your own adams knew this was where he needed to be careful i know youve been out for a while so i dont expect that youve kept up on everything thats been going on but lets just say rapp stuck his nose into something that doesnt concern him hurley almost laughed but managed to keep a straight face really hurley said as if he were intrigued why dont you enlighten me chapter adamss mind was moving at light speed trying to plot the correct course that would allow him to sucker this old codger into thinking rapp had made a monumental mistake he couldnt remember the exact date but as best he could recall hurley had been out for at least fifteen years there was no doubt he kept tabs on certain things but most of his old sources would have dried up the key he decided was to stay as vague as possible and keep things current adams averted his eyes and seemed to study the dented and scratched surface of the metal desk this thing im working on im afraid i cant talk about it hurley looked at him with his bloodshot but shrewd eyes so if i call director kennedy right now shell tell me you were on official cia business shaking his head adams replied she wasnt involved in this tell me who to call then give me a name hurley folded his arms across his chest as if he were settling in for a long wait stan youre not read in on this adams shifted in his chair hell you dont work for langley anymore i cant discuss this with you hurley snorted i know more shit about our black ops than the president so stop wasting my time and start answering my questions or were going to test that little euphorian theory of yours and what theory would that be the one about torture how you like to tell all your buddies in the press that it doesnt work that its nothing more than a recruiting tool for al qaeda adams looked dumbfounded well thats true and how in the hell would you know hurley leaned over the chair have you ever interrogated someone had to get rough with him to save lives you know the answer to that im the inspector general of the cia what about those twentythree months you spent in the clandestine service that you like to brag about a whole five of them in the field and even then the only time you left the embassy compound was to play golf or try to get laid im not going to relive all that with you adams said with a forced smile lets just agree that there are two sides to every story yeah like the truth and then the stuff that isnt the truth like your little dinner date last night what about it according to mitch you were in the process of committing treason mitch rapp is a professional liar it might be a good idea if you didnt try to make this about mitch you either start answering me honestly or im going to bring him in here and you know as well as i do that he cares even less about your feelings than i do fine fine adams said backpedaling but theres only so much i can say what were you doing in new york last night having dinner with an old college friend discussing adams hesitated he had to be careful not to catch himself in a lie i respect you stan i always have so im going to say this as politely as i can i dont answer to you i dont answer to mitch rapp i answer to the president and the oversight committees on the hill thats it hurley exhaled a sigh of frustration i dont seem to be getting through to you i feel the same way adams said in disappointment i understand how difficult this business is so im willing to look the other way this one time but this offer is not going to last very long im tired and i have a busy day of appointments ill give rapp one chance to let me walk out of here and i mean right now one chance adams held up his index finger hurley started to laugh you dont understand whats going on do you i understand that in about two hours people are going to start wondering where i am and once that happens it is going to be very hard for me to look the other way on this so for the last time let me go and ill forget all this but i tell you adamss face flushed with anger if rapp so much as looks at me the wrong way i will bury him hurley wouldnt have believed the mans arrogance if he hadnt been here to witness it i dont think youre going to be going anywhere for quite a while id better adams felt his heart begin to race because what little understanding i have is quickly wasting away youre an idiot hurley said as if he were telling him his shoes were untied i tried my best to help you early in your career but you really are one dumb son of a bitch adams acted as if hed been slapped in the face uncle stan i have done nothing wrong i am the one trying to do the right thing if you think youve done nothing wrong then i might as well shoot you in the head and get this over with adamss mouth was agape here was a man he had known since birthhis fathers best friend for christs sake adams blurted out ive served my country i dont understand i signed up just like you and dad do yourself a favor and dont start comparing your clandestine service career to your fathers i adams stammered i wasnt about to go down with that ship of rats they were the most corrupt bastards id ever met corrupt you talking about our fine boys down in bogot√° back in the eighties of course i am they should have all been thrown in jail hurley considered slapping him but he didnt want to make this any more personal than it already was this is all my fault the other instructors at the farm wanted to wash your ass out but i protected you they knew you didnt have what it would take and i knew it too but i thought i owed it to your father so i talked you up and let you graduate shaking his head in selfloathing he added it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life didnt have what it would take adams asked some anger finally seeping into his voice you mean like a frontal lobotomy you mean the ability to ignore every ethical standard id ever learned ignore everything congress says about what i should or shouldnt be doing the problem with you glen is that you always thought you were special and the truth is youre not you were a dogshit operative the only thing you were good for was wining and dining at the embassy parties anything that involved getting your hands dirty you pissed and moaned like a little girl by getting my hands dirty you mean breaking the law youre damn right i do what in the hell do you think it is that the cia is supposed to do you think were supposed to obey everyones laws go ask the international court and the un and the fucking state department for permission to find out which colombian military officers are on the drug cartels payroll oh i think youre simplifying it a bit you want me to simplify things here it is you were a complete failure as an operative you were a mediocre prosecutor who kissed all the right asses and managed to land an emptysuit job as the chief watchdog at the cia where your entire mission is to get in the way of people who are actually trying to keep us safe is that simple enough for you get in the way adams shouted you think things like the rule of law and the constitution simply get in the way no but neither have i deluded myself into thinking that the men who wrote it ever intended for a second that it be used to protect our enemies so guys like mitch rapp should be able to do whatever theyd like without any oversight kill whomever they deem a threat without answering to any higher authority if i have to choose between mitch and those menstruating partisan hacks on capitol hill ill put my money on mitch adams his fists clenched stood and demanded do you know why they hate us who the terrorists who do you think they hate us because of men like you and my father and rapp and nash and rest of you knuckledragging goons those goons hurley said in a quiet angry voice have done more to protect this country than the entire house and senate put together and theyve done it without an ounce of recognition or thanks from all the intellectually arrogant fucks like you hurley stepped back and swung his cane around smacking adams in the elbow adams yelped and grabbed himself what in the hell is wrong with you i was your only chance you dumb ass all i wanted was the slightest sign of remorse and instead i got more of your pompous defiance he turned for the door where are you going adams asked in a voice that had suddenly lost its command to get the man you think so little of wait adams said in a voice that finally betrayed a bit of fear hurley didnt bother to turn around you blew it now you get to find out firsthand if torture works chapter rapp checked his watch he had thirty minutes at the most and then he would have to hightail it up to langley he wasnt worried about his alibi should the feds come knocking hed send them to hurley and as long as the tough bastard kept breathing hed tell them that rapp had arrived shortly before seven the previous evening and stayed the night as to what theyd discussed and done during the roughly twelve hours since they could confidently tell the feds to pound sand the agents might not like it but the men and women of the clandestine service had good reason for being tightlipped with them and the good ones knew it what bothered rapp was the fact that there were more important things for him to be dealing withlike trying to find the three terrorists who had vanished they had launched a manhunt like nothing hed witnessed in his nearly twenty years of service every law enforcement officer in the country was on high alert and so far theyd only come up with thousands of false leads seven days postattack they finally started looking at different scenarios at first theyd concentrated on the airports the borders and the big ports the navy had boarded and searched twenty vessels that were deemed suspicious not a single person had been able to explain to rapp what intelligence had landed those ships in the suspicious category but hed learned enough over the years to not try to swim against the current the navy was simply doing what they were ordered and those orders were coming from men and women who would rather look busy and earnest than get thoughtful now theyd moved on to the smaller marinas airstrips and remote border crossings in rapps opinion and hed voiced it rather loudly this should have been the area of focus from the beginning the men who were behind the attacks had shown a discipline and level of sophistication that he was sure would lead them to be every bit as creative and careful in their escape despite all the hardworking and devoted individuals who work for it the federal government is not a precise instrument in the post world the training was better the equipment was superior and the ability to share information in real time had improved dramatically but the alphabet soup of government agencies had also grown as only washington could do layer after layer of bureaucracy was added all in the name of streamlining the federal governments ability to prevent and respond to a terrorist attack rapp and a handful of others had predicted how the politicians would react the very room he was standing in was proof that they had been right and that theyd managed to stay one step ahead of the lemmings as they continued to do what they thought would be least offensive to the very men they were fighting and now on top of trying to find out where the terrorists were he had to deal with this sideshowthis little drama with glen adams it was adding undue stress to an already difficult situation rapp hadnt liked it when hurley asked him to bring adams down to the lake house but knowing the family history he conceded looking back on it now rapp wished hed flown out over the atlantic and dumped adams out the rear luggage hatch of the g at about five thousand feet it would have been a lot easier now rapp and the others had to stand around and watch this painfully slow tragedy unfold in real time rapp had been through this enough times to know that once you decided a man had to be killed there was no sense putting it off the handwringing and moral debate had to take place up front in adamss case that meant before they even picked him up once that was done there was no turning back you couldnt undo the fact that theyd already broken a number of laws yet here nash was making waves no doubt it had something to do with the strain theyd been under lately but even so rapp expected more from him rapp had seen it before usually in the military where despite amazing effort the use of force was not always as precise as they would like one too many innocent bystanders blown up by a bomb or killed by an errant bullet and you were likely to have the occasional foot soldier check out it wasnt always easy to detect everyone acted different in the days immediately following an engagement with the enemy especially the first twentyfour hours after combat it was not unusual for instance for one of the men to become quiet the noncommissioned officers put up with it to a point but if that brooding turned into questions about the morality of the mission the noncoms stepped on it quick and hard if a trooper or marine couldnt snap out of it they were gone effective fighting units were not the place to debate the ethics of urban warfare the integrity and effectiveness of the unit could not tolerate it so the men either snapped to or were dumped rapp was beginning to question if he would have to do the same thing with some of his men he would not have guessed that nash would be one of the problems he looked across the room at the retired marine officer who was giving lewis an earful and thought it must be the stress of the past week none of them had slept much and nash knew the men and women who worked at the counterterrorism center much better than he did watching tough men in full combat gear die on a mountain range was hard enough but was not incongruous with the mission or the surroundings watching civilians blown away at pointblank range in an office setting was an entirely different matter though rapp had begun moving toward nash and the doctor when he heard his name called from the overhead speaker mitch get in here and bring the file rapp stopped it was hurley he would have to wait and talk to nash in the car on their way back to dc chapter toolesboro iowa despite the urging of the mentally challenged moroccan hakim took his time he put on his pants and a shirt before grabbing his pistol and gas mask hed thought about this exact moment many times since purchasing the safe house escape was an illusion yes they might make it to the river but america was a country with vast resources in the aftermath of the attacks on the towers and the pentagon every county and city in the country had received federal dollars to bolster law enforcement and critical response to terrorist attacks local law enforcement went on a spending spree snatching up stateoftheart communications gear biohazard suits and weapons that rivaled those used by elite special forces units budgets for training increased in some cases by a thousand percent planes and helicopters with night vision equipment were added to the arsenal as well as boats and specialized vehicles of all shapes and sizes and that was just at the local level chicago was less than an hour away by air and the fbi field office there had a swat team that was considered every bit as good as their venerable hostage rescue team that they kept in quantico virginia hakim in general was equal parts optimistic and pragmatic but on this issue it was hard to be optimistic he knew from the moment he found this place that they would be dead if the americans ever found them they went through the motions of discussing escape routes and the provisions had been put in place but both he and karim knew it would do them little good ahmed on the other hand was probably na√Øve enough to think they could get away hakim started down the hallway at an almost casual pace his pistol in his right hand and his gas mask in the other he made no attempt to stay low to the ground the americans would not fire first they would try to contact them ascertain the situation negotiate their surrender and if all of that failed they would strike or they might simply wait them out that last point concerned karim more than any other if they were going to go down he wanted to do it in one final glorious battle taking as many americans with him as possible the idea of being surrounded and forced to choose between suicide and surrender was extremely unappealing a few steps before hakim reached the front of the house he heard the squawk of a radio it was ahmed calling out the distance to his targets hakim walked past the center staircase and reached the front portion of the house a small dining room was on his left and a living room on his right karim was in the living room kneeling at the window ledge peering through the lace curtain karim looked at hakim and ordered get down hakim ignored him and walked straight to the front door where he looked through the small twelvebytwelveinch window two men were coming up the gravel driveway and they were definitely dressed in orangeorange hats and orange vests hakim was slackjawed for a moment and then began to snicker as he thought of ahmeds confusion in afghanistan the americans would drape their vehicles and positions in orange panels to reduce the chances of their own planes bombing them ahmed assumed these men were wearing orange for the same reasonthat they were federal agents and they did not want their own men shooting them get down karim hollered relax hakim said they are hunters how do you know hakim often grew tired of having to explain the obvious to his friend hunting is very popular in this part of america animals are colorblind they wear orange so they dont get shot by another hunter ahmeds voice crackled over the radio i have the shot do i have your permission hakim looked up the staircase and yelled no do not shoot anger flashed across karims face it is not your place to give such orders they are hunters karims eyes narrowed what if they are agents posing as hunters hakim hadnt thought of that but he wasnt about to admit it to karim so he looked out the window and studied the two men they were now just fifty yards away theyd made it up the long straight stretch of the driveway and were now entering the large gravel square that sat between the house and the barn the man on the left was half a head taller and quite a bit heavier than the other man a few seconds later hakim realized the shorter man was a teenager they are not agents hakim said assuredly one of them is a boy it could be a trick hakim didnt even have to think about this one the americans would never try such a stunt in a voice loud enough to carry up the stairs he said both of you stay calm and keep out of sight i will see what they want he bent over and set his gas mask on the floor no karim ordered trust me for once you fool he slid his gun into the back waistband of his pants and covered it with the tail of his black longsleeved tshirt as he started to open the door he heard karim hissing obscenities at him hakim stepped onto the front porch and put a warm smile on his face holding his right hand up in a casual friendly gesture he said good morning can i help you his english was near perfect with only the slightest accent if a stranger had to guess he was more likely to think he was indian or pakistani than saudi sorry to bother you the older of the two said my name is ted white this is my son hayden hello my name is harry how can i help you the two men stopped about twenty feet from the front porch well im sorry to intrude especially this early i saw the no trespassing signs the father looked over his shoulder back down the long drive but i didnt know what else to do you see im a cousin of the terwilligers the family who used to own this place i assume youre the new owner that is correct the man smiled a bit awkwardly do you like to hunt hakim smiled back and said no but i have nothing against it thats nice to hear the man looked at the ground for a moment and shifted his weight from one foot to the other hakim was extremely calm he looked down the driveway and saw nothing but open gravel road these two were not the advance element of some larger force it was obvious the man had a question on his mind so what brings you out here at this early hour well i was wondering if you would give us permission to hunt down by the river you see ive been hunting turkey on this land ever since i was a little kid and so has hayden here i promise you we wont disturb you well just be using little s nothing more than a little pop really hakim nodded things were beginning to make sense how early do you like to start well that depends he gestured at his clothes we were hoping to get some in this morning got the rifles back in the truck but if nows not a good time i dont want to disturb you i suppose now would work hakim offered already thinking the best way to handle this was to be nice they had monitored the media closely and while karims photograph had been everywhere hakims involvement had yet to be reported thank you the father said and then pointed at him and asked you a hawkeye hakim looked down at his black university of iowa tshirt and its bright yellow lettering yes i went there for graduate school their writing program you an author yes thats why i bought this place nice and quiet i understand the man said holding up an apologetic hand he seemed to sense this would be a good time to leave well we really appreciate you letting us use the land well just skirt the creek down there and make our way down to the river youll never see us really appreciate it it means a lot hakim waved and said no worries be safe right as he said it he heard the door open behind him hoping he had imagined it he kept his eyes on the father and son they were turning to leave but then they suddenly stopped hakim watched the expression on the fathers face turn friendly before his entire demeanor changed hakim felt the old porch boards sway under the weight of an additional person he pulse began to quicken hello the man said in a nervous voice hakim turned his head slowly to see karim standing beside and just behind him his gun was clearly visible in his right hand casually he raised the weapon and pointed it at the two men why are you really here hakim whispered in an angry voice i had this under control without taking his eyes off the two visitors karim said you are a fool chapter lake anna virginia rapp walked over to the closest metal desk and picked up a plain manila file being asked to come into the room at this juncture was either a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective rapps guess was that it was a bad sign for adams he punched in the code and opened the door maslick was right behind him adams was seated where rapp had left him and despite looking tired he still managed a smug look of defiance glen here thinks youre the problem hurley announced really thats right he doesnt want to talk about what he was doing last night hurley rolled his eyes turning to maslick he said grab the cart maslick wheeled a threelevel cart into the room and left it in the corner then dragging the table away from adams he pointed at the nearest chair and said sit listen adams said while holding his hands up in an affable manner i dont know who you are and i dont have to know who you are but trust me when i say you dont want to be involved in this rapp stood in the doorway his hands on his hips a determined expression on his face youre wasting your breath glen hed just as soon kill you but hes a good soldier so hell wait until i tell him in the meantime sit down and do what youre told adams hesitated so maslick helped him back into his chair then the big man grabbed some flex cuffs from one of the cargo pockets on his khaki pants adams complained while his wrists were pulled behind the back of the chair and bound next came his ankles to each of the chairs front legs rapp wheeled the cart over on the top sat a polygraph machine hurley stood in front of adams and asked glen since youre so smart im wondering if you could tell me what makes a guy like mitch here get out of bed and bust his ass for people like you i dont pretend to know the criminal mind but if i had to guess i would say its a perverse thrill that he derives out of inflicting pain on others thats the best you can do hurley asked no other reasons none well i trained him you dumb ass if i thought for a moment that he was some sadistic brute who was two ticks away from being a career criminal id a bounced his ass right out of the program and trust me i know the difference because i got rid of plenty of them over the years the only thing that a guy like mitch gets out of climbing down in the gutter with these religious nut jobs is the knowledge that he is fighting the good fight that hes doing the honorable thing while all the overeducated assholes like you sit in your nice leather chairs and criticize his every move and you would have me what let him defy the rule of law let him kill whoever his peasized brain thinks deserves killing no but at a bare minimum i expect you to resist the urge to delude yourself into thinking our enemies would like us if only we were nicer to them adams exhaled a tired sigh as if to say they were wasting his time do you want to wait until the poly is hooked up so youre sure im giving you the right answer were not going to bother with the poly hurley said half laughing any clandestine officer with half a brain knows how to fool that thing rapp stepped forward grabbed adamss shirt and tore it open normally id try to stay detached while interrogating someone but this is going to be tough you are making a huge mistake adams warned the only mistake ive made in the last twentyfour hours was not killing you sooner adams laughed nervously i know all about your methods as usual i think youre talking out of your ass youre going to scream at me youll keep me up for seventytwo hours youll raise and lower the temperature in this room youll probably give me more vodka he shook his head and added in the end youll learn nothing and youll have to let me go after that i will march straight into the attorney generals office and demand that you be brought up on kidnapping charges and thats just for starters so if the three of you can scrape together enough brain cells to see that the only rational course is to let me go while im still in the mood to forgive this lack of judgment you might be able to avoid some serious jail time theres one big problem with your plan hurley said as he leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette when were done wringing the truth out of you im going shoot you in the head with this hurley pulled back his jacket and drew a pistol from a shoulder harness adams was suddenly transfixed by the gun its a kimber stainless gold match two caliber pistol finest production pistol in the world adams blew off the threat as theatrics you wouldnt dare the intelligence committees the doj the fbi they all know im close to exposing this cancer in the clandestine service they know im on to rapp and if i turn up dead theyll be all over you guys who said youre going to turn up dead hurley looked at rapp and said show him the file rapp held a photograph in front of adams we got this off the surveillance cameras at jfk it was taken last night does the guy in the bottom right corner look familiar adams studied the grainy blackandwhite surveillance photo and after a second saw the mirror image of himself heres the flight manifest rapp placed another sheet in front of him with adamss name highlighted in yellow your flight will land in caracas in one hour you will be seen leaving the airport and then you will simply vanish adams swallowed hard feeling real nerves for the first time his mind scrambled to find a way out you dont think ive taken precautions you mean like the safety deposit box you have at the first bank of bethesda rapp asked and the used dell laptop you have stashed behind the workbench in your garage hurley added the one youre using to write your book he took a big puff from his cigarette and then pointed the hot end at adams you have a lot of problems glen chief among them is the fact that youre insecure its not unusual in fact most of the assholes ive come across suffer from the same affliction its the reason you could never cut it in this line of work not because youre not smart enoughyoure far from retarded the problem is when youre as insecure as you are the only way you can make yourself feel good is to convince yourself that your enemies are stupid and in this line of work you can never underestimate your enemies itll never work adams forced a smile onto his face and some confidence into his voice there are too many people in washington who know i was about to blow this thing open rapp could see he was going to have to jumpstart things if he was going to make it back to langley by nine he held up his right hand and said you see this rapp watched adamss eyes zero in on his right hand and then with his left hand he unleashed an openhanded slap that cracked adams flush across the face adams yelped like a wounded pup and then in a panicked voice yelled thats it youve crossed the line i am going to make sure you spend the rest of your days in a jail cell im going to he never finished the threat because rapp whacked him again this time with his right hand he then grabbed him by his thin silver hair and forced him to look at the sheaf of documents in his left hand do you think those defenders of yours know youve been going through two bottles of vodka and another six to eight bottles of wine a week thats a lie its the truth youre a frickin drunk we have your bank statements credit card receipts atm withdrawals we even have video of you buying booze at three different liquor stores and theyre the only three we checked we found vodka in your trunk your desk drawer we even have video of you stopping at a park to dump your extra bottles marty and mary are out of the house hurley chimed in mentioning adamss two children off to college and calling home once every couple weeks you and gretchen dont even sleep in the same room anymore hell weve had your house bugged for a week you dont even talk youre the classic bitter narcissist whos pissed at the world because everyone has failed to recognize his genius the biggest laugh of all is that we dont even have to plant evidence its all right there for them to see and trust me theyll find it your wife your kids your friends theyre all going to get put through the wringer the curtains going to get pulled back rapp said in a dire tone you really want your kids to find out their old man is just a bitter alcoholic a failed fucking bureaucrat who committed treason it wont work adams said with sweat cascading down his forehead kenny urness will know you guys killed me and hes not the only one they wont rest until youre brought to justice who hurley growled other than some fucking looney antiamerican ciahating scumbag is going to a care that youve disappeared and b spend the next five years of his life trying to find out what really happened you have no idea how powerful my contacts are really hurley said skeptically is that why you had to fly up to new york and meet with an ambulance chaser last night so you could hatch a plot to write a tellall book and line your pockets thats not why i went to new york almost two hundred of your countrymen were killed last week and youre out trying to get rich off it thats a lie and you know it adams spat you two are the problem not me you are why they hate us not me hurley smacked him across the head and yelled youre a fucking embarrassment to your family adams felt his options slipping away felt really for the first time that they might actually kill him you dont know kenny urness if you think hell just drop this whole thing when i dont show up for work what kenny urness saw last night was a drunk rapp said in a flat voice a delusional drunk and when he finds out that you flew to south america and disappeared he wont waste more than two minutes trying to figure out if its true and if he comes after us hurley said tough shit he can look all he wants weve been through your shit if you had any real evidence you would have already taken it to the feds thats not true adams pleaded hurley stepped forward and extended the big caliber pistol any last words before i blow your head off with tearfilled eyes adams shook his head and cried you cant do this uncle stan you and my father were best friends i can and i will but my father you were a disgrace to your father hurley growled you broke his heart but i didnt know adams pleaded tears now rolling down his cheeks you didnt know because youre a narcissistic fuck the only person youve ever cared about is yourself thats not true adams half yelled i have sacrificed i have done what i thought was right well you were wrong hurley placed the muzzle of the pistol against adamss forehead and squeezed the trigger chapter the report of the big kimber was deafening rapp didnt have time to cover his ears hed barely had enough time to grab hurleys wrist and deflect the shot just barely as was evidenced by the red powder burn that was now painted in a cone shape across the top of adamss forehead the slug was now lodged in the concrete wall beyond adamss head a crater the size of a fist marked the spot rapp couldnt hear a thing but he could see just fine hurley was screaming at him and adams was sobbinghis eyes closed his head down his chin bouncing off his chest every few seconds as he gasped for air snot pouring out of his nose hurley pointed his kimber at rapp and began to use it to punctuate whatever point he was trying to make rapp none too fond of having a gun pointed at him almost snapped the older mans wrist but caught himself in time he slowly brought his hand up and gently moved the muzzle of the gun to a less threatening direction after pointing at his left ear rapp mouthed that he couldnt hear what hurley was saying he walked over to the door and gestured for hurley to follow him rapp hit the intercom button and asked for the door to be opened as he stepped into the outer room he found nash lewis and maslick all standing there with shocked expressions on their faces rapp placed both palms over his ears and pressed down for a good five seconds while he swallowed several times and flexed his jaw the first words he began to recognize belonged to hurley he was still cursing up a storm rapp looked at him still waving his gun around and yelled put that damn thing away before you shoot someone hurley pointed the gun at rapp again and barked someone youre the only one im thinking about shooting rapps entire posture was instantly transformed like a big black panther who had been stirred from a lazy nap his muscles flexed and his weight was transferred onto the balls of his feet his eyes narrowed and his brow furrowed and he half shouted stan put that gun away right now or ill break your wrist hurley having trained rapp knew not only that he meant it but that there was a good chance that at this close distance rapp could do it before he got off a shot slowly and with a nottoohappy look he shouldered his pistol and asked why in the hell did you stop me the answer was complicated although there was one really good reason and several decent ones rapp decided to go with the big one the one they all should have thought of to begin with where in the hell is he getting his information weve already gone over that hurley said in an irritated voice hes filling in the gaps if he had anything real he would have taken it to the justice department rapp shook his head he still had to start somewhere someone is talking to him hes the gestapo weve already found dozens of bugs he has half the offices on the seventh floor wired the inspector generals office at langley was often called the gestapo by the frontline troops at langley this was exactly what rapp had fearedthat they would let their dislike of adams cloud their judgment he took a deep breath and asked whats our rush you know as well as i do you cant let shit like this fester the best can lose their courage and besides we have bigger fish to fry and we also have one shot at finding out what he knows weve gone over this hurley snarled we have what we need we kill him and whoever he was talking to wont know if hes dead or if hes disappeared either way the effect is the same we send a clear signal that were done fucking around by we nash jumped in i assume you mean the royal we because no one knows youre involved in this mitch and i are the two guys with the targets on our backs why you little hurley reached for his gun rapp stepped forward and grabbed hurleys wrist he looked at nash and his bloodshot tired eyes and instantly knew he was strung out hell they were all strung out sleep was a luxury they had experienced far too little of in the past week head up to the house rapp said to nash and get cleaned up we need to be on the road in less than thirty minutes but i dont i dont give a shit what you think rapp barked its an order stans right this isnt a frickin book club now get your ass up to the house and get cleaned up it was obvious by the constipated look on his face that nash wanted to say something but he managed to keep his mouth shut and head for the door after he left rapp turned his attention back to the group and said something doc said earlier got me thinking rapp looked at lewis you said hed never commit suicide i said it was highly unlikely good enough so his desire for selfpreservation is pretty high absolutely looking back at hurley rapp said i think we can turn him and i think youre nuts doc tell him why we cant once we turn him loose lewis said and he feels safe he will turn on you what if he never truly feels safe i could check in on him from time to time and remind him that im looking over his shoulder and why take the chance hurley asked because he might be useful doc hurley said as if he wanted him to explain the obvious to rapp its risky mitch with someone like this there is never any real loyalty what if we coopt him maslick suggested they all turned a bit shocked and looked at the linebacker of a man who was known for his quiet demeanor what exactly do you mean lewis asked what if we get him to take ownership maslick asked in a soft voice get him to help us out looking directly at hurley he said like flipping a foreign agent youve said so yourself many times stan all you need is a little money a little time and a cause worth fighting for chapter if the words had come from anyone else rapp felt confident that they would have elicited a rather strong response from hurley but theyd come from the gentle giant so the old spymaster stood there and quietly chewed on them rapp took the time to figure out his next move as he did so he saw the tension leave the old man and it occurred to him there was a heavy emotional toll attached to this untidy situation no matter how tough he was there was no accounting for the burden of almost killing your best friends son a boy you had cradled in your arms as an infant and bounced on your knee as a toddler hurley hobbled over to the closest desk and sat on the edge rapp looked at lewis who was watching the old man with legitimate concern thinking the silence was only making things worse rapp said stan this could work you may have just scared him straight that is a valid point lewis added he expected you to save him from mitch not the other way around and that was a pretty close call i doubt you could have faked it any better i wanna go back in there and throw him a life line rapp said doc lewis shrugged you know the routine to start dont ask him anything you dont already know the answer to and dont try to turn him hurley offered in a detached voice hed swiveled the monitor on the desk around so he could look at adams faint sobs could be heard on the small desktop speakers that comes later after hes proven he really wants it go ahead and hold out a glimmer of hope but thats it understood rapp nodded he grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and a bottle of vodka and a glass buzz me if anything comes to mind rapp knew all he had was twenty minutes but he was probably never going to get another shot at adams when hed be this fragile rapp punched in the code and opened the door there adams sat with his crimson forehead peppered with a hundred little droplets of blood from the muzzle blast his eyes closed and his chin down his pants were damp and there was a puddle of urine at his feet hurley was right about one thingthis was a nasty business and it was easy to lose your nerve if you didnt operate under tight constraints put a bullet in a guys head dispose of the body and move on no sense slowing down to peruse the carnage and dont bother to look in the rearview mirror either you start doing stuff like that and youre inviting trouble even so rapp saw an opportunity it wouldnt be long before people began to wonder where adams had gone the office didnt expect him back until this afternoon and unless theyd missed something he had no breakfast meetings in new york his staff would probably start to get nervous around midafternoon theyd try his cell phone and get nothing then theyd try the house and if they got hold of his wife shed tell them she had not spoken to him and while that might be strange for some couples it was not strange for them the staff would alert the appropriate people at langley who would more than likely sit on it overnight but if he didnt show up for work the next morning the feds would be brought in and not long after that they would discover he had left the country rapp had no illusions that he could roll adams and have him back at the office by tomorrow morning that simply was not going to happen but there was another optionone that would buy them more than enough time with one hand rapp dragged the table back over and placed it in front of adams he set the water bottle vodka and glass down on the table and then withdrew a small tactical knife from his belt he then walked behind adams cut the flex ties from his wrists and said i think you probably need a drink rapp circled back around the room and stood facing adams he wanted to have a good view of what would happen next adams slowly lifted his head and looked at the objects sitting on the table he hesitated and then reached out his right hand went straight for the bottle of vodka which rapp had expected adams clutched the bottle and spun the silver cap off not caring that it fell to the floor with a shaky hand he clanged the neck of the bottle against the rim of the glass and let the clear alcohol come splashing out a good portion missing the glass adams set the bottle down and drew the glass to his lips downing about three ounces of vodka in two gulps for a moment he looked as if he was going to pour another glass but instead he started to shake uncontrollably and then he was sobbing again his head on the table cradled in his arms rapp could only make out every fifth word or so it was a complete meltdown hed seen it before and knew there was no stopping it short of smacking him but that would be a mistake the die had been cast five minutes earlier and rapp was now going to have to play the good cop after a few minutes the sobs softened and the breathing stabilized eventually adams looked up at him with pleading eyes and spoke why it was a pretty openended question so rapp said nothing he just stood there and stared back at adamss puffy bloodshot eyes the guy was a mess i dont understand adams sniffled ive lived an honorable life i dont deserve this rapp wanted to refute the comment but managed to stop himself playing good cop didnt come easy to him his instinct was to smack the fool across the head a few times and make it really clear if he didnt do everything he was told hed get hurley back in the room and have him finish the job instead he sighed and said glen a lot of people have lost their bearings during this mess not me i know you think youve done the right thing rapp said carefully but you havent youve been suckered into this partisan game that everyone wants to play in washington republican versus democrat liberal versus conservative none of that matters at langley the only thing were supposed to concern ourselves with is national security thats our mission and the day the aclu starts driving our national security policy is the day america is really fucked but you guys dont see what youre doing adams pleaded we are becoming the very monsters we are trying to defeat rapp had heard this bullshit line too many times give me one example adams held out his hands and looked around the room what would you call this rapp laughed and said if you worked for al qaeda and they caught you divulging their secrets to the media they wouldnt simply kill you theyd kill your wife and kids and make you watch and then if you were lucky they would put you out of your misery quickly but they probably wouldnt theyd toy with you for months and use you as an example to anyone else who was less than resolute in his faith were not them i was left with no other options i couldnt just sit there and watch you guys operate with such reckless disregard for the law really rapp looked at the door again maybe i made a mistake youre damn right you did you should have never brought me here adams grabbed the bottle of vodka im talking about stopping him from blowing your head all over that wall adams looked up while he was pouring another drink i am not the enemy actually you are glen and if you cant see that youve fucked up theres no hope of saving you stan would just as soon tear your head off and piss down your throat he despises you he sees you as the bright shining example of how the baby boomers have fucked up this country thats a good one adams sneered coming from the most racist bigoted generation this country has ever seen he took another drink you can bring it up with stan rapp checked his watch i have to get back to langley for a meeting he took a step toward the door and stopped i thought you might be worth saving but i guess i was wrong wait adams said desperately you cant leave me here with him whys that because hell kill me adams yelled and how would that affect me it would adamss eyes darted around the room as his brain tried to come up with something it would make you an accessory to murder youre kidding right thats the best you can come up with i have powerful allies adams warned rapp rubbed his forehead and decided to write off the mans lame excuses to the vodka glen i dont think youre a bad person i just think youre confused youve gotten yourself wrapped up in the legal aspect of this youre focused on percent of the issue and youre ignoring the other percent youve lost all sense of proportion and if you cant open your eyes to that there is nothing i can do to help you i have done nothing wrong last chance glen im going to walk out this door and stans going to come back in here and blow your head off then theyll cut you up into six pieces and incinerate you limb by limb by lunch the only sign that you ever existed will be a pile of ash thatll fit into a coffee can by dinner that ash will be spread far and wide all evidence destroyed the only thing the feds will have to go on is the fact that you left the country that and the fact that youre a drunk theyll look for a few weeks and then theyll write your ass off adams shook his head defiantly they will know something is wrong and they wont stop until they get to the bottom of it rapp shrugged as if hed given it his best shot i wish i could say it was nice knowing you glen but id be lying youre a selfserving prick and you wont be missed not even by your own family rapp hit the intercom button im done in here hes all yours chapter toolesboro iowa hakim learned to play chess when he was seven years old his grandfather had taught him the game and for the next six years until the kind old man died they played every week one of the first things his grandfather had taught him was that a chess match was often decided because of one bad move a move that once made set the game on an almost certain path and in chess as in life a move like that could never be taken back so the moral of the story according to his grandfather was to think long and hard before deciding something difficult look at it from every angle see what you see and then ask yourself if theres something you cant see hakim didnt know if it was all that chess or a godgiven abundance of common sense combined with an easy attitude but whatever it was he had been able to avoid a lot of trouble over the years by staying patient and making prudent decisions the same could not be said for karim his daring brash behavior had led him to great success on the battlefield in afghanistan and his plan to attack america despite his own criticism had been a huge success in the more subtle arena of daily life though his ability to pick up on the moods and currents of a foreign land was almost nonexistent the gun came up and before hakim could react it was fired it was as if the entire thing painfully played out before him in slow motion the father went down with a wound to the gut and the kid turned in panic and began to run he made it three steps and then collapsed with a bullet to the lower back karim lowered his weapon and turned to hakim now lets find out why they were really here he walked down the porch steps and onto the gravel with the loud cracks of the mm pistol still echoing down the river valley hakims brain took off headlong in an attempt to assess the damage in the first millisecond he knew it was bad extremely bad he had had the situation under control and then karims massive paranoid ego led him to step in when there was so clearly no need for him to do so it was as if all the frustrations of the last week came pouring out at once he followed his friend down the steps and said i already know why they are here you idiot karim spun to face his friend what did you just call me i called you an idiot an unbelievable idiot you will show me the proper respect karim commanded or you will be punished id like to see you try hakim took a step toward his old friend and pushed his sleeves up do you have any idea what you have done an incredulous look on his face karim answered i stopped these two men from walking away and telling the authorities that we are here i did what you should have done should have done you are an utter fool you have ruined everything and for nothing these two werent going to tell anyone anything other than what i told them they were going to go hunt down by the river and leave us alone hakim looked at the father and son both of them were writhing on the ground in pain now what the hell were they going to do with them they believed me you arrogant ass you are the fool karim spat back they only acted like they believed you they are probably police you have never been to this country before you have no idea how to read these people they are not police hakim motioned at the house the barn and the surrounding land where are we to go karim was obviously irritated by the question well if they are hunters as you say we will bury the bodies and be done with them and when they dont make it home for dinner tonight and the wife calls the police and tells them they were coming out here to hunt what do we do then because the police will come and look for them karim saw that the boy had pulled a cell phone from his jacket and was trying to make a call he raised his gun took aim and squeezed the trigger the orange hat flew off the boys head in a puff of dust and his foot twitched a few times before he went completely still looking back at hakim as if nothing had happened he said then we will have to leave the father howled in agony and started to frantically crawl toward his son hakim was sickened by the entire scene none of it had to happen these two men had done nothing wrong i explained to you what would happen if we had to leave i told you in detail that our best chance for survival was to stay here for at least a month to wait them out then we would be able to slip out of the country i am sick of your complaining karim announced i question your devotion and i question your devotion you are a coward no different than the rest of the lazy rich men who claim to lead us genuine anger flashed across karims face how dare you question me i am not one of your brainwashed robots i have known you for too long if you were a real warrior you would have gone into that building with your men and martyred yourself but you are too obsessed with your own fame the lion of al qaeda ha hakim spoke in reference to the name that karim had given himself in the videos he released after the attacks you should be called the coward of al qaeda he looked back to the father who had reached his son and was sobbing uncontrollably karim could not take another word the insolence of his friend should have been checked a long time ago prove to me that you are not a coward kill the father now i order you karim tossed his gun to his friend the gun sailed through the air but hakim made no effort to catch it the gun landed at his feet and skidded a few inches along the gravel hakim looked down at the gun and shook his head there is no honor in this no bravery in killing an unarmed father and son who have done nothing to offend you or allah i order you we are the infidels in this land this is wrong if you want him dead then you should finish what you started for the last time i order you to pick up the gun and shoot the father i dont take orders from you hakim said with a derisive scowl yes you do hakim turned and started back for the house do not turn your back on me karim yelled but hakim paid him no attention karim had finally had enough he broke into a run and caught his friend just as he reached the steps he delivered a quick rabbit punch to hakims kidney and then kicked through the back of his right knee collapsing him to the ground karim then grabbed him by the shirt threw him onto his back and dropped on top of him delivering a flurry of punches to his friends face this he said in between his third and fourth punches is a lesson i should have taught you a long time ago chapter lake anna virginia adams pleaded then cried and in between the sniffles and tears he began mumbling to himself the door buzzed and rapp opened it to find hurley standing on the other side looking none too pleased that he was going to have to shoot his best friends son in the head for the second time i should have never stopped you rapp said in an apologetic tone damn right you shouldnt have hurley pushed past him his cane in one hand and his gun in the other adams snapped out of his mumbling trance and began screaming for rapp to stop upon seeing hurley and the gun he tried to stand and forgetting that his ankles were still tied to the chair toppled over he caught the edge of the table and brought it down with him sending the glass and bottle of vodka crashing to the floor at the same time hurley moved into position over him and took aim dont shoot adams screamed mitch wait i know things i can help rapp shared a quick look with hurley as he walked back to adams he squatted and said you get one shot at this glen tell me something worth knowing and it better be good adams was lying on his side the toppled chair still attached to his legs he looked at the puddle of urine and then at rapp help me up first fuck you hurley growled as he jabbed the gun into adamss face rapp stood and again started for the door adams began screaming frantically for him to stop and hurley let loose a litany of profanity that described in very colorful terms exactly what he thought of adams to further punctuate each word he stabbed his gun closer and closer to adamss face until he had it pressed into his temple rapp was halfway out the door when he heard a name it was repeated three times in quick succession rapp stopped his interest finally piqued and turned what did you say kathy obrien adams said with his face pressed into the floor rapps eyes narrowed he wasnt sure exactly what he had expected to get out of adams but the name kathy obrien wasnt anywhere on the horizon she was the wife of chuck obrien the director of the cias national clandestine service what about her rapp asked cautiously thats how i knew about the operation you were running one of the keys to a successful interrogation at least early on was to keep the subject off balance no matter how shocking or strange a piece of information might be you never let it show which operation rapp asked would that be the mosques go on rapp ordered the undercover guys you sent into the mosques rapp walked back and looked down at adams you mean the operation that was leaked to the post last week yeah yeah thats the one the story you leaked you mean rapp asked adams didnt answer fast enough so hurley gave him a little love tap with the tip of the barreljust hard enough to draw a drop of blood yes adams screamed yes i was the one who told barreiro the leak rapp said that ended up getting one of my agents killed i i i adams stammered wouldnt know anything about that rapp glanced at his watch he might have to be late for the meeting and just what does kathy obrien have to do with this shes how i found out you already said that i want specifics rapp saw adamss eyes begin to dart around again which was a sign that his brain was scrambling to find the right lie dont do it do what lie to me im not i mean i wasnt going to anything you say to me ill have verified within the hour and if i find out youve lied to me well lets just say im going keep you alive as long as it takes to make you feel some real pain she adamss eyes started darting again until suddenly a knife tip appeared an inch in front of the left one rapp held the blade perfectly still i can tell when a man is lying to me so one more time what does kathy have to do with this adams closed his eyes and said shes been seeing a therapist and we had the office bugged with great effort to conceal his surprise rapp asked the therapists office yes rapps mind was flooded with a halfdozen questions but for now he needed to keep adams focused on the most immediate facts they could squeeze the rest out of him later so if i call my source at justice shell tell me that you had warrants to wiretap the therapists office adams took a long time to answer which in itself was an answer rapp cocked his head to the side you didnt have a warrant not exactly adams admitted rapp pulled the knife back and shared a quick look with hurley things suddenly began to fall into place for rapp why adams knew the broad brushstrokes of what they had been up to but could not pass the threshold needed to refer a case to justice you wiretapped the office of a doctor and recorded the private therapy sessions of the wife of the director of the national clandestine service and you did it illegally i was only trying to do my job and you lecture me about breaking the fucking law rapp snapped i was just trying to stop you you were out of control out of control i break those laws to keep people safe real people you break em to protect some piece of paper you dont even understand i am trying to protect the world from animals like you rapp stuck the tip of the knife into adamss left nostril and said i should mitch dr lewis announced from the door id like to have a word with you and stan rapp resisted the urge to slice the traitors nose clean off his face they had a standard policy during interrogations that whenever lewis asked anyone for a private word they were to drop everything and leave the room rapp stood and left the cell with hurley they closed the door and found lewis pacing nervously nash was back from the house shaved and in a dark blue suit while maslick was sitting behind the desk keeping an eye on the monitors lewis held up a couple of fingers and said two things the first i dont think you can ever allow him to go free there is a chance that his illegalities were driven by a lack of judgment precipitated by the onset of alcoholism but i think the odds of it are small its more likely that in addition to suffering from narcissistic personality disorder he is also a sociopath and this changes things how he uses rules as a weapon he gets extremely upset when he thinks anyone has acted inappropriately or has broken the law yet he sees nothing wrong when he decides to break those very same laws im not even sure hes aware of it hes so narcissistic so in love with himself that he thinks hes privileged rules are for the commoner not someone like him who is destined to make a difference in the world i could have told you that hurley said and i didnt even go to med school lewis ignored hurley and said the narcissistic sociopathic combination is extremely dangerous almost impossible to treat and never in a situation with this much pressure he will say and do whatever he needs to stay alive and then after you let him go the first chance he gets he will bolt he would turn to anyone who he thought had the power to take you down your second point rapp asked normally i would never admit this but considering the situation i think it would be best lewis hesitated wrestling with how best to word his admission doc rapp said i dont have all day spit it out lewis cleared his throat and nervously announced i am kathy obriens therapist chapter rapp was out of time if he and nash were to have any chance of making the powwow at langley they had to be on the road in the next few minutes and even then they would have to drive at least eighty miles an hour to give themselves a chance normally rapp didnt concern himself with getting to meetings on time but this was not your average runofthemill bureaucratic black hole of a meeting kennedy had made it very clear the president had requested the presence of both her senior counterterrorism operatives and while rapp really didnt care much for politicians hed dealt with a few presidents over his career and found them tolerable in the sense that they understood it wasnt a bad idea to have a man like rapp around to deal with some of the stickier situations that popped up mike and i have to go rapp looked at hurley and said i wanna know who he used to bug docs office i wanna know where the originals are and i wanna know how many copies he made and i want to move on this asap my moneys on max johnson hurley said yeah rapp replied he was thinking the same thing max johnson had been the second in charge of security at langley until he retired a few years earlier he now had his own consulting firm which coincidentally did a lot of work for langley rapp didnt know him personally but had heard a few things over the years that would lead him to believe the guy would have no problem stooping this low i want a list of everybody adams has talked to about kathy obrien i want those tapes handed over to me immediately so i can destroy them lewis said doc i dont like this any more than you do but someone is going to have to listen to those tapes rapp thought of chuck obrien it would kill him to know that kathys private sessions with her therapist had been recorded i think you can trust me mitch it has nothing to do with trust rapp said impatiently i need to listen to them so i can assess the damage i dont think kathy would approve lewis shook his head and added and i dont think chuck will be too pleased either nash entered the fray well maybe he should have thought about that before he started sharing classified information with his wife she worked in ops for twentythree years lewis said defensively her record is unassailable looking back to rapp he said in a very forceful manner i want the tapes they are private and they belong to me it aint going to happen doc hurley said matteroffactly kathy was read in on a lot of serious shit but that doesnt give charlie the right to start sharing stuff with her and it sure as hell doesnt give her the right to spill her guts to you thats why we have these rules but i think we can all agree that you trust me lewis looked around the room i mean lets get real what we have going on here is far more serious than anything that might be on those tapes rapp was about to speak but hurley beat him to it doc your office isnt secure fuck the russkies the chicoms anyone could have the place bugged in fact i bet mossad has had it bugged for years hurley looked at rapp you better send a team in there tonight and have them give it the onceover rapp was nodding as hurley spoke i was thinking the same thing ill make it a priority i need to be there hurley said in a voice that made it clear this point was nonnegotiable fine rapp said knowing he was out of time as far as the rest of this goes well have to sort it out later mike and i have to go in the meantime start to peel him open i want you to wring him dry i dont think it will be a problem said lewis but i would discourage ever releasing him he would betray us the first chance he got i agree hurley said rapp simply shrugged and said i dont give a shit it might be useful however for us to make him think we are trying to turn him someone with an ego this fragile needs to have a carrot constantly dangled in front of him along those lines i think we should have him write a note to kennedy and his wife saying that he has checked himself into a rehab clinic its something he needs to do has been thinking about for some time only way to do it was to go cold turkey before he lost the courage the important thing is to give him some hope fine rapp said and if he proves uncooperative hurley asked rapp shrugged do whatever it takes and chuck lewis asked rapp thought about chuck obrien the current director of the national clandestine service what about him he knows kathy was seeing me whos going to tell him that our sessions were recorded that was one conversation rapp did not want to have he could only imagine what had been discussed in those sessions theyd been married for over thirty years if max johnson were in fact the guy who had bugged the office chuck would want to kill him and while rapp wouldnt raise a hand to stop him he at least needed to talk to johnson first i dont want anyone saying anything to chuck until we know who made the recordings and ive had a chance to talk to them when the time is right hurley announced ill do it are you sure rapp asked it would kill him to hear it from you young pups hes still your boss ill handle it all right its settled looking to nash rapp said lets go mitch rapp turned and looked at maslick who was now standing yeah i want you to promise me something rapp got an ominous feeling what when its time to punch his ticket maslick nodded toward the cell door ive got dibs rapp understood immediately chris johnson rapps agent who had been killed a week earlier had been maslicks best friend theyd served in the st airborne division and had done three combat tours together if it comes to that and you still want to do it i wont stand in your way chapter langley virginia rapp blew past the georgetown pike exit at eightyplus miles an hour and continued north on the beltway as expected traffic had been rough rapp had hoped to catch a little sleep on the drive up but had given up on the idea as soon as hed found out where adams was getting his information rapp would never go as far as to say it didnt bother him that the cias inspector general was a colossal hypocrite it surely did but it was pretty small stuff compared to the other glitch they had just uncovered kathy obrien was not the only client of dr lewis who had ties to langley rapp didnt know specifics because lewis never talked about his clients and the cia wasnt the kind of place where people ran around talking about their feelings let alone divulging that they were seeing a shrink but it was known among the professionals that lewis was a man you could trust if you needed a little help getting your head screwed back on rapp wasnt sure but he got the distinct impression cia director kennedy had spent some time on lewiss couch trying to sort through some of her personal issues rapp knew this because kennedy herself had tried to get rapp to sit down and talk with lewis after his wife had been killed even with the nearcrippling pain he was experiencing after annas death rapp never considered consulting lewis he wasnt wired that way rapp knew he had to work his way through it on his own he had nothing against therapy he was sure that there were plenty of good docs out there who could help people get through a rough patch and while he would never deny that he had a lot of issues they werent exactly the kind of things he could share doctorpatient privilege was a nice legal protection for the average person who might someday end up in a courtroom but intelligence agencies were instituted to not play by the rules bugging offices and eavesdropping on important conversations were standard operating procedure i cant believe were going to be late nash said in a tired voice rapp looked over at his friend who was cleanshaven and dressed in a crisp white shirt blue suit and yellow tie rapp glanced at his own reflection in the mirror he had thick black stubble on his tan face and was not wearing a tie if he had had time he probably would have shaved but not necessarily this was not his first meeting with this president or the previous one but it occurred to him this was probably nashs first dance he glanced at the clock it was three minutes past nine and they were still a few miles out rapp hit the blinker cut across two lanes of traffic and took the george washington parkway exit without slowing down by the time they cleared security and parked theyd be about ten minutes late and while rapp didnt like to keep the president of the united states waiting he knew from experience that presidents werent exactly the most punctual people staring out the side window at the passing trees nash asked what in the hell are we doing rapp merged onto the parkway and said youre going to have to be a bit more specific sport this nash made groping gestures with his hands this crap last night and this morning after glancing at him rapp returned his attention to the road they were percent sure the car was clean but they had their work phones on them and although they were encrypted the technology existed for an outfit like the national security agency to turn the phones into listening devices rapp chose his words carefully maybe we can carve out a little time this afternoon to talk about it nash wasnt so easily deterred i didnt sign up for this under his breath he mumbled im not a coldblooded killer rapp thought hed heard him but wasnt sure what was that you heard me nash said its hard to understand someone when hes slouched over like a teenager and mumbling to himself i said nash spoke with exaggerated clarity that im not a coldblooded killer thats interesting because id swear i saw you pop a few guys when we were over in the kush rapp was referring to the operations theyd run in afghanistan thats different how so they were the enemy and what would you call this guy our ally how about a fellow american rapp sighed he did not want to talk about this right now but he needed to figure out what in the hell was wrong with nash and he had to do it before he put him in the same room as the president and god only knew who else threats both foreign and domestic rapp said quoting the oath theyd both taken everyone likes to forget about the domestic part just because youre an american doesnt automatically make you one of the good guys well just because he disagrees with us doesnt make him an enemy so he can break whatever law he wants were not exactly angels rapps patience was fading i think youre tired this conversation is over nash chuckled and said this has nothing to do with me being tired and everything to do with the fact that you dont want to face the truth mike ive been doing this shit since i was twentytwo ive been accused of a lot of things but sticking my head in the sand is not one of them well theres a first time for everything is this how you ran your command in corps was it a debate club dont compare this to the corps i would have never considered kidnapping a fellow marine rapp had heard about enough he didnt like the fact that they were veering into specifics he glanced over at nashs bloodshot eyes shook his head and said i dont think youre going to attend this meeting i dont think thats your decision to make the hell it isnt nash scoffed oh youre never the problem not mitch rapp its always someone elses fault you wanna write my attitude off to a lack of sleep but its a lot more complicated than that i can tell you right now being tired has nothing to do with it what were doing back there to one of our own its just wrong rapp checked his rearview mirror and then yanked the steering wheel to the right the car moved onto the shoulder what are you doing pulling over we dont have time nash said with alarm were late well you should have thought of that before you decided you wanted to have a bitch session rapp brought the black charger to a sudden stop and threw the gearshift into park as he unbuckled his seat belt he said leave your phone in the car rapp checked the mirror waited for a car to whiz by and then got out and circled around the trunk he had a caliber glock on his left hip in a paddle holster and as he stepped onto the grass he rested his left hand on the butt of the weapon nash reluctantly got out of the vehicle and said come on mitch this is bullshit what would be bullshit would be putting you in front of the president and whoever else hes bringing to this meeting im not the problem here mitch nash pointed at himself and then turning his finger on rapp added i think you need to take a long hard look at yourself you are so fucking out of line right now i dont even know where to begin why because i have a conscience unlike you and stan who pretty much do whatever the hell you want whenever you want to whoever you want youre cracking up major rapp said using nashs marine corps rank combat fatigue you havent slept you look like shit and youve lost all discipline discipline nash spat the word back at rapp coming from you thats just ripe your entire career has been one insubordinate move after another you used to talk to your battalion commander like this stop with the marine corps analogies all right this is nothing like the corps rapp took in a deep breath what little patience he had was gone im giving you two options you either take two personal days five days i dont care how many days you need to sort this mess out but you take em and dont come back until you get your head screwed back on whats my second choice you resign right now and if i choose neither nash asked with a forced lack of interest then ill fire your ass rapp responded without hesitation this is bullshit im not the one with the problems maybe you should be the one taking a few days off rapp was on the verge of snapping hed seen this type of behavior before perfectly healthy guys who succumb to the stress of a job that can grind up and spit out the most hardened warrior hurley had warned him a week ago that nash had been showing signs of fatigue nashs wife had called hurley and shared some things that she probably should have kept to herself rapp thought of that conversation and asked nash tell me when was the last time you had a hardon nash frowned what the hell are you talking about rapp stared at him you know exactly what im talking about fuck you rapp shook his head you can try to make this about me and what happened down at the lake but you know thats a lie the only reason your plumbing doesnt work when youre thirtyeight is because you got some shit going on in your head nashs face flushed with anger and he took a step toward rapp and clenched his fists dont make this about me i didnt sign up for this shit no one told me id be involved in kidnapping and murder least of all of a fellow american i dont care how much you hate rapp was already alert to the fact that nash might take an illadvised swing at him so when he heard him getting a little too close to divulging what had gone down the night before he took a quick step forward and his left hand shot out like a battering ram the palm strike landed in the center of nashs chest rolling his shoulders forward and nearly breaking his sternum the blow sent nash backpedaling for a few feet and onto his butt rapp closed the distance and remained in a combat stance if youre dumb enough to get up i swear ill put you in the hospital nash was clutching his chest and had the look of a feral animal on his face rapp could tell he was calculating odds youre so damn tired you look like a strungout junkie i dont wanna see your face for at least two days i want you to go home and sleep and spend some time with your family and if after two days you still cant get your emotions under control then i want your resignation and if i dont do what im told nash said clutching his chest what are you going to do kill me hurt my family rapp was in a state of semidisbelief you know damn well id never touch your family im not so sure lets be clear on one thing rapp stepped closer if you break that oath you took i wouldnt dream of hurting your family he lowered his voice and added but i will kill you it wont be easy and itll probably haunt me for the rest of my life but this is bigger than our friendship chapter cia headquarters rapp parked in the underground garage and proceeded to the directors private elevator kennedy had made arrangements for him to use it when he wanted to get into and out of the building without being seen and stopped which was often rapp wasnt a big fan of headquarters and stayed away as much as possible due to the unique nature of his job however he couldnt always pick up the phone and tell kennedy what he was up to they had both been trained by thomas stansfield a world war ii icon to never assume that a secure phone was secure just because a technician announced it was the history of espionage was riddled with stories of great nations assuming their communications were safe only to find out after being trounced by their enemy that they had been compromised there were times however when logistics distance and operational constraints necessitated a phone call the key at that point was to keep things vague but if you were in the process of doing something that might land your hide in jail then youd better sit down and have the talk in person rapp entered the elevator pressed the top button and as the doors began to close he thought of nash decking him hadnt bothered rapp a bit they were not analysts they were frontline operatives who lived in a physical world of sparring and training judo karate wrestling kickboxing they practiced it all rapp himself was a devotee of the gracie style of jujitsu and nash having been a state high school wrestling champ was no pushover rapp knew more tricks and had never been bested by the slightly younger nash but the fact that rapp had been able to knock him on his ass with one welldelivered palm strike said more about nashs mental state than one might imagine if nash ever came to his senses hed probably thank rapp for knocking him on his ass thats the way marines were wired they could get pissed as all hell in the middle of a fight but after things had calmed down they would laugh at their own stupidity they werent the type to be obsessed with the past what was eating away at rapp was the fact that he never saw it coming nash had been his recruit the guy was a natural tough as nails yet relaxed enough that he wouldnt look like a robot the way a lot of the military guys did when they tried to transition into other careers not more than two weeks ago nash would have been the first guy in line to punch adamss ticket and now he was wringing his hands like one of those blowinginthewind politicians on the hill rapp had seen a few guys burn out and crash land their line of work wasnt exactly stressfree more often than not they would bounce back after a little rr but occasionally a guy would end up in a free fall like some druggy whod taken a bad acid trip rapp could only think of one time when that had happened and the guy had to be put down like a rabid dog he didnt even want to think they might end up there with nash rapp knew his wife and kids well nash was a good family man and a friend and unfortunately he also knew too much the elevator stopped and the second the doors opened rapp sensed something was up two of the directors bodyguards were standing post both of her assistants were on the phone and there wasnt a single secret service agent in sight even if the president were running late a couple of the advance guys should already be here keeping an eye on things rapp was about to ask steven one of kennedys personal assistants what was going on when the young man pointed toward the office door and gave rapp the signal to go in rapp banged his fist on it a few times and then entered the corner suite ran from right to left with a sitting area straight ahead then the directors desk and beyond that a large conference table to the right were the directors private bathroom and the door to the deputy directors office instead of the six to eight people rapp expected there were only twohis boss and a man he had never met but knew by reputation he was handsome as hell shortcropped hair that was equal parts black and white and walnutcolored skin that didnt have a blemish or wrinkle rapp had never much cared for the seventh floor at langley in fact he couldnt think of a single time where he had looked forward to making the trip up to the rarified top floor of the old headquarters building it wasnt that he disliked the people irene kennedy was like family and her predecessor thomas stansfield was one of the finest men hed ever known the clandestine guys were all good and the intel people were sharp as hell but this floor more than any other in the business served as a portal to politics and a whole host of issues that had nothing to do with running an effective intelligence agency the man sitting in kennedys office was proof of that gabriel dickerson placed his coffee cup on the saucer that was sitting on the glass table and stood he extended his right hand and with a warm smile said young man it is an honor to finally meet you rapp could not match the sentiment so he simply nodded his first impression was that dickerson was taller than he would have thought especially since he had to be close to eighty rapp was six feet tall and dickerson was every bit that plus a couple of inches the second thing rapp noticed wasnt the least bit surprising dickerson had a smile and charisma that could charm the lollypop out of the sticky mitts of a fiveyearold whether hed been born with all this charisma or had learned it on a usedcar lot rapp didnt know and didnt really care but he knew hed better damn well be careful because gabe dickerson was to politics what rapp was to the intelligence business their tools were different of course but they were both experts at getting things done behind the scenes while rapp dealt with problems in an often unpleasant and violent way dickerson was known to be every bit as ruthless the big difference was that while rapp used his fists and a gun dickerson used his rolodex and a small cadre of litigators publicists and political operatives to destroy his enemies or curry favor for his clients where is mr nash dickerson asked he couldnt make it rapp said as he glanced at kennedy who was still sitting on the couch thats a shame dickerson continued in his deep basso voice i was very much looking forward to meeting both of you i heard about what you did last week and wanted to thank you personally rapps right eyebrow shot up a notch last week the attack on the counterterrorism center i heard if it werent for the quick thinking and heroics of you and mr nash things would have been significantly worse its already starting rapp thought to himself no one in this damn town can keep a secret dont believe everything you hear sir you know how rumors get rolling around here take a little truth exaggerate it to suit your needs and then spin the hell out of it dickerson let loose a deep infectious laugh you have it all figured out you could work for me before rapp knew it he was smiling and he thought to himself damn this guy is good youre a brave man mr rapp charging a group of men like that dickerson shook his head in semidisbelief i dont think too many men could have pulled that off like i said you cant believe everything you hear in this town rapps desire to keep his name out of the press was paramount and a guy like dickerson got a great deal of his power and influence by whispering juicy secrets in peoples ears i didnt hear anything dickerson said in defense i read it in the fbis official report six terrorists entered the operations center in a singlefile line and began systematically executing personnel mr nash engaged the terrorists from a balcony that overlooks the ops center striking the first man in the line once in the helmet and three more times in the side all caliber rounds you then proceeded to charge the line of men while mr nash kept the first man distracted you shot the second man in the throat the third man in the nose the fourth man twice in the neck the fifth man once in the face and then the last man twice in the small of his back all with a mm glock then you discovered they were all wearing suicide vests and you had the presence of mind not to flee dickerson shook his head in a manner that said this was the part that most impressed him you and mr nash with the aid of several agents then proceeded to throw all six terrorists out a window where they landed at the base of the concrete ramp that led to the underground parking structure each vest then exploded and caused severe damage to the parking garage but not another person was lost it had all gone down pretty fast but from what rapp could recall the man had pretty much nailed the high points dickerson continued now theres a fair number of people who would consider what you did to be either stupid or crazy but i see things a little differently you see mr rapp much of my job depends on sizing people up not all that different from a good tailor who has the ability to look at a man from across the room and know exactly what jacket size the man wears although im not worried about jacket size dickerson tapped his temple with one of his long manicured fingers and then patted his chest im worried about whats up here and whats in a mans heart i can usually size up a prospective client in thirty seconds dickerson looked rapp over from head to toe and said there was nothing stupid or crazy about what you did last week you are at your best when things are most chaotic while others panic and react without thought things slow down for you you tune out all the noise your brain begins looking for avenues of action first and avenues of retreat second you size up an enemy the way a lumberjack surveys a tree and then you move efficiently and effectively dickerson shook his head nothing crazy or stupid about it chapter rapp didnt like any of this didnt like the fact that the damn fbi had to put everything in writing or triplicate or whatever in hell it was that they did now with all the damn forms they had to fill out it was one of his big bitches about this war on terrortoo many lawyers created too many coveryourass bureaucrats who in turn demanded that everything be put in writing assuming it took a few days to put the report together it couldnt have been in circulation for more than three or four days yet here was a private citizen who had already read it rapp was pissed not because of dickerson really but because he had failed to have the damn report sanitized or at least have his role in the affair minimized to a footnote and have someone else given the credit things were happening too fast and he was making mistakes everyone took a seat and then dickerson said you dont look too pleased im not used to discussing classified information with civilians ah i see youre bothered that a man like me who does not work for the federal government and has no security clearance that you know of ended up with the official fbi report of what happened at the national counterterrorism center last week thats a pretty accurate assessment dickerson nodded in a thoughtful manner and said the president showed me the report this morning rapp looked at kennedy who appeared to be taking the news much better than he was and why would he do that rapp asked dickerson he trusts me mr rapp rapp looked around the room i assume hes not showing up that would be correct rapp looked to kennedy the cia director said its politics mitch what does this have to do with politics rapp knew it was a stupid question the second it left his lips the factions in dc could turn anything into a partisan issue much of it he ignored but when it came to national security it really got his blood boiling kennedy said that fbi report that gabe is referring to contained mention of an incident between you and mr abad bin baaz youre talking about the saudi terrorists that i apprehended the day of the attacks yes kennedy replied so dickerson answered he has dual citizenship rapp was afraid some dudley doright would make an issue of this hes a saudi terrorist who applied for dual citizenship so we couldnt put the screws to him if we had any common sense left in this town youd take his citizenship away and hand him over to me so i can finish interrogating him the president dickerson sighed actually agrees with you but there is a rather vocal group in his party that to put it mildly disagrees with him dont tell me theyre going to come after me for this rapp asked kennedy there is too much going on right now too many things that i need to take care of i cant be dealing with these idiots right now kennedy said fortunately it looks like they have run into an obstacle what kind of obstacle dickerson said a fellow senator who has vouched for you lonsdale yes the fbi report has a section that outlines mr bin baazs claim that you dislocated his shoulder and a doctors report that backs up his claim that the injury was caused by you while he was in your custody before he was turned over to the feds rapp knew it had been caused while in his custody he remembered vividly dislocating the little peckers arm and twisting it to the point where he thought he might actually rip it off and lonsdale she has filed an affidavit stating that mr bin baaz was in perfectly good condition when she arrived at the national counterterrorism center and that he was hurt during the attack when he was thrown to the floor by none other than herself rapp concealed his surprise the fact that the senator had lied for him was an interesting development to say the least rapp kept a straight face and asked so whats the problem things in washington are very rarely open and shut this group of senators and representatives has retreated for the moment but they have very powerful lobbying groups that give them piles of cash and in return they expect them to take the fight to the enemy those groups will demand that they open a new front with evident sarcasm rapp said i thought we were all on the same team they despise you mr rapp dickerson looked around the office they despise this entire agency rapp was somewhat alarmed to hear he was on their radar screen but he wasnt about to let on i would imagine some of those powerful lobbying groups are clients of yours they are and you make a lot of money from them i do so why do i get the feeling youre not here on their behalf this morning dickerson smiled you are a quick study mr rapp i am not here on their behalf conflict of interest dont confuse lobbying with the legal system its the first thing i tell my new associates who are almost always fresh out of law school and full of ideals im a pragmatic man mr rapp ive been a lot of places seen a lot of things and if im lucky ive got another ten years before i meet my maker i take money from these groups because im a capitalist and i earn every penny of it trying to moderate their crazy demands i know who they are and i dont particularly sympathize with their view of the world but they are a force to be reckoned with so whose meter are you on right now lets just say im here because i feel its my patriotic duty that and because the president asked me to take his place and why would the president do that because i advised him to cancel this meeting rapp asked the obvious question why he was briefed by the fbi late last night about the ongoing manhunt and lets just say it didnt go well how so they dont have a single lead and the suspects that you took into custody the day of the attacks have all lawyered up and are refusing to talk and this surprised the president not entirely but he is a man who expects results he thought some progress would be made but these three men have simply vanished the fbi doesnt have a single solid lead well when you fight with both hands tied behind your back its hard to win the president is starting to see things your way but im getting ahead of myself there was another development at the meeting one of the deputy attorneys general also pointed out this sticky issue between you and mr bin baaz he went so far as to say he felt senator lonsdale had filed a false affidavit and that you in fact had abused the prisoner rapp groaned i bet the president loved hearing that it did not please him in the least dickerson turned even more serious he told the briefers that the only two people who seemed to have gotten anything done in the past week were you and mr nash and that in his honest and very important opinion if men like you didnt have to spend so much time answering the justice departments inquiries you might have been able to prevent the attack that occurred last week he then went on to suggest that it might be a good idea if we stopped persecuting our own people and focused a little more on the terrorists who attacked us kennedy said to rapp the president called me after the meeting he said he wanted to talk to you and mike first thing thank you for the sacrifices youve made and ask you for a favor rapp turned to dickerson and you talked him out of coming yes why please dont take this the wrong way mr rapp but i think it would be best if the president kept his distance from you chapter rapp really wasnt the insecure type so rather than taking offense at dickersons comment he began to laugh he didnt need to ask for clarification any fool could see why a gamer like dickerson would advise the president to steer clear of a man of rapps ilk his curiosity however was piqued by the revelation that the president had suddenly taken an interest in his unique skill set it was funny how that worked in washington guys like rapp were often viewed as the problem until the politicians themselves were threatened rapp looked at dickerson and with a slight grin said as you may have already guessed its pretty hard to offend me no i wouldnt imagine you care too much about other peoples opinions probably not even the presidents i dont want to sound disrespectful rapp said he is our president after all its just that ive been at this a while im a little jaded so am i ive worked in this town for fiftyfive years ive seen a lot of administrations come and go and while each one has its strengths and weaknesses the good ones all have something in common whats that rapp asked deniability rapps face showed his surprise there were a lot of words he could have anticipated but this was not one of them how so this is a shitty business and the chief executive needs to stay out of the shit i served in the navy after college learned a lot about a lot of things but the thing that impressed me most about the navy was the way they thought everything through to the tenth twentieth sometimes hundredth degree the way they design those ships is amazing the training everything is geared toward not just putting out a fire but putting out the fire while still taking the fight to the enemy you take a torpedo up front below the water line you close the watertight doors and keep fighting you seal off that part of the ship and there more than likely are going to be some guys who arent going to make it out but you seal the doors anyway your point im that watertight door between you and the president rapp thought about it for a moment and then said so in other words you expect me to put my neck on the line but if things start going bad water starts flooding the compartment to use your analogy and i try to get out youre going to slam that door in my face and let me drown now it was dickersons turn to put a frown on no thats not what im saying rapps version of the sinkingship analogy was more accurate than dickerson would allow himself to see the only problem was the political operative mostly due to his station in life viewed the scenario from the top down not an unusual thing for a wealthy successful person dickerson naturally saw himself on the bridge of the ship with the captain to save the ship others would have to die conveniently however they would also be saving themselves rapp understood the draconian necessity in the military application but in the political arena it was tinged with selfishness and arrogance especially when bracketed in the context of national security the number of politicians in washington who were willing to stand on principle and put the security of the country before their beloved party was quickly becoming a pathetically small group theyd all spent too much time on the bridge and not enough time in the engine room rapp leaned back and crossed his legs i think thats pretty much exactly what youre saying no dickerson shook his head vehemently and trust me on this the president is a big supporter of yours i have advised him however that due to the way things work in this town it would be best if he kept a few people between himself and you especially in light of what he wanted to talk to you about today here it is rapp thought to himself he bet a guy like dickerson billed between five hundred and seven hundred dollars an hour and while it was unlikely that he would be charging the president for this slice of time he was nonetheless an extremely busy man who wouldnt bother coming out to langley unless it was something serious as i already stated the president is not happy about the fbis lack of progress i know some of those guys and to be fair to them the justice department isnt doing them any favors i wouldnt disagree with you but we are a nation of laws rapp leaned forward and put out his hand giving dickerson the stop sign you know youre the second person today who has used that line on me and i gotta tell you i think its a copout dickerson was not used to people speaking to him so bluntly really a throwaway line that means everything and nothing at the same time you dont think were a nation of laws dickerson asked no i agree were a nation of laws but there are a lot of people running around parroting that statement without any sense of history i think i have a very good sense of history then help me with this when did we get so hell bent on affording our legal protections to our enemies dickerson paused a beat and then said thats a complicated answer mr rapp no it isnt rapp replied bluntly you dont want to answer it because youre going to ask me in a very coded way to put my neck on the line and break these very laws you and the president pretend to hold so dear and if im right about that id appreciate a little honesty from you on this issue rapp paused for a beat and then added and dont worry i wont be running to the press not my style the only people i dislike more than politicians are reporters i just want to make sure were on the same page before you send me down to the engine room to plug the leak dickerson nodded as if to say fair enough kennedy held up a finger looked at rapp and said if i may rapp said go right ahead this country of laws kennedy said in a slightly sarcastic tone has a long history of curtailing its citizens rights during times of war and national emergency the civil war is the most obvious example lincoln suspended what many would argue is the most sacred law of all habeas corpus during world war ii the fbi opened any piece of mail they wanted they listened in on phone calls intercepted cable traffic and they did it all without a single warrant and anyone who is na√Øve enough to think we treated every pow to the exact standards of the geneva conventions has never spoken to a marine who served in the pacific not every japanese pow was treated as well as wed like to believe fdr a man who is considered by many to be one of our greatest presidents interned thousands of japanese americans as well as german and italian americans we simply rounded these people up based solely on their ethnicity and stuck them in prisoner of war camps until the war was over then the cold war came along and despite all the people who have tried to rewrite history the soviet union had a massive intelligence operation here in the united states joe mccarthy may have been a drunk and an ass but that didnt make him wrong on the big issue it is an undeniable fact that the soviet union was engaged in espionage on a colossal scale they were recruiting agents stealing our vital national secrets and attempting to undermine our political process by funding communist and socialist political parties in this country this little chapter in our nations history was not simply cooked up by the alcoholsoaked brain of the junior senator from wisconsin so while there are a lot of people in america who would love to embrace compassion and tolerance and they have correctly labeled joe mccarthy a bully they do so by conveniently ignoring the fact that the soviet union was doing everything that joe mccarthy and j edgar hoover and jfk and a whole host of political figures accused them of doing dickersons expression soured i think on this point we will have to agree to disagree no i dont think so kennedy said firmly even rapp was surprised by how forcefully his boss had responded to dickerson i dont want to sound disrespectful gabe but im pretty sure i know why youre here so i think you might want to hear our concerns before you ask us to risk our careers and possibly our freedom fair enough fifteen years ago do you know what we used to do when wed close in on a suspected soviet spy and im talking about the ones who had us citizenship im sure you would refer the matter to the fbi dickerson said showing the hint of a grin no kennedy answered seriously wed grab them usually in the middle of the night and wed take them to any number of undisclosed locations and wed use every form of interrogation you could imagine and you werent always right were you of the nearly one hundred cases im familiar with there was only one instance where the individual turned out to be innocent dickerson scoffed at kennedys claim how could you be sure those groups you referred to earlier the ones you represent yes you know how they like to say torture doesnt work yes kennedy tapped her leg with her reading glasses and said well trust me it does chapter rapp looked at his watch he had a mental list two pages long of stuff he needed to get to and sitting in his bosss office trying to persuade one of the presidents closest advisors that torture worked seemed like it might be a waste of time rapp had found in his various appearances before the intelligence committees that you were wasting your breath if you tried to convince people in thousanddollar suits who had ivy league law degrees that torture was an effective and necessary tool against an enemy who refused to put on a uniform and intentionally targeted civilians given the right team and enough time to work on the individual there wasnt a person out there who didnt break but rapp had learned the hard way that most politicians preferred an issue and a readymade talking point to reality rapp had tired of trying to convince people that it worked hed come to the conclusion it would be like a major league slugger arguing with fans over why he swung or didnt swing at a certain pitch if youve never been in that batters box with some freak of nature perched a little more than sixty feet away on an elevated mound of dirt who was about to whip a hard white ball at you in excess of ninety miles an hour that might or might not hit you in the head you really couldnt understand what it was like to decide in a split second to swing or not swing its easy to sit in the stands with a hot dog and cold beer and criticize and its every bit as easy to sit in a federal office building in washington dc and do the same thing in response to kennedys admission that they not only used torture but it worked nearly percent of the time dickerson said there are certain things i dont need to know he smiled uncomfortably and added this is why i advised the president not to attend this meeting this type of discussion is way off the reservation having said that i sympathize with your position does it bother me that i am surrounded by people who want so badly to be liked want so desperately to be thought of as enlightened that they are willing to tear this country apart yes it bothers me does it drive me to the brink of madness that there are people in this town who think the way to peace is to afford tolerance to an intolerant group of bigoted muslim men people who should know better by the way yes it drives me mad rapp felt a glimmer of hope he couldnt recall the last time he had heard someone this well connected speak so frankly it is utter insanity dickerson said that the justice department has four men in their custody who we know for a fact helped plan and prepare for attacks that killed nearly two hundred of our fellow citizens all four of those men were born in saudi arabia two of them have dual citizenship those men know things that could help us find the three men who are at large and possibly information that could help us prevent further attacks and what are we doing nothing kennedy said they all have lawyers dickerson said while making a hopeless gesture with his hands and kennedy said i was told the aclu will be filing a brief this morning fighting any extradition to saudi arabia why am i not surprised dickerson answered they think that we will hand them over to the saudis so they can torture them for us dickerson thought about it for a second and said not a bad idea rapp shook his head actually its not such a good idea the saudis like to say theyll share information with us but they rarely give us the whole story they suck them dry and then they kill them and we only get what they want us to know which never includes anything that might connect them to certain wealthy subjects as well as highplaced government officials so what do we do with the four men in custody rapp asked yes nothing kennedy answered for him unless the president wants to sign an executive order that authorizes us to use extreme measures and a blanket pardon would be nice rapp added with a smile dickerson suddenly looked less than enthusiastic about the new direction of the discussion the president was hoping you would take a more active role in the search for the three men who are still at large this lion of al qaeda character has really got under the presidents skin he was under rapps skin as well so im not going to get the blanket pardon i dont think so but there is something else i think i can help you with im not sure if you are aware of this but there are certain elements on the hill who are already maneuvering to make this agency and you director kennedy the scapegoat for what happened last week kennedy said i was not aware of that but it doesnt surprise me well you have a pr battle that you have been losing for some time both rapp and kennedy nodded it was universally agreed that when the cia did something well it was never discussed but when they screwed up it was plastered across every media outlet for weeks if not months i think i can help you more effectively defend yourselves get out in front of these other groups before they strike i can help shape your message get it told in the right way over the best outlets and just how are you going to do that rapp asked in a skeptical tone the media elite in this country dont exactly like us ive got something they wont be able to resist whats that rapp asked you mr rapp come again rapp asked looking more pissed off than confused youre a hero what you and mike nash did last week is the type of thing legends are made of and i dont even have to exaggerate your accomplishments the media will eat it up and you and mr nash will become untouchable there wont be a politician in this town dumb enough to try and take you on you will become this generations audie murphy youre nuts mitch kennedy cautioned no way in hell am i mitch kennedy cut him off just calm down for a minute i want to hear what else he has to say well i sure as hell dont kennedy gave him the look of a mother about to cuff her teenager across the head and after hed backed down a bit she looked at dickerson and asked in exchange for what he dickerson said referring to the president but not wanting to use his name thinks it would be best if you found these three men first why rapp asked dickerson took a long moment to answer lets just say that he thinks you might be able to cut through some of the red tape so you mean he wants me to put the screws to them before the fbi reads them their rights and they hire a lawyer dickerson shrugged he didnt dare open his mouth for fear that his words might be recorded boy rapp said in near disgust you guys are a real profile in courage you know darn well the president cant endorse something like this it sounds like he wanted to but you got in front of him and convinced him it was a bad idea you somehow persuaded him that you could barter a trade with us a couple hundred billable hours of pr from your firm in exchange for me putting my nuts on the chopping block dickerson had a pained look on his face i know it doesnt seem like a fair trade but i think youre minimizing the potential upside this pr offensive could get a lot of these politicians to back down some of them might even turn into supporters of yours rapp placed his face in his hands and shook his head after a long moment he looked up at dickerson and said somewhere in this building theres a safe filled with a bunch of medals and commendations for guys just like me whove put their asses on the line over the years we dont do this job for public recognition we dont want public recognition and we cant effectively do our job if people know who we are so i will not be participating in your pr offensive and if my name somehow ends up leaked to the press i will find out who did it and i will hurt them dickerson looked at kennedy to see if she would overrule rapp rapp didnt give her the chance i call my own shots on something like this going over my head wont work so sorry to disappoint but i wont be going on oprah to talk about my top five favorite movies so i should tell the president your answer is no rapp thought about it for a second and with a deep frown said im going to keep doing what ive always done you can tell the president that im going to find these three guys i dont know if its going to take a week or a year but im going to find them and when i do i dont give a shit what the aclu or the justice department or anybody else thinks about how they should be treated im going to find out everything there is to know about their organization who supported them where they got their money where they got the explosives how they got into this country and if they got out who helped them and then im going to track all of these people down and im going to kill them dickerson was more than a little surprised by the frank admission the president will be very ah happy to hear that you will be taking an active role in the case rapp stood hed already wasted enough time yeah well tell him if the shit hits the fan ill scream from the rooftops that we had this little powwow and you asked me on his behalf to disregard the law and do whatever it takes to bring these men to justice dickerson looked as if he might vomit in a deliberate cautious tone he said i would advise against dont worry rapp said casually pointing at kennedy he added i think she and i are the only two people left in this town who know how to keep their mouths shut chapter while kennedy said goodbye to dickerson rapp grabbed his blackberry walked to the far end of the office and began listening to the nine messages that had been left during the meeting rapp saw no sense in thanking dickerson for a meeting at which at least from his perspective nothing had been gained as usual rapp and his people were going to shoulder the risk while the political elites inoculated themselves against any fallout rapp took a bit of joy in the fact that dickerson left looking none too pleased rapp figured he made the man nervous dickerson was a professional handicapper and rapp was a wild cardthe aberration that his formula couldnt account for dickerson was used to assessing his chances for success in a game where people played by a certain set of unwritten rules the players all moved along a path where their incentives were money power and notoriety rapp had more than enough money and as far as power was concerned it could be easily argued that he represented the very essence of physical supremacy at least in the individual sense put him up against pretty much any guy in town and youd be a fool not to put your money on rapp the thing that had really thrown dickerson though was rapps outright refusal to become a national hero dickersons substantial fees were generated by ambitious men and women who couldnt compute turning down such an offer many of them wouldnt bat an eye at manufacturing tales of bravado if they knew they could get away with it and more than a few had done just that over the years passing on an opportunity to bask in the lights cameras and microphones of the national media was unthinkable it would be like a sex addict saying no to a weekend in bed with a playboy centerfold there was another reason rapp knew that dickerson didnt look too happy he had recognized rapp for what he wasa molotov cocktail that could ignite a conflagration that would bring down a presidency and put a party on a course for a few decades of permanent minority status it was why dickerson had argued against the presidents attending the meeting in the first place even so dickerson was acutely aware of both the risks and rewards that were circling the president an attack had gone down on his watch and he hadnt raised a finger in protest of the very people dickerson represented apparently being nice to the terrorists wasnt working out so well and you wonder why i dont like coming in here rapp said as kennedy closed the office door on her guest kennedy began walking across the office toward her desk should i be offended has nothing to do with you boss you know that its just that ive got a few things that need my attention and i just wasted the better part of the morning sitting here listening to im not sure what gabe is a good person to have on your side rapp shrugged maybe if you want to get booked on oprah but from where im standing he doesnt appear to offer a lot you could have been a little more subtle maybe a simple thanks but no thanks a guy like that would see that as a yellow light hed hit the gas the only way to stop him is to make your intentions crystal clear maybe even make him think you might come unhinged well you accomplished that kennedy looked at the blinking message light on her phone and decided it could wait she needed to go over a few things with rapp first and she could tell by his fidgeting that he didnt plan on staying long lifting her gaze she focused on rapps face and asked where were you last night rapp didnt waver he looked her straight in the eye and said i was down at stans place we had a few things to go over kennedy nodded and you didnt bring your cell phone i had it with me but you turned it off and took out the battery rapp shrugged as if to say what do you expect call me paranoid no doubt and if i need to get hold of you kennedy asked youd leave me a message and id call you back or try stans number next time hes no better than you are he never answers his phone im not even sure he has a phone now that i think of it i call him all the time kennedy eyed him im never going to get anywhere with you on this am i rapp shook his head listen before we get too far off track did you know that this meeting was going to be about a big pr offensive of course not kennedy answered i know better than to waste your time so if hes as smart a guy as you say he is how could he possibly think id go along with something like this kennedy picked up a small tube of hand lotion i think he was a bit desperate she squirted a dollop the size of a quarter into her palm and began rubbing her hands together the president has good instincts he can see where this is all headed we havent even finished burying all the dead from last week and in certain circles hes being labeled as weak on terror you have to remember he ran on a ruleoflaw platform and now weve been hit and so the brave thing to do is launch a pr offensive theirs is a different world mitch kennedy shrugged the president told me himself that he is really frustrated with the fbi why because they have come up with nothing they know very little about the men who carried out the attack and the three men who are still at large theyve vanished well dont get mad at the fbi theyre operating within the very constraints the president campaigned on and that kennedy said i suspect is why he wanted to sit down with you and mike but dickerson waved him off rapp said correct and to be honest im not sure it wasnt wise counsel god forbid the president get a little dose of reality maybe sign an executive order that allows us to really go after these guys be careful what you wish for mitchell if i could wish for anything it would be some damn support from the white house and the hill as foreign as it seems thats what gabe was trying to offer you but for reasons that i completely understand you would prefer to not have your image splashed across the world media outlets kennedy hit the space bar on her computer to take it out of sleep mode the pr offensive isnt a bad idea youre just the wrong guy for it you know as well as anyone that it would be nice to get some of our esteemed senators and representatives to back us a bit more it has been a long time since rapp stopped listening his mind was wondering off down a path that involved a bird in his hand and two in the bush or was it a stone and two birds whichever it was he saw an opportunity are you listening to a word im saying kennedy asked rapp shook the dazed look from his eyes and said sorry i was just thinking of something else were you guys drinking last night kennedy thought of hurley and his colorful history and said that was a stupid question you were at stan hurleys lake house of course you were drinking where is mike by the way rapp thought about his roadside confrontation with nash and wondered how he would explain to his boss that one of her most valued operatives was experiencing a mental collapse dont tell me he was too hung over to see the president it sounded like as good a story as any so rapp gave it the nondenial denial and shrugged his shoulders kennedy shook her head in disappointment do i even want to know what goes on down there rapp thought of adams and said probably not how bad can it be rapp was tempted to tell her it involved hookers and a bunch of drugs but he didnt want to push her over the edge some cards some drinking some harmless talk thats all it ever is kennedy gave him her schoolmarm frown hey this isnt exactly the easiest job in the world rapp said defensively theres nothing wrong with blowing off a little steam i agree just make sure thats all it is she maneuvered her mouse and opened up her email speaking of pr the last thing we need right now is some tv news crew to catch you guys doing god only knows what you do down there rapp found the idea preposterous hurley had more damn security than some federal buildings if any reporters were dumb enough to ignore all the signs and wander onto the property they would end up running for their lives from hurleys pack of dogs the last person you need to worry about is stan hurley hes smarter than all of us and hes been doing this for a hell of a lot longer rapp thought of the inevitable confrontation between hurley and nash if nash didnt snap back percent and do it quickly hurley would want him gone not killed necessarily but he would want him transferred out of the clandestine service and probably out of the cia entirely rapp looked a few days into the future and saw a way that he might be able to defuse the conflict speaking of pr maybe gabes idea wasnt so bad after all kennedy looked surprised really not for me rapp added quickly im thinking of mike kennedy thought about it for a second why mike hes perfect former marine officer gorgeous wife four cute kids dickerson could do wonders with something like that kennedys hazel eyes narrowed what are you up to what do you mean you know exactly what i mean fifteen minutes ago you thought it was the craziest thing youd ever heard and now all of the sudden youre offering up mike youre always telling me i need to be more openminded thats all this is kennedy studied him for a long moment she wasnt buying it youre up to something i know it chapter rapp was thinking on the fly he wasnt about to explain to kennedy that nash had come unhinged in the last twelve hours she was too perceptive and she would want to know what the catalyst had been she would also assume it was something that had taken place at hurleys lake house and she would be right rapp could fabricate a hell of a lie that would stand up to a lot of digging but there was one weak point sometime in the next three days she would have nash standing in front of her desk just as he was now she would begin to probe and if nash was still in his volatile state and mad at rapp he was likely to say a few things that would cause a lot of trouble rapp would have to get to him in the meantime and prepare him but for now he had to give kennedy a plausible reason for his newfound respect for dickersons plan there wasnt a cover story worth a damn that wasnt somehow grounded in truth and kennedy knew him too well as was evidenced by her suspicion rapp started speaking and before he knew it the answer was on his lips i think mike is having a hard time with what happened last week so your answer is to thrust him into the spotlight and end his career as a clandestine operative rapp shrugged and tried to play down the obvious it wouldnt be ended theres still plenty of work for him to do around here he just wouldnt be involved in some of the more risky operations rapp watched her eyes burrow through him as if she were trying to read his soul something happened last night kennedy said this time it was a statement as if she knew for certain something had gone on rapp sighed and said hes burnt out irene this shit has really gotten to him im not sure he ever fully recovered from the injuries he suffered over in the kush rapp was referring to an operation they had run in afghanistan nearly a year ago the intel had been solid a highvalue target was staying in a village on the border they had gone in with a special forces team right at dawn everything was looking good and then the house they were about to raid blew up killing two troopers and nearly killing nash the docs are still picking shrapnel from him and his wife tells me he wakes up every morning with an earsplitting headache then last week he sees his secretary and a bunch of his coworkers gunned down by some guntoting jihadists considering what hes been through its a wonder he can get out of bed in the morning and face the world and you kennedy asked with a bit of amusement in her voice what about me it could be argued that youve suffered through the same events i wasnt wounded on that operation in the kush and i didnt know those people at the nctc like he did but youve been wounded before and ive always bounced back thats debatable rapp knew she was referring to his lengthy absence after his wife had been killed listen i think it would be a mistake for you to try to compare mike and me for starters ive been at this a lot longer and i think i have proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that im committed i you dont think mike is committed kennedy asked cutting him off rapps frustration was apparent are you going to let me talk or are you going to keep interrupting me kennedy put on a pleasant smile and said by all means continue im not saying mike isnt committed im saying his life is a little more complicated than mine he has certain obligations that i dont have his family yes i think this job is really taking its toll on his personal life we are all aware of the pressures that go with this job its deeper than that irene its not just the job its the way the job has crept into his life rapp paused for a beat and tried to honestly put his finger on what was going on with nash shaking his head he said i think maybe i scare the hell out of him kennedy was surprised by rapps statement why would mike have reason to be afraid of you has he done something youre not telling me no its not that he hasnt done anything that i know of i think hes afraid hes going to become me interesting he has a family to go home to at night and he has to somehow shut down this portion of his brain that deals with all this crap he has to be a father and a husband try to teach those kids the difference between right and wrong live up to the ideals of maggie and reassure all of them that everything is all right and will be all right when he knows damn well the world is a scary place at some point it creeps into your head that you might not make it home rapp paused as he thought of an image he had blocked from his mind just last week he looked down and found his secretary lying on the floor with her brains blown all over the carpeting something like that is going to haunt a man for a long time kennedy made a steeple with her hands and asked and how do you cope with it rapp sighed shed been trying to get him to discuss his wifes murder for years i dont know i just do i think its a little more involved than that rapp shrugged im not normal im wired different so you say she said in an accusatory tone rapp saw his chance to counterattack how do you deal with it with what the pressures of the job you ever sit down and talk to a therapist kennedy inclined her head and took on a stern look that is none of your business it wasnt easy to read kennedy but rapp thought he saw something in her eyes a flash of anger and a look that told him to back off it was probably as close as he would get to an admission that she had seen a therapist and in all likelihood it was lewis its interesting how at this juncture everything becomes a oneway street as my boss and my friend rapp stressed youve been very vocal about the fact that i need to sit down with a professional and talk about my pain over the loss of anna yes i have but dont try to change the subject this isnt about me its about you and mike rapp was willing to let her off the hook for now this was about nash its apples and oranges for starters i go home to an empty house i dont have to confront the lie every time i walk through the door the lie telling your kids to be good dont cheat in school play life by the rules and oh by the way i just broke five federal laws today and killed a man that kind of shit weighs on a guy after a while it doesnt weigh on you kennedy focused her gaze more intently just a little bit rapp was surprised that he actually paused to think about it as crazy as it was no one had asked him this question in a long time which part of the job all of it but lets start with the part that most people would have a hard time with the killing rapp shook his head its never bothered me the guys im whacking arent exactly upstanding citizens kennedy had read every afteraction report hed written and verbally debriefed him on the ones that were too sensitive to put in writing she knew rapp wasnt big on detail or blowing his own horn so more often than not she got a very abbreviated version of what had gone down youve never accidentally killed an innocent bystander define innocent if youre talking some rentabodyguard whos hired to protect some piece of shit hes not exactly innocent in my book you wanna play tough guy mercenary youd better understand the bullets are real kennedy nodded theyd covered some of this territory before rapp considered it further took a kernel of an emotion and decided to blow it up turn it into something kennedy would get the only thing that weighs on me is not having his life what do you mean his life id leave this shit in a heartbeat if i could turn back the clock and have anna back when hes in town he goes home to that family and theyre his those kids love him and the dumb shit takes it for granted when you dont have something rapp caught himself and added when youve had something that meant more than anything in the world to you and it was taken away its hard to imagine why anyone would want to do this shit when the price is that high kennedy didnt speak for a long time and then she said you know its not too late for you mitch youre in your early forties you mean to find someone else settle down have a bunch of kids rapp shook his head not so sure its for me besides someone has to do this job and i dont see too many guys with my skill set ready to step into the breach im sure i could find someone else with a confident grin rapp asked and do you think they could do it as well i doubt it kennedy reflected on the subject and began to see that maybe rapp was coming at it from the right place so your solution as far as mike is concerned is to let dickerson turn him into the cias poster boy i havent worked out the details yet but yeah thats pretty much the plan and you think hell go along with this not sure but we dont have to give him a choice in the matter kennedy shook her head i dont think hell like it he probably wont at first but i think hell come around pretty quick kennedy winced i dont know mitch hes not as stubborn as you but hes pretty close when he sees how proud maggie and the kids are rapp smiled all will be forgiven ill think about good rapp checked his watch i gotta get going i need to kennedy stopped him yes you do you need to get out to dulles your friends have requested a meeting which friends your counterparts from across the pond oh these neutralsite facetoface meetings were a recent development how much time do i have if you dont want to keep them waiting you need to be wheels up in fifty minutes rapp swore to himself he always kept a go bag packed in his car so that wasnt a concern but he needed to talk to scott coleman and get him to sweep lewiss office anything i can help with kennedy offered rapp almost laughed at the question but before he could reply there was a muted knock on the door and then it opened rapp looked over to see sixfootthree chuck obrien enter the room the ruddyfaced director of the national clandestine service had been with langley for thirtythree years and if rapp was reading his clenched jaw and austere expression right they were about to get some bad news sorry to intrude obrien covered the distance in a few long strides and pulled up next to rapp but some info just got kicked up to me whats that kennedy asked apparently glen adams decided to take a little unauthorized trip huh rapp asked more than a little surprised that the alarm bells were already being sounded that the cias inspector general had gone missing kennedy asked where to venezuela obrien answered he landed in caracas about an hour and a half ago left jfk late last night caracas kennedy asked with a puzzled look on her face why caracas does he have any relatives down there not that i know of kennedy slowly turned her gaze to rapp any idea why glen adams would take an unannounced trip to venezuela rapp unflinchingly returned his bosss stare shook his head twice and said how the hell would i know were not exactly drinking buddies chapter fortunately for rapp scott coleman wasnt big on sleep the retired navy seal had returned home from the operation in new york at am and after three short hours of sack time hed gotten up and started his day by the time rapp called coleman had already hit the gym and gotten in a fivemile run coleman confirmed that he could meet rapp at one of their usual spots in twenty minutes rapp grabbed his go bag from the trunk of his sedan and took a quick shower in the mens locker room of langleys fitness center ten minutes after leaving kennedys office he was in his car and heading west rapp exited the main gate got onto dolley madison boulevard and grabbed his phone after searching his address book he found the mobile number for maggie nash and punched the call button through his bluetooth earpiece he listened to the line ring on the fifth chime a familiar upbeat voice answered maggie nash hi maggie its mitch how are you fine she answered in a cautious voice maggie was a great person and rapp had always gotten along with her he knew immediately by the uncertainty in her voice that she had talked with her husband you spoke with mike yes rapp had to multitask he had to get maggie to see things from his perspective and he had to make sure he made it to his next meeting without the wrong person or group following him fortunately he had grown up only a few miles from langley and knew the winding residential streets as if hed laid them out himself it was the ideal terrain to detect surveillance with all the parks and creeks there were a lot of deadends and if it turned out the fbi was following him he could always fall back on the fact that there were hundreds of foreign spies in washington who would love to know what he was up to being security conscious and aware of americas enemies was a big part of his job that was both his reality and his cover but the sad fact was that he was now more worried about his own government following him than the chinese or the russians did he tell you we had a little problem this morning yes maggie i dont expect you to take any side other than your husbands but id like you to hear me out on a few things im listening i care a great deal about you and the kids i think of mike as a brother id risk my life to save him and hed do the same for me rapp cut down vincent place and turned onto elm street two short blocks later the truth was he had already risked his life to save him and maggie knew it im worried about him maggie sighed and emotion flooded her voice i dont know what happened between you two this morning he wouldnt talk about it but i do know he is extremely upset and because you guys live such a screwedup life and cant talk about anything that you do i dont have the slightest idea how to help him rapp turned on to chain bridge road relieved that nash had at least informed her that there was a problem maggie i need you to listen to me and i need you to understand that this comes from the heart im damaged goods im good at my job and thats about it ive given up on ever having a normal life but she cut him off dont say that mitch please let me speak if i dont say this right now i dont think i ever will i see you and mike and your kids and i see the life i could have had with anna i blew it i thought i could do both i thought i could keep the two lives separate continue to do all the stuff id done for a decade and half all the nasty shit i cant talk about mitch you cant blame yourself anna knew it maggie she begged me to get out of the field let a new crop of guys take the fight to the bad guys and i told her i would but i never did i kept telling myself one more operation one more bad guy to take down i made excuse after excuse i even lied to her about the crap i was involved in because i knew shed freak i thought i could keep the two lives separate and it was all a bunch of bullshit and you know it maggie i saw what you and the kids went through last year when he almost died and then this crap last week rapps voice trailed off as he thought of their dead colleagues in a remorseful tone he said this is no business for a family man maggie sighed you dont have to convince me good then heres what were going to do we as in you and i yes rapp checked his mirrors mitch i love you and i respect what you do i admire your courage i admire michaels courage and commitment to what he believes in but i hate your jobs and michael knows it i have tried to get him to quit and he has yet to listen to me what makes you think this time is going to be different because were not going to give him a choice in the matter so what are you saying are you going to fire him no the opposite im going to promote him to what for all i know youve been promoted a dozen times and it hasnt changed a thing this is going to be different im going to do you a favor maggie im going to give you and your kids the life you deserve that sounds great mitch but i still dont get how youre going to pull it off hes not a quitter you try to promote him out of the clandestine side of the business and hell turn you down i might need your help on this but in the end hes not going to have any choice in the matter youre just going to have to trust me you know gabriel dickerson of course i do everyone in dc knows who gabriel dickerson is maggie worked for a prominent pr firm in town did mike by chance tell you anything about last week what happened at the office you mean the attack yes yeah i mean we know jessica died we went to the funeral she was referring to nashs assistant he didnt talk about any heroics no he never talks about that stuff rapp was relieved at least nash still knew how to keep his mouth shut he began telling her a little bit about what her husband had done leaving out his own part in the heroics and focusing on nash then in broad strokes he told her about dickersons plan that the cia needed a hero that america needed a hero and then he fudged a bit and told her the president wanted to give mike a medal that he wanted to do it at a public ceremony at the white house and they wanted maggie and the kids there her husband would finally be rewarded for his sacrifices and maggie would no longer have to live the lie because he would be outed rapp made her promise not to tell anyone especially her husband you know how these politicians work rapp warned her this morning they think this is a great idea dickerson is championing it for the president but its never a done deal until it actually happens you dont have to tell me ive been burned plenty of times rapp could hear the hope in her voice maggie theres a lot of fuckedup guys like me out there who dont have a family to take care of let them take their turn stepping into the breach mikes done his part go home support him make sure he gets some rest and dont breathe a word of this to him you know him if he gets wind of this hell stop it dead in its tracks chapter rapp took a quick left and then a quick right he backed into a private drive halfway down pathfinder lane and stopped under a massive elm tree the leafy canopy of the tree would frustrate any airborne surveillance one of rapps high school buddies had lived on the street and he knew the driveway serviced only a couple of houses the street jogged at both ends so it wasnt used to cut through the neighborhood like some of the other side streets rapp checked the clock on the dashboard and settled in to see if any americanmade fourdoor sedans came skidding around the corner he thought about his conversation with maggie and stared at his phone for a long moment a sliver of guilt crept in as he wondered if he could deliver on the promises hed just made after a beat he knew he could he knew he had to he would call dickerson and make it happen feeling better about it rapp punched in stan hurleys number on his secure blackberry to get an update after three rings the scratchy voice of hurley answered rapp didnt bother to say hello so were you right rapp asked in reference to hurleys prediction that adams had used max johnson to bug lewiss office about who he was using yeah yep hurley answered hes been on the payroll for about two months rapp wanted to ask him how he was paying him but was hesitant to get into too much detail over the phone motive another member of the mitch rapp fan club rapp looked north and then south no cars so far how so cant say if there was any personal animosity but my guess is he was intrigued by the idea of taking down a real gunfighter rapp thought about that hurley liked to refer to the clandestine folks as gunfighters everyone else was a limp dick or a desk jockey theirs was an entirely separate culture from that of the other folks at langley and it was not unusual for other groups to harbor acrimony against the spooks in the building johnson had spent his entire career within the secure perimeter of langley there were probably a handful of times that hed gone overseas to do a security review of an embassy and the cias personnel but hed never participated in a real op the entire focus of his career had been to protect langleys secrets and bust those who didnt play strictly by the rules any idea what he was using to listen in on the sessions hes not certain but it sounds like it might have been offsite all right im on it i gotta go ill call you later rapp hit the end button and thought about the task he was going to give coleman max johnson while not exactly an a team field guy was nonetheless someone they should not take lightly what concerned rapp was that johnson would be dumb enough to get involved with a guy like adams hurleys assessment of the situation was as good as any but they werent talking about an impulsive twentyyearold johnson was a thirtyplusyear veteran of the business he should have known better than to get mixed up in something like this rapp checked the street again no crown vics caprices or ltds came sliding around the corner on two wheels so he put the car back in drive and drove over to lewinsville park rapp had spent countless hours here as kid he and his neighborhood buddies played every sport there was and if they werent at the park they were down at the pool and tennis club off of great falls rapp was smiling to himself and thinking about the summer his brother had gotten them banned from the pool when he saw coleman pulling into the parking lot in his big black suv without saying a word they both left their vehicles and traveled down the path between the bleachers to the syntheticturf lacrosse field it was a typical late april morning for the area the temp was in the midseventies and the skies were partly cloudy with the threat of storms off in the distance rapp had changed into a pair of comfortable jeans and a longsleeved shirt for his flight coleman had on a pair of khakis a buttondown shirt and a blue sport coat the two men faced each other but didnt look at each other they were more concerned with their surroundings than making eye contact coleman looked over at the basketball courts there were four kids playing hoops young enough that they should probably be in school and definitely too young to be on the payroll of the fbi or any other organization he ran a hand through his blond hair and asked dont tell me we already have a problem rapp kept his eyes on the parking lot not with the thing youre thinking of he said referring to the op theyd run in new york at least not in the way you might be thinking although he said glancing at colemen i did hear something interesting this morning whats that charlie obrien told me that little prick glen adams took off for caracas without letting anyone at langley know he was leaving the country you dont say i thought you guys had rules about that most definitely you have to notify senior management as well as security and he did neither thats right hes stepped in some real shit do they have a line on him coleman asked already wondering if his guy had been able to disappear they had agreed that it would be best to have no communication unless there was an emergency you mean langley yeah no rapp said not so far is the fbi in on it rapp shook his head irene wants to keep it in the family at least for the next six hours we have some people looking at the hotels and were quietly talking to a few of our contacts in the venezuelan dis if we dont get some answers quick shes going to have to bring in fbi and state coleman nodded do you think he defected who knows as long as the guy doesnt give away any of our secrets id just as soon he hung himself rapp checked out the boys on the court and then finally looked at coleman the name max johnson ring a bell colemans blue eyes closed a touch as he tried to remember where hed heard the name after a moment he said yeah hes one of you guys or i should say was rapp frowned he was never one of my guys that would be like me telling you an investigative services guy was on the teams coleman thought about it for a second and said point taken but he did work at langley right yeah for a long time does he know where all the bodies are buried rapp shrugged hard to say with a guy like him hes not the bubbliest fella but then again those security guys are supposed to make people nervous you ever have a beef with him not that i can recall rapp paused a beat and then added but ive pissed off so many people over the years i cant keep track irene rapp thought about his boss he couldnt imagine her running afoul of her own security service but then again johnson had been passed over twice for the top job not directly but you know how it is its the rare bird who gets passed over for a promotion who doesnt hold some kind of a grudge so what exactly has he done coleman asked he runs his own consulting company now coleman said i know thats how i heard of him the word is hes pretty hot shit on the new technology specializes in surveillance rapp nodded the war on terror had been a boon to private security and consulting firms outsourcing was the new hot trend youd better grab marcus then rapp said referring to his resident computer genius can you tell me what this is all about you got a pen and a piece of paper coleman dug in his jacket pocket and pulled out both rapp flipped open the small notebook and clicked the plunger on the pen he hesitated for a brief moment while he decided on the best way to relay the information while still being cryptic pressing lightly he began to scrawl the pertinent information on the lined paper when he was done he handed the notebook over coleman glanced down at the words and read rapps blocky print last night found out where hes been getting info hired johnson to bug docs office know of at least one person who spilled the beans assume there are more find out how he was doing it and get me a full scouting report on him holy shit coleman said out loud as he thought of dr lewis and the number of people he worked with this could be a real mess information like this could be sold over and over rapp took the notebook back and tore out the top five sheets he grabbed a lighter from his pocket and lit the bottom corner of the pages he watched the flames lick their way up and then he flipped them over so they had to work their way down to his fingers when there was a square inch left he waved the paper back and forth until the flame was out be careful with this guy dont tip him off i dont want him getting spooked and running off with the goods coleman thought of adams the news that he had supposedly left the country for venezuela would spread like a dry autumn wild fire through the intelligence community hell hear about this other thing sooner rather than later no doubt and hell probably get a little skittish thats why i want you on this right away roe coleman asked roe was military jargon for rules of engagement rapp thought about it for a moment he didnt know johnson anywhere near well enough to predict any of it coleman would have to use his instincts do what you have to do just make sure we know what our exposure is if he has recordings i want them all back if i have to get rough rapp shrugged i should be back late tonight if it can wait till then id appreciate it but youre going to have to play it by ear where you off to cant talk about it itll be a short trip ill shoot you an email and let you know when ill be back rapp started walking back to the car and coleman fell in beside him send me some updates and make sure theyre as obscure as possible assume everything you write or say will be intercepted got it anything else yeah be careful i got a bad feeling about this johnson character chapter when hakim finally woke up he made no attempt to open his eyes his head hurt too much his body hurt too much it seemed that everything hurt too much slowly his senses started to send reports back to his brain there were bruises and cuts and scrapes and maybe some breaks he kept his eyes closed not because he didnt want to see where he was but he thought it would hurt too much to open them without forethought his brain decided to take inventory he wiggled his toes and was pleased to see they worked his left foot rolled outward and everything felt as it should when he tried the same thing with his right leg his knee sent back signals of sharp pain he couldnt tell the extent of the injury but nothing felt broken his torso ached but it was nothing compared to the pain he suddenly noticed in his arms and face hakim tried to open his eyes but nothing happened it was if his eyelids were glued shut he tried again and with a little more effort he was able to get his left one open a sliver it felt as if something was weighing down his eyelids he was surrounded by a soft natural light somewhere in the distance he heard a throbbing hum that was faintly familiar his sense of smell slowly came back and he picked up the weak scent of a campfire hakim managed to get his left eye open a bit more and after staring at the strange wood grain pattern for a while he realized he was in the back of the rv lying on the bed he tried to roll onto his side but didnt get far he let out a small gasp it felt as if he had been stabbed things slowly started coming back to him he had no idea how long hed been out but the last thing he remembered was karim on top of him his fists rising and falling with crazed rage remember those punches it suddenly occurred to hakim why he couldnt open his eyes with dread he brought his hands up to touch his face it was one of those things you never thought of what your own face felt like mostly because you didnt have to you touched it so frequently throughout the day for so many reasons and over so many years that every centimeter of it was imprinted on your brain you could feel your way to the slightest blemish or new wrinkle hakim gently touched the area around his left eye everything was foreign it felt like a ripe tomato plump and smooth his fingers continued their search his lips were even worse and his right eye felt twice as bad as his left then as if a switch had been thrown the pain started it was both specific and everywhere at the same time as if his brain were stuck in a circular loop of agony moving from one area to the next and then back again running faster and faster until he felt like a thousand fire ants were feasting on his face he started to moan and after a good five seconds he stopped himself the thought of karim hung above him like some awful nightmare he did not want to feed the mans arrogance any more than he already had how could one friend do this to another hakim lay there and asked himself the question over and over the answer was so obvious that he was no longer able to ignore it the truth was now staring back at him like an old wise parent telling him he had been warned long ago but had been either too stubborn or too immature to heed the advice hakim felt his puffy face again was it true had he been so blind for so many years or was he suddenly in full martyr mode casting himself as the ultimate victim and his friend as the archvillain hakim knew he wasnt exactly in the best frame of mind to be dealing with such a question but it was no longer possible to ignore the obvious had he been the one who had changed or was it karim was it both or had he simply drifted away from their radical worldviewthe myopic one the wahhabi clerics had brainwashed them with it was so foolish hakim thought as he looked back on his testosteroneladen late teens and early twenties they had been indoctrinated like brainless fools even so there was another question that was more troubling was karim a monster hakim thought of the father and son who had showed up at the farmhouse and asked permission to hunt by the river he had had the situation handled they were not federal agents or local law enforcement they were just a father and a son such as you would find anywhere in the world and if karim had been able to keep his ego and anger in check everything would have been fine the sinking feeling hed had when he heard the screen door open came back hakim replayed it all in his mind but without any sound for some reason the audio wouldnt play it was just the cold harsh visual of bullets hitting flesh and bodies falling in slow motion to the gravel the agony on the fathers face the fear on the sons and all for what what had they gained what had karim gained with his obtuse inflexible methods they were now on the runforeigners in a land where everyone was looking for them hakim had calculated their chances of escape many times and he was convinced that nothing offered more hope than the house in iowa it was the last place anyone would look he had even told karim not to worry if someone should stumble upon them he and ahmed were to stay out of sight hakims cover story was solid he would be able to deal with anyone possibly even law enforcement it had all been discussed and rehearsed many times hakim was in the midst of asking himself why his friend would be so reckless when the floral curtain that separated the rear sleeping area from the rest of the rv slid back a half foot hakim looked up to see a pair of large almost childlike eyes staring down at him it was ahmed the moroccan pulled the curtain back a little more and then stepped into the sleeping area and let the curtain close behind him he had a damp washcloth in one hand and a bottle of water in the other ahmed placed the washcloth on hakims forehead and then holding the water in front of him asked thirsty hakim began to shake his head but it hurt too much he winced in pain and tried to speak but that hurt as well he moved his tongue around in his mouth and realized he was missing at least two teeth ahmed leaned in close and softly said i am sorry for what happened it was obvious by the way he spoke that he was afraid of being heard by karim hakim saw fear in his eyes the kind of fear a man shows when he is in over his head through puffed lips caked with dried blood and a swollen and possibly broken jaw he managed to ask where are we i am not sure i think still in iowa how long have i been unconscious im not sure but it was a long time i was afraid you might be dead what time is it now ahmed held up his black digital watch it was twelvefiftysix in the afternoon hakim worked his way backward and figured hed been out for over five hours how long have we been on the road the moroccan shrugged hakim suddenly noticed a familiar but much stronger odor on ahmed you smell like a fire after looking over his shoulder ahmed nervously said karim had me put the father and son in the house the basement i then set fire to it why hakim asked in near disbelief he said it would destroy the evidence and bring the police what did you do with all the supplies in the barn hakim watched ahmed shrug and then flinch as he heard karim call his name from the front of the rv he was obviously driving i will come back and check on you later what about their vehicle ahmed didnt understand the car that the hunters drove ahmed shrugged his big shoulders and said i dont know then he was gone hakim slowly rolled his head back to his left as he closed his eye and tried to rest he wondered how long it would take before the police figured out who had been staying at the house he doubted they would remain at large very long and part of him was fine with that chapter eastern atlantic rapp woke up on descent about an hour out as he almost always did takeoffs put him to sleep and landings woke him up hed never figured out exactly why but he guessed it had something to do with the way takeoffs kind of pinned him back in his seat the end of the flight was easier to understand when the pilots eased back on the throttles and started their descent it was as good as a flight attendant placing a gentle hand on his shoulder on this flight however there was no flight attendant just two sixtyplusyearold former air force jocks at the controls and rapp riding in back all three men knew how to keep their mouths shut that left fifteen open seats rapp had logged countless miles in the service of his country and at least early in his career they were rarely in such comfort the gulfstream was a beautiful bird from top to bottom and a far cry from the noisy cs he used to fly around in the old military transport had been in service for over fifty years and while it was robust and dependable it was not designed for comfort zero noise suppression minimal insulation web seats along the sides a latrine that consisted of a curtain on a wire and a funnel on the side of the plane plus four of the loudest turboprop engines known to man rapp had flown all over the damn world on the things and the end result was always the same the thing vibrated so much it shook your senses right out of you it was a wonder units could deploy on them and still shoot straight it was all those darn c hops that had enabled him to take this new development in stride in the days after rapp understood almost immediately the full extent of what had happened and where it was all headed he knew the public outcry of his countrymen would be nearly uniform and for that delusional to percent who wanted to blame america for the attacks there was nothing he or anybody else could do to convince their illogical brains otherwise but rapp had read enough history that he could see part of the future the populations support for the war on terror would wane over time and it had but the one thing he never fully expected was just how low the politicians would stoop this little trip to the middle of the atlantic was proof that their actions had farreaching and unintended consequences just a few years ago all of this could have been handled with a secure conference call or an encrypted message those sanctimonious politicians however with their chant that the people deserve to know the truth had turned the intelligence community on its ear the british and french had been crucial in the war against islamic extremism far more so than the american people and most politicians in washington understood in many ways they had done the heavy lifting they had more experience in dealing with some of these characters and at least in the case of the british courts they took a more pragmatic view of what the people deserved to know with the politicians in america and their various leftwing specialinterest groups demanding investigations hearings and trials the british and french and a good number of other allies began to reassess what they were willing to share they had participated in many of the same terrorist interrogations the far left was now screaming to see the tapes and notes of those notsopretty sessions it is a fundamental tenet of any intelligence organization to keep its means and methods a secret so when federal judges starting ruling in favor of the aclu and other groups requests for the release of information under the freedom of information act some very important allies in paris and london got nervous kennedy and rapp flew to both cities and met with their counterparts each group of professionals was worried about the same thing the stuff the aclu was asking for was damaging enough but it paled in comparison to the mountains of highly sensitive encrypted data that had been sent back and forth between the three intelligence agenciesstuff that was hidden or destroyed with the understanding that the information could start a world war if ever leaked they all trusted each other but there was one glaring problem americas national security administration captured almost unimaginable amounts of signal traffic as with one of those big commercial fishing trawlers it looked as if their nets might bust at any second they might be looking for tuna but they caught everything else big and small they all knew that somewhere in the nsas vast files their own highly sensitive and encrypted traffic sat like an ancient cipher waiting to be solved so the flow of daily information slowed to a trickle and a handful of trusted men and women who had earned their spurs in the field began meeting face to face rapp dreaded the trips at first it seemed there was always something else that needed his attention but after a few of them he realized they were a bit of a blessing in disguise for starters they allowed him to unplug the planes always had a secure comm package and he would usually take an hour or two to catch up on the more mundane stuff but in general he turned everything off and used the silence of the long flights to crack some of the more stressful problems they were dealing with with all of the damn technology around today strategizing was in danger of becoming extinct the other bonus was that he no longer felt the need to plod through twentyplus pages a day of cable traffic that was rarely germane to what he was most concerned with now theyd meet face to face two or three times a month and go over the most important information rapp put on a fresh pot of coffee in the galley and then brushed his teeth and washed his face since his hair was only a quarter inch of black stubble there was no need for a comb when the coffee was ready he poured himself a cup took a few sips and then changed back into his dark suit and a fresh light blue dress shirt the closest inflight screen told him they would be landing in approximately ten minutes rapp turned on his laptop and used it to skim fortyone emails thirtynine of them were pretty much useless chatter but two jumped out at him as things he would need to deal with rapp slid back a wood compartment and retrieved the handset for a secure satellite phone he punched in the number for kennedys direct line and thought about the best way to convince her that his plan was sound after six rings rapp knew the call was rolling over to one of her assistants director kennedys office the womans voice was neither polite nor rudejust efficient kristen its mitch is she around shes on the phone can you interrupt her let me see there was a click as he was put on hold and then a few moments later kennedy was on the line rapp said you know that meeting we had this morning yes im on board you sure youre up for all the attention no rapp said making no attempt to hide his lack of patience im talking about mike i know she said i was just jerking your chain can you get it done do you care what your boss thinks or are you calling the shots now rapp groaned why are you doing this doing what torturing me you told me this morning that you thought it was a good idea that was when i thought you would accept the medal as well ive had the visual in my head all day of you sitting on oprahs couch talking about skincare products rapp pulled the phone away from his head and looked at it as if he might snap it in half are you done yes but i want you to at least recognize the fact that you are giving mike no say in the matter while you have threatened me or anyone else with extreme violence if we dare recognize your achievements which were even more remarkable than mikes weve been through this so many times do we have to go over it again no we dont have to go over it again kennedy said in slightly playful tone i just want you to recognize that youre not being entirely fair fine im happy to admit it life isnt fair mike has four kids and a wife who need him my wife and unborn child are dead because of what i do for a living maybe i dont want to see that happen to him maybe i dont want to have to knock on maggies door some night and explain to her and the kids that their dad is dead were different people im damaged goods he still has a shot at a seminormal life and thats why hes going to be the face of this thing not me kennedy didnt answer for a long time rapp rarely talked about his deceased wife and it had caught her off guard i think i understand rapp felt like an ass for coming down so hard on her sorry boss for what for snapping at you like that you know im no good at this stuff i just hes not doing well rapp said changing gears ive seen it before the lie is tearing him up i dont think seeing his assistant and another dozen and a half coworkers killed did him any favors no it didnt rapp thought about nashs fragile state just please do this for me and do it quick before he does something stupid what do you mean something stupid kennedy asked with trepidation nothing rapp lied its just a feeling tell dickerson its a go get it set up for tomorrow if you can arent you forgetting something what mike you know hell never go for this dont worry about him you tell me what time you need him at the white house and ill have him there just make sure everyone keeps their mouth shut chapter santa maria island azores the landing gear thudded into the down position and the plane banked to port out of the nearest window rapp caught a glimpse of the western edge of santa maria island and her big tenthousandfoot runway courtesy of the us taxpayers the place had been a busy hub during world war ii and in the decade after but was now nothing more than a tourist destination and convenient meeting place for three spooks who didnt want to be noticed the plane landed so softly rapp wasnt sure they were down until the pilots began to brake but with ten thousand feet of concrete there was no rush he looked out the window and saw the other two private jets parked in the distance at the refueling station that was the other thing santa maria island was known forfuel roughly a thousand miles from the european mainland the big airstrip offered a convenient place to stop for fuel or repairs on transatlantic flights the other beauty of the island was that it only had five thousand residents who were more or less uninterested in the tail numbers on the planes that came and went even so rapp grabbed a pair of sunglasses and a newspaper as he prepared to exit when the plane stopped he disengaged the safety lock and lowered the steps he moved stiffly down the stairs and pretended to read the newspaper as he proceeded around the nose of a bombardier global express he hesitated for a moment at the base of the bombardiers stairs and looked around not a person in sight rapp bounded up the steps two at a time once inside he glanced to his left the door to the flight deck was closed rapp hit the close button on the hatch and the stairs began to fold back into the closed position he then walked through the wellappointed galley to the rear of the longhaul private jet all of the shades were down on the windows and there sitting side by side at a table near the back of the plane were two familiar people they were both facing the front but only one of them stood at six foot four george butler had to tilt his head a few inches to the right to avoid hitting the ceiling the fortyeightyearold brit offered his hand and said hello mitch good of you to come rapp grabbed the hand of mis counterterrorism chief good to see you too rapp turned to look at the woman who had remained seated she was petite just under five and a half feet tall and weighing no more than pounds rapp had known her for nearly fifteen years her name was catherine cheval and she worked for frances directorate general for security external or dgse she gave rapp a faint smile and offered her cheek rapp leaned over the desk and kissed her first on her right cheek and then the left always good to see you catherine the feeling is mutual she said in perfect english cheval sat back and brushed a strand of her raven black hair behind her right ear she looked a decade younger than her fifty years rapp took one of the two seats across from them cheval leaned forward and gestured toward the coffee cup sitting in front of rapp please as cheval poured rapp a fresh cup he apologized for being late butler nodded and said frankly im surprised you could make it on such short notice irene didnt give me an option she said it was important butler and cheval shared a look and then nodded in unison cheval said we have discovered some information that you might find useful but before we begin butler added cautiously we would like to revisit the ground rules rapp could have been offended by the comment but wasnt in many ways these two and the people who worked for them were better allies than the people in his own government the fact that butler had brought it up though told rapp two things first that they had some good intel and second that they had come by it through means that the department of justice and us congress would not approve of if you need to modify the rules i completely understand but remember when it comes to certain elements of my government few have more motivation than i do to lie to them true cheval said and we trust you it is just that certain nosy people in your country will begin to walk the dog back they will want to know how this information fell into your possession they might even make assumptions butler added if they begin to stir the bleeding hearts in our own governments it could create a rather unhealthy environment for us understood as far as im concerned none of what i hear today has to be shared that would be nice cheval said but not realistic what we have to tell you you will most certainly want to share cheval reached under the table and grabbed a manila file it was simple enough looking and intentionally so she placed it in the center of the table and hesitated for a long moment her light brown eyes slowly drifted away from the file and settled on rapp she looked as if she still hadnt figured out precisely how she was going to handle the exchange of intel rapp had seen the file before and it had always carried information that was far more valuable than its worn simple appearance would lead one to believe ingenious on chevals part rapp had always thought the files at langley were made of sturdy heavy stock the important ones were red although rapp had known a few people over the years who had used chevals method of misdirection typically though the really important stuff was in red files with letters strewn across the label some designations were easy enough to figure out like top secret but most were covered with phrases like eyes only and a string of letters that were nonsensical to the uninitiated all of it was compartmentalized intel some had locks and most had twine claspsthe kind you had to twirl around a little disk to secure and unwind to open the twine wasnt there to defeat prying eyes it was there to give a person pause one more step to go through to get the thing open and hence an extra few seconds to consider just what the hell you were doing the cia was funny about that they liked their people to keep their attention focused on their particular area of expertise during rapps tenure hed seen two complete overhauls of the system and a bunch of little modifications at the end of the day one of the quickest ways to land yourself in serious trouble was to get caught opening a file that was none of your business the french and the brits operated with similar constraints so rapp had guessed long ago that chevals worn file had likely never been carried through the security checkpoints at the dgse headquarters in paris cheval asked have your services made any headway on the identity of the men who carried out the attacks very little talking to two colleagues like this rapp was slightly embarrassed to admit that they had made zero progress the race to find out what had happened had been going on for a week and they were still wandering around the starting line looking for clues nothing butler asked looking surprised as far as the six guys who raided the ctc are concerned there isnt really anything left to identify the surveillance footage doesnt give us anything useful they were dressed in full swat gear complete with balaclavas goggles helmets gloves heavy vests rapp shrugged theres nothing to see physical evidence cheval asked rapp thought about the stew of body parts that had been created when all six suicide vests were detonated at the same time they were still finding bits and pieces in the woods a couple of hundred yards away the men had ended up at the base of the twentyfootwide parking ramp the smooth pouredconcrete walls looked like an old subway car that had accumulated five years of graffiti but instead of spray paint it was chunks of bone and flesh and lots of blood and instead of a half decade it had happened in the blink of an eye theyve been able to identify six separate sets of dna but thats about it surely theres a fingertip or two to be found butler said ive seen a lot of nasty shit over the years george but this one was disgusting rapp thought about it for a second and then corrected himself saying i take that back it wasnt disgusting it was bizarre there was nothing left except chunks of indistinguishable goo but you did manage to get six separate sets of dna cheval asked thats what i was told she asked fbi yes we might cheval said guardedly have a relative in our possession can you get me a dna sample rapp asked cheval and butler glanced at each other rapp picked up on it and asked what it would be best if you gave me what you have i will see if i can get a match rapp gestured with his hands as if to say no big deal i think i can take care of that this relative he continued sister mother father brother cheval answered whered you find him this stays here of course rapp said one of my teams picked him up in casablanca moroccan yes active investigation cheval shrugged her slender shoulders as if to say who knows rapp gave her a disbelieving frown cheval ran the dgses directorate of intelligence anything on the covert side of the business fell into her purview how can that be my operative who brought this to my attention she paused how do i say this after a moment of searching for the right description she smiled at rapp and said he reminds me a lot of you rapp grinned tall dark and handsome highly intelligent women hanging on his every move dont forget delusional butler added with a wry smile rapp chuckled cheval smiled and said he does not follow directions well ahhh butler said while nodding at rapp he has authority issues i think i know the type yes that is the phrase he has authority issues very difficult to manage unnerving at times cheval smiled at butler and he nodded as if to say i share your pain rapp laughed at both of them well if hes so difficult why do you put up with him the question had a solemn effect on cheval you know why i put up with him because he gets things done rapp said with a bit of pride in his voice that is correct he is extremely effective but her voice trailed off what lets just say i know how irene feels rapp was well aware that kennedy and cheval shared a history that went all the way back to beirut nearly thirty years ago youre afraid hes going to land you in jail one day no cheval shook her head then what every time he leaves the country i wonder if he will return rapp lowered his eyes and felt like a bit of a moron sorry hed been through this with kennedy on many occasions he didnt spend a lot of time worrying about his fate but apparently she did no need to apologize it is the business we are in this man spends a fair amount of time in algeria and morocco and he has very good contacts he picked up a rumor that some of the men involved in the attack were moroccan after some diligent work he found a man who was bragging that his brother had participated in the attacks on america rapp frowned there are probably a million young muslim men who are claiming that they had a relative involved in the attacks rapp knew he sounded slightly ungrateful but it was the truth trust me when i say my man verified the information rapp looked at butler for confirmation the brit nodded and said i think you will want to hear the rest of the story it was rapps nature to be skeptical the craft of espionage was filled with half truths and guesswork lies and deception so much so that it was often impossible to unravel all the layers of misdirection but this was not chevals or butlers first dance they were every bit as suspicious as rapp and maybe more and both had a look that said they had solved a very important piece of a complex puzzle rapp had seen this same look on their faces a few weeks earlier sitting at this very table on this same little island in the middle of the atlantic ocean it was when they had informed rapp that a third terrorist cell was at large and headed to america rapp reached for his cup of coffee and settled into the plush leather seat he braced himself for what was to come and said lets hear it chapter the original plan had called for three cells to hit america in typical al qaeda fashion they had picked new york los angeles and washington dc ninety percent of the intel they collected pointed toward attacks on those three cities occasionally chicago or another major city popped up but al qaeda was especially obsessed with new york and washington dc for obvious reasons al qaeda was acutely aware of the role media could play in amplifying their message infidels were infidels but killing a couple of hundred people in toledo ohio simply wasnt as good a story in the medias eyes as hitting a big glitzy city the brits had nabbed one terrorist cell while it was transiting through hong kong and the french had picked up the second cell in west africa much better at keeping secrets from their elected officials mi and the dgse took the men to black sites and proceeded to peel back the onion on what was to be a very lethal operation of three coordinated attacks the one thing they couldnt do however was glean the whereabouts and identity of the third cell the various groups had never met the only thing they knew about each other was that they existed and that they each had been assigned one of the three major cities no specific targets were known to anyone other than the individual cell leaders rapp wondered if they had managed to squeeze a little more information out of the men in their possession and asked cheval have you had more success with the cell you intercepted my man cheval said without pretext was heavily involved in those interrogations like you he is not afraid to get his hands dirty so i have absolute confidence in what i am about to tell you we originally told you that these three groups didnt know each other no crossover whatsoever while that is still true the men all belong to the same organization in the broad sense and the majority of them earned their stripes fighting in afghanistan butler added terrorists talk the same as everyone else cheval continued they were tightlipped about operational details but there is gossip about the more trivial aspects of their lives they looked at their best men to create these three teams there were quite a few rivalries the saudis with their usual arrogance demanded to be in charge of all three units and fill the ranks with their own people that however presented a problem let me guess rapp said they found out it was a oneway trip and the courageous sons of arabia decided theyd pass that was part of it the other problem lay in the fact that the saudi ranks are bloated with wealthy men who rarely see combat they are there to provide funds and then go home and thump their chests for this operation they needed real shooters real veterans of combat the best without question are the afghan and pakistani tribesmen but these men didnt like the idea of dying in a strange country thousands of miles from their homes rapp said so they looked to the moroccans algerians syrians jordanians precisely cheval said and these men talk there is a rivalry that is not different from that in our own military services they like to brag and inflate their successes and of course taunt the other groups and they all hate the saudis butler said but tolerate them because they have the money yes at any rate my man picked up in one of his interrogations that the moroccan contingent was very proud that three of their men had been chosen to serve on one of the teams i checked with george cheval said glancing at butler and he confirmed that none of the men in his possession were moroccan so you guessed that the three men were in the third and unknown group yes so my man went to rabat and then casablanca and began to beat the bushes it took him a week and then he found what he was looking for the sibling yes cheval gave rapp an uneasy look and added it was slow work at first you mean the brother was not cooperative rapp said that is correct it took a little longer than my man would have liked but you know how such things work eventually even the toughest decide to cooperate rapp thought of asking if the sibling was still alive but thought better of it we now know the identities of all three moroccans who participated in the attack let me guess they were all part of the suicide crew cheval shook her head not according to my man one of the men is still alive rapp leaned in a bit one of the three we are looking for yes cheval ran her ring finger along the edge of the file and flipped it open revealing a photograph she spun it toward rapp and said look but do not touch no reason to put your fingerprints on any of this rapp nodded who is he ahmed abdel lah twentyfour born in casablanca spent the last three years in afghanistan and pakistan and youre sure hes still alive as sure as one could be considering the situation how he sent his brother an email yesterday rapp lifted his eyes from the photograph of ahmed he had a youhavetobekiddingme expression on his face what did he say he told his brother not to worry that he is alive and well and that his mission was a total success did you get a fix on it she shook her head only that it originated from a server in america what about the other two we have some ideas but i think george should fill you in on what he has found out first butler cleared his throat and said we think we know how they funded their operation saudis rapp had found over the years that nine out of ten times the money trail led back to saudi arabia no surprisingly enough we think it was south american drug money this piece of information caught rapp off guard are you sure yes butler continued ive been able to piece together a strange string of events which i think will explain how this cell managed to get into your country south american drug money rapp repeated himself still not quite buying the idea they had looked into the possibility years ago due to the opium trade coming out of afghanistan and southeast asia the rationale was that if the cartels could run drugs and sneak them into the country they could easily do the same with terrorists theyre all catholic down there rapp said referring to south and central america and i mean oldschool catholic the church has made it very clear that its their continent and the muslims arent welcome as strange as it sounds the cartels are very loyal to the church on this issue plus it would be bad for their business if we found out they aided a terrorist group the leaders know itd be a good way to get a twothousandpound bomb dropped on their heads ive seen the same reports and i agree with your assessment butler said but this is something different this third cell butler said in an admiring tone theyre smart they decided to do something none of them have tried before whats that they unplugged unplugged rapp asked with a puzzled look what in the hell is that supposed to mean they cut all ties to al qaeda strict operational security chapter butler went on to explain what theyd discovered the other two cells had stayed in contact with al qaedas senior leadership during their training they sent back regular reports and received orders from their commanders targets were adjusted and modified based on the success of the training and the ability to smuggle explosives and weapons into america but this third cell butler said they went dark no one had heard from them in months that is until the bombs started going off last week rapp wasnt here to punch holes in his colleagues stories but on this point he couldnt resist thats normal operational security for us yes but there is always a failsafe we always keep in place a way to contact each other in case the mission needs to be modified or scrubbed we verified cheval said that they had such protocols in place we also verified this past week that they feared the third cell had been intercepted months ago why rapp asked because no one had heard from them butler said they went completely dark no communication whatsoever what about finances rapp asked we found the account it hasnt been touched in five months rapp shook his head with a bit of skepticism we all know how expensive it is to run an operation like this to move men and materials into position to bribe people to look the other way were talking a significant amount of cash i agree butler said as he reached under the table and retrieved a file of his own instead of manila this one was brown but every bit as worn as the one cheval had on the table and i think i know where they got it south american drug money rapp said still not buying it yes butler tapped the file and with a dire expression said mitch i cant stress this enough i trust you if i didnt i wouldnt have boarded a plane this afternoon and flown down here but what i have in this file is extremely sensitive it is information that you need to see but how it came into my possession is one of my governments most closely guarded secrets rapp thought he knew the cause of butlers cautiousness and nodded youre worried about exposing your source yes tell me how you want me to handle it for starters nothing gets put in writing at least nothing truthful rapp smiled create a false sourcecuban perhaps butler hadnt considered going that far he was thinking more of a misdirection play but he instantly liked the idea of creating a ghost it would unnerve the cuban intelligence service and force them to dump resources into chasing a mole we can talk about that later but lets go over the background material first ive checked on this first part you can confirm this information with your drug enforcement agency this past week while the world has been focused on the attacks in washington a minor drug war has erupted in south america it started in a remote jungle region of the triple frontier and has spread to a half dozen cities the estimates of those murdered is in excess of one hundred people and while they cant seem to agree on who started it they all agree on the single event that caused the spark butler retrieved a pair of blackrimmed reading glasses and put them on he opened the file withdrew a satellite photograph and then closed it he slid the image to the middle of the table so rapp could see better and pointed at a line of brown in a photo that was filled with green jungle landing strip operated by the red command cartel out of s√£o paulo it serves as regional distribution center for their cocainemanufacturing operation local peasants cultivate the coca crops make the cocaine and then they bring it to this strip where it is gathered and shipped out once a week three days before the attack on washington the facility was hit it hasnt been easy to get exact numbers but we think approximately eight of the cartels men were killed and the entire weeks shipment was stolen again theres all kinds of rumors floating around but the estimated street value of the stolen merchandise is somewhere between ten and twenty million dollars thats a lot of cocaine rapp said the red command agrees they have offered massive rewards they want their drugs back and they want the guilty party punished they played nice for a few days last week and then when no useful information turned up they began hitting the rival cartels and all hell broke loose you dont think it was a rival cartel rapp asked no i think it was the third cell rapp nodded im listening this is where it gets tricky what im about to tell you is for your ears and irenes only understood rapp said they could figure out the best way to disburse the information later the same day that the distribution center got hit a plane showed up in cuba with nine men and two pallets of cocaine they were met by a colonel in the cuban army and a small contingent of soldiers who helped them offload the cocaine and transfer it onto two speedboats this particular colonel was given percent of the shipment in exchange for his help somewhere between one and two million dollars in product rapp digested the information and said cuba isnt exactly my area of expertise but from what ive heard this isnt an uncommon thing it happens to be one of my areas of expertise and theres more butler withdrew another satellite photo it was another shot of the jungle but instead of a rectangular clearing this one was square an analyst had taken the time to label the various features weve all seen this before barracks over here obstacle course here this square area here used for pt and a firing range here training camp yes where is it located rapp asked next valley over from the airstrip about ten kilometers away as the crow flies so you think these guys hit the distribution center loaded up a plane flew it out of there and landed in cuba that is precisely what i think rapp was skeptical i know a little bit about the red command theyre some of the most ruthless bastards on the planet i find it hard to believe they havent already figured this out this is their backyard after all butler looked over the top of his black reading glasses and said yesterday afternoon in the triple frontier town of ciudad del este a mosque was firebombed and burned to the ground killing eighteen people rapp swallowed hard what else my source in cuba tells me that the nine men who came in on the plane looked more mediterranean than south american and then theres this last part that you are probably aware of the day after this plane landed in cuba two speedboats approached your florida keys your coast guard scrambled a helicopter to intercept it crashed at sea your rescue divers located the wreckage and discovered fifty caliber bullet holes in the engine rapp was slightly embarrassed that he hadnt already made the connection thousands of data points had passed in front of him in the last week alone emails text messages voicemails briefings internet searches offtherecord conversations with his counterparts at a half dozen foreign intelligence agencies fbi reports and of course the notsolittle side show with glen adams rapp was suffering from sleep deprivation and information overload at the same time it was time to strip it all away and start over he rubbed his eyes for a moment and then said all right youve convinced me what else do you have butler slid another sheet from the file this one was white and had a sketch of a mans face on the front this was the advance man who set everything up in cuba rapp studied the drawing the man was handsome he looked to be in his late twenties his hair was wavy and a little long but not mangy this was done off a photo rapp said referring to the sketch yes you really are sure about this source surveillance photos could be analyzed by experts who could tell you with amazing accuracy where the photo had been taken by having an artist sketch the image one ensured that all those background clues were no longer a concern again this is between the three of us nothing gets put in a file my source in cuba i recruited him myself a long time ago i would do anything to protect him rapp and cheval nodded they had both been in similar situations before do we have a name to go with this face rapp asked as he looked at the artists sketch cheval smiled and said have you ever known us to waste your time no cheval tapped the artists sketch and said george sent this to me and i had my man show it to a few of the prisoners two of them recognized him would you like to guess his nationality rapp looked at the drawing it was black and white so it was impossible to pick up any skin tone the nose and the cheekbones offered some clues though if i had to guess id say saudi or yemeni cheval nodded and said saudi we dont have precise dates but we think he fought in afghanistan for at least a year they said he was very cosmopolitan rapp frowned cosmopolitan was not often a word used to describe jihadists fighting in the mountains of afghanistan how so he liked to read especially american authors he had traveled to your country before and cuba as well his favorite writer was ernest hemingway he talked of going to his house in key west and in cuba as well as far as we can gather he left the fighting a few months before the teams had been assembled it was rumored later that he had been sent ahead to scout out potential targets rapps doubt was quickly dissipating name hakim al harbi grew up in the town of makkah saudi arabia and here is the really interesting part as you know most of these fighters sign up in groups hakim joined with his best friend a man named karim who in a very short period gained a reputation as a fierce and capable fighter butler said one source says that he was barely one week in the fight when the taliban mixed it up with an american hunterkiller team that had staked out a mountaintop position the local taliban commander ordered three assaults on the position each one a complete disaster this karim and his fresh group of saudi fighters were ordered to lead the fourth assault rather than lead his men on a suicide mission he shot the taliban commander on the spot and took over nice way to receive a battlefield promotion and thats exactly what happened butler continued apparently this taliban commander was a bit dim the al qaeda leadership was looking for an excuse to get rid of him and without their lifting a finger karim took care of their problem the taliban didnt make a stink because this particular commander had made a habit of burning through fresh conscripts anything after this incident rapp asked were working on compiling and checking the stories but he was known to be a tough and disciplined commander with a wicked temper cheval said and apparently wasnt afraid to engage in a little selfpromotion how so rapp asked he gave himself a nickname butler asked care to hazard a guess rapp was used to connecting the dots and this was something he should have picked up on several minutes ago with a shake of the head he said the lion of al qaeda exactly cheval answered rapp looked at butlers file and then chevals please tell me you have one more photo to show me weve been after the saudis but they havent given us shit theyre denying that hes even one of them that does not surprise me butler said sorry to disappoint but we have no photo at the moment i promise you though we are throwing a lot of resources at the problem chapter midwest usa hakim came to and the first thing he noticed was a lack of movement there was no gentle swaying back and forth and the occasional bounce they were either on a very smooth road or they had stopped his head moved to the right and then the left he felt fluid sloshing around inside somewhere and then a stabbing sensation in his ear he knew instantly his left eardrum had been burst after clenching his jaw for a long moment he opened his eyes and looked around the bedroom in the back of the rv the shades were still drawn on the two windows but a bit of light still managed to make it through something felt oddly different this time to say that he had been a bit out of it would be a huge understatement hakim had no real sense of time but it felt as if he had slept on and off for most of the day occasionally something would hurt so badly hed come to for a moment and then things would get hazy again his memory was foggy but at one point he seemed to remember ahmed sticking something in his arm that image jogged a few things loose and he suddenly realized he was really thirsty he tried to sit up but it was too painful a few ribs were surely broken reaching out he managed to get hold of the curtain that separated the bedroom from the kitchen area he moved it a few inches and saw karim sitting in the booth talking to ahmed maps were spread out on the table and they were talking in hushed tones karim sensed he was being watched he lifted his dark eyes and looked through the gap at the man he had pummeled earlier in the day hakim did not look away he stared back at his friend with his sliver of a left eye the right one still puffy and closed he wanted karim to have to look at his battered face he wanted karim to know exactly what he had done to his supposed friend ahmed realized hakim was awake and quickly slid out of the booth he yanked open the door to the halfsized refrigerator and grabbed a bottle of water he quickly brought it over to hakim and after gently cradling his head he pressed the bottle to his swollen lips hakim took several sips and after a long pause a few more when he felt he could speak without his voice cracking he asked where are we ahmed looked over his shoulder and karim reluctantly nodded for him to go ahead he looked back at hakim and said we are not sure not sure you mean we are lost yes hakim didnt know if he should laugh or cry how could you be lost where is the gps device ahmed did not answer from behind karim announced in a quiet but noticeably angry voice it was left in the house hakim looked up at the ceiling and laughed silently he had taken so many precautions how could they have screwed it up he wasnt worried for a second that they would remain lost he had driven all over this part of america he had spent more nights than he could ever recall sitting in lonely roadside motels poring over maps so many that he imagined he could win nearly any geography competition in the country what time is it ahmed looked at his watch almost five in the evening when did we leave the farm around nine ahmed added i think it was eightfortyseven karim announced with confidence do you know what state we are in ahmed sheepishly said i thought i knew but now i am not sure hakim was dumbstruck the states in the middle of america were huge how can that be the river he said as if that would explain everything it turns like a snake now hakim understood the confusion the mississippi river acted as a state line for almost all of its twentythree hundred miles the rv had two gas tanks which karim knew held seventyfive gallons he also knew the tanks were full because he had topped them off with the reserves he had stashed at the farm if theyd been on the federal interstate highway system and had driven at the posted speeds they could have traveled as far as seven hundred miles without refueling that was almost ten hours of driving and they had been on the road just eight how much fuel do we have left we are low how low barely above empty hakim was hit by a pang of fear how could that be he had gone over the escape plans with both men he had drilled it into their thick heads that if anything should happen to him they should follow one of two escape plans either to chicago or houston and stick with whichever one they chose both involved getting on the interstate and blending in getting as far away as possible as quickly as possible with the least chance of something going wrong like getting lost what happened to the escape routes i gave you they were simple to follow even without the gps ahmed made a gesture with his eyes as if he was looking over his shoulder while not wanting to turn his neck hakim understood karim why did you not follow my plans he wished ahmed would move so he could see the pained expression on karims face i made a tactical decision when i looked at recent developments i decided we must adapt and how did that work for you deviating from the plan hakim asked not caring if he upset him again after a long pause karim said i do not need your help i can figure this out without you is that why we are stopped we should be halfway to houston or safely parked under a bridge in chicago if that were the case you chose to ignore all of my hard work and once again look where it has gotten you ahmed move karim ordered the big man got up and walked to the front of the rv karim gave his old friend a long hard look and said i will not hesitate to beat you again i do not have the time or the patience to deal with your hurt feelings and i no longer have the time or inclination to condone your arrogance and stupidity anger flashed across karims face he pulled back his untucked shirt showing the handle of a pistol hakim smiled his onceperfect set of teeth now ruined you talk of mission and faith and doing what is best for the jihad but you cant humble yourself for even a second i am your commander it is not my place to humble myself before you hakim said who gave you the rank of commander karim started to draw the gun you gave it to yourself i was never part of your little group that you trained in the jungle you may have deluded yourself into thinking that i was but deep down in your heart you know i am speaking the truth i am sick of all your talking karim shouted as he stood hakim remained calm and you think that justifies killing me on the battlefield it certainly does discipline must be kept hakim started to laugh but it hurt too much and quickly turned to coughing he spat up some blood that dribbled down his chin his face was so bruised and numb though that he didnt even feel it he asked what would allah think of this you say that everything you do is to please allah how will your murdering me please allah karim held on to the gun so tightly he began to shake allah wants this mission to succeed that is what will please him you and all of your western ways disgust him allah cares nothing for you he would award me for ending your life and sending you to hell now you claim to know what allah thinks i am truly in the presence of greatness maybe you could ask him where we are i have heard enough karim raised his pistol and pointed it at hakim from the front of the rv ahmed called sir please may i have a word with you karim turned to find ahmed standing ramrod straight his hands at his sides his chin pointed slightly up and his eyes looking straight ahead as if he was on the parade grounds waiting inspection what in private please sir hakim lay there on the bed wondering briefly if he had lost his senses why provoke an unstable man who had killed and would gladly do it again rather than admit he was wrong the answer he guessed was that he didnt care he watched karim hesitate and then yield to ahmeds request the two men stepped outside and closed the door leaving hakim alone in the rv wondering if he would have the courage to leave these two on their own let them fend for themselves that would be poetic justice let the egomaniac rely on his inflated opinion of his own skills he wouldnt last more than a few days ahmed came back into the rv by himself and closed the door he moved carefully to the back and sat on the edge of the bed in a quiet tone he said i know this hasnt been easy for you that jungle changed him it changed all of us that is no excuse no but it is a cause hakim thought for the first time that ahmed might not be as dimwitted as he seemed be that as it may he is not my commander you may think that but you will have a hard time convincing him then there is nothing to talk about ahmed made a calming gesture with his hands i think you need some time away from each other please by all means drop me off at the next town ahmed ignored him lowering his voice to a mere whisper he said i have offered to deal with you are you my superior officer now we must keep the chain of command in place hakim said in a mocking tone no i want to save your life i think you are a good man and i think we need you please help us hakim thought about it for a long moment and then said in the rear luggage compartment on this side hakim pointed over his head to the starboard side of the vehicle you will find a black oakley backpack bring it to me ahmed left and a minute later returned with the backpack karim came back into the rv and stood just behind ahmed his gun still in his hand it occurred to hakim that he was keeping an eye on him in case he drew his own weapon from the backpack instead he unzipped one of the pockets and withdrew a garmin handheld gps device he fumbled with the device for a second and then pressed the power button as the unit powered up hakim looked at karim with his one squinty eye and said all you had to do was ask i have a backup for nearly everything chapter hakim held the small device in his bruised and battered hands waiting for the inner workings to reach out to the nearest satellite or mobile phone tower or whatever it was that allowed it to be so precise it took a total of forty seconds for the device to power up run through a bunch of graphics and deliver the information he was looking for hakim would have laughed but the pain from his previous attempt was still fresh on his mind so he kept his composure squinting at karim he announced congratulations we are in mexico karim frowned how can that be mexico missouri hakim wanted to throw in a you idiot but knew it would likely elicit a further beating or maybe even a bullet it is a town west of st louis i knew we were near st louis hakim didnt believe him he looked at ahmed and said there is a laptop in the bag would you please hand it to me after he was given the laptop he said and in the outer pocket on the side you will find a small usb device with verizon printed on it please find it for me hakim turned on the computer and while he waited for ahmed to give him the usb modem he asked karim do you have any idea where you have been not precisely i didnt ask precisely i asked if you have any idea i know we were in illinois at one point several times ahmed said while he kept digging through the pockets he came up with something and said it this it yes hakim took it and stuck it into the usb port and what was wrong with the route i had laid out for you karim looked at his watch and said i did not want to be seen so i decided to stay off the main roads the man was a stubborn idiot and you got lost did it ever occur to you that the big roads have more traffic that it is easier to blend in and they have more police karim said boastfully that is why we got lost i wanted to avoid st louis too many police and there was construction you left the farm more than eight hours ago if you had followed my plan you would already be in oklahoma and well on your way to houston now you are barely in the next state everything is fine karim said dismissively three minutes ago you were lost i knew we were near st louis hakim didnt believe him he glanced at the laptop screen and saw that he had a connection he logged onto google maps and doubleclicked on the middle of america using the track pad he began to zero in on the area north of st louis he eyed the distance between the iowa farmhouse and mexico missouri you have traveled approximately miles in eight hours that is a good distance hakim realized the idiot was still thinking as if he were in the mountains of afghanistan where traveling twenty miles in a day was considered a huge success if you had trusted me you would have traveled more than five hundred miles in that time it does not matter we are safe and we know where we are doesnt matter three arab men in americas heartland a town like mexico is probably percent caucasian the other ten percent is divided up between hispanics blacks and some asians they have probably never seen an arab before it doesnt matter no one will be looking for us in this part of the country and when they find the father and son in the house it will be days before they find them karim said with confidence if they find them at all i would be willing to bet that they have already found them karim shook his head not possible we are fine all we need to do is wait for nightfall and then fill up on fuel with your device we will no longer be lost why wait until nightfall we only have cash and that means we must go into a store to pay they will see our faces the man was an idiot hakim asked ahmed for the backpack and after digging through a pocket for a second he pulled out a small billfold it had a texas drivers license cash and a few other things hakim held up a credit card we can get gas now where did you get that karim asked with derision how do i know it is safe rather than answer the question hakim began tapping away on the keyboard a moment later hed pulled up the website of the iowa city press citizen it was the closest big city to the farmhouse he found what he was looking for at the very top double homicide he announced and turned the screen so karim could see the bodies have already been discovered and it has been ruled a murder i dont believe you you are a stubborn fool hakim said without passion the americans work fast im sure somebody will recall seeing an rv driving away from the farm at about the time of the fire the police will call other departments and ask them if theyve seen an rv that fits this description before you know it they will receive dozens of calls that it was seen wandering back and forth between illinois and missouri for most of the day you give them too much credit and you obviously dont give them enough they will alert all of the law enforcement in the region it is standard procedure did you burn the barn down as well karim and ahmed shared a quick look ahmed said we think so you think so it burned down karim said with forced confidence hakim could tell there was some disagreement between the two you saw it burn down no ahmed said sheepishly the house caught fire faster than we expected karim said people were bound to come the rv was in danger of catching fire so the barn didnt burn down we used some of the extra fuel and poured it on the ground between the house and the barn im sure it caught fire the fuel cans were yellow hakim said what does that matter karim asked it was diesel fuel so diesel fuel is combustible not flammable it still burns it did but not anywhere nearly as easily as gasoline hakim didnt have the energy to explain the fuel had likely soaked into the ground and dissipated before it could give off enough vapor to ignite what did you do with the extra provisions there wasnt time to deal with them karim said but i am sure they are destroyed he really was a pigheaded idiot and if they havent been destroyed they will find the motorcycles weapons ammunition food fuel passports cash and the two backpacks that i prepared for each of you hakim tried to shake his head but it hurt too much if the fbi isnt already there they are on their way he handed karim the handheld gps device head west stop at the first gas station you see and then take highway south we need to get moving and remember only diesel fuel no regular petrol chapter washington dc senator lonsdale wasnt entirely sure why she was going but as she entered the lobby of the watergate complex south apartment building there was no turning back harry the doorman had already seen her and was on the move from the outside she looked put together and ten years younger than her fiftyeight years but inside she felt fragile vulnerable and beat even so she continued across the lobby on a course that would carry her toward the elevator bank and harry who was now waiting for her with a sad expression on his face good evening senator evening harry lonsdale said without much energy sorry about everything the doorman said sincerely i know you lost quite a few friends lonsdale was on her fourth day in a row of funerals and wakes the pain of watching families torn apart was difficult to say the least but lonsdale had to carry the additional burden of knowing that it was her hounding of the cia that had more than likely opened the door for the terrorists thank you harry and my condolences to you as well i know senator safford cared a great deal for you ive been here eighteen years and hes been here the entire time harry choked up a bit im going to miss him something fierce we all are harry we all are lonsdale patted him on the arm you take care of yourself you too maam lonsdale took the elevator to the sixth floor and when the doors opened she stepped out and stopped she looked to her right and didnt move she almost got back in the elevator but the doors closed behind her and then the apartment door to her right opened senator carol ogden poked her head out and said darling you werent thinking of leaving were you lonsdale looked at her fellow senators hot pink velour sweat outfit and put a fake smile on her perfectly lined lips not at all you could have fooled me the senator from california said and you look like you need a drink twist my arm lonsdale said as she entered the apartment there in the living room were two other women fran burton and amy pringle both united states senators together they were the four gals that was the name their sexist colleagues in the senate had given them sixteen years ago in that time their ranks had grown to seven seats but the fifth sixth and seventh female senators were all from the other party so it was decided to keep their little group at four schedules were tough but for sixteen years they got together at least one evening a month in the beginning they played cards smoked and drank lonsdale figured it was their way of showing the men that they had no problem keeping up with them both burton and pringle had given up smoking about ten years earlier and that coincided with their starting a book club that lasted a few years and then petered out after they realized they all liked different kinds of books and none of them were about to change the others mind lately theyd gone back to cards and drinking chardonnay mostly though they got together to network to make sure they were watching each others back and offering support where it was needed ogden handed lonsdale a glass of chardonnay and in her smoky voice said harry told me you seemed a little down lonsdale took the glass i think we all probably are arent we burton and pringle were starting a game of thirtyone burton started dealing cards and said i havent slept more than an hour or two each night i keep waking up feeling like i cant breathe like im being suffocated pringle picked up her cards and said me too i keep thinking what was it like for them what did they feel were they buried under the rubble and then slowly suffocated or worse burned to death ive wondered the same thing pringle said i was supposed to meet greg givens from the sierra club there for lunch but canceled at the last minute he and his wife and their kids all came over this weekend to thank me we all sat around and cried ogden shot pringle a look that could kill and then jerked her head toward lonsdale pringle who wasnt always quick on the uptake realized what shed done while she had canceled lunch and saved a man lonsdale had decided to skip lunch and condemned a man by sending her chief of staff to take her place im sorry barb i wasnt thinking lonsdale nodded took a massive gulp of chardonnay and then lost it she had a fullblown meltdown ogden took her wine from her afraid that she was about to spill it all over the carpeting and steered her to the nearby couch and had her sit the other two put their cards down and huddled around their bereaved friend after a few minutes lonsdale got her breathing under control and managed to say i feel so guilty ogden countered by telling her it was nonsense there was nothing you could have done this was fate and nothing else youre a survivor you always have been a survivor through sniffles lonsdale said and i have survivors guilt i sent ralph to his death he was my best friend and he tried to she couldnt finish the sentence and once again began sobbing ogden patted her on the back a bit too roughly she looked more as if she were trying to get her to spit out a piece of meat than to comfort her this is foolish ralph of all people would not want to see you like this ralph tried to warn me lonsdale said through tearfilled eyes he thought it was foolish the way we hounded the cia and mitch rapp he tried to get me to see who the real enemy was ogden frowned ralph was a prince of a man but he was shall we say morally inconsistent he was right lonsdale countered well im not so sure about that ogden took a couple of steps back and placed her hands on her ample hips what im about to say does not leave this room do you understand me after all three women had nodded ogden said this whole thing is wrong to me the timing everything you were supposed to be at lunch that day barbara and so were you amy youre two of the senates most outspoken critics of the cia just minutes after the explosions mitch rapp and this nash thug just happen to stumble across some immigrant who has the iq of a labrador and then they proceed to beat a confession out of him she shook her head emphatically im not buying it what are you trying to say carol pringle asked im saying this thing stinks and i wouldnt be surprised if that conniving bitch irene kennedy and all of her mercenary pals arent behind it youre not serious lonsdale asked i was there i was at the national counterterrorism center when it was attacked rapp and nash were shot at and neither one of them was scratched and oh by the way all six terrorists who attacked the nctc were thrown out the window and their bodies were conveniently destroyed by the suicide vests they were wearing its all a little much burton who was sitting on the far side of lonsdale looked up at ogden and with a frown asked have you been visiting those whacky conspiracy sites on the internet again no ogden snapped i havent worked it all out yet its complicated but im warning the three of you she pointed at each of them dont fall into this trap and forget the sins of the cia they are the reason our friends were killed last week we need to hold them accountable that was the last of the conspiracy talk for the next few hours three more bottles of wine were opened and burton insisted they hold a miniwake of sorts pringle then made everyone agree up front that they couldnt say anything negative about their deceased colleagues and friends ogden broke the rule twice but each time was shouted down and lonsdale only had one more major breakdown and a couple of minor incidents all in all though it was good for the soul especially the laughter ogden told the story about her first year in office when they went on a factfinding mission to brazil one night in the bar they were all tanked and everyone was dancing when senators safford and sheldon decided to make an ogden sandwich at the bar she was the meat and they were the bread safford got a little too into it and decided to grab the left breast of the new senator from california ogden in turn placed saffords left testicle between her thumb and forefinger and squeezed it like a grape safford dropped to his knees and had to be carried to his room upon hearing the story for the first time amy pringle nearly wet her pants lonsdale helped clean up she was glad she had decided to show both the laughing and the crying helped when she finally left ogden was saying her goodbyes and reminded her about the naral prochoice america event they were cohosting on saturday night youre the keynote speaker oh god lonsdale moaned i dont know if i can you can ogden rubbed her arm ill write something up for you just in case remember were honoring the life of dr smith lonsdale nodded and stay tough on this cia thing dont give in to them let me do some poking around lonsdale didnt have the energy to fight with her so she let it go thanks for the laughs ill see you tomorrow as lonsdale waited for the elevator she thought about the naral event they were going to honor the work of an abortionist whod ended more lives than anyone dared count and ogden wanted to destroy a man who had devoted his entire career to protecting his country lonsdale suddenly felt as if she were trapped in a lewis carroll novel were all mad here washington was a very strange town chapter southern missouri hakim drank some orange juice and popped four extrastrength tylenols he was propped up in the bed with three pillows behind him staring at his laptop trying to figure out what to do logistically things were perhaps more straightforward than one might imagine it was as simple as riding down the mississippi river in a raft there were twists and turns but eventually everything made its way south and dumped into the gulf of mexico they werent following the river however they were working the state highways and county roads of missouri in a gamble against time looking back on the day it was almost impossible to believe what had happened a single rash decision had led to a string of them each one limiting their options and exposing them needlessly to capture he and karim could spend the rest of their lives debating the wisdom of deciding to kill the father and son and they would never agree but it was undeniable that the act had set in motion a series of bungles one rushed decision had led to another and now they were on the run with no idea how close the law was on their trail hakim pecked away at his laptop searching various news sites for most of the evening as they worked their way down highway through jefferson city and then lake of the ozarks and finally the turn for springfield at highway hakim decided not to take interstate over to oklahoma he had labored over that decision for quite a while but eventually decided they might be too exposed on the interstate he made the decision to head for branson it was a major tourist destination that also catered to rv enthusiasts he determined the smartest move would be to lay up for the night in a big lot with other rvs and wait until morning then depending what they found on the news they would either dump the rv or fill up on gas and make a sunrisetosunset dash to houston somewhere north of branson hakim wasnt exactly sure where he felt the rv begin to slow and then sway as they turned off the highway he pulled back the rear shades an inch and stole a oneeyed glance half expecting to see the twirling emergency lights of a police car there was nothing not a car in sight hakim looked to the front of the rv just as it came to a complete stop he watched as karim unbuckled his seat belt and came to the back karim pulled the privacy curtain back completely hesitated for a long moment and finally said i am worried about something you are always worried about something karim exhaled his frustration and lowered his voice so ahmed couldnt hear for a minute could you try not to be so difficult hakim nodded his consent i have been noticing more rvs as we get farther south i know that branson is like a bedouin watering hole for rvs well they are all old the rvs hakim asked no the people driving them every time i pass one they wave and that bothers you it doesnt bother me karim scowled but i have not seen another rv in nearly an hour hakim suddenly saw why he was concerned they are stopping for the night i think so i passed a truck stop a few miles back and there were at least ten of them lined up with the big trucks hakim thought about it for a moment maybe we should go back park there for the night karim shook his head vigorously there must be a charge of some sort someone you must check in with hakim thought he might be right what other option do we have you can get satellite images on your laptop yes hakim hit the space bar and took the computer out of sleep mode google maps was already up he moved the cursor and clicked on the satellite tab and then turned the computer so karim could see the screen is that our exact location no but it is close you can zoom in and out over here if you bring me the gps device i can tell you exactly where we are karim took the laptop and sat down at the kitchen table facing hakim what are you doing hakim asked without taking his eyes off the screen he said finding a place to stay tonight hakim got a sinking feeling in his stomach what kind of place a house preferably one without any neighbors chapter dulles international airport rapp landed back in the states feeling a lot better than when hed left hed slept a solid four hours on the flight back he woke up almost precisely an hour before landing and put on a fresh pot of coffee while he waited for it to brew he ate a turkey and bacon sandwich and some chips and drank a bottle of water with that out of the way he set about drinking some coffee and making a list every time he got out one of his yellow legal pads and a pen kennedy cringed she adhered to the oldschool ways of guys like bill donovan bill casey and thomas stansfield they liked to say if you needed a pen and paper you were in the wrong business rapp didnt have their photographic memory and they almost certainly couldnt break a mans neck with their bare hands so he made his list he tore off a single sheet at a time and scratched down his thoughts in nearunintelligible handwriting no names were used just initials last and then first he filled up two and a half sheets with his chicken scratch jumping from one person or problem to the next and then back as new solutions or concerns came to him hed found that if he didnt do this at least twice a week things began to slip through the cracks and in his line of work that usually meant someone was either going to have his career ruined or end up dead by the time the plane landed on the rainslick dulles runway rapp had torn the sheets into quarters and fed them through the shredder the slivers of paper like strands of angel hair pasta were collected in a burn bag the ground crew would dispose of it later and if by chance it fell into the wrong hands rapp wished the fools luck even if they could reconstruct the original pages they wouldnt make much sense the plane taxied to the private aviation hangars where the cia kept their planes rapp looked out the window and was relieved there were no government sedans waiting for him he gathered his stuff thanked the pilots and moved across the tarmac with his garment and duffel bags as he passed through the gate he saw someone standing under an umbrella next to his car rapp tensed a bit and draped his garment bag over his right arm in a smooth casual motion his left hand tugged at his belt buckle and then slid around to the hilt of his gun two steps later he realized it was coleman and relaxed rapp fished his keys out and unlocked the doors from about twenty feet away whats up coleman looked as if he was in a shitty mood we have a problem what kind of problem i think itd be better if we talked on the way back into town coleman glanced over at the entrance to the private aviation center a couple of beefy guys who looked like they might be diplomatic security were waiting for someone rapp threw his stuff in the backseat and asked can you ride with me yes coleman pointed a few rows over and said i brought mick with me hell follow us back downtown downtown why are we going downtown because i think youre going to want to talk to someone rapp almost asked who but decided hed wait until they were on the road as they pulled out of the lot coleman said your cars clean i swept it while i was waiting good rapp turned onto the service road and asked you sure coleman glanced over at him and gave him a noncommittal stare i checked out docs office and i didnt find shit rapp frowned how many guys did you use myself plus three marcus rapp asked referring to his main computer guy yeah and you found nothing damn it i didnt say nothing i said i didnt find anything in his office across the street in a leased office we found some serious equipment how serious ive never seen anything like it all passive stuff you know how they always taught us to close the drapes so the lasers couldnt pick up the vibrations on the glass yeah supposedly it doesnt matter with this stuff marcus knew about it he said its the latest version developed by your boys in s and t coleman was referring to the science and technology people at langley they were the whiz kids of surveillance equipment and they also happened to work very closely with the men and women in security at langley which meant johnson would have gotten to know plenty of them over the years still rapp asked if its brandnew and johnson no longer works at langley what in the hell is he doing with it thats a question you might want to ask irene you think she knows i have no idea this is your turf not mine but if i were you id pick up the phone and call her later rapp said as he got on the expressway he doubted irene knew anything about johnson but it was something hed have to run down what else the shits wired to a fiberoptic line it was being sent out in real time marcus thinks the recordings were probably run through a program cleaned up and ready for listening in less than a minute does he think he can trace it hes working on it right now but he says fiftyfifty at best so no hard evidence unless we catch him coming back to retrieve the equipment coleman considered it for moment and said if we brought in the feds we could start rounding people up and find out who tells the biggest lie we could probably even put some heat on the s and t guys to find out who gave johnson the equipment but colemans voice trailed off he didnt even like the idea we cant bring in the feds because we cant tell them how we know the shit even exists exactly plus rapp checked his side mirror and changed lanes i dont feel like airing the cias dirty laundry with some overzealous federal prosecutor i thought thats what youd say so why are we going downtown because thats where johnson is rapp glanced sideways at coleman and why would i want to see him right now because hes running with a crowd that should make you nervous who russians lots of them is he working for them rapp asked more than a little surprised i couldnt prove it in a court of law at least not yet but these arent the kind of guys who hang out with fat fiftysomething retired cia security officers because they have a good sense of humor what kind of russians the kind with lots of money shit rapp was pissed off the worst kind former kgb guys coleman shrugged maybe in his entourage but the main guy is too young hes a thirtysixyearold whiz kid peter sidorov you ever heard of him the name rings a bell hes got a phd in physics from cambridge what does he do uses all that brain power to run a hedge fund hes made billions the last couple of years mostly and this could be a lot of jealousy talking by manipulating commodity prices a russian hedge fund manager manipulating commodity prices rapp said with feigned surprise im shocked i know but you know how people are with success especially with this new crowd out of russia everyone wants to believe theyre in bed with either the fsb or the mob or both yeah theres also a few of them who play it up so they can act like tough guys rapp was familiar with both types his preference was clearly for the ones who were acting so which is it with this guy i dont know this isnt my area i never operated in that part of the world well i have and i happen to know someone who is probably our top expert on the subject irene coleman asked referring to kennedy yep but i think i already know the answer how if theres one thing ive learned about the russians over the years its that rules and laws are nothing more than obstacles for them hiring a guy like max johnson to rig the game in their favor would be like us hiring an accountant to do our taxes so how does that tell you who they are if it was the russian mafia theyd try to hire someone like you or me besides none of our intel says theyre in dc los angeles chicago most of the big cities on the east coast and a few in the rust belt but not the capital irene says putin doesnt want them screwing things up things for the svr so what you think this is straight industrial espionage i dont know but whatever it is max johnson has decided to hang out with the wrong crowd chapter missouri arkansas border they agreed it was better to travel eleven more miles and cross into arkansas rather than backtrack north from branson to a lesspopulated area it seemed to them that the more state lines they could put between themselves and the farmhouse the better off theyd be hakim was not in disagreement that it was a good idea to get off the road for the night he did however fear the unknown and by unknown he meant what karim would do to the unfortunate occupants of the house they happened to choose not far across the border they found a few interesting prospects just off highway on old cricket road karim carried the computer over to hakim and showed him the two homes hed zoomed in on hakim knew instantly which house they would be visiting they were adjacent to each other but more than a quarter mile of woods and pasture separated them they shared a gravel driveway for several hundred feet and then it split off to the left the drive led to a series of buildings that even from space did not look well cared for and then a house hakim stared closely and identified eight vehicles that were parked randomly in clusters around the main portion of the property a couple of them could have been farm equipment but it was too difficult to discern the place had a disorganized feel to it hakim imagined a large extended family living on the property people of all ages coming and going lots of dogs too many variables at play to go wandering into at this late hour or any time for that matter the other property was uncannily similar in layout and geography to the farm in iowa the gravel road ran for a thousand feet up the side of a gentle rise and then hooked around the top to dump into a gravel courtyard that was situated between the house and a large barn a thick picket of trees encircled the house on three sides and then beyond as the hill fell away there was pasture it was precise immaculately maintained and by far the better choice karim pointed at the screen and asked does that remind you of anything the house in iowa yes it is almost the exact same hakim kept his eyes on the screen searching for other clues i dont know how old this image is but there are no livestock trails in the pasture what does that mean if they had cows or sheep hakim pointed at the screen you would see lines in the pasture like a goat trail in the mountains the cattle use them to get from the barn to the pasture and back is this good yes if they have cattle they have to be taken care of especially if its a dairy operation the milk has to be picked up daily that would mean someone showing up tomorrow morning we might be gone by then hakim said if we are lucky this might even be what they call a hobby farm what is that it is no longer used as a farm people live there and that is it some people use them as vacation homes they live in a bigger city and spend their weekends at a place like this so it might be empty its possible hakim hoped so karim conferred with ahmed briefly and explained what they would do he laid out a precise plan in less than sixty seconds hakim had to admit this was where his friend shone he had a mind for such things from the moment they had arrived in afghanistan all those years ago he proved almost immediately that he was a battlefield commander karim climbed behind the wheel of the rv and pulled back onto the highway they drove the exact speed limit through branson and took some comfort in the increased traffic a few miles later they crossed the border into arkansas two miles after that they turned onto old cricket road karim saw the driveway on the left a short while later and slowed to get a better look there were two mailboxes one in perfect shape the other tilting and looking as if a strong wind might push it over karim took note of the name on the nicer box ten feet back there was a private driveway sign and a no trespassing sign karim checked the odometer and continued sixtenths of a mile later he slowed to a near crawl and gave the signal ahmed had changed into black coveralls a tactical vest and black floppy hat holding a silenced m rifle he stepped from the rv at a trot and then disappeared into the night karim picked up speed and continued down the road at a leisurely pace four miles later he pulled into a driveway with a gate he backed up and went in the direction hed just come from the motorola radio sitting in the cup holder crackled to life with ahmeds voice no sign of people one faint light karim picked up the radio and pressed the transmit button any animals not that i can see security system not that i can see karim paused dogs no are you in position yes i will be there in a minute he placed the radio back in the cup holder and began looking for the turn a short distance later he found it karim wrestled with the big wheel as he made a near degree turn he stayed to the right and a hundred feet later cruised past the turnoff for the other house at a respectful twenty miles an hour as they began the slow steady climb up the driveway ahmed announced that he could see the rv and that the situation in the house hadnt changed karim was feeling more confident by the minute that they had found the perfect place then as they swung around the rise and pulled into the courtyard the place lit up like a shopping mall parking lot two floodlights on the barn flickered to life as well as the entire front porch of the house karim slowed and grabbed the radio what is happening no movement ahmeds voice came back steady i think they are motion lights karim slowed to a stop directing the rv headlight at the front door of the house he put the vehicle in park and climbed out of the chair with the radio in one hand and his silenced mm glock in the other he exited the rv and began to walk across the gravel toward the house he glanced to his left and right and was careful to keep his gun close to his right thigh he was forty feet away when the front door opened chapter washington dc rapp turned off h street and parked the car at a yellow curb he threw a plastic police placard on the dash and looked down the length of the block at the old warehouse people were lined up from one end of the street all the way to the near corner a flock of mostly twenty and thirtysomethings moving and bobbing to the heavy bass that was rattling the grimy windows of the club the guys trended a little older the women probably six years younger the guys all wore their urban chic uniform twohundreddollar designer jeans splashy shirts and snappy shoes the hair was either really short or really long and there was a lot of stubble on the faces to rapps eye they looked as if they were all going after the eurotrash look that had been all the rage on the french riviera some ten year earlier the women were pure eye candy threeinch platform shoes and skimpy dresses of every cut and fabric and lots of heavy makeup and wild hair they looked more as if they were in line to audition porno than for a night on the town every thirty feet or so a couple of buttonedup preppy kids from the hill could be seen trying to fit in their efforts consisted of losing their ties and unbuttoning their dress shirts two whole buttons this had never been rapps scene and it sure as hell was no place for a fiftysixyearold former agency employee coleman could tell by the way his jaw was set that rapp was looking for a fight his brow was slightly knotted and he was looking at the group with a disapproving frown i know what youre thinking coleman said in an easy tone and i dont think its a good idea rapp kept his eyes on the front door what am i thinking youre thinking of jumpstarting this thing you have other shit you need to take care of and youre really not in the mood to sit around in a car all night doing surveillance rapps gaze didnt waver anything else yeah youre frustrated youre thinking this max johnson should know better and the fact that he doesnt means he deserves a good ass kicking and the russians rapp asked you dont like that they come over here and break all of our rules anything else yeah i see the way youve been eyeballing those four bouncers at the door rapp grinned youre itching coleman said in a notsohappy voice sometimes rapp said as he unbuckled his seat belt the best way to handle these situations is to force the issue these russians are nasty people mitch they dont play by the rules rapp turned to coleman and arched his left eye and we do no not exactly coleman stammered for a second but were not crazy like they are well maybe its time we get a little crazy make them feel a little uncomfortable about coming into our backyard and recruiting some jackass like johnson they dont scare easy well see about that coleman sighed he knew there was no changing rapps mind when he got like this so what are you going to do improvise and if the locals show up rapp dug into his suit coat pocket and asked you said marcus is monitoring the clubs network yes rapp pulled out a leather id case he opened it reached behind his cia id and pulled out a second laminated piece of paper this one said homeland security in dark blue block letters he slid it between the cia id and the clear plastic window he showed coleman works like a charm whos not for homeland security coleman shook his head if the cops show up im out of here and im taking my guys with me understood tell marcus that in about two minutes i want him to crash their security cameras and their phone lines and kill the mobile phone traffic whos going in rapp thought about it for a second looked at the four big guys at the door and assumed there were at least another six or eight inside i think you and i can handle it coleman half laughed and said fine but im telling mick to stay close mick reavers was colemans oneman wrecking crew he was built like an nfl linebacker only meaner fine by me rapp got out and popped the trunk while coleman issued instructions to the rest of the team he dialed in the two threedigit codes on a large black rectangular case and then slid the buttons out both hasps popped up with the thud of an oldfashioned briefcase the inside of the case consisted of a large gray block of foam sections of the foam had been cut out in the silhouette of a variety of weapons rapp already had his mm glock on his hip as was almost always the case it was loaded with subsonic hollowpoint ammunition rapp took his wallet out of his left pocket and set it next to the case he grabbed the shorter of two silencers and put it where the wallet had been rapp never went anywhere without a gun and he had all the proper paperwork to carry the thing anywhere he wanted but even so the quickest way to land yourself in hot water was to fire your weapon in the district whether the action was warranted or not the district was very sensitive to gunplay rapp looked toward the door and considered the crowd he wasnt going to go in without a gun but he would have to be in big trouble before he used it the glock would be for defensive purposes only he stared at the cutouts trying to decide between several other lessthanlethal options there was the pepper spray but it wasnt exactly his favorite especially in a crowded place like a club if you used enough of it the next thing you knew it got sucked into the ventilation system and the entire place would empty as if there were a fire people coughing and spitting emergency crews showing up to give medical aid that was the type of thing that might attract a local tv station rapp didnt want to cause that kind of stir if he could avoid it he decided on an expandable tactical baton an asp f in a small belt holster it was a heavy black piece of steel about eight inches in length with a foam grip with the proper flick of the wrist the eight inches extended to twentyone it was a nasty little weapon that was great to use against bigger people with long reaches it also worked well if you needed to clear a path through a crowd of people a couple of flicks and people would start moving like spooked cattle rapp hooked the asp onto his belt on his right side and then decided on one more thing he grabbed a taser x and two extra cartridges it looked pretty much like a gun except parts of it were yellow he put the two extra cartridges in his front right pocket and stuffed the taser between the small of his back and his pants coleman joined him at the back of the car and rapp asked do you need anything coleman looked at the case as if he were shopping for watches is that your new m rifle yep ill take it funny rapp handed him the pepper spray and said dont use it unless you really think we need it got it coleman hooked the bottle to his belt and buttoned his suit coat so whats your plan rapp shrugged and closed the trunk we go in like we own the place which we do this is washington not moscow and then what we grab the little prick by the scruff of his neck and we pull him out of there coleman had a worried expression on his face and if they try to stop us rapp thought about it for a second and then said a few of them will probably end up in the hospital coleman moaned ive got a bad feeling about this rapp shook it off and started walking toward the club and its four massive gatekeepers you always say that coleman fell in a half step behind and under his breath mumbled and im usually right chapter northern arkansas other than the four years hed spent in the army dan stewart had worked his entire adult life for the same employer a lowell arkansas native hed practically fallen into the job when he returned from his second tour of duty in vietnam a new lowprice retail chain just up the road was hiring stewart took a job as an assistant manager and moved to eureka springs a few hours east within a year he was rewarded for his strong work ethic by being promoted to manager and moved to branson missouri to open one of the companys new stores that was where hed met his kelly she was one of his cashiers and after a courtship of just five months he married the daughter of the local baptist preacher not a big deal for most but stewart was a methodist and in lowell arkansas the methodists were warned to stay away from the baptists and vice versa fifteen years four kids nine stores and six states later he was transferred to headquarters in bentonville arkansas and promoted to senior management the timing was perfect in the sense that it allowed all four kids to put down some roots and attend bentonville high school the kids all graduated and three of them went on to college and one joined the army like his dad as the years trickled by stewart took part in the employer stock plan during all those moves he had promised kelly they would return to branson when he finally stopped working it was during his thirtyninth year with walmart that she found out they had accumulated over three hundred thousand shares of preferred stock with the price hovering around fifty dollars a share at the time the math was not difficult on his fortieth anniversary with the company his wife forced him into retirement they bought a cabin on table rock lake where kelly had spent the summers of her youth after the first year stewart bought the hobby farm just down the road kellys relatives seemed to drop by the lake a little too frequently and he was getting way too much crap from his friends for living in missouri so he convinced his wife they needed the hobby farm so he could store all of his stuff and avoid paying the outrageous missouri taxes stewart was sound asleep in his big leather recliner when his german shepherd started to make noise her name was razor the third two and three had lasted ten and eleven years and the third was going on nine she was a good dog perfectly obedient to her master protective of kelly and reasonably tolerant of the grandkids stewart was sleeping in the chair because his shoulder was giving him problems hed been putting off surgery for years and had finally decided it was time to fix the darn thing all of his friends were playing golf and hunting and he was in so much pain he could do neither he came to hearing the low growl of razor and then she let loose two unhappy barks stewart was about to shush her when the exterior lights snapped on and then he could hear the grumble of an engine stewart was a motor guy and he could tell immediately it was not a car it was something bigger he pushed forward in the chair dropping the footrest and springing to his feet the blanket fell to the floor and he watched as the headlights washed across the opposite wall above the tv the first thing he thought of was the meth heads who had been causing all the trouble with local law enforcement over the past few years there had been a home invasion at the lake just after christmas an elderly couple had been beaten tied up and robbed at gunpoint stewart had vowed he would never let a couple of hoppedup pieces of white trash get the draw on him he yanked open the front hall closet and stuck his hand in shoving the collection of fall winter and spring jackets from the right to the left without his having to look his right hand found the back corner and the cold tempered steel of his remington shotgun he closed the closet door threw back the bolt on the main door and opened it stewart stepped into the cool evening air wearing a pair of maroon arkansas razorbacks pajamas his grandkids had given him for his sixtysixth birthday his bare feet hit the whitepainted porch razor growled at his side showing her menacing teeth stewart saw a man coming at him out of the nearblinding white lights on the front of a big motor home he racked a shell into the chamber and flipped off the safety with the smooth practiced motion of a man who had hunted game since he was seven he kept the muzzle pointed at the intruders feet and said whos there and what in the hell do you want the next part happened fast somewhere to his right stewart heard a slapping noise and then he heard razors nails sliding around on the glossy porch floorboards as if she were wearing roller skates and then she was down stewart glanced at her to see what was wrong and right as he noticed the blood pooling against the white backdrop of the porch something big and heavy smacked him in the upper left chest there was no time to figure out what it was he was spinning and falling his bare feet giving him no traction he landed hard on his left side the shotgun clattering away as it bounced down the steps another moment passed and stewarts brain still wasnt processing what had happened but as he lay there a warmth began to spread beneath his left side stewart realized hed been shot he thought of razor for a second and then his wife he heard a scraping noise on the gravel and knew it was the shotgun being picked up then there were footfalls on the porch steps slow and deliberate stewart tried to crane his neck around to see who it was but a stabbing pain in his left shoulder stopped him the intruder used his foot to roll him onto his back stewart winced in pain and clutched his shoulder as he took in the shadowy figure standing above him what do you want stewart asked in a painlaced voice how many people in the house stewart had never met a meth head but this man sounded far too calm and he had an accent he couldnt place its just my wife and me take whatever you need and leave us alone we havent hurt anyone stewart could see the shotgun in one hand and something else in the other the man began to point the mystery object at him and stewart realized a split second before he died that it was a gun chapter washington dc rapp was still wearing his dark suit and white shirt he didnt bother unbuttoning the shirt an extra button he was either a threebutton or twobutton guy hed never really put any thought into it but he knew he wasnt a fourbutton guy way too much skin and hair with his scruffy facial hair rapp did not scream cop or fed the way coleman did the retired seal officer was in a blue sport coat black polo shirt pleated khaki dress pants and thicksoled laceup black dress shoes anyone with a decent amount of experience would notice the bulges under their jackets and guess that they were carrying rapp used to blending in had to consciously tell himself to act more like a cop make his fluid movements a touch more robotic and instead of avoiding eye contact make sure he made it kept it and left no doubt who was in charge he decided to cross the street directly across from the front door rather than at an angle as he stepped off the curb he sized up the four bouncers three of them were black and one of them was white big fellas with big legs big arms big chests and big necks they were easy to pick out since they were in black jeans and black polo shirts and they were two to three times larger than anyone else in the vicinity when rapp was five steps from the sidewalk one of the black guys did a sweep of the area and noticed the two men coming for them his eyes screwed in on them and his face betrayed a split second of surprise that these two were different from all the other partiers they dealt with rapp locked eyes with the man and headed straight for him no one was wearing any indication of rank so it was impossible to see who was in charge instincts told him though that the most alert of the four would be the best place to start rapp stopped just his side of the velvet ropes and glanced over the guys broad shoulder at the open doorway through a crack in the red velvet curtain he could see strobes and silhouettes of bobbing and swaying people loud music with a heavy thrumming bass rolled out the door and hit them like a strong gusting wind rapp put his eyes back on the big man rapp was six feet tall and he figured with the pitch of the sidewalk running away from the building to the curb the guy was probably a few inches shorter than he looked rapp guessed he was about six and a half feet tall the height didnt concern rapp the taller the better when it came to a street fight and if you wanted proof all you had to do was watch an ultimate fighting championship match the big guys had the reach but their center of gravity was way too high for norules fighting rapp opened his suit coat on the left side and reached into the breast pocket he watched as the bouncers eyes moved down to his waist the guy noted the gun on rapps left hip and didnt bat an eye rapp pulled out the id case in a smooth onehanded motion and held it open next to his right ear so the bouncer wouldnt have to work too hard the guys eyes flickered back and forth and then he nodded and said whats up national security nothing to do with the club directly i just need to get in there and talk to someone the bouncer started to answer but was stopped by another bouncer who had been standing next to the door this guy was even taller he had to be sixnine and easily tipped the scales at plus pounds his white head was cleanshaven and tattoos peeked out from under his shirtsleeves and collar rapp noted a hammerandsickle tattoo with a sword on the mans forearm he repeated what hed already said to the other bouncer and for good measure held up the homeland security id the big white bouncer reached out to grab the id case and rapp took a step back in a cool voice rapp said im not going to cause you any trouble i just need to talk to someone no the man had a foul look on his face you have paper he asked with a thick russian accent paper rapp asked having no idea what the guy was talking about the big russian snapped his fingers several times while he searched for the right translation warrant he said finally coming up with the word you must have warrant no warrant no come in rapp looked at the big black guy and said hes not serious the black guy gave rapp a shrug that said he was the wrong guy to ask rapp looked back at the russian and said let me see your passport the russian made a big show of patting himself down as if he were searching for the proper documentation then with a smartass smile he said sorry no passport then you better let me in or im going to have to arrest you the man laughed at rapp come back with warrant no warrant piss off rapp watched as he made a shooing gesture with his hands as if he was trying to send a doortodoor salesman on his way rapp glanced at coleman who was already looking over his shoulder wondering where reavers was three options rapp said in a loud voice the first i ignore the fact that youre a rude son of a bitch and you get out of my way second you decide not to let me in so i arrest you for obstructing a federal agent and i have you deported with all the other russian assholes who were picked up this week and the third the russian asked as he defiantly folded his big arms across his enormous chest third rapp said as he cocked his head to his left i kick your ass and leave you bleeding and crying here on the sidewalk your choice and to show you im not a bad guy ill even give you a second to think about it while the big russian stood there like a statue rapp turned and walked over to coleman in a voice that only the two of them could hear rapp said call marcus and tell him to jam everything there are probably more russians inside the club i dont need these guys calling for reinforcements when this guy goes down what are you going to do coleman asked im going to drop the asshole before he even knows what hit him rapp looked back over his shoulder and gave the big man the onceover from the heavy soles of his black boots to his shiny bald head there are a lot of ways to take down a man every guy is different different strengths and different weaknesses big guys like this all had one weakness in common and rapp had already scoped it out this thing would be finished before the guy even knew itd started rapp was sure of that his only real concern had to do with the other three big locals giants like these guys were easy to handle one at a time but in groups they could be a problem all they had to do after all was get their arms around you and fall to the ground if you got caught between them and something really hard like a concrete sidewalk you were bound to break a few ribs rapp saw reavers crossing the street and decided it was safe to start his presence might be enough to give the other three bouncers pause rapp turned and marched straight back to the russian he stopped one pace away and placed his right hand on his hip and his left hand on the hilt of his gun so whats it going to be the russian kept his arms folded across his chest each fist was stuffed under an armpit in a show of immovable defiance how do you say in english he said again searching for the right word how do i say what in english rapp checked the mans feet again they were shoulderwidth apart feet planted firmly on the ground knees barely flexed this guy was used to intimidating people the russians face lit up with a smile and he said go fuck yourself freedom of speech right god bless the usa and fuck all the cops fuck all the cops rapp repeated in a voice loud enough that it would get the attention of the other bouncers and some of the people in line that is right you americans think we russians are stupid but we know your laws you cant do shit you are a cop you cant touch me rapp smiled and nodded he kept nodding and leaned in a little farther he got up on his toes and lowered his voice so it would stay between the two of them i like your theory but theres only one problem with it im not a cop rapp turned as if he were going to walk away he took one step with his left foot and then started to lift his right foot off the ground everything looked normal there wasnt a single sign that would betray what was about to happen the toe of his right shoe touched the ground for an instant and then he moved rapps left leg flexed and his upper body leaned forward his head turned to the right and then in one lightningfast move rapps right leg shot out like a donkey delivering a kick the heel of his shoe landed directly on top of the russians right kneecap and kept going driving the knee past the vertical line and folding the leg back in the wrong direction a healthy knee would not have been able to take the blow let alone one that had been carrying around an extra pounds for a good decade the snapping noise of the knee joint breaking was followed by the crunching sound of tendons tearing away from various bones rapp held his strike at maximum extension for only a fraction of a second and then he was away like a lumberjack clearing the area in case the tree kicked back at him the russian stayed upright for another second and it seemed like an eternity rapps right hand slid around his belt found the heavy black baton and yanked it free he watched as the russian began to teeter to his right rapp knew exactly what was about to happen the brain hadnt registered the catastrophic failure of the right knee its internal gyroscope was telling the body that it needed to place weight on the right leg to prevent toppling over it was something the brain did on autopilot a million times a day and it always worked unless some external force got in the way or the right knee had just been shattered the russian didnt even scream there wasnt time he just kept tipping to his right stepped as if he was going to catch himself and then when the full weight of his plus pounds started to come down on the bad knee it folded in the middle like a cheap card table chair he hit the sidewalk hard even though his arms reached out to slow his fall his right temple bounced off the hard dirty surface and landed facing the toe of his right boot that was when the screaming started chapter rapp figured he had five minutes to get in and out before things got heated maybe as much as fifteen but that was pushing it shutting down the phones and radios would certainly delay things but the cops had to patrol this neighborhood on a pretty regular basis rapp could handle the cops if he had to but he didnt feel like spending the night calling in favors and then having to explain himself for the next two days the whole point of tonights exercise was to take this particular problem off the burner and put it behind him life would be a lot easier if he simply marched in grabbed johnson by the scruff of his neck and dragged his lame ass out of the joint simple and direct rapp knew all about momentum in a situation like this the best thing was to keep moving more often than not if you had the right bearing and you acted as if you were in charge people followed your lead rapp looked at the first bouncer and flicked his wrist in a hard downward motion the two extendable sections of the baton snapped out and into a locked position with a hard click rapp pointed the stick at the big bouncer and said i gave him three choices you only get two the bouncer looked down at the big bald russian he was writhing on the cement swearing in his native tongue and staring in shock at his knee rapp said you either take me to peter sidorov or you spend the next three days in the dc lockup with every other shithead and drug addict in the city youre a big guy but theyre like hyenas in there they attack in packs they might not be able to rape you but theyll probably cut you and then you can spend the next year wondering if you have aids the bouncer hesitated for maybe a half second and then undid the velvet rope and gestured for rapp to follow him rapp looked at coleman and said you stay here and keep an eye on things mick rapp said looking at reavers come with me the big bouncer led them through the front door rapp followed two paces behind and then reavers a long bar with a galvanized top ran for a good hundred feet along the left side of the old warehouse exposed metal trusses ran from left to right rapp paused for half a step to scope out the high ground old warehouses like this one often had a catwalk but this one didnt with one sweep of the place rapp noted four more bouncers dressed like the four guys out front to the right was a dance floor with an elevated dj booth the place was packed and their pace slowed as they threaded their way through the crowd rapp saw where they were headed a few steps later there was a vip section at the far end a set of stairs on the left and another one on the right led up maybe six feet to a big area that was probably eighty feet wide by twenty feet deep there was a steel column every ten feet that acted as a divider between the individual vip seating areas red velvet curtains hung in front of each area swooping down from the rafters to where they were tied off around the columns through the openings in the drapes rapp could see couches and chairs revelers standing and sitting and in far dark corners probably doing things that could get them arrested the music was loud so loud that rapp figured he wouldnt need to bother with the silencer if he had to start shooting people they reached the base of the stairs for the vip area and the big black bouncer slowly climbed four treads and he and another monster began screaming into each others ears rapp noted the tattoos on the mans neck and wondered if his theory was flawed this guy was a lot like the other russian hed just crippled except he had hair the world of the russian mafia and their tattoos was a strange one over there you could get killed for wearing a tattoo that you hadnt earned but here in the states rapp wasnt so sure were these guys the real thing or a couple o wannabes trying to intimidate by putting some ink on their skin the new guy finished listening to the big black guy gave rapp the universal stop motion with his hand then disappeared into the dim recesses of the vip area rapp immediately worried there was a back door up there somewhere if johnson had half a brain and he found out a federal agent was in the building he would bolt momentum he reminded himself keep moving forward basic battlefield doctrine never give your opponent a chance to get his shit together rapp did a quick of the area he noted two bouncers within sight but they werent looking his way rapp smiled as he saw them fiddling with their radios that alone would cause a diversion with them focused on trying to fix their radios rapp saw his opening looking over his shoulder at reavers rapp waited for the big guy to lean in reavers stepped forward and placed his ear near rapps mouth i dont want him sneaking out the back door im going to tase this big fella here step around to my right and shield me when i hit him help me lower him nice and slow reavers nodded rapp looked up at the big black bouncer and started to move his lips the bouncer couldnt hear so he leaned forward and turned his head away from rapp offering his right ear rapps left hand slid inside his jacket and around his waist he grabbed the taser and kept it close to his body as he started to ask the bouncer about a back door he turned his body a shade to the left and with his right hand grabbed the tip of the taser and removed the cartridge with the two contacts exposed he leaned in real close and placed the contacts on the mans lower back only a few inches from his spinal column rapp squeezed the trigger and instantly fifty thousand volts passed from the plastic gun into the big guys body while he went rigid rapp kept the prongs pressed into him and was careful to make sure their bodies didnt touch he counted to three in his head and then withdrew the taser reavers was right there as the big guy started to go down reavers grabbed him by the shoulders and slowly lowered him so that he was lying on the steps rapp snapped the cartridge back into the taser and slid it back into his belt at the small of his back at this point he didnt bother to look left or right to check on the other bouncers he went up the stairs when he hit the landing at the top his eyes swept the area they were drawn to a space midway down on the left the russian bouncer who had gestured for him to wait was talking to two guys in suits they were both bigger than rapp but smaller than the mammoth bouncers these would be the real professionals probably former special forces but not necessarily russian they might even be local guys which rapp would welcome beyond the three men rapp caught a glimpse of max johnson sitting on the couch with two women draped over him the big russian saw rapp said something to the man in the suit and marched off with a really pissedoff look on his face to intercept the two unwelcome visitors rapp showed his hands palms out and up in an effort to sucker the guy into continuing his headlong march toward him rapp kept moving as well closing the distance at a deceptive pace rapp lowered his left hand a notch making his right hand the more presentable target he watched the sixandahalffoottall brownhaired russian take the bait and begin reaching for his target now was the moment of decision for rapp at this juncture he had several options the solar plexus was out because of the guys girth there were too many layers of fat to get through to deliver an incapacitating blow the second option was the chin but as rapp took a final good look he noticed the guy had some pretty decent traps traps short for trapeziuses were the muscles that anchored a guys head to the rest of the body and the more developed they were the harder it was to knock a guy out the last and best option carried a risk with it but rapp wasnt too worried this wasnt exactly some innocent bystander out on the street at the exact moment the bouncers beefy fingertips were about to grab rapps right wrist rapp uncoiled he sprang off his left foot and transferred about percent of his weight onto his right foot as his hips rotated the big man never saw it coming for a move like this both the closed fist and the open palm were too big to make the precise strike so rapp had to use a knuckle strike rapps first set of knuckles on his left hand folded under so the tips of his fingers were touching the pads of his palm his left arm formed a battering ram from the elbow down to the jagged second set of knuckles the target was one of the weakest points on the human bodythe adams apple lots of cartilage and soft tissue it didnt matter how good or tough you were if you got hit with a direct strike to the adams apple you were going down there was only one problem with the move if it was delivered too forcefully you could kill a man just as rapp was throwing the blow an image flashed before his eyes it was of the big russian rolling around on the carpet clutching his throat and dying from a crushed windpipe it was that image that caused rapp to lay off a touch and that was his first mistake chapter northern arkansas hakim took a bit of comfort in the fact that the old woman had died in her sleep he wasnt in the room when it had happened but hed heard the mechanical clank of the slide jerk back and then forward and the spit of the mm round as the gases were vented through the silencer hed watched the old man die on the porch first he didnt know why but he wanted to see it with his own eyes with his broken and bruised body he pulled himself out of bed and hobbled his way to the front of the rv he watched his friend raise the gun and shoot the old man from a distance of no more than a few feet there was another brief flash from the muzzle and the body convulsed one last time hakim had killed before in the mountains of afghanistan and pakistan but never so closeso personal they were just silhouettes in the distance he considered how difficult it must be to see every wrinkle and misplaced hair to know the exact eye color of the person whose life you were extinguishing would those eyes come back to haunt your dreams for hakim the answer was yes but for his friend he wondered did anything really get to him was there a line he would not cross hakim stared through the windscreen and then watched with increasing concern as his friend climbed the porch steps and moved into the house with great effort hakim climbed down the rv steps and moved as quickly as his broken and battered body would allow he climbed the porch steps no more than five seconds behind karim he looked down at the lifeless carcass of the dog and the old man who had been literally shot between the eyes he moved with increasing alarm he didnt know why but he was convinced there were children in the house no matter what the maniacal clerics said allah would never condone the killing of children in the foyer hakim paused there was a staircase straight ahead and a hallway just to the left farther to the left there was a tv room there was a big leather chair and a matching footstool a blanket was in a pile on the floor that must have been where the old man was when they pulled in that would explain why he was up so fast and was able to intercept karim outside he hobbled over to the chair to confirm his theory he touched the leather chair it was still warm from the body heat of the man that was when he heard the faint yet distinctly mechanical clank and spit of the suppressed glock firing a round the sound did not come from the second floor the headlights of the rv were still spilling through the big picture window on his left as he looked in the direction of the sound he saw karim come through a doorway at the back of the house he raised his weapon and pointed it directly at hakim and then something very strange happened hakim had thought of death before but he had never welcomed it now it felt like a warm blanket against a cold biting wind he was ready to wrap himself in it and fade away face whatever judgment waited for him in the afterlife based on what he had allowed to happen the last few days he doubted he would see paradise you idiot karims voice cut like a knife through the dark still house i nearly shot you he moved across the room quickly his footfalls silent on the carpet stay put while i check upstairs as he walked past hakim reached out and grabbed his arm we do not have to kill every person we encounter his friend angrily shook himself free and moved swiftly upstairs after he had disappeared hakim walked to the back of the house he stood at the bedroom door and hesitated it was dark inside but he could easily discern the shape of the bed and the nightstands and lamps the near side of the bed was flat and undisturbed the far side had a lump hakim sighed and without making a conscious decision his feet were moving they carried him across the room to the side of the bed where he guessed the mans wife had been lying doing what billions of people do every nightsleep how had she offended islam could someone be an infidel if she was asleep in her own house thousands of miles from the heart of islam in a largely christian country hakim stood over the shape and willed himself to look closer to confront yet another evil perpetrated by his best friend at first he could only make out a silhouette under the covers and a head on a white pillowcase he bent farther and the features of the womans face became clearer then he saw it a dark circle at the womans temple no bigger than a small coin hakim reached out and turned on the bedside lamp the red pucker mark was surrounded by a circle of gray karim had shot her pointblank the tip of the muzzle no more than a few inches from her skin he had expected to see an elderly woman but instead saw someone who looked to be in her early sixties with many years left to live until they picked her house hakim felt sickened by the whole thing he turned off the lamp and walked back into the tv room he stopped at the fireplace and looked at the photos arrayed on the mantel lots of kids school photos sports photos and photos of family vacations hakim guessed they were grandchildren he could barely breathe he closed his eyes and prayed and listened listened for the clank and the spit of karims gun he prayed that the kids were not here he could not take any more senseless killing not tonight maybe never again he asked allah for guidance asked him if this was truly what he wanted and when he didnt hear from him he made a promise to allah it was a bargain he would follow through on his end of the deal and he hoped that allah would keep up his end of the bargain shortly after that karim came downstairs and announced that the upstairs was empty then he radioed ahmed and told him to make a quick sweep of the perimeter before coming in hakim breathed a sigh of relief but he didnt have much time to enjoy it he felt a slight tickle in his throat and then he began to cough at first it didnt seem unusual but then he felt the coppery taste of blood in his mouth he moved to the chair where the man had been sitting and managed to fall into it just as he blacked out chapter washington dc this russian was quicker than he looked rapp figured he must have twisted into the blow at the last second blunting rapps strike and causing him to miss by a fraction the russians throat would be a little sore in the morning and he wouldnt be eating any tacos for a few days but his windpipe was intact and in working condition that meant he would have no trouble sucking oxygen into those big lungs and in turn providing fresh blood to those big arms and that was a problem fights tended to follow a pattern and for rapp it was usually pretty predictable it started and five seconds later it was over rapp on his feet and the other guy on the ground clutching some part of his body that would need a doctor to fix so when his first strike missed it was like a symphony conductor hearing a poorly played note the audience might not have caught it but he knew it and he knew he had to do something fast or this big guy would get hold of him and hed be the one in need of a doctors attention the other thing rapp did was reevaluate his opponent moving into a blow was not the tactic of an amateur pros leaned in rookies leaned back and if you never learned to move into the blow you werent long for this roughandtumble world as rapp withdrew his strike he felt the hand of the russian clamping down on his right wrist rapp yanked his right hand down hard and rotated it clockwise at the same time he delivered a quick rabbit punch to the russians nose not hard enough to break it but enough to make him bleed and maybe stun him for a second rapp made his first retreat with his right wrist free he hopped back a step and that was when he felt more than saw the guys massive right fist screaming toward the left side of his head another move every fighter has to learn is a standing turtle theres nothing pretty about it you simply tuck your chin into your chest bring your shoulders up and prepare to receive a few blows the punch glanced off the top left side of rapps head rapp registered the stinging pain but ignored it when a guy this big throws that big a punch he almost always leaves himself open rapp found the opening he ducked slid to the left and delivered a hammer punch just beneath the guys right armpit where the ribs are most exposed the brutal punch stood the big man up as he arched his back and tried to step away from the next blow then three things happened in quick succession rapp eyed his spot it was the back of the guys right knee just above the top of the calf always the knees with these big guys that was their most vulnerable point rapp stomped down hard with his right foot this time the joint would be working with him the guy wouldnt go to the hospital but he would be going down and for now that was all rapp cared about he had other things to do that were more important as the big russian started his tumble reavers stepped in and hit him with a perfectly placed right hook that snapped the russians head a quarter turn to the right it was as if someone unplugged the guy he went down on one knee his arms dangled his shoulders slouched he started to topple forward and although rapp couldnt see it he knew the guys eyes were rolling back in his head that was when the third thing happened rapp spun to go after max johnson and found himself facetoface with the muzzle of a sig sauer pistol one more fucking move and i blow your head off the english was perfect the accent a slight southern drawl most likely texas or oklahoma the face lined and weathered rapp guessed him to be in his midthirties you wanna shoot a federal agent in the head you go right ahead theyll ship you back to texas and fry your ass the guy blinked thought about it for a minute and said show me your id nice and slow rapp carefully reached into his jacket pocket withdrew his id and flipped it open he watched as the bodyguard glanced back and forth between rapps face and the id rapp knew what was going through his mind so he asked who do you work for triple canopy they were good one of the best which meant this guy was more than likely pretty levelheaded im oga attached to homeland security while im back here in the states you guys do a lot of work with us over in afghanistan and iraq the guy nodded rapp hadnt said a lot but he didnt need to oga stood for other government agency which anyone who worked for triple canopy and had been over to the sand box knew was a polite way of saying cia mentioning all of the work that triple canopy did for langley was a subtle reminder that while sidorov might be paying a small fortune for protection the cia the state department and the dod were paying a real fortune to the tune of about a half billion a year to triple canopy and its subsidiaries rapp said i just need a word with your employer not going to happen he wont talk to anyone who has anything to do with our government youre supposed to go through his lawyers rapp wondered what kind of trouble sidorov had gotten himself into he motioned for the guy to point his gun in a lessthreatening direction the guy took a step back and pointed his weapon at the floor rapp asked you spend any time in moscow the guy shook his head well i have and let me tell you something they dont use warrants over there if the fsb wants to talk to you they dont ask for permission they talk to you and its typically not very pleasant now i dont want sidorov at least not yet but if he pisses me off any more than he already has im going to take a real hard look at him and it wont be pleasant the guy i want is sitting right over there rapp pointed to the big horseshoe sitting area where sidorov and his party were set up there were only four men the rest were women the bodyguard turned you mean the older guy in the jeans and loud shirt and funny glasses thats him rapp shook his head johnson was dressed like one of the twentyfiveyearold kids on the dance floor he hadnt seen him in maybe a year but he still recognized him hed grown his hair out a bit and even in the soft light of the lounge area rapp could tell he was dyeing it dark brown it also looked as if he had grown a patch of hair under his bottom lip in an effort to look hip the guy holstered his sidearm let me see what sidorov says wait here as the first guy retreated to talk to his boss the second guy filled his place and blocked the path rapp frowned and stepped forward to talk to him marines army navy seals rapp laughed the guy was a virtual replica of reavers normally seals were of the smaller variety as rapp motioned for reavers to join him he made eye contact with johnson who had finally managed to tear his eyes away from the wellendowed woman sitting on his left johnsons face went blank his lips parted and then he blinked several times as if he wasnt sure what he was looking at rapps expression was not friendly he pointed at johnson and then gestured with two fingers for him to come to him johnson got up but instead of coming to rapp he joined the bodyguard and sidorov a heated exchange ensued rapp couldnt hear a word but he could tell johnson was loudly stating his case and sidorov appeared to be agreeing with him the clock in rapps head told him they were close to the fiveminute mark he needed to wrap it up the bodyguard left sidorov and johnson and came back shaking his head sorry he said when he was within a few feet he says no go he wants you guys out of his club right now you dont want to do this rapp said ominously hes one client and he isnt even an american in ten seconds i can have director kennedy on the phone ten seconds after that shell have the chairman of triple canopys board on the phone and thirty seconds after that your phone will ring and youll be fired and for what your protection order is for sidorov not some rat bastard whos selling his governments secrets listen i dont want to be caught in the middle of this then dont be step aside sixty seconds from now ill be gone and sidorov can bitch all he wants but it isnt going to get him anywhere once your bosses talk to director kennedy theyll give you a promotion and theyll politely tell sidorov to pound sand i dont know well i do step aside this is national security way above your pay grade im doing you a favor the guy finally nodded and stepped back rapp wasnt going to wait for him to change his mind he moved forward quickly and entered the pit where sidorov and his crew were sprawled out johnson was now one woman over from sidorov rapp ignored the russian and pointed at johnson get up he made the same getoverhere motion with his two fingers right now sidorov stood saying something in russian before switching to english you are not welcome here i must ask you to leave rapp pulled out the id case for the last time flashed it at sidorov and said national security stay out of it i know who you are mr rapp this is not russia the cia has no authority to arrest people rapp turned to look at sidorov for the first time he was a handsome man with thick brown hair parted to the side high cheek bones and deepset eyes stay out of this i dont care how much money you have i am not someone you want to pick a fight with mr rapp rapp put his nose to within a foot of sidorovs and said let me tell you something normally im not one to follow the law but this little asshole here is in violation of a half dozen national security statutes now i dont care how many cabinet members you own or how many senators you play golf with hes off the reservation and its my job to bring him back so you can either get the fuck out of my way or end up in the hospital like that big ugly russian bouncer you have out front sidorov snorted looked at rapp with bemusement and then took a step back i have heard a great many stories about you from my associates in the russian intelligence services then you should know im serious i see that you are not to be deterred thats right sidorov looked at rapp for a long moment and then said i would like to make one request of you whats that a meeting a meeting rapp asked not quite sure what in hell the russian was talking about with you mr rapp there are certain things i would like to ask you rapp glanced at his watch he needed to get out of here a concession that he would never follow through with was harmless ill check my calendar but dont expect me to roll over for a bunch of cash like this piece of shit rapp pointed at johnson sidorov offered up a business card you are not the type of man who betrays his country mr rapp i wouldnt be so stupid as to insult you we have some mutual areas of interest that i think would be worth exploring rapp took the card and said fair enough ill give you a call he walked over to a terrified max johnson who grabbed the nearest girl and hung on for dear life get up rapp ordered johnson shook his head and drew the girl closer rapp reached over the girl and grabbed johnsons left ear he gave it a good twist and then yanked johnson to his feet rapp grabbed one arm reavers grabbed the other and they dragged him out of the club chapter rapp stuffed johnson in the back of his car with coleman they started driving east away from the fbi the justice department the supreme court and pretty much anything else that might represent legal protection for johnson with each passing block the houses fell into increasing disrepair this seemed to add to johnsons agitated mental state like someone who was afraid of the water being driven farther and farther out to sea johnson was not able to keep his cool he pissed and moaned and begged and pleaded the entire way after traveling twelve blocks they pulled into an alley just off the railroad tracks rapp had ordered two of colemans guys to scope out the place in advance it was on the fringe of one of dcs more inhospitable neighborhoods dilapidated abandoned rustedout warehouses dotted the area around the railroad tracks it was the perfect place to kill a man and dump his body the setting put johnson over the edge he took one look at the two toughlooking guys standing next to the van and started sobbing rapp would have laughed at johnsons lessthannoble performance but he was experiencing the front end of a nasty headache that was no doubt the result of the punch hed taken to the side of his head the alley was strewn with garbage an abandoned mattress was leaned up against a wooden utility pole with a shredded tire sitting next to it the floodlight that hung from the pole had long ago been shot out probably by some local gang bangers coleman dragged johnson from the backseat and stood him up the two guys grabbed him and slapped on a pair of plastic flex cuffs johnson stood motionless for a moment looking at the cuffs trying to decide if this was a good or bad development with moist eyes and a pleading voice he said mitch please dont do this there are things you dont know you have to give me a chance to explain myself i havent done anything for sidorov i only johnson never finished the sentence because rapp unleashed a backhanded slap that caught him flush on the side of the face in the relative quiet of the alley it sounded like a thunderclap shut up and listen rapp said if i hear another fucking lie come out of your mouth im going to kill you right here rapp pointed at the ground right here in this frickin alley with ratshit all over the place and god only knows what else but people saw me leave with you you cant rapp raised his hand again and it was enough to silence johnson i dont know if youve noticed but people are a little more concerned about getting hit by another terrorist attack nobody gives a shit about you youre a retired rentacop who was whoring himself out to a russian billionaire thats not true i have friends he stammered who i was working with important people who will want to know what happened to me rapp wanted to mention glen adams but didnt youre a fucking traitor and a liar and youll say whatever you think will save your miserable ass but youve got one problem max i dont need a polygraph to figure out if youre bullshitting me unlike you ive spent my entire career in the field i dont have a support staff and the latest and greatest technology to get the job done i dont have anything against you ive always admired you see now thats an interesting example right there rapp said to coleman he didnt lie but he didnt tell the truth he may not have anything against me specifically and he probably has a grudging respect for some of the things ive done but ill bet you my entire pension that he thinks im a cowboy and that i dont give the other people at langley enough credit which is a true statement coleman said exactly but hes either too afraid to say it because he thinks ill hurt him or hes a pathological liar in which case were all wasting our time so which is it rapp asked johnson johnson was confused i dont understand are you too big a coward to tell me the truth or are you a pathological liar i he stammered im neither im just really really scared right now this isnt fair there is no fair in espionage you asshole this field shit isnt as fun as it looks is it a little easier hanging behind the secure perimeter of langley where youre the only sheriff in town isnt it its not how it looks i wasnt doing anything wrong rapp wanted to reach out and choke him tell him to hand over the tapes that hed made from lewiss office but he needed to keep that ace buried in the hole for a while maybe forever his voice dripping with sarcasm rapp said really im sure a goodlooking billionaire like sidorov is hanging out with you because youre a real hit with the ladies right johnson didnt answer tell me did you bother to inform langley about your new friend rapp knew he hadnt but asked anyway im not in bed with him answer my question i told certain people but nothing had been put in writing i was waiting to see how serious things got rapp glanced at coleman and then without bothering to make eye contact with johnson he unleashed another vicious backhanded slap johnson yelped like a kid rapp slid his mm glock from his holster and began screwing the black cylindrical silencer onto the end heres how this works left foot right foot left knee right knee most guys pass out when you get to the first knee you i dont think youll make it past the second foot rapp pointed the gun at johnsons left foot and took aim wait johnson screamed i was working for him all right but it was all background stuff nothing that had anything to do with national security again a half truth rapp said you were working for him but dont try to make it sound like you were doing anything remotely legal i never said legal rapp looked down took aim and fired the weapon a small hole appeared on the outside of jonsons left foot a second later blood began oozing out of the puncture and then johnson started screaming one of colemans guys had a rag ready to go and he shoved it into johnsons mouth rapp checked his watch all four men stood there watching johnson writhe in pain fifteen seconds later rapp pulled the rag out of johnsons mouth before he could ask another question johnson began blabbing rapp listened to a good minute of it johnson had been doing nothing even remotely legal for sidorov and if the power players in washington found out what hed been up to they would gladly pay rapp every penny in their war chests to have the problem dealt with in a very final way rapp took the rag and shoved it back into johnsons mouth he walked to the rear of the van and coleman followed him take him to the quarry put him in a cell and give him a notepad and a pen have him write it all down chapter and verse everything hes done for sidorov can i dangle a carrot hell yeah dangle it all you want hit him over the head with it i dont care coleman looked doubtful can i dangle it in good conscience hell yeah this little snake has some talent if i can trust him id rather have him working for us than freelancing shooting him in the foot may not have been the best way of recruiting him rapp shook off the concern i shot him through the outside of the foot no permanent damage in two weeks hell be completely healed still coleman gave him a disapproving frown i still might kill him so dont go all naval academy on me a lot of people saw you tonight if he vanishes there will be questions it wouldnt be the first time and once people find out what he was doing they might not look so hard to find him should i call doc no rapp shook his head i want to keep him out of it for now have johnson write down everything he can think of every single time hes strayed off the reservation you think theres more than just this sidorov thing and the job he was doing for adams who knows but this could be a gold mine tell the boys to give him a little vicodin just enough to take the edge off but keep him awake ill be back out there a bit before seven and i want him edgy rapp leaned back and looked around the corner of the van johnson was balancing on one foot and crying rapp shook his head in disgust and said and if hes dumb enough to hold back on the little dirty op he was running with adams well then youre going to have a hard time talking me out of killing him chapter fairfax county virginia rapp woke up at fivethirty looked around his spartan bedroom and thought of his dog he supposed most therapists would tell him that was progress since his deceased wife wasnt the first thing on his mind time really was the great healer not that he was healed but he was at least coping better before anna he never remembered waking up and feeling alone hed never really been that attached to anyone now waking up in an empty house even one that she had never lived in didnt feel right hence missing shirley the mutt more often than not the border collie mix stayed with the kennedys where irenes son tommy would take care of her rapp paid him at first but after a while tommy wouldnt let him hed grown too attached to shirley and with rapps awkward travel schedule she stayed with tommy more than she stayed with him she was a great dog smart as hell and very loyal rapp wished people were more like her rapp really wasnt one to lie around and wallow in his own misery and he had a lot to do so he rolled out of bed and hit the floor the first ten pushups were always slow he had to get the blood moving through the shoulders first this morning he had the added thrill of a throbbing skull the next forty were done at a precise clip every time he lowered his chest and hit the bottom the pain in his left temple peaked and he was reminded of the big russian who had almost knocked his head off rapp smiled though because as bad as he felt the bouncer would be far worse this morning that was the way of the competitive mind as long as you came out on top all pain was manageable after the pushups rapp flipped over and rattled off a hundred situps and then he was off to the shower he stood under the hot water barely moving for five minutes the days events cascading through his mind like the water down his back it was often the clearest five minutes of his day oxygenated blood coursing through his brain hot water warming his muscles the sound of the water falling on the tile no phones no radios no tv no internet no one around to interrupt his thoughts it was the perfect way to start any day and especially this one he had stopped by kennedys house on the way home she wasnt much of a sleeper and he knew shed be waiting to hear about the meeting with their french and british allies rapp realized that was probably why hed woken up with shirley on his mind shed sat next to him while he filled his boss in on the high points and conveyed george butlers concerns about his man in cuba kennedy had been in the same spot many times countless hours and resources went into recruiting wellplaced sources once compromised they were out of the game never to be used again in a future conflict those experiences made her not so willing to share information with agencies that might not treat it with the delicacy it deserved they agreed to sit on it for a day or two and see if they could come up with a plausible solution rapp was already thinking of one but it was too halfbaked to share it with kennedy hed have to let it cook for a while then when he got up to leave shirley ran back into tommys room and he remembered standing there for a brief moment feeling jilted looking back on it this morning it made him smile tommy was a good kid and shirley was a lucky dog now standing under the hot water he was trying to punch holes in his own plan as with anything in his business there were certain risks the question was were they worth it after hed fleshed it out a bit more he decided to table the idea and get back to it later he was going to be doing a fair amount of driving today and after he made it through a busy morning hed have some time later to devote to it the first item to be checked off however was max johnson and if the idiot knew what was good for him hed already have filled a notepad with his professional sins the rock quarry was situated thirty odd miles west of dc few people knew of its storied history and for the people who now used it that was just fine it was a relic from the cold warone of the few places that hadnt been declassified and leaked to the press and that was due solely to the fact that it had never been on the books to begin with and no politician in the last thirty years had been informed of its existence it also helped that even at the height of the cold war the place was rarely used due to poor planning the site was at the convergence of two underground streams which meant that it flooded frequently some upgrades had been made in recent years more sump pumps were installed as well as several dehumidifiers and a backup generator but even so the place was like a concrete petri dish the men who worked there liked to joke that they didnt have to worry about congress blowing the whistle on them it was osha who would shut them down for unhealthy working conditions fortunately the men and the women of the clandestine service were used to working in less than ideal situations the place was laid out like an old world war ii command bunker with hallways branching out like a network of arteries rapp found coleman napping in one of the bunkrooms and woke him with a firm shake and a cup of coffee coleman swung his feet onto the cold floor and took the mug from rapp after a few sips he scratched his blond hair and began to fill rapp in on what had been an interesting night one of the guys fetched the notepad and handed it to rapp while coleman hit the high points rapp tried to decipher the chicken scratch what about bugging docs office coleman grinned i didnt push him on it i thought youd want to save it for the shock value rapp nodded he did he noted it but its pretty lame all he says in there is that hes done a little consulting for langleys inspector general is he aware that adams supposedly left the country no coleman went on to fill him in on a few more things rapp continued to speedread his way through the notes after about ten pages he looked up at coleman and said hes been a busy beaver id say so you gotta hand it to him hes pretty good at this surveillance game my guys tell me his equipment is out of this world shit theyve never seen before rapp thought about that and filed it away maybe the idiot was worth saving he checked his watch and said anything else before i go in there im on a tight schedule i went to bed around five but up until then it was a fullblown pity party he definitely sees himself as the victim hes really upset about being shot he was in a lot of pain i think hed probably crawl out of his own skin for a painkiller right about now good where are they coleman walked over to a metal file cabinet yanked it open with a screech grabbed the red bottle and handed it to rapp rapp took the pills and a bottle of water and went down the long hallway to the cells he punched in the code for the cipher lock on the door and pulled it open there were two cells on the left and two on the right with heavy steel doors that looked as if they might have been salvaged from a battleship the place was not permanently wired for audio and sound the humidity wreaked havoc on the av equipment so rapp carried his own device it was only a precaution in case he missed something and needed to play it back later more than likely though he would trash the recording the second the meeting was over rapp stopped at the first door on the left and pulled back the heavy slide on the peephole johnson was sitting back with his bandaged foot on the table in front of him was another yellow legal pad and a pen rapp threw the dead bolt on the door and opened it colemans guy left without saying a word rapp set the bottle of water on the table and shook the container of painkillers back and forth to get johnsons attention you ready for another one of these johnson held out his hand yes rapp looked at the sweat on his upper lip and said in a minute johnson started to squirm and looked at his foot with deep concern we just have to go over a few things first johnson moaned and banged his fist on the table come on just give me a pill rapp stared him down and asked what do you know about me i know you shot me in the foot last night for no good reason thats what i know about you rapp could see what coleman meant now by the pity party thing in the broader sense max what is my reputation as you know it he looked around the room nervously and shrugged his shoulders rapp took off his suit jacket and draped it on the back of the chair he rested his hand on his gun and said its not a trick question max honesty is whats important this morning i dont care if you insult me just tell me the truth thats the only way ill let you walk out of here do you understand me i dont know this is so fucked up theres nothing to think about rapp said a bit more forcefully the truth is the truth and a fucking lie is a fucking lie and if i think youre lying to me were going to start up that game again what game johnson said in genuine confusion rapp drew his gun for effect and said left foot right foot left knee right knee johnson buried his face in his hands so remember rapp said the truth now for the second time what is my reputation johnson shrugged his shoulders i dont know youve killed a lot of people rapp tried to be objective all things considered i guess that would be a true statement and after last night johnson added quickly i dont doubt it for a moment i mean what the hell i was at langley before you were i put in my twentyfive years i served what you did last night was wrong i mean thats no way to treat a fellow professional rapp was glad hed gotten five hours of sack time because johnson was a perfect example of what happened to the human mind if deprived of sleep add to that the fact that he probably hadnt felt real pain since he was a kid and you had a very agitated fiftysixyearold man so lets do a quick recap for the last year youve been whoring yourself out to whoever will pay you youve broken dozens of laws youve illegally spied on officials in your own government illegal johnson scoffed what would you call this you dont exactly play by the rules i sure dont but theres a big difference between what i do and what you do maybe in your mind really why dont you tell me how much money ive made breaking the law during the course of my career johnson squirmed in his seat im not into your relativism max i do this job because i think its important i do it because narcissistic fucks like you care more about your own ego and making a buck than our national security what really pisses me off though is that youre the same assholes who when the next happens will all sit around pointing your fingers at guys like me and saying i didnt do enough to protect the country well im fed up max im sick of swimming upstream ive spent the last two days running around dealing with bullshit like this like you greedy fucking children who dont give a shit about anyone or anything other than yourselves thats not true really rapp folded his arms across his chest you call yourself a fellow professional max well if you really think youre a professional then you know damn well that you wandered way off the reservation and i have every right to put a bullet in your head thats not true there are things things you dont know about bullshit rapp yelled adams had tried the same line on him its your choice max are you going to repent with all your heart and soul or am i going to put a bullet in your head your choice chapter this was not rapps first s√©ance as they liked to say in the business there were a couple of books out there on how to properly interrogate a prisoner but they were pretty remedial the more nasty stuff could be found in the cias human resource exploitation training manual or the kubark counterintelligence interrogation manual this was stuff that the cia had authored decades earlier when people were either brave enough or crazy enough to put such things in writing rapp had read both a long time ago and found them to be useful in the sense that they offered an outline but it was all a little bit like reading about a baseball swing most people can read and easily understand the swing but less than one percent of one percent of the population can actually step into the batters box and hit a ninetymileanhour fastball rapp had no doubt that johnson was scared to death of him but was he scared enough to actually tell the truth with most people the fear of death or severe pain was all it took and as long as you could check out the story they would tell you the truth because if they lied you went back into the room and pushed whatever button worked johnson looked up at rapp and in a convincing voice said i want to tell the truth now came the sticky part with johnson the crux of the problem was that he had lived by a double standard for so long that he thought lying was his birthright he was the great inquisitor charged with making sure langleys people played by the rules and if he had to break the rules to catch them then so be it he was above it all the rules were for the little people it was no wonder he and glen adams had become bosom buddies so rapp had to come at this one from a slightly different angle i have to be honest with you i have a long day in front of me i have to go pick up a friend this morning whos all fucked in the head because hes been working his ass off and hes come within a fraction of losing his life twice in the past year and his job is made five times harder than it should be because hes got assholes like you running around and then i have to get up to the hill and listen to all those blowhards on the judiciary committee grill me because i didnt treat some terrorist with kid gloves and then after that i have to get over to the white house and tell the president that i either killed you like he asked me to do or i spared your life and went against his orders the president ordered you to kill me johnsons eyes were wide with fear and disbelief after what happened last week the president has decided this war on terror is not just a campaign slogan hes dealing with the aftermath of the attacks trying to find the guys who are still at large and make those who helped them pay and in the midst of all of that he finds out that the cias inspector general has left the country and flown to fucking caracas venezuela of all places rapp saw the surprise in johnsons eyes thats right your old buddy glen adams weve been on to him for about a month now someone slipped up he got spooked and he bolted turns out hes been working for that thug chavez for the past four years hugo chavez none other we started going through his stuff and unfortunately your name was all over the place johnson swallowed hard thats how we got on your tail we didnt know shit about sidorov and all these other pet projects you had going people saw me last night a lot of people johnson looked up and pointed at rapp and they saw you too russians all of them they play by a different set of rules they respect this rapp waved his gun around they know ill hunt them down and put a bullet in their head a guy like sidorov he has enough problems the last thing he wants is a guy like me hounding him those two security guys johnson said with a got you expression on his face they were american they saw me they saw you drag me out of the club you mean the two guys from triple canopy the former special forces guys we already talked to them gave them the rap sheet on what youve been up to they wanted to know if they could help with the interrogation i told them id see how things went this morning rapp checked his watch it was sixfiftysix youve got thirty minutes to convince me that i should stay your execution johnson was staring off into the distance with a blank expression on his face do you understand what i just said i cant believe he was working for hugo chavez rapp didnt show it but he was smiling inside maybe there was a bit of a patriot still in the man none of us are too pleased about it now did you understand what i just said yes im not sure you did so im going to make it real clear the president has told me to kill you hes furious that a guy with adamss security clearance has defected between you and me hes horrified that little sausage chavez is going to parade adams in front of the cameras he knows you helped adams collect a lot of his information rapp shrugged he cant get his hands on adams so youre the next best thing i didnt know he was working for chavez max rapp said with a heavy sigh id like to feel some sympathy for you but its not like you didnt know you were breaking the law you climbed into bed with a rat bastard and you were caught now the only chance you have of living a minute past seventhirty is if you put all your cards on the table i know this wont be easy for you because youre a professional liar youre going to have to fight your instincts if i think youre lying and trust me ill know when you are the gun comes out and we do the left foot right foot thing understand and if i tell you the truth rapp grinned lets just say there are a few people around here who think youre pretty good at what you do whats that supposed to mean it means if you are completely honest and you hold nothing back i might consider letting you live and if i think i can trust you i might even give you a job there was a genuine glimmer of hope in his eyes johnson sat up a little straighter like a dog ready to please all right i think i understand lets hear it and remember no lies all right about six months ago glen came to me and explained his suspicions about what you and irene were up to he said that i was the only one who would understand his situation that if you were going to catch someone who was breaking the law you couldnt fight fair you had to be willing to break the rules yourself and you agreed rapp said in a reasonable tone wanting to help him along yes johnson started to speak but stopped fight it rapp said your only chance is to tell the truth what if it pisses you off ill deal with it by shooting me in the foot rapp shook his head only if you lie to me so you decided to go to work for him rapp made a rolling motion with his hand telling him to pick up the story it started out pretty simple he wanted me to bug an office i didnt even know who the guy was rapp knew immediately that it was a lie he pointed the gun at johnsons bandaged foot and said fight it all right he said quickly i knew who he was but id never met him go on his name is thomas lewis hes a shrink hes kind of the goto therapist for the bigwigs on the seventh floor has a practice out by tysons corner im familiar with him well we bugged his office thats real classy i wasnt calling the shots i was merely following orders like me rapp said the president wants me to kill you so who am i to question him i should probably just kill you right now and get it over with please let me explain i thought it was a little underhanded but you also thought it was brilliant johnson hesitated and then said kind of so howd you do it rapp asked i set up a passive system in a nearby office and started recording id go back to the place every couple of weeks to check on the equipment but it was pretty much handled offsite the recordings were uploaded to a server every day id put them on a disk and hand them over did you ever listen to any johnson started to say no but caught himself a few but not many seriously yeah it might sound interesting but its boring as hell how many copies rapp asked casually i gave one to adams and the other one is up on the secure server rapp nodded and picked up the bottle of painkillers he popped the top and took out two pills he held them in front of johnson and said you know marcus dumond yes johnson snorted hes a disrespectful little shit not really just seems that way because hes so much smarter than the rest of us at any rate he was telling me the other day that he has a new software program that can tell how many times something has been copied now marcus is at your office right now if i call him up and ask him to find out how many times this stuff was copied and he comes back with something other than two well lets just say you and i will be finished so think real hard how many copies did you make johnson thought about it for a long moment and then said three i think there are actually three copies rapp set the pills on the table and slid the bottle of water over good answer rapp watched as johnson popped the pills in his mouth and took a swig of water that office you leased jonson nodded third floor directly across the courtyard from lewiss office we already have all your equipment rapp saw the surprise wash across johnsons face i know more shit about you than you can even begin to imagine max you fucking hold back on me one more time and this will get really ugly i mean saddam hussein third world shove a thermometer up your pecker and smack it with a hammer ugly shove your head in a bucket full of your own shit ugly thats what we do to traitors im sorry johnson said in a shaky voice sorry doesnt fucking cut it max you need to get it though your head that you have one shot at this i understand good because the next time i ask you for a number you better be damn sure its the right one i will i promise rapp wasnt so sure but maybe with a little reprogramming they could get him back on the right team hed never pull a saddam hussein on him but he might show him a few photos just to scare the piss out of him all right now where are these copies chapter mclean virginia the house was on a nice treelined street in north arlington not far from where rapp had grown up it was upscale but not obnoxious lots of twostory colonials and federal style houses with wellkept lawns lawyers lobbyists and government contractors lived in the neighborhood jobs that fed out of the bottomless trough of federal funds very few civil servants lived in the neighborhood unless like nash their spouse worked in the private sector rapp pulled up in front of the house a few minutes before eight and threw the gearshift into park he looked up the sidewalk at the white front door and imagined what was going on inside kennedy had called nash before bed and told him he would be traveling with her for most of the day they had a closed meeting on the hill with the judiciary committee and then a briefing with the president if nash had told kennedy about his problem with rapp she had failed to pass it along rapp undid his seat belt and climbed out of the car as he started up the walk he wondered if nash might take a swing at him rapp hoped hed gotten a little sleep and regained some of his senses rapp hit the doorbell and then stepped off the front stoop if nash was still pissed it was best to have a little room to maneuver a few seconds later maggie answered the door she had ravenblack hair a button nose and bright blue eyes all set against smooth alabaster skin she was already dolled up for the big day dressed in a black pencil skirt and white cotton blouse with a shirred waist her jetblack hair was slicked back in a perfect high ponytail that both showed off her gorgeous face and gave her a little bit of that corporate dominatrix look that told men to tread carefully you would never guess by looking at her that shed given birth to four kids maggie flashed rapp a nice smile and a conspiratorial wink mitch what a nice surprise she offered her cheek rapp kissed it and whispered hows he doing he doesnt have a clue then in a louder voice she said come on in maggie led him down the hallway were getting the kids ready for school good i was hoping id catch them as rapp entered the kitchen four faces lit up as if it were christmas and one face turned so sour you would have guessed his mortal enemy had just walked in the room shannon the fifteenyearold daughter jumped up from the kitchen table and threw her arms out uncle mitch she gave rapp a hug and said guess what before rapp had a chance to answer she said i get my permit saturday it had been a long time since rapp had gone through that teenage right of passage but she was obviously extremely excited at the prospect of being able to drive great will you take me driving absolutely rapp reached out and rubbed the head of jack the tenyearold brain child who was simultaneously working on a bowl of cereal and watching sports center maggie was from boston and the kids were all big red sox fans so rapp asked how are your yankees doing yeah right jack replied theyre a bunch of overpaid prima donnas sounds like youre talking about the red sox maggie was coming back from the other side of the kitchen with a fresh cup of black coffee dont make me throw this on you she handed the mug to rapp just as charlie the oneyearold started banging on the tray of his high chair rapp took the mug and turned to face charlie who was looking up at him with his big brown eyes he had an expectant smile on his sloppy foodcaked lips sorry little man i was getting to you rapp bent over and kissed the top of his head when he straightened up he looked at rory who was sitting on the other side of the table the thirteenyearold had a plate of pop tarts and an open book in front of him howd it go last weekend rory looked up with a barely concealed grin we won all three matches without looking away from the tv jack said he had fourteen goals no one could stop him nice rapp said rory was a phenomenal athlete rapp had been an allamerican lacrosse star at syracuse and took great joy in watching rory play the kid was a man child on the pitch and had the potential to play at the highest levels we play again saturday rory said dropping a hint great ill try to make it rapp turned his attention away from the kids to mr sourpuss who was standing on the other side of the kitchen irene wanted me to pick you up he checked his watch she wants us to get there early so we can go over a few things i can drive myself nash said gruffly still pouting i see maggie cleared her throat extraloud and said come on kids lets go its time to load up she took a washcloth to charlies face and then unhooked and plucked him out of the chair she handed him off to rapp and said he needs to be dropped off at day care make sure grumpy gets the car seat from the back of the van she kissed charlie and mitch and then walked over to her husband kissed him and said i love you be safe and have a great day ill call you later thirty seconds later she was gone with the kids and rapp was standing in the kitchen with charlie in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other nash was leaning against the far counter looking at rapp as if he was trying to figure out if he could take a swing at him and not hurt charlie nash took a sip of coffee and said i have a bruise on my chest this wasnt rapps thinghandling people with kid gloves he was tempted to put charlie back in the high chair and kick his dads ass but that would be a little shortsighted the only thing that mattered today was getting nash to the white house rapp swallowed his pride ignored every code hed ever learned about leading warriors and said im sorry i wish it hadnt come to that come to that thats your apology rapp sighed listen lets talk in the car there are some things i need to say to you and and what when was the last time your house was swept probably a month ago well talk in the car rapps word was final they left through the side door nash handed rapp a diaper bag and walked over to the twocar detached garage to grab the car seat charlie saw the neighbors cat and about jumped out of rapps arms he pointed and bounced and yelled and when none of that worked he grabbed a fist full of rapps hair and gave it a good yank rapp was so amused by the kids determination that he just laughed once nash had finished wrestling with the car seat they strapped charlie in and were off nash didnt speak for the first minute when they got to glebe road rapp said i know youre mad at me but you have to tell me where were going were going to the dirksen senate office building you know where it is rapp thought holy cow he really is losing his mind then he jerked his head toward the backseat and said charlies day care oh take a left rapp pulled onto glebe and said listen im not the easiest guy to work with and neither is stan but you have to take a little ownership in this in what nash asked obviously irritated you think i knocked you on your ass yesterday because im frustrated with my job maybe rapp shook his head ive known you for how long and i havent once laid a hand you other than that time in the kush when i dragged your shotup ass out of the line of fire rapp looked sideways at nash itd be nice if you kept that one in mind before you condemned me to hell nash shook his head and looked out the passengerside window rapp scoffed thats it youve got no reply to that one i risked my ass to save your ungrateful ass and youve got nothing to say i knew you were going to hold that one over my head for the rest of my life thats usually the way it works when you save someones life mike to tell you the truth i didnt think about it until yesterday when you were being so unreasonable unreasonable me thats right mike youre a professional you know better than anyone that in this day and age you cant say shit because it might get recorded but that didnt stop you from coming unhinged yesterday i warned you twice but you just kept on and then you hit me youre damn right i did and id do it again this shit is bigger than you and me and you knew that when you signed up you were the one who came to me and said you were sick of fighting a war with one hand tied behind your back nash was silent for a few blocks charlie hummed away in the backseat and then finally nash said im not ungrateful but im not going to throw my conscience out the window you have no right stan has no right to easy rapp said cutting him off slow down before you make a fool of yourself again im not asking you to sell your soul well it sure does seem like it just hear me out for a minute i spoke with stan and filled him in on your situation great nash moaned i suppose you told him you knocked me on my ass i did crap im never going to hear the end of this probably not but thats not whats important nash stared straight ahead what did he say he said the fact that i was able to knock you on your ass with one palm strike is all the proof he needs that you need to take a sabbatical nash was a state high school wrestling champ in pennsylvania and had boxed in the marine corps his little altercation with rapp had been the shortest fight of his life his sternum hurt like hell and his ego was ten times worse yeah well i havent had a lot of sleep lately rapp could have made any one of a dozen retorts but none of them would have been helpful this morning wasnt about winning the argument and getting a stubborn friend to do the impossible which was to admit hed been wrong it was about advancing the ball toward the goal line all of us have been under a lot of stress lately you probably more than most of us chris was your guy the way he was taken out really sucked and then there was jessica and the rest of the folks you knew in the nctc stans never set foot in the place and i dont get in there very often but you knew those people im not a heartless bastard i understand why youre a little messed up but in this line of work theres no coddling you need to take a few weeks off take em but you have to honor your promises and keep your mouth shut and if i take a week off and i still disagree with you and stan where does that leave us do i just ignore my conscience and let you guys do something that i think is a mistake no rapp said in fact i think stan has a solution let me guess it involves a kimber and a wood chipper no rapp shook his head and smiled at the visual hes says its your call whats my call nash asked with a frown whether that unethical bastard ever sees daylight again bullshit nope stan says hes sick of doing all the heavy lifting says hes sick of you bitching about the size of the hole the size of the hole nash asked not understanding what hurley meant yep he says its your turn to grab a shovel and start digging hes done he says its your call my call about what on what were going to do with that rat bastard who leaked our operation the one that got chris johnson killed and quite possibly another americans nash turned his head slowly and looked out the window his thoughts turned to chris johnson the retired army ranger had been nashs first recruit the twentynineyearold had gone completely off the grid for nearly a year while he infiltrated one of dcs most radical mosques he was on the verge of exposing the cell that had pulled off the attacks only a week ago when a story appeared in the post that accused the cia of illegally running surveillance on a half dozen east coast mosques the day after the article appeared johnson was discovered tortured and killed by the lion of al qaeda and his merry band of terrorists without looking at rapp he asked when do you want my decision stan says you have a good week before were done with the debriefing a week nash thought seven lousy days to decide a mans fate a man whom he hated what in the hell had he gotten himself into chapter capitol hill senator barbara lonsdale walked down the broad hallway of the dirksen senate office building and stopped at a nondescript door she tapped on it once with her dainty hand and then entered mitch rapp was in the corner talking to irene kennedy and mike nash was in the other corner talking to a couple of langleys legal eagles all five stopped and turned their attention to the outgoing chairman of the judiciary committee in one weeks time lonsdales entire bearing had changed rapp likened it to the conversion of a new york limousine liberal who gets mugged and then the next day tears up her aclu card buys a gun and joins the neighborhood watch group lonsdale looked at the two lawyers and said gentlemen would you please excuse us for a minute the lawyers looked to kennedy to see if it was okay the cia director gave her consent with a nod why dont you go into the committee room lonsdale advised well be starting any minute the two men picked up their briefcases and left through the door opposite the one through which lonsdale had just entered once they were gone and the door was closed lonsdale slapped a plain white envelope against her hand and said well this is it are you sure you want to go through with it kennedy asked lonsdale had made a deal to resign her chairmanship of judiciary in return for control of the intelligence committee without hesitation lonsdale said yes rapp said its not too late he still wasnt convinced she couldnt do them more good staying right where she was ill still be on the committee so i can keep an eye on things but you wont be in control rapp said lonsdale smiled ill still have my seniority ill be one chair over from the gavel i know this committee better than anyone the staff is loyal to me they all liked ralph her voice trailed off at the mention of her chief of staff who had been killed in the explosion at the monocle along with seven senators and a whole bunch of highlevel staffers lawyers and lobbyists the looneys on the far left are already beating you up nash chimed in a couple of them have started raising money to challenge you in your next primary its america they have every right to do it and i have every right to ignore them listening to the idiots is what got me into this mess im just saying this isnt going to be easy for you nash said we could have been a little more subtle about it having them think you were still their champion might not have been the worst move lonsdale dismissed his concerns with the wave of a hand those people will never be happy and besides playing the game of double agent isnt my style im better out front drawing fire its where i shine if people want to criticize you three theyre going to have to come through me first or at least expect that i will come back at them fast and furious this stuff was difficult to quantify for rapp on some level he knew it mattered but at the end of the day it was all a bunch of words he said so and lonsdale replied by saying words mean a lot in this town and dont forget im not the only senator who has undergone this conversion under fire others have gravitated to a similar position im not alone besides she said in a more upbeat tone i can handle it missouri might be a blue state but were big on defense in light of recent developments i think my constituents will understand why i changed my position i think its a good move barb kennedy said the press will not be able to ignore that one of the cias most steadfast critics has now become a champion of the agency thank you youre welcome now she said as she checked her watch were due to start in two minutes heres the lay of the land ive spoken to twelve of the nineteen members she caught herself two of her fellow committee members had been killed in the attack on the monocle twelve of the seventeen members only three that i can think of are planning to make a real stink about this maybe five at the most rapp said let me guess ogden shes leading the charge lonsdale said ogden was the senior senator from california as you know this will be a closed meeting but we all know how that works this small block of dissenters will begin to selectively leak their side of the story as soon as the meeting is over so be careful what you say in there dont admit to anything that could lead to a referral to the justice department ive already signed an affidavit that backs up your story with a shrug she added if senator ogden and her little cabal want to side with a terrorist well thats a fight i dont think they will win in this climate but we still have to be careful lonsdale covered a few more things and then said you should head in ill follow shortly as the group began to move toward the door lonsdale said mitch hang back for a second i want to talk to you about something rapp stopped and waited as lonsdale walked around the far side of the conference table as she drew near she took the white envelope shed been holding and handed it over to rapp he took it and asked whats this call it opposition research on who senator ogden rapp opened the envelope and pulled out three sheets of paper he scanned the lines whats this her prepared remarks rapp was impressed how the hell did you get these senators werent the only people who were killed in the attack on the monocle nine staffers also died were a closeknit group one of her people gave it to you lonsdale nodded youll have time to read it while we get things started the first two sheets are her remarks the third is something i prepared for you its something that ralph used to point out to me on a regular basis call it a glaring example of hypocrisy you might find it useful in taking some of the wind out of ogdens sails rapp scanned the first and second pages his name jumped out at him a few times he had to hand it to the senator from san francisco she wasnt going to back down a bit even in the wake of the attacks he scanned the third page with a bit of surprise this is all accurate yep interesting lonsdale patted him on the arm im sure you will put it to good use now if youll excuse me i need to get things started chapter the seventeen members sat behind the big horseshoeshaped wooden bench since it was a closed meeting only a skeleton crew of staffers were seated behind them rapp thought they appeared a little more solemn than normal even ogden looked somewhat mournful she looked over the top of her reading glasses and made eye contact with rapp there was neither joy nor malice in her expression just a cold calculated appraisal the two had never been fond of each other and rapp was in no way delusional enough to think it was solely her fault he had never given any of them the respect they were used to being accorded he had managed to stay off the judiciary committees radar for nearly a decade and a half but then he was involved in a series of highprofile incidents that garnered far too much interest for the past two years it seemed that the committee had placed a bullseye on his back he had become the whitehot example of everything that was wrong with the war on terror at least as far as senator ogden was concerned lonsdale gaveled the hearing to order and spent the next few minutes going over the itinerary before allowing the first senator to begin with questions she asked director kennedy if she had any statements that she would like to make normally kennedy would have passed but this time she took lonsdale up on the offer i would like to offer my condolences to the committee i know that some of the people we lost last week were far more than just colleagues they were dear friends and im sorry for your loss thank you director lonsdale replied and on behalf of the committee i would also like to offer our condolences to the cia and the families who lost loved ones in the attack on the national counterterrorism center thank you madam chairman lonsdale nodded to the ranking member sitting on her right and the questioning began it started out with more of the same although the offers of condolences were greatly abbreviated due to the fact that there were no cameras in the room and the transcripts would be sealed for many years to come everything was abbreviated in fact the senators staked out their turf but kept things moving two members from the minority party and one from the majority voiced their full support of the cia and didnt even bother bringing up the issue that was at the core of the hearinghad mitch rapp and mike nash tortured an american citizen when it was senator ogdens turn the mood changed drastically this was where the fireworks were going to start director kennedy in your opening remarks you stated that you will not stop until those responsible for the attacks are brought to justice what exactly do you mean by justice kennedy leaned forward and was about to answer the question but never got the chance because ogden cut her off and said in the past your version of justice has been to let men like mr rapp and mr nash here track these people down and play the role of judge jury and executioner rapp leaned forward and said madam senator you make it sound as if there is something wrong with that as ogden stared down at rapp the strain became palpable rapp returned ogdens harsh glare as if he was daring her to engage him which was exactly what he wanted at the best of times rapp had found it difficult to follow the decorum and procedure of any committee and especially this one which was famous for being filled with the senates largest egos and biggest blowhards considering that he had far more important things to be doing with his time he really didnt care if he upset ogden and her little cabal the senator from california was the quintessential ivory tower politician she moved in the elite circles of her party listening to the trial lawyers academics and the nuttiest of the crazy specialinterest groups rapp had never pretended to understand the intricacies of politics but he felt pretty confident that on this issue ogden was out of step with the majority of californians mr rapp ogden said in an icy tone it is no secret that i have never cared for you or your methods i am not alone in my belief that you are out of control and have been for some time that your unseemly techniques have been the single greatest recruiting tool for our enemy that you play to our weaker instincts of vengeance and vigilante justice and that while this may feel good in the short term in the long term it is destructive beyond calculation your use of extreme measuresand by the way i hate the way you use that euphemism to describe what you do she stopped and looked from one end of the dais to the other we all know what he does its called torture when you intentionally dislocate someones arm and then wrench that arm behind that persons back in a way that is specifically designed to cause more pain it can be described as nothing less than torture while my colleagues may be willing to temporarily forget their oath of office and lose their moral compass i cannot you are a black mark a stain against everything we stand for you undermine our position on the world stage and you stand in stark contrast to our national values your jackboot tactics and immoral techniques have sullied our reputation beyond repair the torture that you so wantonly practice is ethically reprehensible and blatantly illegal it violates our laws it flies in the face of the international courts and the geneva conventions which we are legally bound to obey and uphold your actions have endangered the lives of our service members and inflamed antius sentiment around the globe you have singlehandedly eroded our moral authority and for what questionable results at best everyone on this committee who is brave enough to admit it knows that torture doesnt work yet here we all sit most of you hoping we can just wish away this black mark this stain ignore the fact that we have in our possession an affidavit submitted by a wellknown attorney and signed by a respected doctor that an american citizen was tortured by mr rapp and mr nash in the aftermath of last weeks attacks rapp waited patiently and respectfully while she built her indictment of him he ticked off her points one by one and plotted his counterattack never in his life would he again have this chance in front of this committee he stole a quick look from one side of the massive bench all the way around the horn seventeen faces at least half of them scowling at their fellow senator a few more looked as if they simply wanted to get up and leave and then there were ogdens two lone supporters the senior senators from vermont and illinois koolaid drinkers if there ever were outoftouch party loyalists who had built their careers on trashing the cia every chance they got ogden shook her head as if she were eyeing a disgusting child rapist and said i cannot sit here silently like my colleagues i must express my absolute outrage at you and mr nash and your brutal unethical tactics i think you are both monsters i think you should be run out of federal service i think you should be investigated indicted put on trial convicted and sent to the worst prison we can find in the federal system and i hope it is for a very very long time she leaned back and glanced to her left and then her right and said and i feel that i must express my extreme disappointment in my fellow committee members that they are so willing to turn a blind eye to you and your illegal methods this is after all the judiciary committee where the rule of law is paramount it is embarrassing that i am the lone voice for justice this morning the room remained silent for a few long beats rapp was at the far left of the big witness table kennedy was in the middle and nash on her right the two lawyers were right behind them rapp glanced over at kennedy and gave her a little nod that said he would be handling this one he looked to the center of the big bench at lonsdale and said madam chairman if i may id like to respond by all means rapp pushed his chair back and stood he buttoned his charcoalgray suit coat and stepped around the table why is the witness standing ogden asked tersely as she looked sideways at lonsdale rapp knew this would piss her off i stand out of respect maam its senator ogden snapped ive worked very hard to get where i am and i would appreciate it if you would use my appropriate title and sit back down senator why must i automatically defer to you while you have absolutely no problem calling into question my morals ethics and motives i call them into question mr rapp because the people of california have seen fit to elect me four times to the united states senate and i would be breaking my oath to uphold the constitution of the united states if i turned a blind eye to your barbaric behavior now sit back down no thank you but before i address your points id like to ask a fairly simple question can you at least acknowledge that mr nash and i have made certain sacrifices that we have served our country with distinction mr rapp ogden said her voice dripping with contempt there are millions of federal employees and i would put you both in the lowest percentile of that group rapp felt his anger stir a bit senator i have been shot on three separate occasions in the service of this country i received this nice little scar at the ripe old age of twentyfive rapp showed her the left side of his face and craned his neck to show her fellow committee members the white mark that ran nearly four inches along his jawbone it was delivered by the man who was behind the terrorist attack on pan am flight oneohthree one hundred seventynine americans were on that flight thirtyfive of my classmates from syracuse university perished including a young woman whom i had dated since high school and planned on marrying i have been captured and held prisoner by hamas for nearly a month i have been detained and beaten in both syria and yemen and this was all before abu ghraib and guantanamo so please dont sit up there and tell me that myself and mr nash have created this problem these sadistic bastards existed long before we joined the fight and unfortunately they will be around long after weve retired mr rapp this is all fine but i am not in the mood to mood rapp yelled with such intensity that a number of the senators eased back in their seats as if to get out of the way of the coming storm you call into question my morals and my service and cast doubt on whether i have sacrificed for this country and then when i defend myself you tell me you are not in the mood to hear it i will not be spoken to in this manner ogden said trying to regain control now you want to argue about tone my insolence offends you rapp said in a mocking voice barbara ogden said loudly this is unacceptable youre damn right it is rapp shouted our two worlds collided last week and seven of your fellow senators found out the hard way that you cant appease these bigoted sexist freaks and now you want to sit here and condemn my actions as immoral mr rapp ogden said with force i hardly think its a stretch to condemn torture as an immoral act what about partialbirth abortion rapp asked her ogden frowned as if rapp had lost his mind what are you talking about you were the one who brought up morals this morning not me you condemned me for dislocating the arm of a terrorist a suspect she shot back who happens to be a us citizen and is innocent until proven guilty innocent rapp replied let me tell you a little something about this piece of human debris youre so strenuously defending he was born in saudi arabia and applied for us citizenship for the sole purpose of helping carry out the attacks that killed of our countrymen last week you explained to the committee only moments ago that i dislocated this persons arm after the initial three explosions and then failed to mention that while i was in the midst of allegedly rapp held up his hands and made quotation marks with his fingers to emphasize in a contemptuous way the word while i was allegedly trying to separate the terrorists arm from his shoulder socket his fucking friends showed up and gunned down in cold blood eighteen federal employees and if it wasnt for the brave actions of mr nash here we would have lost another hundred and probably the entire building so while you have so kindly placed us in the lowest percentile of federal employees you do so at the risk of exposing yourself as a very dangerous person who cares more about her political power base than the security of this country i do not have to sit here and take this ogden snapped her briefing book shut tell me senator ogden rapp said as he thought of the note hed received from lonsdale what do you think is more morally reprehensible dislocating the arm of a terrorist who has intentionally lied on his immigration application so he can become an american citizen and help kill innocent people or sticking a steel spike into the brain of an eightandahalfmonthold fetus and then sucking his brains out nice try mr rapp you are talking about settled law and in front of this committee that is a big mistake you are way out of your depth on this issue undoubtedly maam but i dont want you to get me wrong here i am not condemning your position ive killed far too many people to begin waving the prolife banner im merely trying to point out the hypocrisy that you have so perfectly displayed during your twentyone years in the united states senate rapp recalled the numbers lonsdale had provided you have a one hundred percent voting record when it comes to a womans reproductive rights on thirtyeight separate occasions you have voted to protect or expand partialbirth abortions as well as provide federal funding for clinics that perform the procedure the people in this room are well aware of my voting record and i can assure you that i am not the only senator on this committee who has a hundred percent voting record when it comes to a womans right to choose i wouldnt know i dont follow it that closely and again im not in the business of judging why all of you vote the way you do im the one who has been accused by you senator of being a morally bankrupt barbarian so im just trying to figure out where all your outrage comes from you honestly dont understand why i find torture so utterly offensive youre an intelligent civilized woman i would never expect you to openly condone torture but im confused about your outrage a little over a year ago a saudi named abad bin baaz emigrates to the united states takes up residence in washington dc and begins receiving shipments of explosives and providing intelligence for the very same terrorist cell that last week used those explosives to blow up buildings and kill innocent civilians i catch him redhanded and in an effort to try to apprehend the terrorists who are still at large i allegedly dislocated his shoulder and slapped him around and got him to spill the beans on his little band of thugs and you find my behavior reprehensible i think any normal person would ogden answered how about sticking a spike through the top of a babys head piercing the skull and then sucking the babys brains out all because the mother gets a note from two doctors who claim she has depression or some other mental issue that precludes her from giving birth to a fullterm baby mr rapp the two issues are completely different as i said i know what you said senator rapp shouted and im sick of your manufactured outrage mr rapp the jowly senator from vermont jumped in you will watch your tongue this is the united states senate im well aware of where i am sir this is where we not only say its perfectly okay for a doctor to kill a fullterm baby but we think taxpayers should help pay for it rapp shot daggers at ogden and you call me a barbarian mr rapp ogden said for the last time we are not here to discuss abortion im well aware of that senator were here to talk about your moral outrage over what i have allegedly done and im merely trying to point out the hypocrisy that this esteemed body is so famous for rapp walked back to the table chapter where the hell did you come up with that nash asked as soon as they were clear of the committee room kennedy was still inside having a private word with a few of the senators rapp grinned thought of lonsdales note and said just popped into my head it was brilliant i mean frickin brilliant ive never seen ogden that frustrated yeah well she opened the door pretty wide for me i think you actually got her to reconsider i doubt it rapp shook his head shell make it about me shed rather shoot the messenger than confront her hypocrisy well there were sixteen other senators in there who all seemed to be agreeing with you rapp laughed maybe fourteen or fifteen at the most probably enough to kill this thing before it gets legs but shell leak it to the press and all of her buddies at amnesty international and the aclu theres no shortage of attorneys in this town who wouldnt jump at the chance to try to drag our asses into court they stopped to wait for kennedy yeah but at least well get political cover from the committee probably and well have the president on our side nash waited for a couple of staffers to walk past and then said in a conspiratorial voice wouldnt it be nice if the president would just slip us a couple of blanket pardons rapp laughed nash the martyr appeared to be on break we could tuck them away in irenes safe for a nice rainy day no one would have to know rapp thought of their next meeting you should ask him when we get to the white house i jumped on the grenade in there rapp jerked his head back toward the committee room you handle the next one nash thought about it for a while and said maybe i will dont hold your breath ive been waiting to get one for years kennedy joined them in the hallway and as she pulled up she shot rapp a look and said that was interesting sure was nash said i think we can count on the committee dropping the issue what about ogden rapp asked who cares nash said you destroyed her she can still make trouble for us kennedy warned yeah shell be back to fight another day rapp said she has to either that or admit shes wrong and shes been drinking the koolaid for way too long to admit that you were lucky in there kennedy said lucky nash scoffed i know rapp said i dont think luck had anything to do with it if it was a prize fight they would have called it after the first round what irene means is that under normal circumstances they would have never let me get away with that they would have shouted me down and if it wasnt for lonsdales conversion theres no way in hell i would have gotten away with it kennedy looked at rapp and said ive never seen anything like it in my nearly twentyfive years theyre scared to death she looked back down the hall at the doors to the committee room and in neardisbelief said your friend from illinois the one who likes to call us nazis yes he just pulled me aside and told me whatever i want just ask for it he told me to take your leash off and turn you loose unbelievable the guys been busting my balls for two years thousands of people die in the towers and the pentagon and planes fall out of the sky and he wants me to mirandize every piece of crap i come across now it hits a little closer to home and all of a sudden we need to take the gloves off and throw away the rule book god theyre the most egocentric fuckers on the planet yeah well dont look a gift horse in the mouth kennedy said isnt this what you wanted yeah rapp snarled itd just be nice if they did it for a reason other than self preservation well kennedy said sometimes you have to take what you can get just be happy they didnt launch an investigation you could spend the next year sitting in conference rooms drinking weak coffee and eating stale doughnuts talking to lawyers youre right all right kennedy said while checking her watch we cant keep the president waiting the three of them walked down the hallway two of kennedys bodyguards fell in one in front and one in back nash asked his boss what does the president want kennedy stole a quick glance at rapp and then said to nash i have no idea well find out when we get there rapp and nash parted ways with their boss and went down the back stairs to where rapps car was parked c street was closed on this side of the building and his car was parked in one of the diagonal spots he paused at his door with his keys in hand and looked across the boulevard at the teams of special agents combing through the debris of what had been one of washingtons most famous restaurants the place looked more like an archeological dig than a crime scene the big parking lot had been divided into more than a dozen sections separated by crime scene tape and orange cones agents were sifting through the debris with shovels and by hand a crane was parked off to the side just in case but most of the heavy stuff had already been removed from the pile the fbi was looking for clues sifting through every pile of debris this was where they excelledgathering evidence and building a case finding a latent fingerprint on a detonator tracing the detonator back to the manufacturer and then following it every step of the way right back to who used it to commit murder they would spend years building their case and then as much as a decade trying to convince some foreign government to turn the individuals over it would be a slow tedious process rapp shook his head and realized why the president wanted him to expedite things in this particular situation he wouldnt play the role of judge and jury but he would gladly play the role of executioner he got into the car started it up and backed out as they drove over the popup security barricade and took a right onto second street rapp listened to a voicemail coleman had left him at constitution he took another right a block and a half later rapp was thinking of colemans voicemail when he asked nash you ever seen a shrink he knew nash would think the question was a little out of bounds so he quickly added irenes been trying to get me to see one you probably should nash answered without giving anything away i did right after anna was murdered didnt go so well nash gave him a sideways glance no i imagine it didnt what in the hell is that supposed to mean rapp said with a selfdeprecating laugh guys like us arent very good at discussing our feelings i dont have anything against it i think therapy can do a lot of good but i also think a lot of people use it as a crutch yeah i suppose maggie thinks its good anna used to try to get me to do it said it would be a fair way for us to resolve some of our issues maggie says the same thing i know she has someone she goes to from time to time she doesnt say much about it other than she thinks it would be good for me to sit down and talk to someone rapp turned onto pennsylvania avenue and added our security clearance doesnt exactly allow us to do that thats what i keep telling her rapp was half tempted to tell him about colemans message apparently doc lewis wasnt the only shrink they had put under surveillance max johnson had told coleman that adams had directed him to follow maggie nash and see what he could dig up when he found out she was seeing a therapist twice a month he ordered johnson to bug the office mitch knew he couldnt tell nash though at least not today he needed to get him to the white house and let him have his moment afterward he would be sure to tell nash all the sordid details before he made his decision on adamss fate they entered the white house grounds via the southwest gate and pulled into one of the visitor spots on west executive avenue they handed their guns to the uniformed secret service officer who checked them in on the ground floor just around the corner from the situation room he placed them in a locked drawer and handed them claim tickets rapp looked at the signin sheet and was pleased to see kennedy was already here her security detail would have buzzed over from capitol hill without stopping for lights they walked down the short hallway and when nash turned to the right to go to the situation room rapp grabbed his arm and said were upstairs today where nash asked in surprise he didnt do a lot of briefings at the white house and none so far with this president but when he did they were always down in the situation room not sure rapp lied he started up the stairs and hoped no one was loitering in the halls this was all a bit like delivering the honoree to a surprise party when they got to the main floor they took a uturn and headed down the hall past the cabinet room straight ahead two big secret service agents in dark suits stood post outside the main door to the oval office each agent widened his stance a bit and tracked the two visitors with unblinking eyes rapp knew having a couple of guys like him and nash in the building always put these guys on edge he locked eyes with the one on the left and said gentlemen they nodded but said nothing rapp hung a left just before he got to them and ducked into an outer office where the presidents administrative assistant sat he looked at the woman behind the desk and said good morning teresa i have mr nash here to see the president hes expecting you go right in thanks rapp moved to his right and stopped at the door he stuck his left eye up against the peephole and took in the scene they were all theremaggie shannon rory jack and charlie as well as most if not all of the presidents national security team and the requisite pool reporters rapp smiled to himself opened the door motioned for nash to go in first and then as soon as nash had crossed the threshold rapp closed the door behind him and put his eye back to the peephole chapter mike nash stopped as if hed just stepped into a foot of thick wet cement and looked at the smiling faces staring back at him some hed never met but recognized and a few he knew intimately he heard the door behind him click shut and he whipped his head around expecting to share his surprise with rapp instead he found himself alone staring at the door and in that split second he realized hed been set up he felt his face flush with embarrassment and for a brief moment considered leaving but knew he couldnt as badly as he wanted to it would be against everything the marine corps had taught him about being an officer leaders gritted their teeth and took it while cowards ran as he slowly turned around he felt he would rather have taken on an enemy platoon than this crowd they were all smiling and some of them werent exactly known for having a happygolucky demeanor there was the secretary of defense secretary of state national security advisor director of national intelligence fbi director chairman of the joint chiefs a few people he didnt recognize but was sure were important his boss and the biggest surprise of all his family they were all assembled in perhaps the worlds most famous office all eyes on him his wife holding charlie and blushing almost as much as her husband it all started to fall into place maggie picking out his suit shirt and tie which she rarely did making sure the kids were all bathed and in clean uniforms and rappthat judasdistracting and then delivering him like some suburban joe to his surprise fortieth birthday party despite his discomfort and the bad thoughts coursing through his brain about what hed like to do to rapp nash was still smiling from ear to ear he had no idea why but he felt like a jackass everyone else was grinning back at him nodding to each other in recognition that the surprise had worked nash made a promise to himself right on the spot that however long it took he would get even with rapp mr nash the president said as he walked across his own office i was just informed that this is a bit of a surprise to you nash tried to speak but his mouth was too dry so he just nodded and took the presidents extended hand irene kennedy was suddenly at president alexanders side im sorry mike but we knew you would never have gone along with this if youd known in advance nash licked his lips and croaked what exactly am i going along with this the president said is a medal ceremony for your bravery under fire last week nash looked past his boss and the president and smiled awkwardly at his wife and kids off to his right someone began snapping photos which for an intelligence officer was a close second to someone shooting at you with a large caliber gun is that a reporter he asked nervously yes the president said but im nonofficial cover nash protested i cant have my photo taken dont worry about it the president continued casually youre being promoted enjoy it mike kennedy said very few of us get this chance what chance nash asked out of the side of his mouth receiving an award in the oval office the president stepped aside and placed a hand on nashs elbow usually you guys have to die to get something like this relax and enjoy it im not sure i want it nash muttered nonsense the cia could use a little boost in morale hell after last week we all could the president started walking nash toward his family your wife is lovely and so are your kids theyre very proud of you kennedy grabbed his other arm were all proud of you mike you deserve a little recognition nash turned to kennedy and snarled what about mitch kennedy looked straight ahead and said well talk about that later just try to relax and enjoy nash wanted to talk about it now but his wife was already moving toward him with the kids nash was still trying to figure out how rapp had gotten out of this when he noticed the tears in his wifes eyes his anger toward rapp was shoved aside as maggie reached up and planted one on his lips charlie the cussed little towhead managed to wiggle out of his mothers arms and latch on to his dad the other three kids all came up for a hug and then it was on to the individual members of the presidents national security team it took a good five minutes to get through all the handshakes and backslapping by the time the rounds were done nash was feeling considerably better when they got down to the actual medal ceremony nash handed charlie back to shannon his fifteenyearold and maggie took her position on his right side in front of the celebrated fireplace things turned serious when kennedy handed the president the citation and opened the blue velvet box as the president read the words aloud nash felt as if he were having an outofbody experience on behalf of a grateful nation it is my honor to present to you the highest award achievable by a member of the intelligence community the distinguished intelligence cross for a voluntary act of extraordinary heroism involving the acceptance of existing dangers with conspicuous fortitude and exemplary courage the president paused and looked at nash and maggie and smiled thank you for your dedication service and sacrifice your decisive and brave actions during the terrorist attack on the national counterterrorism center saved the lives of countless individuals you stand before us as a living breathing example of honor valor and heroism this great nation will forever be in your debt and we hope that future generations of americans will look to your actions for inspiration during turbulent times kennedy presented the medal to maggie who took it from the silklined case as if it were an ancient family heirloom she gently looped it over her husbands head and kissed him on the cheek next came photos lots of them first as a group and then individual shots and then finally the nash family when they were all finished nash was in for one more surprise the president approached him and said director kennedy thinks it would be a good idea if your family stayed in here while we step outside nash wasnt quite following but he got the sense it wasnt good whats outside the president glanced toward the glass door just behind and to the left of his desk the press theyre waiting for us you would have thought the president had asked him to address the nation i dont do press sir kennedy appeared on cue along with secretary of state wicka and secretary of defense england wicka said nonsense youre exactly what we need right now a goodlooking hero and a retired marine officer england added dont forget that part dont worry the president said well do all the talking just stand there and be yourself nash looked at kennedy for help once he walked out that door there would be no turning back irene just let it go mike this is bigger than just you think of all the people at langley who get kicked around in the press every day theyll all be able to go home tonight and hold their heads a little higher knowing theres honor in what we do chapter northern arkansas when he awoke in the morning the sun was filtering in through the sheer white shades hakim blinked several times before he could focus there was a dvd player on a shelf under the tv four small blue numbers stared back at him if the device was right it was ninefortyone in the morning hakim looked down and saw the blood on his shirt he opened his mouth and felt the dry caked blood on his lips he remembered the coughing fit and the blood and the dead man on the porch and the woman in the bedroom and knew he hadnt dreamed any of it not with karim around he was a living breathing angel of death hakim didnt have the strength to get up so he grabbed the remote sitting on the end table and pressed the power button a moment later two anchors from a twentyfourhour news channel were on the screen ahmed must have heard the tv he entered the living room with glass of water and a washcloth how are you feeling he asked softly hakim wasnt sure he was all beat up inside but his breathing was better than it had been yesterday im alive he glanced over ahmeds shoulder and asked where is karim a frown came over ahmeds face and he said he is outside doing what he is very upset about you ahmed shook his head he thinks you are causing us problems hakim told himself not to get angry he wasnt the one who had gotten them into this predicament what kind of problems ahmed shrugged his big shoulders and tried to remember the exact words he said you have become an operational liability me hakim asked with genuine surprise in better times he would have laughed but not now he thinks i am the problem what do you think ahmed it is not my place to think i am trained to follow orders are you a monkey if he orders you to shoot yourself will you do it ahmed took the washcloth and dabbed hakims chin you look horrible and you did not answer my question ahmed worked on a crusted piece of blood there is enough arguing between the two of you you dont need me to join in let me ask it a different way then you were trained to think tactics did you think i had things handled back in iowa at the house did you feel he needed to step outside and shoot them what if they had been police if they had been police we would be dead right now shooting them would have solved nothing the best course was to wait and see besides the police dont use young boys they were simply a father and son looking to do some hunting but we did not know that at the time ahmed said we hakim asked you mean you and karim did not know and you did not know because you have spent no time in this country you do not understand america the way i do so you do not see what is obvious you blindly follow him and where does he keep leading you to another house where he kills a husband and wife two people minding their own business breaking no law and doing nothing to offend allah ahmed looked out the window for a moment and said these are strange times tell me why couldnt he have tied them up i dont know he has his reasons ahmed turned his attention to the tv and a moment later added it is not my place to question him you keep saying that but if you ever want to see paradise you had better start thinking for yourself allah does not condone this the people who lived here were not infidels they had done nothing to provoke his wrath this is different we are in the land of our enemy thousands of miles from any support we must do whatever it takes to survive whatever hakim questioned ahmeds choice of words now you sound like him you know what pleases allah and you know what displeases him tell me do you think allah will condone what was done here last night in his name before ahmed could answer karim entered the house through the front door he stood in the foyer and looked suspiciously at the two men what have you been discussing ahmed quickly said i was telling him that the white house has announced a major press conference about what the media is saying their president is going to discuss what happened in washington last week what is to discuss kakim holstered his pistol and took off his jean jacket we won they lost ahmed flashed hakim a nervous look and then said they are speculating it is about the investigation who ahmed was confused i do not understand who is speculating the reporters they are citing sources inside the administration good karim said we could use some information with that he moved down the hallway to the kitchen ahmed gave hakim a worried look and whispered be respectful do not upset him hakim watched his moroccan friend follow karim into the kitchen he turned his attention to the tv and wondered how much longer it would be before they had their final confrontation a minute passed before karim came back into the room he was holding hakims black backpack he placed it on the coffee table and opened one of the side pockets karim withdrew three mobile phones and said why did you not tell me about these hakim looked at the three prepaid phones he had purchased months earlier i did you did not hakim eyed him cautiously his friend was looking to provoke a fight i thought i told you while we were at the farmhouse back in iowa you did not hakim swallowed the day after we arrived i made sure they were charged they were in the kitchen on the counter despite being beaten unconscious he remembered it clearly karim had questioned him about the phones i never saw them karim said he was lying and hakim knew it i purchased them months ago they are also radios we can talk to each other by pressing the buttons on the side where did you buy them and how karim said while shaking the phones in new orleans and with cash this had all been covered the previous weekend i do not remember giving you approval there is no way to trace them what about a surveillance tape at the store where you bought them it is possible but extremely remote i wore glasses and a baseball cap and used a british accent when i spoke to the clerk karim paused and considered all of this he looked at the phones and said no more secrets he tossed one phone to hakim and the second one to ahmed who was standing in the dining room do not turn them on unless i tell you are the numbers for all three phones programmed yes hakim watched karim stuff the last phone in his pocket and then leave the room without another word hakim looked down at the phone in his hands and briefly questioned his own sanity was everything that had happened in iowa a dream he was almost certain it wasnt the phones had been discussed hakim had specifically told him they had been purchased well in advance as a precaution he told him they needed the phones in case they were separated that meant karim either had a terrible memory or was conveniently forgetting that it had all been discussed hakim knew the truth and he was also beginning to understand the depths of karims immaturity this was all about him and nothing else it wasnt about allah or muslim pride or a battle against the colonial powers it was about the need to feed the lion of al qaedas ego chapter washington dc rapp cruised up massachusetts avenue toward rock creek his mind worked geographically it connected dots like stick pins on a map with strings running between points of interest linking one location or fact to another he was listening to special agent art harris the fbis senior guy at the nctc art had just stuck a pin in rapps map and it wasnt making a lot of sense he trusted harris though so he let him work his way through the preamble rather than telling him to cut to the heart of it harris and rapp had a nice arrangement through unofficial channels art passed along what the fbi knew on various cases that bumped up against things rapp and his people were dealing with and he made sure very little was put in writing over the last few years his early warnings had allowed rapp to get out in front of certain things and deal with them before all the badges and lawyers showed up harris had just told rapp about an investigation in iowa two bodies had been found in the basement of a torched farmhouse they were burned beyond recognition but preliminary reports said theyd been shot the local sheriff was all but sure they were two hunters who had gone missing the day before he gave rapp the backstory on what the sheriff thought had happened while rapp found it all about as interesting as a whodunit episode of primetime he knew there had to be more to the story or harris wouldnt have bothered to call the sheriff called the jttf gang over in chicago harris said jttf stood for joint terrorism task force they were formed after to foster cooperation and preparedness between the myriad local and federal law enforcement agencies in communities across the country im listening the barn almost caught fire but survived the blaze inside the sheriff found a bunch of supplies the kind of crap the armageddon types would have a bunch of mres guns ammunition and some handydandy military grade c plastic explosives complete with detonators they also found a couple of backpacks that contained maps cash credit cards ids and passports photos rapp asked already knowing the names would be bullshit yeah your boys run them through tide tide stood for terrorist information datamart environment and was an extensive database run by the nctc doing it right now but it doesnt look promising they prioritized it and have already blown through all the usual suspects whats left we wouldnt be interested in unless you think one of these guys might be filipino no rapp said as he thought about it some weird crap went on in the rural areas across the heartland it was amazing the type of hardware these militia groups could get their hands on it was probably nothing but just in case he said do me a favor and send the photos to my blackberry i will but theres one other thing you might find interesting the farm was purchased about six months ago by an llc it was handled by an attorney out of new york im sure people do that all the time rapp had done it himself im sure they do the sheriff also said no one has ever seen anyone use the place kinda strange when you think of those hitlerlovin groups they tend to turn these places into fullblown communes people coming and going all day and all night yeah rapp said i suppose youre right well i just thought id pass it along i wouldnt be surprised if the wonder boys at justice decided to send us knocking on that new york attorneys door come monday if for no other reason than the c it was late friday morning rapp considered the possibilities did the sheriff by any chance give your boys a copy of the deed and all the title work public record im looking at a copy right now good send it to me and cc marcus are your guys from chicago on scene rapp asked they got there an hour ago and we have a rapid deployment team on standby good rapp took a half loop around sheridan circle and continued one short block before taking a right onto decatur place the place he was looking for was on s street but he wanted to drive past the back first to see if there was anything of interest up ahead on his left he got his answer hey art i gotta run thanks for the info and call me as soon as you hear anything else rapp hit the end button and then hit the speeddial button for marcus dumond a few seconds later the computer genius was on the line marcus youre gonna get an email from art in the next few minutes its going to have a copy of a deed and title for a farm in iowa it was purchased a few months back by an llc an attorney out of new york handled it do you think you could get into his system and find out where the money came from to buy the property yeah shouldnt be a problem give me an hour or two thanks call me as soon as you find anything rapp slowed down and looked through his heavily tinted windows at the back entrance to the big property a serious man with a dog was on the other side of the gate at the end of the block rapp hung a left on twentysecond and then another left on s street a third of the way down he pulled over and dug out the business card it was a local number so he skipped the first three digits and punched in the next seven a woman answered on the second ring mr sidorovs private line how may i help you peter please may i have your name no thanks just tell him its his friend from last night he gave me his business card at the club rapp said as he looked through his windshield at the recently purchased million federal style home trust me he said to the young woman hell take the call rapp didnt have to wait too long sidorovs familiar voice came on the line and said mr rapp good to hear from you so soon have you decided to come work for me rapp cringed at the thought that the fbis counterespionage boys might be listening in he would have to play things really straight while they were on the phone i was actually thinking you could come to work for us sidorov had a good chuckle and then said i dont think you can afford me probably not but i thought id play to your newfound love of freedom and democracy yes that would be your only chance now listen i had friend in russian intelligence fill me in on your exploits this morning you are a very interesting man a dangerous one as well according to my source only if you piss me off well he said dramatically i hope i have not offended you not yet you didnt seem too pleased last night i was more upset with your new business associate than you he was only trying to make a little money i cant begin to imagine trying to live on one of those pensions they give you i dont suppose you could with your highflying lifestyle but thats not really the point he knew the rules and he broke them and me sidorov said a bit tentatively you didnt break any law that im aware of well he laughed you dont know me yet i know enough i made some calls as well and rapp didnt answer for a beat i think we should sit down and discuss a few things i would love to how does your evening look not good rapp said looking at the house how about right now sidorov laughed i am barely awake mr rapp i still havent adjusted to the time change and we stayed out very late last night thats all right i didnt get much sleep either besides you russians can all handle your booze rapp put the car in drive and pulled across the street into the flat ushaped drive listen im parked in front of your house right now invite me in for a cup of coffee im kind of on a tight schedule this morning rapp turned off the engine and got out he counted to ten and then sidorov appeared in a secondstory window he was still in a robe you are a resourceful man mr rapp how do i know you are not here to kill me rapp looked up at him and wondered what assurance he could offer for starters i dont like to shit in my own yard meaning sidorov asked this is washington i live here i dont need that kind of exposure besides if i was going to do something like that i wouldnt call you up and ask you to talk id just do it youd never see me coming sidorov thought about it for a long moment i suppose you are right ill tell my people to let you in give me a few minutes to get dressed chapter northern arkansas hakim stayed in the overstuffed leather chair and carefully chewed a banana between bites he sipped the warm lemon water ahmed had prepared for him the tall moroccan was outside doing a sweep of the propertyhis punishment for nursing hakim hakim could tell it bothered karim that ahmed was trying to take care of him he had always held the frail in contempt even when they were young he had no time for excuses or kids who claimed to be infirm hakim watched him pace from one end of the house to the other and could tell he was irked to be in the presence of his feeble friend never mind that he had caused the injuries karim was far too narcissistic to own up to that in his mind hakim had deserved the beating and he had done nothing more than carry out the punishment karim probably thought that if his friend had been in better shape he would have suffered less from the blows none of it actually made any sense but it allowed him to rationalize away his guilt and look down on his injured friend with disgust the front door opened and ahmed entered the room he leaned his rifle against the wall and took the binoculars from around his neck with flushed cheeks he said the perimeter is secure no sign of anyone karim stood with his deliberate military posture and looked out the big window i heard a dog yes ahmed said with a slight bow of his head from down the hill the next house eight hundred meters away there are several of them are they fenced in no and what should we do if they wander up here ahmed looked nervously at hakim for help and then said shoot them maybe karim slowly turned and looked him in the eye i do not like this place why hakim asked inserting himself into the conversation karim looked as if he might not answer the question and then said there is too much we do not know such as hakim asked we do not know if someone is expected to show up they could have deliveries the phone has already rung twice he looked to the photos on the mantel family may live nearby he was right but all of that could have been avoided he gambled and decided to point out the obvious maybe if you werent so quick to kill everyone we stumble upon we might be able to answer some of your questions karim looked to ahmed and shook his head it was one of those looks that said see what i have been telling you turning back to his old friend karim said what is wrong with you why must you argue with everything i say why must you kill every person we come across karim looked with thinly veiled contempt at his friend he was like a sick dog that needed to be put down and if he didnt do it quickly the disease was likely to spread to ahmed they were going to have to leave this place the woman was still in the bed hed considered moving her but the pillow sheets and mattress were soaked with blood the old man and the dog were in the corner of the garage under a tarp he might as well kill hakim in the leather chair and leave him there maybe even make it look like a suicide to confuse the police that was a good plan trash the place shoot his friend in the side of the head and put his gun in his hand karim was considering how he would move into position without alerting hakim when ahmed stepped between them and pointed at the tv it has started ahmed said they all turned their attention to the tv and watched as the american president stepped up to an outdoor podium he began reading a prepared speech karim scowled at the man and briefly imagined what it would be like to kill the president of the united states that would surely earn him eternal glory in the eyes of allah and his fellow muslims the world over the president droned on about the hard work duty sacrifice and perseverance of the rescue workers emergency personnel and law enforcement over the past week karim noticed not for the first time that leaders the world over loved to hear themselves speak it was as if they were a walking thesaurus descriptions came in threes when one adjective would do just fine he supposed it made them feel smart the president went on to talk about the losses they had suffered he choked up at the mention of some of the friends hed lost in the explosions and went on to talk briefly about the funerals hed attended for much of the week in a more commanding voice he listed half a dozen tragedies that had beset the country over the past eighty years and gave examples of how each time americans rose to the occasion and persevered then he moved onto a topic that grabbed karims interest in regard to the cowardly attacks of last week there is an untold chapter that i had decided to keep from you until now the reasons for not coming forward with this sooner are complicated but in essence involve issues of national security in addition to the three restaurants that were bombed last week a federal facility in virginia was also attacked there has been no shortage of rumors in regard to the facility itself and the attack on it im here this morning to put those rumors to rest the facility that was attacked was the national counterterrorism center as the name would suggest this relatively new building houses elements of the both the fbis and the cias counterterrorism units as well as personnel from over a dozen other agencies and organizations the building is the nerve center for the battle against terrorism just hours after last weeks cowardly attacks in washington dc a karim pointed at the tv and began screaming cowardly he puts pilotless drones in the air over pakistan and fires on villages with women and children and he dares call us cowards hakim thought about pointing out the fact that the reason those missiles were fired was that al qaeda liked to hide behind the skirts of the very women he was describing but he thought that might finally put his friend over the edge and all things considered he wanted to live long enough to hear the presidents side of the story the president continued saying a black suburban disguised as an emergency vehicle showed up at the gate of the national counterterrorism center inside were six heavily armed men masquerading as swat personnel they shot and killed a number of guards and then entered the building where they proceeded to the top floor of the facility where the counterterrorism operations center is located the six men forced their way into the operations center and opened fire on the unarmed employees who were so diligently trying to aid the men and women involved in the rescue operations fortunately there were a few employees who were armed one such individual is with us here today the president stopped and looked over his shoulder to a younger man in a dark suit who was wearing a medal around his neck with a tricolor silk ribbon id like to introduce you to mike nash mr nash is a retired marine corps officer and until very recently an undercover operative for the cias clandestine service karim pointed at the tv and yelled that is the snake who was sending his agents into our mosques the president continued mr nash was at the facility last week when it was attacked and watched in horror and confusion as the six armed men moved into the operations center in a single line and began killing his coworkers at nearpointblank range a combat veteran and expert on tactics mr nash assessed the situation and acted decisively ignoring extreme danger to his own life mr nash did the last thing the terrorists expected he charged the line of men headon his bravery and superb training caught the terrorists by surprise in a matter of just a few seconds armed with a single pistol mr nash shot and killed all six terrorists if that wasnt enough mr nash soon realized all six men were wearing suicide vests that were on automatic timers and were set to explode in less than two minutes thinking quickly mr nash and his colleagues managed to get all six bodies out a sixthfloor window the explosives then detonated without further casualties mr nashs bravery should serve as a reminder to hakim noticed the object flying through the air a split second before it smashed into the tv screen punching a hole in the glass and sending a shower of sparks onto the carpet he turned to see karim standing with his fists clenched in rage and the tendons on his neck so taut they looked as if they were about to break free from his own skin lies karim screamed all of it lies hakim stole a glance at ahmed who carefully had his eyes focused on the floor too afraid to look at karim they speak of honor and courage they know nothing of such things did you hear him he said superb training karim marched from one end of the room to the other and back angrily stomping his feet and then kicking the leg of the glass coffee table so hard it shattered superb training i will show them i will show them what bravery and courage and superb training is like a feral animal he turned and faced his old friend and i will show you too you doubt my bravery you said i sent them needlessly to their deaths that i am too afraid to martyr myself well we will all martyr ourselves he shouted in fact some of us sooner rather than later we will go to washington and we will show the world that this president is a lying dog i will show this mike nash what it is like to fight a real warrior chapter washington dc when the front door opened rapp was confronted with an unwelcome sight there before him was the big russian who less than twelve hours ago had come within an inch or two of tearing off his head rapps left temple began to throb just looking at the guy the bodyguard had a bandage around his throat and a hell of a shiner from where reavers had tagged him but here he was at his post which said a lot about the guy after having your ass kicked like that most guys wouldnt be too willing to show up for work the next morning the guy was either very devoted or extremely stupid rapp hoped it was the former because guys who suffered from the latter were hard to teach a lesson this time the guy eyed rapp a bit more cautiously he pointed at rapps waist and in a really hoarse voice that was english with a russian tinge said open your jacket rapp popped the one button and pulled open both sides revealing the gun on his left hip leave your toys outside the man ordered no thanks it was important not to back down rapp had no outward physical mark from their last meeting not a choice fuck you rapp said this is my town not yours the big russian stared him down for ten seconds and finally said wait then he closed the door rapp stood there and wondered how he was going to handle this if they came back and told him to hit the road hed told kennedy in very vague terms where he was headed just to cover his ass in case some other federal agency was running surveillance but he had no real backup if things went south and the russians werent exactly known for playing by the rules hed learned long ago that you could never let down your guard and think you were okay without your gun he didnt even like handing it over when he went to the white house he sure as hell wasnt going to go in here without it the door finally opened this time it was sidorov he was in bare feet torn jeans and a faded blue vneck tshirt he looked more like a hungover rocker than a billionaire financier the russian whiz kid smiled and said are you always so difficult rapp thought about it i suppose i am no offense to you peter but i dont know you that well and i have no idea who you have in there ive made a few enemies over the years sidorov pushed the door the rest of the way open i can relate to your paranoia i myself have had three attempts on my life sidorov turned and moved across the blackandwhitecheckered marble foyer rapp stepped over the threshold and scanned right and then left as he closed the door a big curved staircase wide enough for four people looped up and around to his right sidorov moved ahead down a center gallery that divided the house in half down the middle rapp followed him checking the rooms on the left and right as they went there was a music room a library a sitting room a dining room and another sitting room all were empty finally at the back of the house they entered a colossal kitchen that looked as if it had been painstakingly restored to its original s condition a babushka in a gray house dress was standing on the other side of the kitchen island staring at rapp sidorov spoke rapidly in russian to the woman and continued through the kitchen and into a solarium he took a seat in a white wicker chair and gestured to the one on the other side of the table rapp sat and sidorov offered him his choice between the financial times and the wall street journal rapp took neither sidorov began scanning the front page of the financial times and asked so what can i do to help the famous mitch rapp i had a nice talk with your boy max last night very talented man sidorov said while still reading the paper im shocked your cia couldnt find more use for him i suppose there was a time where they would have but things have changed yes they have that is what i just told my bodyguard who for obvious reasons doesnt like you for the record i did not want to tangle with him but he didnt leave me many choices i just wanted to collect johnson and leave why did you want him so badly surely it wasnt my business dealings with him this was the part rapp wasnt sure about had johnson sold any additional information to sidorov or anyone else for that matter it would take a while to sort all of that out but for now rapp wanted to discuss something else his dealings with you are not my concern at least not at the moment lets just say hes been involved in some stuff that has a few people upset what kind of stuff the kind of stuff he should know better than to get involved in fair enough the babushka dropped off the service tray of coffee and poured a fresh cup for each of them sidorov took his with cream and sugar rapp took his black so what can i do for you at this early hour sidorov asked early its almost noon sidorov smiled i am a young man mr rapp early is relative i suppose so rapp took a sip and said max told me about the moves youre making in cuba he did i paid him a considerable amount of money i would think he would at least know how to keep his mouth shut i can be persuasive yes i suppose he regarded rapp for a moment and then asked so why are you here it involves cuba go on youve had some business dealings with general ramirez anyone who wishes to get things approved in cuba eventually must deal with general ramirez so ive heard rapp nudged his coffee cup and then said i need to meet with him i would think that could be arranged in private of course but why would you need my help i dont want him to know hes sitting down with me until its too late for him to back out and i would prefer to meet him on neutral ground the general sidorov said is a very dangerous man and what would you call me peter sidorov exhaled while he thought about it and said i have spent three years building my relationships down there i have significant sums of money invested in my various endeavors why would i want to risk all of that on a situation that is so obviously combustible rapp had anticipated this response because i think you can turn it to your advantage how rapp smiled this is all unofficial but theres a man who lives not far from here big white house you get the picture for reasons that im sure you can understand he is not happy with the events of last week rapp prepared to exaggerate a bit he has directed me to punish anyone who was involved in aiding the terrorists and how does general ramirez fit into that rapp told him how the drugs had been stolen and flown to cuba how ramirez had allowed the terrorists to use cuba as a staging area for their attack and in exchange was given a large cut of the stolen drugs sidorovs face grew pained as the details unfolded when rapp was done he said i hate the drug trade i avoid it like the plague its all very bad for business especially my business but i do not condemn those who choose to make their living that way and im not asking you to take a position against ramirez you just want me to help you kill him rapp didnt answer right away i would like to give the general a chance to make amends by doing what by providing me certain information about the person he was dealing with one of the terrorists yes and if he does not want to cooperate with you trust me hell cooperate sidorov thought about it for a long moment and then said this terrorism is bad for business i do not understand them but it really isnt my fight i fail to see a good reason for me to put my neck on the line rapp smiled sidorov like any good businessman wanted to know what was in it for him when castro finally goes it will be a freeforall down there it doesnt matter what you say youve purchased or leased it will be challenged by the folks down in miamithe cuban expatriates who had their land seized by castro they are going to want it back or at least to be compensated for it it will be a very nasty and costly fight and you will need every ally you can find but then again you already know all of this and thats why you hired max johnson to start digging up dirt on the important senators and congressmen it was sidorovs turn to smile surely you have more to offer than that my services your services as is evidenced by your fleet of bodyguards you have managed to make some enemies during your relatively short career that is true as you know i have a certain reputation certain skills that at times can make people nervous im listening i would be willing to offer you a bit of cover possibly deal with some of your more unsavory enemies in a way that will tell others to leave you alone sidorov folded his copy of the financial times and tapped himself on the leg several times before saying i think we might be able to work something out chapter northern arkansas karim vented more of his rage by smashing several lamps and knocking all the photos off the fireplace mantel hakim sat in the big leather chair and didnt dare twitch a muscle under karims untucked shirt the bulge of his pistol was obvious it was best to let the storm pass it took a few minutes but karim eventually composed himself he announced that they would leave in precisely one hour he wanted everyone showered and cleanshaven for the trip he told ahmed to go through the kitchen and pack any food that he could find and then he took the big road atlas hed found on the bookshelf and threw it at hakim find the best way to get there get where hakim asked in as nonthreatening a voice as possible to washington hakim got the impression karim was looking for an excuse to get rid of him so he nodded and began flipping through the pages and keep an eye out the window karim barked hakim watched him leave he stopped in the kitchen and said something to ahmed and then he went to the owners room a moment later the shower came on ten seconds after that ahmed came around the corner with a nervous look on his face as he crossed the room he looked over his shoulder twice when he got to hakim he whispered can you move hakim didnt understand and then suddenly ahmed was pulling something from his pocket and handing it to him in a hurried whisper he said hes going to kill you he told me take these hakim pushed the car keys into his hand there is a white car in the garage i put your backpack in the front seat go go now before he gets out of the shower ahmed pulled him out of the chair and got him to his feet hakims body was screaming at him from virtually every point he was in such pain he didnt know if he could move but somehow he did they were short steps at first more like the shuffle of an old man he reached the front door on his own and looked over his shoulder to thank ahmed but he was already gone cupboards were being noisily opened and slammed in the kitchen hakim opened the door and closed it behind him he moved across the porch to the steps and then froze there were only three steps but they might as well have been a cliff hakim grabbed the railing and willed himself down his torso twisted stiffly with the first step and he instantly felt a whitehot pain it was as if someone were stabbing him in the ribs with a knife having already diagnosed himself he guessed that was exactly what was happening one of his broken ribs was tearing into the soft tissue of his left lung with a jagged serrated edge he practically fell down the next two steps and then he was shuffling across the gravel his right foot first and then hed drag his left foot to catch up the pain was nearly unbearable he felt that at any moment he would launch into a coughing fit and then it would be over he would collapse right there in the middle of the gravel courtyard and pass out karim would then saunter out with that arrogant disapproving look on his face and before killing him he would have something stupid to say some phrase that would elevate his act to something noble while decrying the betrayal of his best friend that more than anything was what drove hakim toward the garage the hate that he felt for karim at the moment was unlike anything he had ever experienced hakim wanted to win he wanted to survive and he wanted his arrogant friend to feel the sting of betrayal he wanted the narrowminded fool to try to make the journey to washington on his own and he wanted the lion of al qaeda to fail and feel the sting of death just like his six brave warriors fortunately the garage was closer than the big barn where they had stashed the rv hakim lurched for the side door taking shallow breaths as he went it was the only way to prevent the stabbing pain he didnt dare look back until he got to the metal service door and then he did so for only a second there was no sign of anyone leaving the house hakim twisted the knob and practically floated over the threshold the overhead lights were automatically triggered by a motion sensor hakim slammed the door closed behind him and was about to open the big garage door and then stopped he decided he would get into the car first there had to be an automatic opener inside it was a big fourdoor white cadillac dts the owner had been kind enough to back it in for him hakim opened the drivers door and was relieved to see his backpack sitting on the front seat just as ahmed had said placing one hand on the roof and the other on the door he carefully lowered himself into the seat at some point he couldnt bear the pain and just let go falling the last foot holding the steering wheel he dragged his right leg into the car and then the other and then he just sat there completely immobile wondering if he would pass out it seemed like an eternity but it was probably no more than five seconds a voice seemed to be guiding him walking him through each step it was now telling him to put the key in the ignition he did and it turned over on the first try the dashboard lit up with various gauges and lights hakim looked for the door opener on the visor but there was none it took him a moment his eyes scanning every inch of the dashboard for the button and then he realized it was on the rearview mirror he stabbed the button and the door lurched up hakim put his foot on the brake pulled the gearshift into the drive position and prepared himself for the worst if karim was blocking his path he would have to run him over the optimistic side of him was hoping he would be greeted by nothing but daylight but the vengeful side of him hoped the arrogant asshole would be waiting for him he slid lower in the seat and prepared to duck farther and hit the gas should his friend attempt to block his escape with each passing foot of open space the conflict deepened until the door was open and he saw that the courtyard sat empty hakim stayed low and slid his foot from the brake to the gas back inside the house ahmed continued to rifle through the kitchen cupboards making as much noise as possible all the while silently counting to himself his biggest fear was that hakim would not be able to make it to the car how would karim react if he found him outside passed out on the gravel he turned to head into the dining room and look out the window but stopped himself he would give him another thirty seconds he couldnt risk helping him any further or he would be the one facing a oneman firing squad ahmed prayed to allah over and over harder and harder begging that he would heal hakims wounds and give him the strength to get away ahmed did not understand any of it he had nothing but respect for karim he was an amazing commander and was as good a leader as he had ever seen but when it came to his childhood friend he was not himself there had been times in the past few days where he had felt as if he was watching two eightyearold kids fight the constant bickering the back and forth about every petty thing they could dream up and then the decision back in iowa to kill the father and son it was the first time he honestly thought karim had made a tactical mistake everyone made mistakes but this one was obvious and ahmed couldnt help but think it was rooted in the jealousy karim harbored for hakim karim needed to be the hero and everyone around him had to offer absolute subservience that was why he stepped from the house back in iowa and destroyed all of the careful plans and set them on this dangerous and uncharted course ahmed finished counting to thirty for a second time and then kicked a pan as he walked across the kitchen floor and back into the dining room he looked past the living room and through the big picture window his heart leaped as he saw the hood of the white sedan ease out of the garage he glimpsed hakim through the windshield and thought he saw blood on his chin keep going he said to himself dont pass out allah please give him strength please protect him ahmed watched the car turn and accelerate past the big barn it started winding down the driveway a faint trail of dust kicking up and then the taillights vanished ahmed exhaled a sigh of relief but it didnt last long from the bedroom the noise of the running shower suddenly stopped chapter cia headquarters langley virginia rapp parked underneath the building and took the elevator up to the first floor he was grinning with anticipation as he walked past the cias gift shop and cafeteria the wide double doors to the award suite were open and he could see a good number of people milling about inside he crossed the threshold and paused for a brief second his eyes sweeping the room from right to left scanning faces just long enough to see if there were any land mines waiting for him but not so long as to make eye contact with any single individual rapp tended to skip these events better to come and go from hq and make as little actual contact as possible this afternoon however was worth the exception it was a virtual whos who of the national security community the top dogs from every agency and department that had a hand in the alphabet soup of counterterrorism as was standard procedure there wasnt a single reporter or photographer in the room there would be plenty of time for that later but for now this was the one chance for the men and women of the clandestine service to poke their heads out of their rabbit holes and celebrate the bravery of a colleague most of these folks had the security clearance or at least the connections to know the full story of what had happened the afternoon of the attacks and a good number of them were turning to get a look at rappthe other man who had risked his life these professionals would whisper among themselves but they would honor their oath they all knew there were valid reasons for a man in rapps position to keep his head down rapp had to be realistic though his role in the affair would be passed from one person to the next and with each retelling it was likely the facts would be warped like a rainsoaked piece of wood impossible to know in advance just how it would turn out rapp heard the squawk of a child to his left and moved in that direction he figured there couldnt be too many toddlers at the reception so the odds were the noise was coming from charlie nash he wanted to get in give his congratulations to the kids and maggie and tell them how proud he was of their father and husband if possible track down art harris for a brief update and then get the hell out of dodge rapp made it three steps before a smiling julie trittin cut him off barely five feet tall in her heels the petite brunette was the hotshot rising star over on the national security council shed come up through the ranks on the military side and until a few months ago was helping run a highly sensitive operation at the defense intelligence agency trittin looked up at rapp and with a mischievous smile said well well mitchell just how in the hell did you pull this off rapp cracked a dry smile and said i have no idea what youre talking about julie trittin held up her champagne flute and gave him a minisalute i thought you would say that she swung around rapps right side and hooked her arm through his leading him off to the nearest corner she whispered this is good rapp nodded and continued to scan the crowd nice turnout you know what i mean for morale and by the way wheres your medal rapp laughed off the comment my sources tell me the story is a little backward about who shot who last week your sources dont try to play me i know you were the one who charged that line of men and i know mike was up on the catwalk firing down at them you know how some people get confused in the heat of battle dont believe everything you hear trittin looked over to where mike nash was standing he was surrounded by a good number of wellwishers they were all smiling and beaming at the hero of the hour well im happy for both of you both of us rapp asked yes the president was a little disappointed that you managed to sneak out of the white house this morning rapp sighed you know how it is julie i dont do so well around politicians perfect segue trittin said in a more serious tone the president wanted me to tell you that he thinks youre an insubordinate little shit and that your medal is waiting for you on his desk hed like you to personally stop by and pick it up though i get one too rapp said in mock surprise yes you do trittin shook her head and smirked you really are something thank you julie i think youre pretty special too trittin laughed at him before turning serious two more things for you the fbi now has the lead on the search for glen adams pretty standard isnt it yes but you can thank senator ogden for putting you at the top of the list rapp showed no outward sign of concern but trittin had just gotten his attention what list would that be the list of people who may have had something to do with his disappearance the way i heard it he just up and left the country trittin shrugged her small shoulders and gave rapp a whoknowswhatcouldhavehappened expression rapp spotted the nash kids and out of the side of his mouth said i also heard hed been drinking a lot i heard the same thing but as you know the fbi will follow every lead even if it comes from a vengeful partisan hack like ogden especially if it comes from a vengeful partisan hack like ogden great she might be vulnerable at the moment trittin said without looking at him how so a new friend of ours told me ogdens been telling those close to her that she thinks the attacks last week were not on the up and up rapp froze for a second and then turned to trittin what in the hell is that supposed to mean trittin checked to make sure no one was near and then said she thinks it may have been a plot by certain people in this building to eliminate their critics and whip up antimuslim sentiment come on rapp didnt know if he should be pissed off concerned or just laugh he decided to go with the first one and kill a bunch of innocent people in the process including a lot of colleagues over at nctc like most conspiracy theories its heavy on motive and very weak on evidence its also crazy i mean dont get me wrong ive thought of plugging a few of those selfserving idiots but actually doing it is nuts the president agrees and that is why hes asked me to quietly see if i can leak it to the press why rapp asked in shock thats not the kind of thing you want floating around out there it already is at least on the internet its all the same jokers who think was a conspiracy the bottom line mitch is that the president is willing to make a move against her hes sick of her antics hed never say it publicly but he thinks shes come unhinged thinks shit i could have told him that years ago well i just wanted to let you know we have your back on this one you stay focused on finding this lion of al qaeda and well deal with ogden and the fbi thanks julie i appreciate it trittin gave him a quick hug and then moved off rapp circled the perimeter until he reached the nash kids theyd staked out their own turf near the back wall not an adult within fifteen feet just the four nash kids and tommy kennedy irenes tenyearold son when rapp pulled up they were standing in an informal circle with charlie the toddler waddling around in the middle looking like a drunken british sailorhis mom had dressed him in a white sport coat and white shorts with white shoes the other kids including tommy kennedy were dressed in their prep school uniforms they all turned to greet rapp and charlie saw his chance he broke out of the circle and charged his dads friend rapp bent over snatched him up and tossed him up in the air charlie let out a squeal before landing safely in rapps arms kids rapp said hows it going jack nash stepped forward my dad is really mad at you me come on you cant be serious he was trying to talk all quiet on the way over here but hes half deaf from that explosion so he doesnt know we can hear everything he says he was really mad shannon stepped forward with a smile and said my mom was laughing at him so i dont think he was that mad but he did say some notverynice things about you wouldnt be the first time did you kids enjoy meeting the president yeah jack said excitedly we got to take photos and everything heads up rory said while looking over rapps shoulder here he comes rapp turned and saw nash coming straight for him his eyes locked on him as if he were a ramhell bent on knocking something off his ledge a few people tried to stop him and offer their congratulations but nash kept moving rapp was suddenly glad he was holding charlie he figured the little fella would deter any serious physical confrontation he turned so charlie was in the direct line of fire nash pulled up to the group youre unbelievable nice medal rapp said pointing at nashs chest nash looked down and fingered it ive already taken it off twice my wife and irene and some pr handler keep making me put it back on rapp laughed over his friends obvious discomfort you think this is funny i swear if you werent holding charlie id take a swing at you rapp tried to turn serious you have to admit i got you yeah and im going to get you nash said as he leaned in this is bullshit and you know it rapp cupped his free hand over charlies ear and feigned shock at his friends choice of words hey dad i heard that jack announced as he appeared at rapps side i dont know if youve noticed jack but its my day when youre thirtyeight and the president of the united states gives you a medal you can swear all you want to now take your brother i need to have a word with mitch rapp handed charlie over to jack and then followed nash to a nearby open spot nash looked at the people who had gathered on his behalf i cant believe you ambushed me like this rapp couldnt stop smiling and i cant believe how easy it was to dupe you yeah well ive been a little preoccupied lately you do work for the cia you know youre supposed to see shit like this coming i dont want to hear it from you not now probably not ever you had no right to make this shit up well youre welcome rapp pointed across the room at nashs wife i havent seen maggie this happy in years nash looked at his wife she was talking with kennedy dickerson and a few other big shots and rapp was right she looked as if the weight of the world had been taken off her shoulders that doesnt mean it was okay for you to out me how the hell would you like it if i did it to you youd be breaking the law why isnt it breaking the law when you do it to me because the president didnt say you could he gave me the goahead and besides i dont have a wife and four kids who depend on me rapp looked back at the nash brood and said trust me you dont want to turn out like me they need you and you need them the words seemed to at least make nash stop and think he considered them for a moment and said i would have at least liked to have a say in it and you would have said no youre damn right i would have i didnt do all those things the president said i did you did i did some of them and dont get all semper fi on me you were a big part of it if you hadnt zipped that first guy id be dead and so would a hell of a lot of other people including you rapp poked him in the chest you deserve that medal what about you shit i already have three of them bullshit rapp shrugged see for yourself now that youre getting promoted you might be able to read about some of the stuff ive done nash suddenly lit up irene says im your boss now about the only good thing that happened today quit your pissing and moaning look at how happy your wife and kids are once you calm down youre going to look back on this day and thank me nash looked over both shoulders and said im going to ride your ass is what im going to do im going to be the worst boss youve ever had rapp laughed good luck youre not the first guy whos told me that art harris the deputy assistant director of the fbis counterterrorism division ambled over with a huge grin on his face rapp matched it and nash frowned harris stuck out his big mitt and said mitch nice work you got him good thanks art i appreciate it but its not the first time someones duped a jarhead theyre like labs harris said extremely loyal but at the end of the day not real smart boy you two are a regular rowan and martin who harris asked never mind nash turned away from them and saw the cias director of public affairs headed their way oh shit marian rice approached her new hot commodity and said good news minutes wants an exclusive with you theyre willing to put all their best people on it when she saw nash hesitate she said this is huge i know you dont like it but its huge and we have to strike now while youre hot come on she said grabbing him by the arm there are a few more people who would like to meet you nash resisted for a second and then when he saw the shitass grins on rapps and harriss faces he said keep laughing great friends you two turned out to be he started to walk away and then looked over his shoulder with all the excitement of a man being led to his own execution chapter northern arkansas hakim reached down and adjusted the seat a touch more leaning it farther back it seemed as if he was feeling better with each passing mile hed almost fainted twice during his escape the first time was going down the steps of the house and the second was when he had to lower himself into the seat of the car each time the pain of his broken ribs tearing into the soft tissue of his lungs was almost too much to take looking back on it now he was sure that allah had given him a helping hand nothing else could explain his not blacking out from the pain as he turned onto highway and headed south a coughing attack almost became a horrific reality but he forced himself to take slow shallow breaths now nearly two hours later he was feeling pretty good the big sedan was comfortable and the owner had fortunately left him a full tank of gas the wind was howling out of the north and he was headed south so he figured he could get in at least three hundred miles before he had to fill up on gas he was nearing the outskirts of little rock so everything was back to a twolane divided highway hed already blown through several small towns on the journey south the speed limit went from mph to mph and he hadnt even noticed it until some guy standing on the corner motioned for him to slow down after that mistake he tried to pay more attention he set the cruise at mph and found an am news station with a strong signal and settled in for the drive hed already listened to two local news updates and one national and there still wasnt a single mention about anything to do with what had happened in iowa there was one big problem that he needed to deal with and one small one that could become a big one he needed to go to the bathroom and under any normal circumstances hed have found the nearest gas station and made it happen but he was in such bad shape that he didnt dare try to get out of the vehicle just the thought of the pain that ripped through his body when hed gotten into the vehicle brought on a wave of nausea hakim thought he had a solution and he began scanning the billboards on the side of the road for the right place sure enough within a few miles there was a sign for a mcdonalds hakim got in line with all the other cars he checked himself out in the mirror while he waited hed found a pair of large sunglasses in the center console the kind that you saw older people wear over their regular glasses they were so big they effectively covered most of the bruising around his eyes and also helped age him he ordered a vanilla shake large coffee two bottles of water a couple of cheeseburgers some fries and some extra napkins he wasnt hungry but he thought it would be good to have some food in the car just in case he filled the cup holders with the shake and the coffee and tossed everything else in the passenger seat as he was leaving the parking lot he saw two signs that told him allah truly was looking out for him the first was a drivethrough pharmacy and the second was a fullservice gas station if he filled up now he would have no problem getting across the state line without stopping again hakim pulled up to the line of pumps farthest from the building and waited for a man to come out it turned out to be a young kid which was all the better while the kid topped off the cadillacs big tank hakim slowly began sipping his vanilla shake the total came to hakim gave him two twentydollar bills and told him to keep the change as he crossed the busy street and pulled into the drivethrough lane at the pharmacy he began thinking about his decision hakim had been up and down the gulf coast from the florida keys all the way up and around to brownsville texas he had contacts in a halfdozen cities none of them muslims and most of them involved in the illegal trade of drugs his most trusted contacts and the ones who owed him the most were down in miami but that was a long drive brownsville was as well in his condition he could never make it to either city without stopping and that would complicate things he would have to dump the car because eventually someone would find the murdered couple and report the car stolen no he decided it would be better to drive to new orleans he could make it there in ten hours arriving well before midnight he would have to ditch the car and call his contact there was one other option and he was tempted to go with it but he would have to see how things played out first he picked up some heavy duty aspirin and antibiotic cream at the pharmacy and was back on the highway a few minutes later hakim figured when he was done with the shake hed pee in the cup and then dump it out the window with his decision to go to new orleans though he needed to make a call he fished the cell phone out of his pocket and decided to turn it on for the first time hakim set the cruise at sixtyeight miles an hour and held the phone on the steering wheel while he waited for all the various signals to light up it took about twenty seconds with the phone making some funny noises as it ran through its setup and then it made a weird chirping noise and the screen told him he had one new message for a split second hakims heart sank and then he realized it was probably one of those messages left by the wireless company he held the message button down for a few seconds and then heard the phone dialing he pressed the speaker button and listened as the computerized voice told him what he already knewthat he had one message a few seconds later a voice from his notsodistant past sent a chill up his spine you dare call me a coward what are you you sneak out of here like some frightened woman while i am in the shower and leave me to fight for myself stuck in the middle of america you will pay karim sounded so angry hakim wondered if ahmed had received a beating for not stopping him allah will make you pay i will tell everyone that you are a traitor nothing more than a woman with a mans genitalia and that im not even sure about when i am done with my mission i will find you i will hunt you like a dog and i will make you endure unimaginable suffering and humiliation and trust me i will not fail i will find you hakim listened to it again this time the surprise was gone and with it his fear of karim he looked down the highway for a moment and decided to throw caution to the wind he pressed the callback button on the phone and left it on speaker it was picked up on the sixth ring i cant believe you are calling me karims angry voice came over the speaker i cant believe you have your phone turned on are you slipping are you letting your emotions get the best of all your selfproclaimed military discipline there was an angry laugh and then you are running away just like in afghanistan you are a coward hakim knew he was trying to bait him with lies and you are a psychotic killer of innocent people as well as a delusional liar i speak the truth as allah is my witness you are so arrogant allah does not condone what you do you are not important enough for him to care about you and you have lost the way you spent too many days in the west and have been weakened you are soft that is why i beat you so easily we will see who beats who in the end i am not running like jonah i am heading into the belly of the beast while you run off to your drugdealing friends you mean you are going to kill more innocent people or will you have ahmed do it for you like you did the others hakim paused and then answered his own question i think you will have ahmed do it you love yourself too much to risk being killed why dont you meet me in washington and find out i think not it is my duty to tell the world the true story of the lion of al qaeda there was a long pause and then karim asked and what would that be why do you not like women what are you talking about i think i will tell everyone that the lion of al qaeda likes little boys and is afraid to kill real men with guns he must kill old men and women in the middle of the night like a common criminal there was a long silence hakim could hear his friend breathing heavily on the other end he knew he had him near his breaking point hakim smiled to himself and laughed at the phone i will tell them how you send other men to their death while you take all the credit and then shoot unarmed boys i will tell the world that you are an evil little man in a voice seething with anger karim said i will kill you if it is the last thing i ever do you will have to find me first and since you are not very smart that will prove impossible maybe i will tell the police about the car you are in report it stolen hakim laughed out loud this time have you ever heard the phrase it is better to keep your mouth closed and have people wonder if you are stupid than open it and remove all doubt if you report the car i am driving stolen and i am arrested i will simply tell them everything i know about you i even have a nice photo i could give them hakim laughed again and then knowing it would drive karim insane he rushed to get in the last word i have to catch a plane maybe i will call you later try not to kill any more innocent people goodbye hakim hadnt felt this good in weeks he flipped over the phone and pulled out the battery several hundred miles to the north he imagined karim breaking more things and throwing another fit after a moment he thought of ahmed and hoped his petulant friend did not take out his anger on the moroccan hakim looked down the long smooth highway and said i am free free from the torment and stupidity of a man who never should have been my friend chapter cia langley virginia after they had managed to collect themselves and stop laughing at their friends misery harris asked rapp did you get the photos rapp had forgotten all about them he pulled out his blackberry and found the email harris had sent him several hours earlier he waited for the photos to come up on the screen and then scrolled down the first man he didnt recognize but the second one looked an awful lot like a certain moroccan hed seen in a photograph provided by catherine cheval rapp scrolled back up to the first photo and wondered if it was possible could this be the lion of al qaeda he felt as if he were holding the winning lottery ticket harris saw the change in rapps expression and asked what is it rapp lowered his blackberry and tried to figure out how much he could reveal there was no way he could sit on this information iowa he thought to himself the bastards had gone to the middle of the country to hide out what do you know harris asked impatiently let me check with a few of my sources harris studied him with the eyes of a career lawman youre holding back rapp hesitated that he was holding back was obvious here they were at the tangled and mangled intersection of politics law enforcement and international espionage he could trust harris but the fbi did everything with one eye on a possible prosecution and court date and right behind them were all the lawyers over at justice they would be obsessed with following the trail of evidence knowing that any defense attorney would do the same in an attempt to punch holes in the governments case this was exactly what the president and dickerson were afraid of he was screwed both ways if he brought them in and told them everything it would eventually blow up in the face of the french and further damage their cooperation rapp would lie through his teeth before hed let that happen but he needed the fbis help he simply didnt have the manpower to do what needed to be done at some point they were going to need a lucky break or they would have to go public with these photos rapp suddenly thought of something else and it turned his mood foul if it came out after the fact that he had sat on this information even if it was just for a day or two he and the cia would be crucified rapp eyed harris and thought of the fbis rapid deployment teams he couldnt remember how many they had but he thought there were at least six you still have that rapid deployment team in chicago on standby yeah rapp wavered for a minute i think you should deploy them i need a reason to deploy them harris said pushing for information twentyplus years of experience youre not a janitor tell everyone to snap to and make it happen harris resisted new development since we last talked the director sent out an edict this morning weve been getting false leads for a week mitch these teams have been flying all over the country theyre at their breaking point the director told us no more chasing ghosts keep the teams home until we have some hard evidence id say two dead bodies a bunch of militarygrade c and two sets of fake ids with photos of two men of possible middle eastern persuasion is a decent start what arent you telling me mitch harris asked art you know how this works i cant tell you what i know right now because you guys are going to make me sit down in front of a bunch of lawyers and put me under oath and ask me how i know what i know rapp shook his head that cant happen but mitch but nothing leave me out of this get your team there put these photos up on the wire and list them as possible suspects in a double homicide and let your guys piece it all together are you trying to tell me you think these are two of the three terrorists were looking for im not telling you anything art rapp winked the only thing im saying is that my brain tells me these two guys are middle eastern not mexican as their names would suggest rapp looked at his blackberry and said my gut tells me theres a chance these might be two of the three guys were looking for and your gut should be telling you the same thing thats all youre going to give me your gut for now yes i gotta run art deploy the team and see what they dig up rapp turned to look for kennedy where are you going harris asked rapp ignored him and threaded his way through the crowd toward kennedy she was surrounded by too many people rapp didnt want to talk to so he maneuvered into a position where he could catch her eye it took a few seconds but kennedy eventually saw him he pointed his finger straight up and mouthed the word now rapp left the room and pulled up marcus dumonds phone number he listened to it ring in the hallway across from the gift shop while he waited for kennedy the computer genius answered on the fourth ring whats up are you in the building rapp asked which building old hq yeah im down in the basement working on rapp cut him off drop whatever it is and get your butt up to irenes office on the pronto am i in trouble only if youre late rapp ended the call and put the phone back in his pocket just as kennedy joined him in the hall two of her bodyguards hovered nearby whats wrong rapp started walking ill save the good stuff for your office they moved quickly down the wide hallway while rapp filled her in on the developments in iowa they turned a few times until they got to a door that led to kennedys private elevator no one spoke on the ride up to the seventh floor when the door opened the two bodyguards stepped aside and rapp followed kennedy to the left and into her office i asked marcus to join us rapp said he should be here any second kennedy leaned against the front of her desk placed her hands on the edge and crossed her legs at the ankles she was dressed to the nines for the cameras dark blue skirt and jacket with black nylons black pumps and an ivory blouse im not sure i understand why youre so concerned yesterday when you sent me on that little hop to go meet with catherine and george yes well i told you last night they gave me some pretty good intel kennedy could tell by his sour expression that there was a catch and lets just say your friends up on the hill wouldnt approve of their methods kennedy noticed how he referred to them as her friends so youre nervous about sharing the intel with the fbi yes and i promised george up front that i would be really careful with the stuff he gave me between the two of us im about percent sure it came from his top source inside the cuban government kennedy nodded and considered how nervous she would be if she had to share one of her top sources understandable i told you they ided two of the three and they have a line on the third i remember well youre not going to believe this rapp pulled out his phone and showed her the photos art just sent me these this is why i asked you to come up here they found these fake ids at the crime scene in iowa one of these rapp checked the small screen this one right here im almost certain is a moroccan named ahmed abdel lah who catherine tells me is one of the three men we are looking for and just how does she know that unofficially and i mean really unofficially someone catherine trusts picked up ahmeds brother and had a long talk with him i dont know all the details but it sounded pretty solid to me and you know catherine as well as i do she wouldnt dump something like this on me if it was bullshit what about the other photo i dont know when marcus gets up here ill have him send it to george and catherine i dont want it to come directly from either of us better to make it look like it was part of an information dump kennedy thought about it for a second and said so ahmeds brother was more than likely tortured rapp shrugged as if to say of course he was and if we share this information with the fbi they will want to know where we got it exactly and then at some point in the notsodistant future theyll send a couple dozen agents and attorneys over there to question ahmeds brother and catherines man and we cant let that happen rapp said no we cant kennedy stared out the window what i need you to do is come up with a plausible explanation for why we think this double homicide is linked to the attacks of last week and do it in a way that doesnt compromise george and catherine or their people we could alter those photos and dump them into the database not a bad idea but art already ran them through tide and came up with nothing this has to come from overseas rapp looked toward the door hoping to see dumond as soon as marcus gets up here hell know how to handle it without leaving any fingerprints i also have him looking into an issue in new york new york rapp was getting ahead of himself the farm in iowa was purchased through an llc i dont know six eight months back the lawyer who handled it was out of new york i wanted to get a look at his files before all the dudley dorights show up on monday follow the money you got it im half tempted to fly up there myself and slap the guy around a little bit make sure i get the whole story out of him kennedy shook her head i dont like that idea rapp knew she wouldnt but asked anyway why if this adds up like you say the fbi will most certainly be all over this attorney on monday i know you can be persuasive but there is no guarantee the attorney wont file a complaint in fact once hes surrounded by a bunch of federal agents i can almost guarantee hell file charges and then ill have to explain to a lot of upset people what one of my top operatives was doing beating an american citizen and subject in a major criminal investigation before rapp could answer there was a knock on the door dumond entered the office and ambled over he was wearing khaki flatfront pants a shortsleeved blue buttondown shirt and an old black knit squarebottom tie with his afro he looked like a reject from the seventies whats up we need your expertise rapp said he showed dumond the two photos i need you to pull these off here and send them over to charles and catherine can you make it look like an information dump send it to them first and then send the photos to all our allies asking for help in identifying them no problem hows it going with the lawyer in new york james gordan dumond said rapp could tell by his tone that he wasnt impressed did you find the money trail the start of it chase manhattan provided the funds for closing here in the states whered the money come from before it got to chase nassau and thats going to take a little longer to crack why royal bank of nassau very good security ill crack it eventually but its going to take the better part of a day if not the weekend shit all this international banking secrecy drove rapp nuts give me a few hours ill see what i can dig up good get to it ill be down to grab the phone in a few rapp looked back at kennedy and said i think you should call george and catherine try to explain our predicament kennedy looked at the clocks on the wall behind her desk and then hit the intercom button and asked her assistant to get butler and cheval on the phone tell them its urgent please any ideas rapp asked a few nothing great though i think i might be able to thread the needle thirty seconds later butler and cheval were on the line ive got mitch here with me kennedy said into the speakerphone as rapp joined her at the edge of the desk hello mitch cheval said you were going to send me those dna samples from the six terrorists sorry catherine but i might have something better rapp filled them in on the double homicide in iowa the explosives and the fake ids one of these guys looks vaguely familiar to me i could swear ive seen a photo of him recently rapp shared a look with kennedy and added he looks moroccan there was a prolonged silence and then cheval asked why dont you send me the photo on its way shortly when you get it maybe you could run it by your people in north africa and see if they get a hit maybe it matches a passport on file i will do that butler cleared his throat and asked what about the other photo he looks saudi to me rapp replied i see butler said what exactly are you looking for irene just trying to be careful george you know how this works if we put these guys on our watch list and tip off the fbi theyre going to want to know how we figured out who they were so far mitch is running with the idea that they dont look hispanic like their names would suggest yeah rapp said im thinking moroccan and saudi i just received the photos cheval said the one man is definitely moroccan i think i can get independent confirmation for you within the hour by independent do you mean something the fbi could use in court yes i would be careful with this other photo though im not sure the saudis will be much help they might even begin to destroy evidence im not sure we need confirmation on both photos at the moment kennedy said the moroccan should be good enough to pass the entire thing off to the fbi nice and clean anything from my end butler asked rapp leaned in if you could show the second photo to the right people george that would be great will do and one other thing rapp said youre not by chance heading to the bahamas this weekend are you butler laughed i wasnt planning on it well im flying over to nassau in the morning what on earth for i need to talk to someone about a shipment of stolen drugs and while im there i might visit one of your banks oh butler said showing a bit of concern if youre interested meet me at the graycliff say around eleven if not send someone you trust someone who might help expedite things let me see what i can do fair enough just shoot me an email and let me know if you can make it kennedy covered a few more things with them thanked them for their time and then disconnected the call she looked up at rapp with a pensive stare and said the bahamas yes and when were you going to tell me about this i thought id send you a postcard from the beach really and just how do you plan on getting there actually i need to borrow one of your planes the guy im going with is sending his plane to cuba to pick up the man i need to talk to cuba kennedy frowned who i think it would be better for both of us if i spared you the details youre unbelievable kennedy said with a shake of her head and a sigh chapter new orleans his watch woke him up with a steady beep beep hakim turned off the alarm and looked over at the dashboard clock it was fourthirty in the morning he reached down with his left hand and searched for the seat controls after he found the big vertical knob he pulled up and the drivers seat began to raise itself out of the fully reclined position he looked over the steering wheel half expecting to see a cordon of police officers there were none he smiled at the cars opposite him there wasnt a person in sight and beyond the edge of the concrete parking ramp he could see the sky in the east turning gray with the first hints of dawn the relief felt good so far his plan had worked on the drive into new orleans hed weighed his options and decided it was time to press his luck before his window of opportunity closed it was time for a bold move he had a brief conversation with his cajun associate timmy the bayou coke king the coke king told him he was running a boat in five days the thought was hakim could ride out for the transfer and then ask for passage on the other boat the plan might work but hakim had other concerns the first involved staying at the cajuns swamp shack for five days the place was filthy in his current state he was likely to catch a debilitating infection his second concern was the vision of himself attempting to climb from one boat to the other in the inevitable swells and that would be after pounding through who knew what kind of seas at close to fifty knots if it had been his only option he still would have wavered but he supposed in the end he would have simply dealt with the pain fortunately there was an alternative there was a great deal of risk in the sense that he would be trapped as soon as he entered an airport but sometimes the best course of action really was the simplest he had an american passport and a matching credit card with a tenthousanddollar limit on the way down the night before hed pulled into a walmart parking lot outside vicksburg and turned on his laptop there were no direct flights but in a way that was better he had his choice of ten or more flights that would work but the best combination was the am out of new orleans with a connecting flight through miami he was very familiar with both airports the security people at new orleans international airport werent exactly the cream of the crop and the people at the miami airport werent much better miami was also one of the busiest airports in the world and they were far more worried about who was entering the country than who was leaving it so hakim said a quick prayer and booked the tickets through an online travel site he then very carefully eased himself out of the car and slowly walked into walmart so he could use the bathroom and purchase what he would need for the next leg of his journey back in the parking lot he took all of his purchases out of the packaging and neatly placed them in the new carryon bag hed purchased he was back on the road in less than thirty minutes and headed over to jackson mississippi where he pulled in to a truck stop he hobbled in with his new roller suitcase and found the pay showers that the truckers used he fed dollar bills into the slot and then entered the cramped space slowly and carefully he peeled off his clothes and rolled them into a neat ball before stuffing them into one of the two plastic walmart bags hed saved hakim stood in front of the streaked and scratched mirror and inspected the full extent of his injuries the left side of his body from under his armpit to nearly his waist was one marbleized slab of purple both eyes were bruised his nose was broken and his lip was split even when confronted with the severity of his injuries he had a hard time believing his friend had done this to him he plugged in the electric clipper set it to one placed his head over the sink and began to buzz off his mediumlength black hair in a few minutes he was done all of his hair was buzzed to a uniform quarter inch he then took the electric razor and took off the two days of stubble on his cheeks and neck leaving the thick black hair on his upper lip and chin it was exactly the way he had worn it for the photo he used on his fake passport after a quick shower hakim placed the electric razor in his suitcase and put the clipper in the second bag with his shoes he then put on his baggy khaki cargo shorts a striped light blue and white polo shirt flipflops and a budweiser hat on the way back to the car he tossed the two walmart bags into a garbage can then drove down to new orleans and the louis armstrong international airport he arrived a few minutes past eleven and pulled up to the shortterm parking kiosk where he grabbed his ticket and entered the large multilevel parking structure he found the perfect open spot on the fourth floor it was dark and the space was bracketed by a large suv and a pickup truck he carefully backed the vehicle into a tight space there was barely a foot to spare on each side which was good if any security guards were on patrol this was the last row they would pick to cut through hakim set the alarm on his watch reclined his seat turned it all over to allah and went to sleep now he had a flight to catch he was about to open his door when he realized he needed more room he started the car and pulled out of the spot near the end of the row he found two open spaces and pulled in he popped the trunk and took the keys with him he stuffed the keys in the pocket of the hoodie sweatshirt he had on over the polo shirt and then very carefully slid the carryon over the edge and let it slide off the bumper to the ground after extending the handle he grabbed the bag of cotton balls and tore it open he took three and stuffed them in his mouth on the left side between his teeth and his cheek he tapped his cheek with the palm of his hand and decided he could use a few more after that he put just two on the right side and stuffed some extra ones in his jacket pocket he then grabbed the dull metal cane hed picked up at walmart and closed the trunk with the left hand on the cane and his right hand on top of the wheeled carryon he began hobbling toward the terminal just before he got to the double glass doors he stopped and dumped his other forms of id in the garbage can it wouldnt look good if he was searched and they were discovered he took the elevator down a couple of floors and then took the skyway over to the main terminal so far hed seen just one person a flight attendant who walked briskly past him inside the terminal there were more people but it didnt look like much in the big space hakim looked carefully both ways and saw only one police officer overweight and barely awake he didnt look like much of a threat if they knew he was coming they were doing a wonderful job concealing themselves american airlines had the busiest counter hakim wrote it off to the sixoclock flight to miami he got in the coach line and waited a few minutes before it was his turn the woman behind the counter looked at him with a combination of shock and concern oh you poor dear she proclaimed what happened to you carrr assssident hakim mumbled through his cottonstuffed mouth he handed over his passport im so sorry the woman said as she took his passport and punched his name into the computer i have your reservation right here mr andros youre on the six oclock to miami she tapped a series of keys and looked at the screen for a moment you know what im going to do for you first class is wide open i think youll be more comfortable up there now once you get to miami youll have to check with the gate agent the computer isnt showing what aircraft you have for the next leg of your trip so i cant assign those seats would you like to check your bag hakim smiled and said pweeeze the woman took the bag and handed him his boarding pass after he was done thanking her hakim hobbled over to the security line only one metal detector was open and again the security people looked about as alert as the cop by the front door no sense in turning back now he thought to himself he showed the tsa agent his passport and boarding pass the agent a fiftysomeyearold man with bloodshot eyes made sure the name on the passport and the boarding pass matched and that was about it hakim kicked off his flipflops and very slowly bent down to pick them up he placed them on the conveyor belt and tossed his money watch phone and car keys in a dish a female tsa agent standing on the other side of the metal detector asked him if he could walk without the cane and he nodded that he could he placed the cane and his zipup hoodie on the belt as well and slowly made his way through the detector on the other end he picked all of his stuff up without a problem he felt so good after clearing security that he had to remind himself to slow down using the cane he made his way over to the closest coffee shop and was about to get in line when he remembered the cotton balls he picked up two newspapers instead and then headed down to the gate on the way he extracted a few of the cotton balls and placed them in his left pocket with the others a twentyfourhour news channel was on an overhead tv near the gate he stopped and watched for about five minutes there was nothing new except that the director of the fbi had announced a press conference for am eastern hakim boarded early with the only other firstclass passenger and settled into his seat when the flight attendant came by with a glass of champagne and orange juice he decided things were indeed looking good and he took her up on the offer that was when he decided to call karim he removed a few more cotton balls turned on the phone and then hit send twice surprisingly the phone went straight into voicemail at the beep hakim turned toward the window and in a quiet voice said its too bad you didnt trust me im already on my way out of the country i suppose youre stuck somewhere in the middle of america getting ready to kill another innocent woman the lion of al qaeda he laughed it should be the lamb of al qaeda its too bad you dont have the genitalia to fight a real man face to face hakim ended the call and removed the battery as a precaution he couldnt help but smile at the thought of what the message would do to the thinskinned karim he sincerely hoped the idiot would meet his death in a hail of bullets hakim hoped he could read about it on a beach somewhere he would put the madness of al qaeda behind him and start a new life chapter nassau bahamas rapp was wearing a black nat nast bowling shirt with a couple of vertical cream stripes linen pants and black loafers his face was cleanshaven and his eyes were concealed behind a pair of dark aviator sunglasses he saw them sitting at the outdoor caf√© as he ambled down the street glancing in the windows of the highend shops as he went sidorovs detail knew who he was and expected him but the general had brought along two men of his own rapp had no idea if they were armed or not it was highly possible that they had carried their weapons through customs in a diplomatic pouch just as he had gunplay was to be avoided if the cubans got rough coleman reavers and wicker were just up the street in a minivan and butler and his men were at the other end of the block sitting at an outdoor caf√© so rapp moved down the street with relative calm casually taking in the surroundings there were banks on all four corners of the block and between them a spattering of jewelry stores caf√©s art galleries and french and italian designer labels there wasnt a cobblestone out of place or a speck of garbage to be seen rapp had walked down streets just like this in dozens of cities the world over the ultrarich who wanted to avoid taxes flocked to cities like nassau with their strong bankingprivacy laws along with them came a smaller percentage of men who made their money in the illicit trades of guns drugs and organized crime rapp had spent a great deal of his career tracking these modernday pirates and the trail often led to these tiny island nations rapp stopped next to the outdoor caf√© and pretended to check out the display of panerai watches in the window of a jewelry store through the reflection in the large plateglass window he could see five bodyguards three for sidorov and two for the general he was close enough to smell the smoke from the generals cigar and could faintly hear him talking to sidorov in english rapp nonchalantly stepped over the rope that divided the outdoor seating for the caf√© from the rest of the sidewalk he kept his right shoulder to the building and his eyes on the bodyguards if they reached for a weapon rapp would raise his hands and let coleman and the brits come riding in with the bodyguards out of the way rapp could focus on ramirez not a single bodyguard reacted until rapp was next to the table sidorov and ramirez were sitting across from each other there were two more chairs and rapp stepped behind the one that had its back to the building peter rapp said in a friendly voice good to see you sidorov stood and offered his hand mitch very nice to see you please join us id like you to meet general manuel ramirez the general stayed seated he looked up at rapp from behind his reflective glasses his upper lip pushed out while he sized up this new person after an awkward moment he offered his hand rapp clamped down on the generals thin hand and squeezed hard general ive been looking forward to this for some time the general just stared im afraid i dont know who you are rapp shook his head while he pulled back the chair and sat no reason for you to know me peter was kind enough to set up this meeting what are you talking about he removed his sunglasses and gave sidorov a disapproving glare i do not like surprises then youre going to hate this rapp said not wanting to give ramirez a chance to get rolling as youve probably already guessed im an american and while that might not interest you too much i think this will im a counterterrorism operative for the cia which is a nice way of saying i kill terrorists and the scumbags who help them if ramirez was impressed he didnt show it rapp pressed on im going to assume youre familiar with the terrorist attacks in washington last week a lot of americans were killed and my president isnt very happy about that he has given me the green light to kill anyone who had anything to do with the attacks ramirez remained stoic and just how would this concern me well as it turns out the terrorist cell that hit washington used your island as a staging area for their attacks i dont believe you the general said glancing over his shoulder at one of his bodyguards rapp ignored the denial and said last week a plane landed on your island and you ordered your men to help offload a large amount of cocaine onto two speedboats and one truck i dont know what you are talking about rapps eyes stayed locked on the general we can handle this one of three ways the first way is the best you tell me everything you know about hakim al harbi i have never heard of this man thats the real name of the smuggler you were dealing with hes a saudi who spent a little time fighting in afghanistan and then left as an advance scout for the al qaeda cell that hit washington last week rapp pulled an envelope from his pocket and extracted three photos that had been lifted from al harbis drivers license college student id and passport dumond had hacked into the various databases and snatched the photos without alerting the saudis rapp watched the general closely this is the guy you made the deal with he passed himself off as an intermediary who was helping the taliban smuggle opium the general exhaled nervously and again looked over his shoulder to the closest bodyguard he cant help you general you need to tell me everything you know and i mean everything email accounts hotels airlines he traveled on any contacts you know of and most important the banks he dealt with dumond had had his team scouring the international banking community for close to twentyfour hours and so far they had come up with nothing i dont know this man ill make a deal with you general you dont insult me and i wont insult you you bring me here under false pretenses and then complain that i am insulting you the general angrily shook his head the arrogance of you americans i know more about you than you can possibly imagine general i know for instance that before you will do business with anyone you require an upfront deposit you used to take it in cash but with fidels recent decline in health youve begun to have that money deposited in offshore accounts in fact ive been told you prefer it in gold one hundred thousand dollars lies rapps patience was waning he figured hed give it one more shot before he dropped the bomb general this doesnt have to be difficult i really dont give a shit about these drugs i just want the information general ramirez looked at the nearest bank for a long moment and then turned back to rapp and said for one million dollars i will give you the information you ask for and i want it in gold he added with wry smile the american dollar isnt worth shit these days rapps entire impression of the man changed in that instant he was either incredibly greedy or extremely stupid lets get one thing straight im here because peter convinced me to at least sit down and talk to you i have been ordered to kill every last piece of scumsucking shit who had anything to do with this mess i dont know you and going into this meeting i guess i somehow got it in my head that you would be a reasonable man youd recognize that you were on the wrong side of a really nasty situation and you would gladly help make amends you will have to excuse me mr whatever your name is if i do not feel like kneeling at the american altar your country is not without sin you cannot lure me here under false pretenses and threaten me what are you going to dokill me right here ramirez held out his hands and looked around you think me a petty thug and you are sorely mistaken you are a wealthy country a million dollars is nothing to you you can threaten all you want but at the end of the day i know you will pay it is much easier to do things that way so get on your phone he made a movealong gesture with his right hand and get the approval to have the money transferred when you have it i will consider providing you with the information you seek rapps brow furrowed in disapproval as he sized up the general he knew butler and his men were nearby listening to the conversation and right about now his british friend was hoping he would give the crass general a million dollars and move on that wasnt going to happen though rapp cleared his throat and placed both elbows on the table you dont know me so i suppose ill have to give this one more try i came to this meeting with a few contingency plans when youve dealt with as many scumbags as i have you learn that you have to be prepared for the worst my initial thought was that id just shoot you right here and send a clear message to all the other greedy thirdworld dickheads who want to make deals with terrorists my second thought was that id have one of my guys pop you in the back of the head at the airport pretty easy shot really weve done it before everything is set up in advance you start climbing the stairs to get in the plane and when you hit the top step bam a nice heavygrain softtip bullet right in the back of the head from about three hundred yards you fall into the plane door closes plane takes off and your dead body gets tossed out the back door in the middle of the big blue ocean never to be found you dont scare me mr rapp give me the money and we will talk until then i am done with you ramirez started to stand sidorov put his head in his hand and began mumbling to himself after a moment the russian looked up and said general this is not the wise approach dont lecture me ramirez snapped rapp reached out and clamped onto the generals wrist sit he pulled him back into his seat dont touch me you russians and americans are the same your condescending ways have grown old neither of you scare me one word from me to my bodyguards and you will both be dead like that ramirez snapped the fingers on his free hand rapp regarded him for a moment and then decided it was time to hit him with option number three general you think that because im american i wont actually follow through with my threats ramirez snorted that is correct every time you have tried subterfuge with cuba you have failed just as you will fail to intimidate me well see about that that planeload of drugs you and your men helped offload last week any idea where it came from i do not know what you are talking about the general said in a haughty voice rapp ignored his denial your new friend al harbithe guy you set up the drug deal withhe stole it from the red command cartel rapp let the words hang in the air for a beat and saw a flicker of recognition in the generals eyes i dont believe you i really dont give a shit if you believe me or not the important thing is that they will believe me because i have the intel to prove it satellite photos of your men offloading the plane my source told me youve already sold half your take phone intercepts of you talking about a new lucrative business partner rapp made some of it up but he knew the general was too focused on the red command cartel to doubt him of all the south american drug cartels the red command was by far the most violent i figure you have two problems i tell the red command that you helped orchestrate the theft and then i tell the brits what you did theyll come swooping in and seize every offshore account with your name on it all of those dollars youve squirreled away will be locked up in a legal fight for years to come the families who lost people last week will line up by the hundreds to sue you and theyll take every last penny ramirez turned to sidorov and said you will pay for this for what sidorov asked trying to save your life consider everything you have invested in my country gone all of it rapp laughed and said what an asshole here peter is trying to help you and this is how you repay him he is not trying to help me trust me if it wasnt for him youd already be dead rapp shook his head at the stubborn prick and said you know before meeting you i thought i would make this clean and easy you either tell me everything you know about this hakim guy especially any financial transactions or i kill you please enough of your false threats and theatrics pay me a million dollars or i will walk away how about i tell you to go fuck yourself and call the red command cartel and tell them that you helped plot the raid that killed seven of their men and looted one of their distribution facilities of approximately twenty million dollars in cocaine you are bluffing i doubt they will be so kind as to fly you to the bahamas on their private plane in fact you will never see them coming theyll show up at your house one night and slit everyones throat theyll kill your grandchildren your servants anyone and everyone they find and they will probably keep you alive just to watch rapp watched him squirm for the first time he stood pushing his chair back and eyeing the cuban bodyguards so whats it going to be general do you want to live and keep your money or do you want to die rapp waited five seconds he watched the greedy general try to figure out what he would do five seconds after that rapp decided he was done dealing with the idiot fuck you general rapp started to walk away wait looking over his shoulder rapp saw the general reaching into his pocket he pulled out a pen and a small notebook he told me he was lebanese the general began writing down a name adam farhat he wrote a few more lines on the paper and then tore it off and gave it to rapp that is the bank he used he specifically directed me to contact a banker christian something i cant remember the last name the deposit was to be held in escrow until our deal was completed account numbers i do not have the account numbers but i would imagine a man of your resources can figure that out youre damn right rapp thought to himself he looked at sidorov and said well talk later then turning to the general he said for your sake i hope we never cross paths again chapter nassau bahamas the transfer in miami was easy hakim got in line at the gate and was given his seat assignment for the flight over to the island he didnt get first class this time because there was no first class the plane was a turboprop operated by american eagle the only real moment of stress came on the other end when they landed at lynden pindling international airport when clearing customs he lied on his form and said that he would be staying at the megaresort atlantis he planned on going nowhere near the place and grew worried as the customs agent punched in his name and allowed his eyes to linger on his computer screen for what seemed an unusual amount of time he had used the passport on other occasions but this would be his last when michael andros didnt show up for his return flight on monday morning the passport would be flagged but by then hakim planned on being at least a few hundred miles south of the current location the man gave him the proper stamps and he went out front to catch a taxi he was hyperalert now too alert behind every pair of sunglasses he saw a potential spy watching his every move he decided he needed a good long sleep in a warm bed hakim directed the driver to take him to princess margaret hospital the drive through town was uneventful but then again he couldnt turn around to see if anyone was following them the driver asked him if he wanted to go to the emergency room or the main entrance hakim told him the main door he paid the man in american dollars and gave him a fivedollar tip he spent five minutes walking through the hospital his suitcase trailing behind him at the first garbage can he found he ditched the cotton balls when he got to the emergency area he leaned his cane against a chair and exited the building across the street he found a string of cabs he carefully slid into the backseat of the first one and asked the driver to take him to the towne hotel hakim had stayed there before it was nothing special in fact it was pretty downmarket but it would do for one afternoon the drive took just a few minutes when hakim got out he looked across the street and laughed at the irony the entire block was dominated by the american embassy the clerk behind the desk was a young man hakim pulled out a wad of cash and said a room for one night please just you mr smith hakim said pleasantly as he slid a hundreddollar bill across the counter the clerk glanced toward the restaurant to see if anyone was watching and then casually pulled the bill toward him and placed a stack of envelopes on top of it will you be paying cash mr smith yes the clerk quoted him the rate and then added the taxes all told it came to a little less than ninety dollars per night hakim gave him another hundred and told him to keep it he took the key and moved down the hall toward his room smiling to himself he couldnt wait to feel the sand on his feet but first he had to make a phone call and ask for a favor when he reached the room he left the suitcase by the door and sat on the edge of the bed he stared at the phone for a second and made sure he remembered the number his eyes danced over the keys and then he picked up the handset and dialed his friends number hello the male voice on the other end said christian hakim said in a happy voice that concealed his nerves its adam how are you he listened intently for even the slightest sign of nerves from the other man adam i was wondering when you would pop up i received some very nice deposits for your account this week quite a bit more than you told me yes hakim said thinking of the two pallets of drugs my importer decided to double their order at the last minute thats a lot of coffee yes hakim thought he sounded normal and was apparently still buying his story that he was a coffee bean importer even during a recession people need their caffeine i know i couldnt live without it at any rate i must thank you my boss is very happy with your deposits you are making me look very good now i suppose you will want to move it not before i give you the chance to try to sell me some investments good are you free for dinner possibly hakim honestly wasnt sure he needed to put something on the table so he didnt surprise christian too much when they met i was in a car accident and am not feeling percent oh my gosh im sorry to hear that how serious some broken ribs but mostly bruises can i help are you on the island do you need to stay at my place i am i just arrived i planned on getting here yesterday but wasnt well enough to travel what can i do to help well i need to get something out of my safety deposit box im leaving tomorrow and i remember when i purchased the box you told me that for special clients access to the box could be arranged on weekends as well absolutely you are one of my best clients when would you like to access your deposit box would an hour from now work absolutely and i hope you will allow me to buy you a drink and we need to get our fishing trip planned remember you promised me we will hakim said with a laugh dont worry i will see you in an hour hakim hung up the phone with the confidence that his cover was secure he picked up the remote and turned on the tv he flipped through the channels until he found cnn and then he froze plastered across the screen were two passport photos that hakim instantly recognized they were headshots that he had had karim take while he was training the men in the jungle near ciudad del este karim then emailed him the photos and hakim used them to purchase two fake passports one for karim and the other for ahmed they were the passports that he had placed in the backpacks and had stashed in the barn back in iowa the same barn that karim was convinced had been burned to the ground chapter washington dc they passed through centerville on interstate just before noon the plan had been to reach the outerring suburb at am but they had taken a wrong turn in tennessee the quickest route to washington would have brought them back up through st louis and karim reasoned the last thing they wanted to do was head back in the same direction they had come so they swung down south and took a very confusing route thats what karim kept telling himself because the alternative was to take the blame and that simply wasnt going to happen he had been at the wheel when the mistake was made while ahmed was in back sleeping karim was tired and irritable but with washington on the horizon the prospect of revenge helped lift his spirits he was a man of action cowering in a farmhouse did not suit him although the betrayal of his closest friend was weighing heavily on him he knew that was the real reason he had missed the turn he had been absorbed in his own selfpity for the benefit of ahmed he was trying to act as if none of it bothered him but it did and in ways he could have never imagined the betrayal the words the deeds of someone so selfish he had given hakim so much and this was how he repaid him how could he not have seen it earlier all of his careful planning his bold moves his bravery all of it was on the verge of being destroyed by one man a man who was supposed to be his friend looking back on it now though the signs were obvious hakim had never been a true muslim he had always questioned their teachers and their clerics he had been poisoned by all of his time in the west his obsession with american literature and sport fishing all of it should have been a warning to him but he wanted to believe his friend did it only for show so he could blend in and pave the way for his elite group to strike washington it had been hakims idea to flee to iowa and wait for the storm to blow over he had named him the lion of al qaeda he had planted the seeds of doubt in regard to the al qaeda leadership hakim had whispered in his ear not to trust them that they could finance the operation on their own karim could not believe he had been so na√Øve as to not see the true selfish motives of his friend and now the coward had run away and was threatening to spread lies complete fabrications that would make him the laughingstock of the muslim world karim had spent much of the night behind the wheel of the rv telling himself that hakim either would not go through with it or was not capable of pulling it off as the miles ticked by though he knew that he was wrong on both counts hakim had helped create the lion of al qaeda and he was surely capable of destroying the carefully constructed legend at one point when karim was sure ahmed was asleep he actually wept it had been the first time in years the tears flowed over the injustice how could a fellow muslim do such a thing when the tears finally stopped karim turned the anger on himself he had allowed his friendship and affection for hakim to blind him for too many years he had allowed hakim to get away with things he would have never tolerated from another warrior early in the morning as they passed over an unknown mountain range karim was greeted with perhaps the most beautiful sunrise he had ever seen more beautiful than all the sunrises combined that he had witnessed before going into battle against the americans in afghanistan fog clung to the valley below and it looked as if they were in paradise looking back down on earth it was in that dazzling beautiful moment that karim felt allah calling for him hakim had deceived him and distracted him from his destiny he had robbed him of his deserved glory of the honorable death of a commander leading his warriors in battle standing by their side and dying with them the tears came again but this time they were tears of anger not selfpity he thought of his brave beautiful warriors charging into the teeth of satan himself not a single one of them hesitated or even looked back it was the bravest thing he had ever seen and the american president called them cowards karim gripped the steering wheel so tightly he thought he might break it he had lied to the world and flaunted the inflated tactics of his own peoplethis mike nash and his meaningless medal every time he recalled the orchestrated press conference he wanted to scream the american president couldnt open his mouth without spewing lies yet there was the press complicit in every way repeating and amplifying the lies karim would wake them up he would give them something to remember him by he would make his men proud and he would show the world that americas president was a liar karim had the address as well as the phone number memorized it had been emblazoned on his subconscious nearly a year earlier it was part of the original plan orchestrated by al qaedas senior leadership they were not far from the safe house but first he needed to get rid of the rv karim called for ahmed to join him up front two more exits are you ready yes karim stayed in the right lane slowing with the merging and exiting cars at the fairfax county parkway exit he looped around and headed north he took his second right turn at fair lakes parkway and then followed it straight to the big mall the place was huge with rows and rows of cars to choose from karim pointed out several cameras as well as a mall security vehicle parked close to one of the main entrances remember karim said holding up the phone turn yours on and we will use the talk button on the side i remember next to a grassy boulevard with a row of trees karim brought the big rv to a stop ahmed exited the vehicle and crossed the boulevard ten seconds later he was wading through a sea of cars working his way toward the macys entrance just like the thousands of shoppers who would attend the mall on this sunny saturday afternoon karim drove a hundred meters and parked in the area farthest from the mall the parking lot was about percent full he glanced down at his digital watch every man on his team had been taught how to steal a car they focused on the most common makes and models and knew exactly what wires to clip and how to disengage the steering lock even so karims heart was racing his phone beeped and for an instant karim thought ahmed was trying to talk to him he looked at the screen and saw that the message light was blinking he stared at the phone wondering if he could listen to the message and still receive a call from ahmed he knew the message was from hakim and the pull to find out what he had said was too much karim pressed the message button and waited for voice prompts karims eyes scanned the parking lot while the quiet voice of hakim played over the tiny speaker its too bad you didnt trust me im already on my way out of the country i suppose youre stuck somewhere in the middle of america getting ready to kill another innocent woman the lion of al qaeda the words were followed by mocking laughter it should be the lamb of al qaeda karims jaw clenched its too bad you dont have the genitalia to fight a real man face to face karim let loose an unbridled scream of anger that echoed through the rv while he smashed his fist repeatedly down on the dashboard when he was done he looked around to see if anyone was close enough to hear and then repeated the process he didnt think he had ever wanted to kill anyone more in his life karim replayed the message one more time and then pressed the button to reply at the beep he said you are a coward and you have always been a coward you have proved it once again by running away and leaving me to fight i will prove to the world that i am the lion and you are the lamb my only regret is that i will not be able to kill you with my own hands but do not worry i will make sure that you are marked as a traitor to islam and hunted to the ends of the earth moments after he left the message the phone crackled with the voice of ahmed i am pulling up behind you karim checked his side mirror and saw a dark blue pickup he pressed the button on the side of the phone and said follow me they left the mall lot and went back down fair lakes parkway karim remembered seeing an office park not far away it would be mostly empty on a saturday afternoon he took a right at fair lakes court and pulled into the treelined lot a few hundred meters ahead on his left he was pleased by the absence of security cameras karim parked the rv climbed out of the drivers seat and went back to the kitchen area where two bags were packed and waiting by the door he went out the side door and locked and closed it behind him ahmed had already opened the rearside storage compartment he took two bags from the compartment and placed them in the back of the pickup before going back for a third ahmed then climbed back behind the wheel of the ford f while karim jumped in the passenger seat karim pulled the map from his pocket and checked their location one more time before telling ahmed where to go he led him back toward the mall and had him take a left on ox road they wound through some plush residential neighborhoods until they found themselves on stuart mill road the rolling treelined street held some of the countys most expensive homes karim however was not impressed the house was ahead on the right karim instantly recognized the gate even though it had been nearly a year since hed looked at the photos before leaving pakistan they had spent weeks going over every detail of the plan originally this place was to serve as the staging area for the attacks the hilltop estate was shrouded in trees and was big enough to house a battalion of men over thirtythousand square feet of opulence owned by saudi aramco it was used to entertain and house the man who ran the saudiowned national oil companys washington office karim had been assured the executive would be out of the country for the week before the attack and the week after the staff would also be given time off they pulled up to the gate and stopped both men looked up the long paved driveway from their vantage they could glimpse just a portion of the house karim glanced over at the keypad and remembered the code it was simple enough the four corners he said to ahmed one three nine seven ahmed pressed the numbers and the gate slid open they drove slowly up the driveway continued past the circle that led to the front door and went around the right side of the house where the garage doors were located karim drew his gun and spun the silencer into place before jumping out of the vehicle he found the keypad on the first of four doors punched in the same code they used for the gate and then hit enter the door began sliding smoothly up karim moved off to his right and looked around the corner of the house to the backyard it was landscaped in such a way that his view was blocked he moved back to the edge of the garage and bent to look under the rising door the space straight ahead was open but the other three were occupied karim was pleased he ducked under the door and moved across the gray floor ahmed put the truck in drive and followed him when the vehicle was clear of the door karim pressed the button and lowered it ahmed turned the truck off and jumped out before karim had to tell him the moroccan drew his pistol and quickly spun a silencer onto the end of it karim placed his hand on the doorknob hed been told it would likely be unlocked but if it wasnt there was a key hidden behind the garbage can he tried the handle and it moved both men stepped into a back hallway and turned their attention to the buzzing keypad on the wall karim punched in the code but in reverse this time the buzzing stopped a split second later and they both breathed a sigh of relief that did not last long footsteps could be heard down the hallway and then the voice of a man called out karim leveled his gun and glided down the hall in near silence ahmed trailed two steps behind the wide hallway had doorways on the left and the right karim bypassed both of them leaving them to ahmed a modern oil painting hung on the wall straight ahead and there were open archways to the left and the right karim moved to the right side and took a quick look into the room on the left before springing back to his left so he could get a better angle on the room where he thought he had heard the voice there was movement at least one person karim charged ahead his gun ready to dispatch any threat a man was seated at the kitchen table in a white robe and a woman was standing in the middle of the kitchen also in a white robe frozen like a statue with a coffee cup in one hand and a saucer in the other karim would never know if it was the dropping of the cup and saucer and the way they shattered on the stone floor or the womans earsplitting scream that caused him to squeeze the trigger but he did know that it happened without any forethought the bullet sailed clear through her open mouth and blew out a good portion of the back of her head an instant later she was on the floor twitching among the broken white ceramic shards of her coffee cup and saucer karim glanced at her and then his eyes traveled back to the white cupboards that had been behind her they were covered with brain matter and blood and looked amazingly similar to the modern painting he had just passed in the hall his eyes traveled next to the silent man at the table he was in his fifties and was undoubtedly arab the woman could have been his daughter the man swallowed hard and then with a quivering lip said please dont kill me karim nodded and asked what is your name khalid he said khalid al saeed you run the aramco office in washington yes you are supposed to be out of the country he nodded you are the lion of al qaeda karim was caught off guard how would you know such a thing your photo is on tv both of you he pointed over karims shoulder to ahmed karim felt his gut twist he tried to stay focused and asked why are you here you were supposed to be gone i decided to return early your family karim asked they are still in the kingdom karim looked to the woman on the floor her robe had spilled partially open and he could see that she was not wearing any underwear who is she a friend karim nodded ran a few scenarios through his head and made a quick decision he looked at the mans nervous eyes and said allahu akbar no the man pleaded i am a saudi i am a believer i have contacts very wellplaced contacts i karim raised his pistol and shot the man twice in the heart chapter nassau bahamas george butler looked across the table and said you could have just paid him the million dollars rapp smiled shrugged his shoulders and said i suppose im glad you didnt dumond said as he pecked away at his laptop the guy was a worldclass prick rapp laughed it wasnt like dumond to offer such a harsh opinion they were sitting in the chairmans club at graycliff the eighteenthcentury plantation house turned hotel and restaurant the place was very private and very british rapp had suggested it knowing that butler had a discreet agreement with the manager a waiter came into the room with a large tray he set down three plates and refilled the water and iced tea glasses when he was gone butler said to rapp you almost lost him wouldnt it have been easier to just pay him rapp shook his head maybe but i think a guy like that is just as likely to take your money and lie to you hes a thug he gets his way by threatening people with violence butler set down his iced tea so you hit him with the only thing he really understands i suppose it worked didnt it yes but you do know i would never have let you lay a finger on him at least not while he was here i know rapp said with a slight grin i would never put you in that position yes you would butler said with dry sincerity well at least not intentionally that has always been your achilles heel what some people have the midas touch you on the other hand have all the grace of one of those american footballers who bashes the quarterback into submission thank you rapp said with a smile butlers phone vibrated he didnt bother to pick it up he simply looked down at the screen read the message and said we have located our banker christian rapp said yes his last name is nelson he has a flat over in the grove not far from here do your boys have eyes on him rapp asked not yet a car is on its way but we have his mobile work number and email account all monitored rapp smiled when it came to national security and secrecy the brits could move five times faster than the americans do we know if hes on the island according to customs yes im in dumond announced raising his hands in the air as if hed just won an olympic medal where butler asked first caribbean bank impossible butler looked nervously back toward the door how did you do that so fast rapp leaned in and waved off butlers question if you really want to know maybe you guys could take a walk on the beach later but butler tried to press the question no rapp said knowing where it would lead them butler was a techie at heart you two will start talking about all of your trapdoors and back doors and portals and hashes and injections and my eyes will glaze over and then ill get a headache so you guys can go over all that later for now rapp said turning all of his attention back to dumond i want to hear about the financials of adam farhat dumond was the ultimate multitasker and had never stopped typing sweet mother of jesus he announced with his eyes still fixed on his laptop what rapp asked he has over thirteen million dollars in this account almost ten of it deposited this week alone that would make sense butler said payments for the drugs what else rapp asked looks like he runs some kind of coffee import company what about payments where has he been sending money other than this hundred thousand dollar debit which was probably to general scumbag theres nothing only deposits dumond squinted at the screen and pecked at a few keys he also has a safety deposit box butlers phone started ringing he glanced at the caller id and then answered hello he listened ten seconds his eyes growing a touch more alert by the second and we have people in place he listened again for a few seconds and nodded enthusiastically good ill be back to you shortly butler set the phone down and said apparently mr nelson just got off the phone with his superior at the bank and rapp asked one of his more important clients would like to access his safety deposit box this afternoon is that normal for a saturday rapp asked butler shrugged as if to say who knows these banks all make exceptions for their better clients wheres nelson right now leaving his flat we assume on his way to the bank rapp looked at butler for a long moment and then without saying a word both men stood dumond looked up where are you guys going our sandwiches just got here bring it with rapp said you can eat in the car chapter langley virginia the match was a blowout mclean was up over their hated rivals the langley saxons the difference this year was rory nash and everyone knew it the thirteenyearold had eight of his teams points nash watched intently as rory sliced through the saxons defense any other game hed be on the bench at this point but mcleans coach wanted retribution for last years blowout langley had one big defender whom nash had been watching all game he had reminded his son before the game to keep an eye out for him the kid was a head taller than every other player on the field and was known to lay out at least one opponent per game as nash looked out on the field rory was moving from right to left cradling the ball he sliced between two defenders and it looked as if the big kid from langley was finally going to get his shot at rory at the last second though rory slammed on the brakes and pulled off a perfect roll dodge the big kid sailed past rory with an angry grunt as he tried to command his large frame to do the impossible rory closed on the goal moving to his left as he went he faked once and froze the goalie and then again as he closed the gap his feet were dancing along the edge of the crease he faked low to get the goalie to bite and then the stick snapped around the back of his head the ball arching softly through the air to the opposite side of the crease where one of his teammates snatched it and snapped it into the open net sweet jack yelled yeah nash agreed with some relief your brother shouldnt even be in there right now nash looked farther down the sideline in search of his wife she was standing about twenty yards away talking to two of the other mothers she smiled at her husband and pointed at him the other two mothers turned and waved at nash they were smiling and nodding as maggie whispered something to them nash cringed he was not used to all this attention from the moment he had arrived at the field people had been talking and pointing dad jack said as he looked up are you famous the comment hit nash like a slap in the face he felt himself getting angry but told himself to take a deep breath it wasnt jacks fault he was only

his eyes off the field gross maggie grabbed him and pulled him in for a group hug a second later the whistle blew and the game was over as the two teams lined up to shake hands nash began looking around the park for his daughter wheres shannon not sure maggie looked toward the playground there she is pushing charlie in the swing nash watched her push the green bucket that her baby brother was in he felt a pang of anxiety and asked do i have to let her drive home yes maggie said shes not very good i mean dont get me wrong shes a great kid but she cant drive michael she just got her permit this morning do you expect her to be a great driver on her first day i dont expect her to be perfect but but what she sucks mom jack said maggie grabbed his cheeks oh jack sometimes i swear mom jack

the verge of upping the ante when an elderly couple approached them excuse me the man said mike and maggie nash the nashes nodded im charlie kelly this is my wife mary nice to meet you nash said as he shook the mans hand my grandson plays for langley ohh great maggie said not today your boy pounded us pretty damn good player he added gruffly thank you nash said kelly looked across the field his

in forty years at langley clandestine service operations spent most of my time in europe what you did he finally looked at nash it made a lot of us proud and theres not many of us left he shook his

charlie well he said as he looked toward the cars well see you around sure nash said very nice to meet you maggie said as the older couple moved toward the parking lot maggie said that was nice yeah we dont do enough to celebrate those guys jack returned from the middle of the field with rory and a couple of his teammates mom jack said as he came speeding up are you really going to let shannon drive i dont think its any of your business young man well if she is jack suddenly produced rorys lacrosse helmet im wearing this okay thats it maggie took a step and reached out to grab the sleeve of his sweatshirt but again he was too quick he darted off across the field maggie composed herself as she came face to face with rory and his two friends nice game honey thanks rory said can will and ben sleep over well maggie said caught a little off guard your father and i are going to dinner so shannon is going to be in charge her voice trailed off and she turned to her husband to see if it was okay nice game boys nash said thanks mr nash the two boys said in unison im fine with you guys staying over have you asked your parents both boys said they would and ran off to find their parents were going to dinner tonight nash asked his wife yes she said with a big smile i havent spent five minutes alone with you in the past week do you have a problem with that not at all he put his arm around her shoulder well eat someplace close by wherever you want honey italian they started walking toward the cars rory ran ahead to see what charlie and shannon were doing sure and then when we get home nash asked with a hopeful tone we can play spy and you can show me your gun nash laughed he looked at shannon pushing charlie in the swing watched him scream as his brother ran up with his arms out as if he were frankenstein charlie cut loose an earsplitting shriek of terror and then began laughing nash smiled and thought to himself this is the way its supposed to be chapter nassau bahamas hakim decided to walk to the bank it wasnt far and he needed the time to think just as he feared the barn had not burned down karim was an idiot all the more so because he actually thought himself smart he was an intolerable ass hakim kept asking himself if there had been anything else in the barn that could put the fbi on his trail he had been lucky that he had packed his bag in the rvs storage compartment months earlier karims and ahmeds packs were hidden under a tarp in the barn just as karim had ordered something about wanting to personally inspect them it served the fool right that his need to control every detail had led to his own downfall as he exited the hotel into the sunny afternoon he was positive that his only link to iowa was the conservancy trust that hed set up to purchase the farm itself he would have time though before they could get to the bottom of that tangled web and when they did they would find nothing more than a deadend the royal bank of nassau was nearly a mile away and he had never set foot in the place everything had been handled over the phone there was approximately twenty thousand dollars in the account to handle expenses and taxes pocket change compared to his deposits at first caribbean they could have it all hakim moved up the sidewalk confident that he was out in front of the coming storm besides christian was not a good actor that was one of the reasons he had chosen him to be his personal banker a block before the bank he stopped and checked his watch he had ten minutes before he was to meet christian the wise thing to do would be to spend that time checking for any surveillance so he crossed the street and casually strolled down the block every so often he would stop and pretend to look in a window he was actually looking in the reflection to see if anyone was watching him no one was and he was getting a little giddy at the new life that awaited him he would go to brazil over million people and a landscape as diverse as that of any country on the planet the population spoke portuguese english and a little spanish and most important accents were very hard to detect bloodlines from all over the mediterranean spain and portugal had been mixing together with the natives for several hundred years his naturally dark skin would be no more out of place than it would be in his native saudi arabia hakim had traveled the coast and found dozens of places where he could simply disappear and start a new life his only requirement was that he be on the water he would buy a boat and live on it for the first year moving from port to port establishing an identity and making friends maybe someday in the notsodistant future he would settle down and start a family he wondered about his faith though brazil was not exactly a place where a muslim could still practice his beliefs and not stand out for now he would have to keep that part of his life very private hakim was so immersed in thought that he didnt hear his name being called until christian was crossing the street he glanced up to see the look of deep concern on his bankers face oh my gosh look at you what happened a bad car accident did the airbag do that to your face ive heard they can really screw your face up yes but it saved my life christian stood there for a moment looking him over other than that how do you feel okay some broken ribs but ill survive well im sorry you had to go through that lets get you inside and get you taken care of christian led hakim across the street to the front door of the bank where a security guard was waiting on the other side of the glass doors the guard waved to christian inserted a key in the door and opened it once inside the banker thanked the guard and led hakim through the lobby to his office where he stopped to grab his own set of keys and pull up his clients safety deposit box information on the computer before we head down can i get you anything to drink tea water no thank you im fine do you have your key yes hakim couldnt believe how calm he was he supposed it had to do with his familiarity with christian still it would be a huge relief once he got what he needed from the box and disappeared they took the elevator to the basement christian put him into one of the private rooms with two chairs and a desk and left to get the box itself less than a minute later he returned placed the box on top of the desk and left hakim pulled out his key inserted it into the lock and turned it degrees to the left the lock disengaged and he lifted up the longhinged cover inside were a fresh set of documents including a credit card with a limit a money belt containing and sheaf of corporate bearer bonds totaling million in value hakim lifted his shirt and strapped the money belt around his waist he placed the new credit card and passport in his front right pocket and then glanced in the large manila envelope to verify that the bearer bonds were in fact inside he closed the box put the key back in his pocket and told christian he was done after the banker put the box away they took the elevator back up to the first floor and then exited the building back out on the street christian insisted that they get a drink but hakim told him he wasnt feeling up to it the banker then suggested that he give him a ride back to his hotel but hakim got out of it by telling him he needed the air promising that he would meet him for dinner later even though that was highly unlikely they parted ways with a set time and location for dinner hakim walked back to his hotel with a bounce in his step that he hadnt had in some time he was already thinking about the sailboat he would buy he knew the exact length and make and knew where he could buy a nice used one that was if it hadnt sold in the last couple months as he walked down the sidewalk hakim began to refine the next part of his plan mainly how he would islandhop his way to his destination the boat was in farmers hill a little over a hundred miles to the south there was no direct ferry and he desperately wanted to avoid airports for a while and maybe forever he was so fixated on solving this problem and leaving tonight if possible that he didnt notice the car slowing next to him suddenly the side door of the minivan opened and then he felt a jabbing pain in the back of his neck and a strong pair of hands grabbing him from behind he was both lifted and shoved at the same time he felt completely out of control and overpowered as he was folded and stuffed into the bench seat and the waiting arms of a man he did not recognize he noted the pain from his ribs but it was somehow muted he thought of screaming but couldnt nothing was responding not his mouth not his arms not his legs even his eyes were closing against his will and then everything went black chapter nassau bahamas rapp and butler saw the two men enter the bank and even then they werent sure it was them a few minutes later though dumond sounded the alarm he was inside the banks network and saw whose safety deposit box it was that nelson was accessing butler let rapp make the call did he want to grab both of them right now and see what was in that safety deposit box or did he want to wait and follow them when they were done rapp knew what butler would prefer as far as they knew nelson hadnt done anything illegal at this point storming into the bank would eventually involve the police and nelsons superiors as long as he wasnt a flight risk it was better to leave him out of it for the moment butlers people could keep close tabs on him and if they found something out in a day or two they could deal with him then rapp decided on a snatch and grab coleman had the kit with tranquilizer flex cuffs and hood the minivan with coleman wicker and reavers did a dry run while they were in the bank and looked for likely spots on two streets rapp wandered into a gift shop across and just down the street from the bank he greeted the woman behind the counter and asked her if she had any laminated tourist maps he purchased one and then stood near the front of the store pretending to look at it they were in the bank for just under fifteen minutes rapp was looking in the opposite direction when the target exited the bank five of butlers men were doing the same thing they had no idea if the target was alone and they didnt want to get caught with tunnel vision theyre out rapp heard butler call it over his tiny fleshcolored earpiece rapp slowly turned his head back in the direction of the bank al harbi and nelson were standing on the sidewalk talking after half a minute or so they shook hands and parted ways rapp raised the map an inch and lowered his eyes as the target crossed the street and came almost directly at him when theyd seen him approach the bank hed come from the same direction rapp wasnt sure if he was being lazy or bold it might have had something to do with the condition he was in the guy looked as if hed been in one hell of a fight he crossed in front of rapps position and continued down the street rapp counted to ten and then left the store he spotted him almost immediately half a block ahead of him he was wearing a red budweiser hat that made him easy to find rapp held the map in both hands and tilted his head so it looked as if he was trying to read it behind his sunglasses though his eyes were following the red hat one of butlers guys was supposed to be checking his six right now but rapp wasnt going to leave that kind of thing to someone he didnt know getting too focused on the target was a great way to get a bullet in the back of the head rapp spun and walked backward for a few steps pretending to consult the map to figure out where he was the pedestrian traffic was moderate which helped rapp noted who had been behind him and then spun back around he noticed a few security cameras that would have to be dealt with later and noted their position just in case the others missed them the bus stop was up ahead forty feet of empty curb space perfect for what they had planned rapp lengthened his stride and picked up the pace a bit still acting as if he was consulting the map he said it looks good when he closed to within thirty feet he gave the signal by putting the map in his back pocket there was no gunning of an engine no squealing tires nothing that would alert the target the minivan slowly pulled into the open space fifteen feet ahead of the target rapp smiled and moved over for a young couple who looked as if they were on their honeymoon rapp closed fast and quietly his left hand slid into his front pocket and pulled out the short epipen it was filled with enough tranquilizers to take down a pound man in less than five seconds rapp guessed the target was no more than pounds he pulled the cap off and stuffed it in his right pocket the big side door of the van slid open rapp focused on the targets head and watched it begin to turn in the direction of the van he moved as if he was going to pass the target on the left brought up the epipen and punched it down on the back left side of the mans neck his right hand clamped down firmly on the targets shoulder and he halfpushed halfspun him toward the open door the guy moved like a rag doll rapp tossed him into reaverss waiting arms and followed right behind him coleman was already pulling back into traffic as rapp was yanking the door closed rapp patted down the targets pockets he found two sets of identification one of which was for adam farhat the photo matched the sketch we got the right guy nice work guys rapp continued rifling through the mans pockets he found a phone a battery for the phone a room key for a hotel a money belt stuffed with cash and a manila envelope stuffed in the back waistband of the guys shorts he put it all in a small duffel bag and then began to go through the contents more closely he was in the middle of opening the big envelope when butler came over his earpiece we might have a problem one of the shop owners is on the street we think he wrote down your tag and hes now on his phone we think he might be talking to the police shit rapp looked at colemans reflection in the rearview mirror and said start making your way out to paradise island just in case coleman did so without having to ask why rapp pulled out his mobile phone and called the pilots he told them they might have to make a hasty departure it was standard procedure to have the plane fueled and ready for this very reason rapp tore open the envelope and pulled out a stack of papers he fanned his way through the heavy stock and fancy seals bearer bonds holy shit a lot of them he stuffed them back in the bag grabbed the phone and placed the battery back in its place it took a while for the phone to power up rapp wanted to see if hed made any calls recently the message light was on so he decided to start there he hit the button and held the phone to his ear you dare call me a coward the voice had an arab accent and rapp thought the man sounded very angry what are you you sneak out of here like some frightened woman while i am in the shower and leave me to fight for myself stuck in the middle of america you will pay allah will make you pay i will tell everyone that you are a traitor nothing more than a woman with a mans genitalia and that im not even sure about when i am done with my mission i will find you i will hunt you like a dog and i will make you endure unimaginable suffering and humiliation and trust me i will not fail i will find you stuck in the middle of america rapp mumbled to himself he looked over at the body of al harbi his sunglasses had fallen off and his face looked as if someone had beaten the piss out of him rapp was trying to make sense of it all when butler came back over the radio his voice more urgent than before the police are now on the scene rapp thought about the message hed just listened to and made a decision got it were out of here what about your computer friend here butler asked rapp had almost forgot about dumond ill send another plane and another thing i have a room key here for the towne hotel number twelve ill have it gone over coleman hit the gas and rapp ordered reavers and wicker to stuff al harbi into the canvas bag theyd brought along while they wrestled with the limp body rapp called the pilots back and told them they were inbound and he wanted to be wheels up as soon as they arrived the customs stamps and paperwork had already been taken care of rapp cringed at the thought of the police catching a cia black ops team with a heavily medicated terrorist one theyd abducted in broad daylight in the middle of one of the worlds most wellknown tourist destinations whether al harbi was guilty or not this was the type of thing that could set off an international incident coleman went straight to the private aviation section of the airport by the time they pulled onto the tarmac the duffel bag was zipped up and the engines on the g were spooling up coleman wheeled the van around to the rear cargo door rapp jumped out with the small duffel bag and headed straight for the groundcrew guy who worked for the local aviation company rapp slid him a hundreddollar bill and made small talk while wicker and reavers wrestled the big duffel bag into the rear cargo compartment coleman dumped the van in the lot and trotted back to the jet while the cargo door was secured rapp followed him up the steps and hit the button to raise the stairs there was a moment of hesitation while he wondered if they should retrieve dumond and then he decided he could do without him for a few hours what they didnt want right now was for the tower to lay down a ground stop all four men took their seats and buckled in as the plane taxied rapp tapped his earpiece and said george yes dont forget the tags on the van i wont there was a pause and then butler asked do we have confirmation rapp looked down at the small leather duffel bag and grabbed both passports the photos matched the sketch butlers man had provided its him rapp said nice work george we owe you big maybe you could get me one of those medals like mike got yesterday rapp laughed at butlers dry attempt at humor ill do one better ill make sure you get knighted that would be much better butler laughed ill talk to you in a few hours nice work thanks rapp pulled out the earpiece took the small radio from his belt and set it on the table in front of him coleman looked at him and smiled is there any feeling better than this rapp returned the smile not in our line of work the plane reached the end of the runway and didnt even pause it spun around put its nose into the wind and kept going the two rolls royce turbofan engines propelling the plane forward like a rocket seconds later they were airborne and banking to port over the water rapp looked across at coleman and said one down and two to go yeah wed better wake him up and see what he knows rapp looked over his shoulder at the rear pressurized cargo door in a minute i wanna go through this stuff first and then i should call irene chapter oakton virginia the bodies were dragged to a basement closet and ahmed sopped up the blood with some towels while karim quickly searched the house to make sure they were alone and checked to make sure all the doors were locked then they set about researching their opponent the internet was an amazing thing computers were sparse where karim had grown up and the internet was strictly forbidden his spiritual leader imam bin abdullah had warned them all that the internet was satans invention to corrupt the world ahmed however had spent much of his youth surfing the world wide web and knew his way around they started out with the two newspapers that they found on the kitchen table they were filled with propaganda about mike nash and his career they settled in the saudis opulent office he had two computer screens on his desk and a bank of large flatscreen tvs on the far wall there was not a single mention of them or the bodies in iowa but the tv and internet were abuzz with speculation the two photos were everywhere you couldnt watch five minutes of a cable news program without their images being splashed across the screen they were the lead story of every online newspaper ahmed checked they had already figured out ahmeds name and there was significant speculation that the other photo was none other than the lion of al qaeda karim had been alarmed at first but now he saw the benefit he had successfully pushed mike nash off the front page he was the story and they were only in the early stages of this match after tonight he would be the story for years to come he would prove to the world the audacity and bravery of the lion of al qaeda hakim would be shamed and hunted to the far corners of the world after tonight no one would believe his lies ahmed showed him how they could access public records to get the information they needed karim was shocked what they could find out with just a name where people lived how much they paid in property taxes when they purchased their home and for how much phone numbers where they went to school it was all there there was no privacy there was even an online encyclopedia that had a brandnew page devoted to mike nash it gave his full bio where he was born his athletic accomplishments when he joined the marine corps when he got married and to whom it listed his four kids by name and age karim was dumbfounded that such things could be so easily unearthed they were able to pull up some clippings from local and school newspapers about the two oldest kids the daughter shannon had been in several plays and was part of a dance troupe that had won a big competition and the older son rory was a football and lacrosse standout they found two of the sons team photos online it was hard to say for sure but from the shot he seemed to look a lot like his father there was one good photo of the daughter that showed her performing during her schools performance of macbeth and then they came across her myspace page and hit the jackpot american teenagers were very busy karim could not believe they would allow their daughter to do so much unsupervised they had even better luck with the wife there were a couple of photos in the paper where she had been standing in the background but online they found more than a dozen shots her companys website offered a full bio and headshot a search of her name pulled up another half dozen society photos from various charities shed been involved in ahmed printed everything they found and put it into a file for karim to read at five oclock karim gave ahmed the first glimpse of what he wanted to do the moroccan didnt ask a single question he knew better part of the plan the last part if it worked perfectly involved something ahmed had already trained for it was a contingency plan that karim had put into place months ago it was not difficult to prepare for not for a trained sniper like ahmed the first part of the plan was an entirely different story though ahmed could tell by the passion in karims voice that he would not be dissuaded he had seen him like this many times before and had seen what happened to anyone foolish enough to ask a question or worse point out a potential flaw all he could do was pay attention nod and remind himself that it was not his place to doubt his commander doubt created hesitation and hesitation gave the enemy the advantage the briefing took nearly an hour maps were checked and rechecked if they made it to the second part of the plan they would use the radios on their phones to communicate they checked their rifles and pistols to make sure they were in optimal working condition and then they composed the brief letter that karim wanted sent to the media it was short karim wanted it that way he would not stoop to the level of the snaketongued american president he composed it with one eye on the american audience and the other on the muslim world it read i am the lion of al qaeda a son of mohammad i do not run i stand and fight i have killed your hero and sacrificed my life for islam knowing that an army of brave muslim warriors will pick up my banner and fight in my place allahu akbar karim eyed the words and knew what they would produce no amount of deceit from hakim could undo this he would be venerated in every muslim home the world over a modernday saladin in death he would finally achieve the greatness he so richly deserved there would never be enough time to fully prepare for this plan karim did not want to wait not even a day someone could return to this house at any moment every law enforcement expert on tv claimed they were on their way to either mexico or canada a few thought that they might have fled farther west but no one thought they had doubled back to washington the element of surprise was on their side and this nash would be so full of himself that he would never see it coming now was the time to strike with everything prepared they took a moment to pray together karim had never felt closer to his creator even in the fading light he could feel the warmth of allah looking down on him he was enveloped in pride and a righteousness of purpose karim knew he would not fail there were three vehicles in the garage in addition to the stolen pickupa brightred ferrari a silver mercedes maybach and a black suburban it was not a difficult choice although karim at one point considered the benefits of the big silver sedan in the end though one vehicle was clearly best suited for the job they loaded their gear into the suburban and then went upstairs to see what clothes they could find karim found a darkgray suit in al saeeds gigantic closet it fit reasonably well although he had to cinch the belt a few notches the black loafers fit nearly perfectly ahmed had a much harder time trying to find something that worked he moved on to the other rooms and eventually found a blue sport coat that was a little short in the sleeves but otherwise fit in the kitchen pantry they found a box of power bars and grabbed some water ahmed climbed behind the wheel and punched the address into the navigation system the computer plotted the course and told them their destination was miles away travel time twentythree minutes karim gave the okay and they pulled out of the garage they waited for a minute to make sure the door closed and then started down the driveway and into the darkening night chapter mclean virginia nash opened the front door and stepped outside he was wearing a white dress shirt and black slacks charlie was on his left hip already bathed and in his pajamas rory was out in the middle of the street with his two friends and jack was playing whiffle ball nash checked his watch the reservations were for eight and they hadnt been easy to get the manager told nash that they were full but he could wait in the bar and see what opened up nash gave him his name to put on the waiting list and the man practically lost it is this the mike nash the one who was given the medal by the president nash reluctantly confirmed that he in fact was that mike nash and then the man went berserk he offered the best table in the house any time he wanted and insisted on paying it was about the only good thing that had come out of his public outing so far maggie came down the stairs in a little black cocktail dress and a wrap she joined her husband and charlie on the front stoop she was all done up for the evening and she looked great you look fabulous honey nash said thanks so do you charlie smiled at his mom nash yelled come on boys everyone inside but dad jack protested we only have one more inning its not even dark yet nash looked to the west i dont see the sun do you its still light out nash handed charlie to his wife why dont you give him to shannon and tell her to put him down ill get these clowns rounded up nash made the exchange with his wife and then marched down the sidewalk jack whacked the yellow plastic bat on the ground not fair dad life isnt fair get your butt inside jack tried to protest again but nash cut him off jack im not going to tell you again i didnt say you couldnt have fun you guys have a pingpong table in the basement hundreds of movies and an xbox get your little butt inside and im not going to tell you again rory stepped forward come on guys well play you in madden nash and all four kids walked in the house when they got to the kitchen jack plopped down in a chair and ran a hand over his freckled face can we at least have a can of pop nash nodded you can each have one can and if you decide to microwave some popcorn hit the popcorn button on the microwave thats all you have to do one of you two keeps burning it and it stinks up the whole house how do you know its not shannon jack asked because shes the only person who picks up after herself around here and ive seen her make popcorn maggie entered the kitchen im ready one last thing boys no one leaves this house no one answers the door when your mom and i leave im going to turn the alarm on if you guys turn it off my phone will beep and i will paddle some major ass do you understand all four boys nodded good nash looked toward the staircase and in a louder voice said shannon were taking off she bounded down the steps a few seconds later and came cruising into the kitchen have a great time she kissed her dad on the cheek no one leaves the house understand yes she said in a dramatic voice i heard you the first four times you two go and have a good time well be fine come on maggie said grabbing his arm the restaurant is only a mile from here nash followed his wife into the mudroom he stopped at his locker and opened his gun safe there were several options for tonight he grabbed the subcompact caliber g and its small leather holster at the back door he armed the security system and then left and locked the door back in the kitchen shannon and her brothers shared a conspiratorial look and then darted to the front of the house they dropped to the floor and crawled into the dining room from the big window they watched their mom and dad back down the driveway and leave none of them moved for close to a minute and then they sprang to life jack announced all right lets go we were up two runs going into the top of the seventh but the security system rorys blond friend asked hes been saying that for years jack scoffed ive already tested it he has no idea if we turn it off or leave it on jack punched in the code at the front door and disarmed the system shannon came back from the kitchen and handed rory the baby monitor here rory took it without protest be careful be careful with what jack asked im just going to drive around the block a few times jack shook his head youre crazy if dad catches you hell kill you jack im only driving around the block its not a big deal they why did you wait for them to leave why did you wait for them to leave jack thought about it for a second as much as he hated to admit it she was right although playing whiffle ball after dark was not a crime youre not a good driver what if you hit something come on jack shes just going around the block stop arguing and lets get out there or we really will be out of light what if he calls shannon held up her cell phone he always calls my cell fine lets go the four boys headed out the front door with the baby monitor and the bat and balls and shannon went out the back door with the keys for the minivan it took her three attempts to get it out of the garage and she only backed over one small shrub on her way down the driveway the boys stopped play to watch her as she inched her way into the street and then put it in drive and moved off at a snails pace at the end of the block she hit her blinker and took a right turn the boys resumed play six pitches and two hits later she appeared at the other end of the block the boys all moved to the side and shook their heads at her as she did another slow passby then they started to play again and forgot all about her chapter fairfax county virginia rapp sat across the table from hakim al harbi and tried to make sense of it all hed seen a lot of strange stuff in the nearly two decades that he had been doing this but this was a first theyd flipped guys before but always after exercising either pressure or incentive they all broke eventually but most of these militant types had to be threatened to within an inch of their lives before they would give any good information there were others not the frontline troops but the support people who helped purchase weapons and other supplies the moneymen and the deal makers who traveled around the middle east raising capital and recruiting new bodies for the cause they could be turned with nothing more than the hint of violence on one hand and the possibility of hard cash on the other if they cooperated that in itself told him that maybe this hakim fellow was nothing more than a logistics guy but then again he had freely admitted to killing american and coalition soldiers in afghanistan on the flight up theyd pulled him out of the bag and given him a drug to counteract the tranquilizer he woke up groggy but in obvious pain and discomfort after a brief inspection they found out that in addition to a bruised and battered face he had at least two broken ribs and one lung on the verge of collapsing wicker was a trained medic he pulled rapp aside and told him to be careful if the other lung collapsed the man could die rapp didnt care so much if the man died he just wanted to get the information out of him first until he was in better condition they would have to hold off on the rough stuff to rapps surprise though al harbi spoke openly and without any preconditions rapp handled the questions while coleman observed and recorded everything that was said by the time they landed back at dulles rapp was convinced that al harbi was either telling the truth or the greatest liar he had ever met in his life on the advice of wicker they pulled the jet into the hangar and closed the doors stuffing him back into the bag was not a good idea when they arrived at the quarry dr lewis was waiting for them he gave al harbi a sedative to help with the pain and started him on some heavyduty antibiotics after that was out of the way lewis hooked him up to a lie detector and led him through a series of questions to establish a baseline rapp stayed in the room and looked for any signs that al harbi was trying to fool the machines he didnt notice any but that didnt mean that he hadnt unbeknownst to rapp coleman had gone into max johnsons cell and asked him about his contacts in the telecommunications industry johnson began babbling through a list of companies and his contacts at each place coleman asked him if he gave him a phone number would he be able to tell him where the phone was located when it made a call johnson explained that he could tell him what tower it used to connect to the network but that was it then he babbled on about some surveillance equipment hed developed that could pinpoint the whereabouts of a phone down to the nearest foot coleman explained that for now he only wanted to verify the location of the one phone call he went on to tell johnson that his cooperation would go a long way toward convincing rapp that he could be trusted johnson eagerly leaped at the chance he told coleman all he needed was a computer with internet access and hed have the info for him in less than five minutes true to his word he had everything verified in only three minutes coleman asked him if he had a back door into customs and johnson said yes he had him check if al harbi had in fact traveled under the alias of michael andros through new orleans and miami on his way to nassau earlier in the day he verified that information as well coleman told reavers to keep an eye on johnson while he went and talked to mitch rapp was in the middle of interrogating al harbi with dr lewis when coleman knocked on the door and asked rapp to step outside rapp closed the door behind him and asked whats up i thought youd want to see this that phone number the one that he says belongs to karim i had it checked out is marcus back rapp asked hopefully no i had johnson do it rapp showed his surprise you gave him access to a computer relax i watched him can i trust the prick he wants to live so i think we can coleman handed over the map hed printed two things the first that phone pinged this tower right here south of branson missouri and it matches the time stamp on the voicemail that was left on hakims phone so at a bare minimum he wasnt lying about where they were correct i also had johnson check the ice database michael andros left new orleans at six this morning and connected through miami on his way to nassau he was traveling alone and his ticket was purchased online what about the other message what other message coleman asked karim left two messages i only heard one check the phone theres another one it starts out very similar to the first he calls him a coward all that bullshit see if johnson can find out what tower he used when he left the second one and what do you wanna do with the fbi it was the milliondollar question and the eighthundredpound gorilla all rolled into one rapp grabbed the back of his neck and squeezed while he tried to sort it out this isnt going to be easy we give them the phone numbers and theyre going to want to know where we got them there are two dead bodies in northern arkansas and from everything hes been telling us coleman pointed toward the cell door this karim whack job probably isnt done killing people we have to share this information the feds are all still up in iowa trying to piece things together and these guys are hundreds of miles away killing grandparents and god only knows who else i know ive already talked to irene and shes trying to figure out a way to source it coleman stepped back and shook his head scott i dont like it any more than you do but come on you got any better ideas i mean were not exactly sitting on it we just found most of this shit out ourselves and if we gave the feds these phone numbers theyd have them pinged in ten minutes bullshit theyd bring in the lawyers ask for a fucking warrant and fill out ten forms in fucking triplicate and then and only then would they ask the phone companies for their records i dont know coleman shook his head listen irenes on her way to the white house right now shell figure it out in the meantime ask our new friend max johnson if he would please hack back into the phone company database and find out where karim was when he left that second message and see if theres any other activity on the phone coleman nodded and headed back down the hallway rapp collected his thoughts and went back into the cell lewis and hakim were talking rapp stood behind his chair and placed his hands on the back they were discussing karims temper rapp was only half listening to what hakim was saying at the moment he was more concerned with how they were going to bring this sordid mess out of the dark covert world and into the transparent world of law enforcement he didnt doubt for a minute that it had to be done it was just a question of how rapp was trying to figure that out when hakim said something that caught his attention what did you just say rapp asked hakim he was very proud of his men the six that were killed in the attack on your terrorism facility no just before that you said something else he was upset with me for doubting his bravery he was very upset with your president for calling his men cowards he said we were going to go to washington and show the world that your president is a liar show washington rapp asked are you sure he said washington yes but im not sure i believe him i mean he might send ahmed that was part of his original plan to turn ahmed loose in downtown washington and let him kill as many people as he could before you managed to stop him ahmed is a trained sniper yes and hes very good i saw him work in afghanistan but he said you were all going to washington yes to martyr ourselves hakim shook his head but i do not think karim will do it he is too vain there was a knock on the door and then it was yanked open this time coleman didnt wait for rapp to come out the second message was left at twelveohfour this afternoon it pinged a tower just off sixtysix and jackson lee shit rapp started pacing his hand was forced they had to bust this thing wide open he grabbed his blackberry from his pocket and was about to call kennedy when he saw nashs name pop up on the caller id rapp thought he might be with kennedy so he answered the call he listened for a few seconds and then said mike slow down are you sure rapp listened for another few beats and as he listened to nash explain himself he felt his stomach begin to twist into knots well be right there dont do anything crazy just wait for us to get there chapter mclean virginia nash came speeding down his street at close to seventy miles an hour he slammed on the brakes and came to a stop directly in front of his house maggie was out the door and up the walk like a shot hed already told her what he wanted her to do and explained it in a voice that made it clear there was no room for debate they werent even halfway through their first glass of wine when he decided to call home and check on the kids he tried the home number first and then shannons mobile number and got nothing his tension began to rise and maggie did her spousal duty and told him to relax five minutes later he got the same result and his blood began to boil maggie tried to reassure him by offering what she thought were plausible explanations he didnt buy any of them and started dialing the phone every sixty seconds until finally on the fifth try jack answered the tenyearolds weak attempt at a cover story crumbled in the face of his fathers anger and he spilled the beans nash threw two twenties on the table and grabbed his wife by the wrist nash offered his apologies to the poor manager who had so proudly set aside his best table maggie mumbled something about one of the kids being sick they ran two red lights and were home in less than two minutes during the brief car ride nash explained that she was to go into the house lock the door turn on the alarm and grab one of his guns from the safe in the mudroom when maggie tried to tell him he was overreacting he ignored her and hoped she was right nash made sure maggie was in the house and then sped off he stopped at the end of the block and looked both ways there was nothing but a few parked cars he wondered which way she would have turned and guessed right he sped off and stopped in the middle of the next intersection he looked left and then right two blocks down he saw the lights of a police cruiser nash spun the wheel and floored it as he drew closer he saw the minivan just beyond the police car parked in the middle of the street the drivers door was open nash threw the car into park and breathed a sigh of relief shed been stopped for driving without an adult in the car his worst fears behind him he got out and approached the police officer who was standing on the boulevard talking with a woman who looked to be in her late forties the other vehicle sped around the van and stopped in front of it blocking the road nash froze he looked past the van there was no other vehicle he turned to look in the back of the police car expecting to see his daughter it was empty nashs heart began to race two men he heard the woman say they were in a big black suburban both of them dressed like those fbi guys in all black they cut her off and then pulled her from the van they threw her in the backseat of the suburban and took off that way toward glebe road nash joined them on the boulevard he checked his emotions and looked at the police officer my name is mike nash i work counterterrorism for the cia that is my van and that was my daughter who was taken i need you to get on your radio and put out an amber alert on that truck and those men and my fifteenyearold daughter her name is shannon nash nash stared at the dumbfounded officer for a few seconds and then said id appreciate it if youd step on it officer before i lose my cool and start screaming the officer nodded i recognize you from your photo yes said nash im going to call the fbi right now please nash said urgently get that amber alert out right now the officer grabbed his shouldermounted radio and called in to his dispatcher nash called art harris from the fbi and filled him in as best he could harris said he would dispatch agents to the scene immediately as well as to the house and that he would make sure that the amber alert was in place he was about to call rapp when his phone rang he looked down and saw shannons face smiling back at him the call was from her nash swallowed hard and answered his phone hello no one spoke for a second and then a man with a slight accent said i have your daughter prove it daddy the voice was cut short is that proof enough nash closed his eyes and told himself to keep it together what do you want i want you all right i will trade your life for hers nash was nodding without knowing it all right where do you want to meet you will know soon enough im right here im standing in the exact spot where you pulled her from the van come back ill put my gun in the middle of the street and well make the exchange there was laughter we will see who is the real coward the world will see who is the real coward in one hour you will know where we will make the exchange how turn on your tv the line went dead nash stared at his phone his hand beginning to shake he was about to call maggie but stopped he had no idea what he would say to her he decided to call rapp instead if anyone could figure a way out of this it would be him chapter washington dc ahmed drove down constitution avenue and took a right onto twentysecond street the service entrance for the building was up ahead on the left halfway down the block it was saturday evening so the only person they expected to deal with was a night watchman karim had the young girl gagged and tied in the backseat ahmed pulled over and got out he walked around the back of the truck and opened the big double doors he grabbed his long black rifle bag and closed the doors karim met him on the sidewalk and held up the phone remember well use the radio feature to communicate ahmed nodded yes and when you see me parked in front and you are ready you will begin calling the tv stations and then you will radio me i have all the numbers programmed good karim held out his arms and embraced ahmed it was the first time he had ever hugged the man i am very proud of you this is what we should have done a week ago i should have never allowed that snake hakim to talk me out of it ahmed nodded even though he wasnt sure he believed him allahu akbar allahu akbar ahmed moved up the walk and found the back door there was a buzzer to the left he pressed it twice and a few seconds later a voice asked him what he wanted fbi he said in near perfect english ill be right there ahmed looked at his pistol and thought about the plan an old man in a security uniform appeared on the other side of the glass door and opened it for him what can i help you with ahmed stayed with the plan even though he wasnt sure his heart was in it we have a possible hostage situation in the park i need to set up a position on your roof so i can observe sure come on in let me show you how to get up there the man led him to an elevator that they took to the top floor from there they made their way down the hall to a back staircase and up another flight they stepped into the dark night and the security guard led the way to the southern edge of the building two hundred yards away the massive columns of the lincoln memorial were bathed in bright light ahmed had to hand it to karim it was quite the setting to send a message he slowly drew his gun while the old man was occupied with the view i like to come up here on breaks sometimes you look around and realize theres a god out there how else could all of this have happened through chaos i dont think so ahmed slowly slid the gun back into the holster karim had ordered him to kill the man but he couldnt do it there was no honor in killing unarmed people he wrapped his big arms around the mans neck and head and pinched off the main artery in the neck he kept the pressure on until he felt the man go limp then he dragged him out of the way and tied him up it took less than a minute back at the buildings edge he rolled out his mat and set up his m sniper rifle he took a quick peek through the scope and acquired the suburban it was parked on the street in front of the lincoln memorial ahmed pulled out the phone and began calling the various tv stations and asking for the news director at each one there were five in all after the last one he pressed the button on the side of the radio and said it is done ahmed turned his attention to the suburban and watched it drive up on the grass and then begin its climb up the steps rifle fire began cracking through the still night ahmed brought his field binoculars up to his eyes and watched the suburban lurch forward beyond the vehicle he saw people crumple to the ground as they were shot by karim he shook his head at the senseless carnage and began to pray chapter lincoln memorial by the time rapp and nash got to the lincoln memorial the park police and the dc metro police had the place cordoned off tv crews were both northeast and southeast of the barricades and the police were trying unsuccessfully to move them back both departments had big firetrucksized command vehicles parked out front rapp displayed his homeland security credentials at the checkpoint and told the officer to allow the next vehicle to follow as well he had nash in the front seat next to him reavers was in the backseat directly behind nash rapp had quietly given the retired seal orders to shadow nash wherever he went dr lewis was in the suburban behind them with some of colemans other men and hakim al harbi lewis had convinced rapp that they should bring hakim along based on the voicemail messages they had reviewed and his cooperation so far lewis felt hakim might be able to offer some insight into karims mind rapp had some other possible uses in mind but so far wasnt willing to share them with the group coleman and wicker were on their way with max johnson and his surveillance van they were going to try to get a fix on the third cell phone that hakim had given to ahmed for now they were assuming that karim was inside the monument with at least one very important hostage rapp parked as close to the command posts as he could get and then jumped out and raced to cut off nash slow down mike rapp said as he grabbed him by the left arm he had barely said a word on the twelveminute drive in from his house for obvious reasons rapp was concerned that he might do something stupid nash turned and took a big swing at rapp his right fist sailing in a wild roundhouse punch rapp ducked just in time and felt the punch brush the top of his head he brought his fists up to block his face and took a quick step back fuck you nash screamed his eyes were filled with tears and his face was flushed with anger this is all your fault if you hadnt fucking outed me none of this would have happened you put me and my family at risk and i will never forgive you so fuck off and get the hell away from me nash turned and stalked off toward the command vehicles rapp had been waiting for it hed been feeling it himself he just hadnt expected it to come this soon he looked at reavers and jerked his head in the direction nash had just gone follow him stay close dr lewis came up hakim was a few steps behind him with a guy on each arm his wrists were bound with flex cuffs but no other restraints lewis looked at rapp and said that was unfortunate but i think understandable considering the circumstances yeah i suppose rapp said he was already trying to figure out a way to make things right he knew what hed do if he had a daughter he started moving toward the command vehicles he tapped his earpiece and said scott give me a sitrep were close just passing watergate should be there in sixty seconds anything so far he has both signals but we wont be able to pinpoint until we get a little closer and stop roger that rapp did a and looked at the terrain my moneys on the north side if hes not in there with him got it rapp looked at hakim and asked whats his endgame im not sure are you holding back on me no i would have never thought hed paint himself into a corner like this rapp looked at all the police the camera crews and the spectators lewis seemed to be reading his mind and said hes created a stage for himself you provoked him lewis said to hakim by telling him you would tell the world that he was a coward hes so narcissistic that his reputation means everything to him he cant bear the thought of people saying those things about him so hes going to make sure no one ever doubts his bravery but he kidnapped a fifteenyearold girl hakim said lewis pointed at nash who was talking to the police thats who hes after you said it yourself that he flew into a rage during the press conference after the medal ceremony he thinks that he will kill an american hero on this grand stage and that he will be revered and celebrated by millions of muslims the world over not if i have anything to say about it rapp turned and walked over to where nash was talking to all the police brass fortunately art harris was approaching the same point from the opposite side of the circle nash was already arguing with the two officers in charge im not going to say it again thats my daughter in there he wants me when he calls im going in and shes coming out its as simple as that harris was wearing his fbi tactical vest he introduced himself to the two onscene commanders and told them that the fbis hostage rescue team was inbound from quantico and no one he said to the group is doing anything until they get here federal property he said as he pointed to the statue of lincoln and they kidnapped her in virginia and brought her into the district its the fbis jurisdiction i dont give a shit whose jurisdiction it is thats my daughter in there when he calls back im going in and i dont want hrt fucking this thing up mike i understand your situation here but youre not in charge fuck you art nash pointed at the building and screamed thats my daughter in there shannon youve known her since she was a little kid what would you do if that was shelly would you trust hrt or would you go in there and trade your life for your daughters rapp heard colemans voice come over his earpiece and stepped away from the group say again max thinks he has a fix on the sniper says hes due north of your position constitution and twentythird rapp stepped out from behind the command vehicle and looked north the buildings roof was in plain view above the trees rapps eyes swept left there was nothing he moved them right along the tree line the buildings on this part of constitution avenue occupied entire city blocks the next block had a peaked roof but the next block after that housed the federal reserve it was a big flatroofed monster slick rapp said using wickers nickname yeah mitch get over to the federal reserve and settle in at the southwest corner of the roof let me know when you have this guy in your sights mitch what do you want me to do coleman asked drop him off and make sure he gets in i dont care if you have to shoot your way in can max jam these signals if i need him to it took a moment while coleman relayed the question he says no problem but he wants to know if you want him to block all signals or just these two for now just these two but let me think about that hurry up and get slick on that roof were already in front of the building and theres a guard out front show him your dhs creds and call me if you have a problem ive got art here as rapp turned to go back to the group he heard some choppers coming in he craned his head skyward as three blackhawks came in and landed a few hundred yards away just south of the reflecting pool thats hrt harris announced as rapp walked up to the group harris gave him a nervous looked and mouthed the words do something nash was now arguing with one of the onsite commanders rapp listened for a good ten seconds and then stepped in he looked at the two onsite commanders and asked does he have any other hostages as rapp finished asking the question wickers voice came over the net telling him he was in the building and on the way to the roof we dont think so but we think he killed at least eight people there are five up there on the steps and three more just inside any idea where he is in there were pretty sure hes around that inside corner on the north side of the building pretty sure three people told us he was on the north side none of the eyewitnesses said he was on the south side who cares nash said impatiently it doesnt matter im going in there rapp placed a hand on his shoulder and said lets talk about this nash knocked his hand away and made a fist get the hell away from me rapp backed up and put his hands up palms out dont you even want to try no if i go in there he lets her go or he blows her head off right in front of you shut up mitch ive spent too many years doing things your way not tonight thats my daughter in there im calling the shots wickers welcome voice came over rapps earpiece got him range yards no wind give me twenty seconds rapp was thinking of wicker when he looked at coleman and said fine but if were going to do this your way youre gonna call maggie first you tell her you love her you tell those boys you love them and then you go in there and make the exchange the words got to nash he slowly started to nod in recognition that it was the right thing to do he pulled out his phone stared blankly at it for a moment and then started to walk away from the group while he dialed the number rapp followed him and when nash put the phone to his ear rapp pulled an epipen from his pocket flicked off the protective cap and jabbed nash in the back of the neck rapp held the pen in place for a second and then dropped it and reached for nashs phone reavers stepped in and caught nash as he collapsed to the pavement art harris pulled up next to rapp with a worried look on his face and asked what in the hell are we going to do now that depends on how much time we have art to reavers he said leave him lets go rapp broke into a sprint for his vehicle slick give me updates if you hear me say bingo you take the shot roger that when they got to the car rapp told reavers to grab his shit out of the backseat rapp popped the trunk and stripped off his suit coat he slid on his bulletproof vest and velcroed the sides before putting on his tactical vest he grabbed his m rifle from its hard case and snatched up a thick silencer reavers trotted behind him with an identical rifle and vest when they got back to the command post harris was waiting for them with his arms across his chest just what in the lords name do you cowboys think youre doing dont start art get out of my way i cant do that this is an fbi op you guys cant operate around here look at all the media rapp stopped and took note of all the cameras good point turning to reavers rapp asked you got a balaclava referring to the black ski masks they sometimes wore on operations reavers produced one from his tactical vest at about the same time rapp did they put them on but left them up on their foreheads like watch caps oh shit harris said with genuine concern you guys cant do this just wait for hrt the phone rapp took from nash started ringing rapp looked down at the smiling photo of shannon he glanced at harris and said no time rapp pressed the answer button and held the phone to his ear hello there was a long pause and then who is this im one of mikes friends where is he karim asked angrily rapp looked around said ahhh he just started vomiting coward karim scoffed i will make sure the media knows that your hero vomited before facing me yeah well not everyone can be a tough guy right who is this rapp looked up and saw lewis and hakim dr lewis im monitoring the situation here mr nash is obviously very traumatized by this rapp tried to think of the words lewis would choose he just got off the phone with his wife and boys he wanted to say goodbye to them he wanted them to have some closure well put him on the phone it is time to make the exchange hold on rapp looked down and hit the mute key he marched straight over to hakim and said are you honestly sick of seeing innocent people killed hakim looked up at the building bathed in lights and said yes rapp thought it through one more time all right then youre going to get your chance to prove it im going to hand you this phone and i want you to bait him like youve never baited him before i want you to work him into an absolute fury hakim nodded i know just what to say mitch lewis said im not sure thats such a good idea no time to argue rapp snapped slick are you good to go affirmative rapp grabbed hakim and dragged him through the police and up the edge of the steps harris followed art rapp said take the phone from him if he tries to warn him harris pulled out his gun rapp looked at the keypad took a deep breath and took it off mute are you still there yes and i must warn you i am not alone if anyone other than mr nash approaches the building i will kill the girl understood rapp handed the phone to hakim and pulled the black mask down over his face karim this is your old friend i see you are still hiding behind the skirts of little girls rapp turned away from hakim and said bingo i repeat bingo rapp took the steps three at a time reavers was right at his side youve got my six we go in on the right side tango is down wickers voice came over the net i repeat tango is down wickers words were welcome but rapp didnt have time to celebrate there was one bad guy down but still one to go they pushed up the last flight of stairs their footfalls nearly silent as they neared the big columns rapp could hear someone shouting from inside the immense space he had a moment of indecision should he stop and assess the situation or rush headlong into it and keep surprise on his side he decided on the latter and already had a picture in his minds eye they reached the threshold and rapp sliced through the farthest opening on the right his left eye was perched behind his eotech holographic sight the red bullseye glowed in the middle of the square aperture the picture rapp had in his minds eye was nothing like the one he was confronted with standing no more than twenty feet in front of him karim had his phone to his ear and was screaming his gun was in his right hand and there was no sign of shannon they made eye contact and rapp saw the gun start to come up he continued to close and did three quick double taps all high center mass all suppressed karim tumbled backward the pistol falling from his hand rapp stopped two feet short and kept the gun trained on karim who was now sprawled out on his back shannon rapp yelled off to his left he saw something in the shadows shift he glanced over and saw shannon tied up with her back to him but moving rapp looked back down at karim who was clutching at his tactical vest there was no sign of blood rapp figured he was wearing a bulletproof vest rapp thought about the president and dickerson and the bullshit show trial that the country would be dragged through he elevated the thick silencer a few degrees and put karims face in the center of the sight he was trying to say something but rapp didnt really care he squeezed the trigger one more time and ended it chapter lake anna virginia the bell helicopter floated down out of the night sky its front spotlight lit up the grassy field north of the house in the shadows just beyond the light stan hurley waited at the edge of the field along with rapp and a slightly groggy mike nash dr lewis was in the house keeping an eye on shannon hed given her a mild sedative and was making sure there wasnt something she was afraid to talk about while her dad was in the room rapp turned his back to the rotor wash while hurley and nash simply closed their eyes and lowered the heads the cia helicopter set down softly on its three wheels and its rotors began to slow the portside door opened and scott coleman jumped to the ground he held jack nash under the arms and pulled him from the chopper and set him on the ground rory followed on his own jumping from the chopper and landing on both feet he and jack saw their dad and broke into a sprint maggie was next charlie was in her arms wrapped in a blanket and somehow still asleep coleman helped her step down and finally kennedy appeared in the doorway she said something to the pilots and then exited the bird rapp and hurley stood by smiling as nash hugged rory and jack maggie joined the group and buried her head in her husbands chest nash wrapped his left arm around his wifes back and placed his right hand on charlies head they stood there for a long moment and said nothing finally maggie wiped tears from her eyes and asked wheres shannon shes in the house with doc nash said shes fine minor concussion and a few scratches but other than that doc says shes in good shape i want to see her maggie turned and saw hurley she stepped toward him and gave him a peck on the cheek thanks for taking care of us stan i had to get out of that house the media had descended on the nash house the normally quiet suburban street looked more like a carnival midway all lit up with news vans reporters and cameramen trying to get a piece of the story when kennedy got wind of it she sent two suburbans and a full security detail to the house to extract the family and bring them back to langley knowing they would want to be together she had the helicopter waiting maggie finally noticed rapp she stepped toward him there was a quizzical look on her face and for a moment rapp thought she might slap him he was prepared to take it he felt like crap for endangering her family maggie reached up and wrapped her arm around rapps neck pulling him in for a big hug thank you irene told me what you did rapp kissed the top of her head im sorry i put your family in danger she shook her head bravely and wiped more tears from her eyes thats nonsense youve given me my husband back that man tried to take him from me and you stopped him but but nothing she said if you hadnt intervened hed be dead right now and probably shannon as well she kissed him again on the cheek and said thank you the family shuffled off toward the house they wanted to be with shannon hurley rapp coleman and kennedy watched them go when they were far enough away kennedy exhaled and said i had a nice talk with her on the ride down shes a pretty strong woman the three men nodded not knowing what to say kennedy glanced back at her helicopter i have to get back to dc the fbi is a little concerned about how this is going to play in the press rapp shrugged his shoulders let em take all the credit nobody needs to know it was us there were a number of witnesses who saw you and mike the rumors are flying fast and furious art harris called and said the fbi press office is swamped with calls from reporters wanting to confirm or deny that the two men involved in the takedown were cia counterterrorism operatives i dont understand the problem rapp said the military does this all the time delta runs an op and they give the credit to the rangers or some other outfit thats a little different kennedy responded they dont have dozens of cameras and live footage of it all they have is footage of two men in black hoods and tactical vests fbi dc park police i dont care who gets the credit i think well be able to work something out you cant do anything about the rumors hurley announced as he lit a cigarette people are going to believe what they want to believe besides its not the worst thing to have floating around out there its a nice message you fuck with us and guys in black masks show up and put a bullet in your head itll make the next guy think twice before he volunteers for one of these oneway trips kennedy thought about it for a moment and said stan you always have an interesting take on things she kissed him on the cheek and said i need to get back thanks for taking care of them she pointed at rapp and coleman be available tomorrow i think some people are going to want to talk to you kennedy headed for the chopper and the pilots started the engines rapp turned back toward the house and said stan i think i need a drink i like the sound of that they started walking back toward the house scott whats your poison just a beer stan mitch whiskey and beer please cigars why not rapp said coleman went with hurley to help and rapp headed down to the fire by the lake there wasnt a cloud in the sky and stars were out rapp looked up found the big dipper and the north star and then orion the hunter coleman and hurley returned and they all grabbed a chair hurley wanted the full debriefing and rapp gave it to him in an emotionless voice hurley only had a few questions most of them to do with max johnson and hakim al harbi coleman argued vehemently that johnson be not only spared but brought on board as a member of the unit rapp and hurley werent so sure about the second part but they were in agreement that hed done enough to earn a stay of execution and more than likely an outright pardon hakim al harbi was more complicated rapp told hurley outright that he had no stomach for killing the guy coleman had no opinion on the matter hurley looked into the fire and took a sip of his drink i need to talk to doc about him we need to find out what makes him tick and we need to catalog his sins figure out just what role he played in all this they heard the screen door slam and a short while later nash came out of the shadows with more beers he passed them around and took a chair hows shannon hurley asked nash stared blankly into the fire im not sure she just fell asleep but i think doc slipped her some pills shell be fine hurley announced nash shook his head who knows i gotta think something like this can really fuck a kid up rapp coleman and hurley all looked at each other hurley spoke for the group kids are resilient were the ones who dont do too well with this shit nash nodded but kept staring into the fire i cant believe i almost lost her and with that he suddenly started bawling he tried to stop it but he couldnt the three men didnt move after a minute of it hurley announced get it all out nows the time he watched him for ten seconds and then said and dont forget it could have been a hell of a lot worse all things considered you were pretty damn lucky nash got control of himself and nodded youre right he finally looked over at rapp who was puffing silently on a cigar im sorry nash said maggies right if it wasnt for you id be dead and shannon might be dead as well well rapp said im just glad we could save her as for your dumb ass im not sure it was worth the effort nash started laughing and then they all started laughing nash lit rapp up with a string of curse words and then said next time you decide to turn me into a poster boy maybe you could check with me youre my boss now i cant take a piss without consulting you first rapp gave nash a sarcastic wink oh god hurley moaned i was his boss once a long time ago worst fucking two years of my life yeah rapp said i saved your ungrateful ass one time too hurley started spewing insults across the fire at rapp the group fell right back into their normal stride it was as if the pressure of the last week was suddenly behind them and everything was back to normal they told stories and insulted each other and they all took it for what it wasa sign of acceptance and camaraderie hurley announced that it was getting late there was one more issue that he wanted to cover thoughglen adams and what they were going to do with him he looked at nash and said mitch tells me youre still not certain about a certain traitorous bastard hurley looked over at his barn just in case there was any question about which traitorous bastard he was referring to nash wavered and then said im not sure i dont think im exactly a paragon of mental stability at the moment well all things considered id like to make the call you want me to pass the buck nash shook his head not very noble mike rapp said you have a great family for their sake and yours i tried to put you on a different path this week the honorable one you cant do both you cant be a great father and husband and do the shit we do something has to give nash stared into the fire and thought about the conflict rapp leaned forward and said let us slosh around in the gutter with these guys you go take care of your family nash didnt say anything for a long while and then he nodded as if hed made up his mind he stood and tossed his empty beer can in the fire he watched it turn red hot and begin to crumble he turned to rapp and said thanks they watched him walk away into the darkness between the fire and the house rapp looked at coleman and hurley a look of disappointment on his face and then he heard nash say im going to go take care of my family good night guys
