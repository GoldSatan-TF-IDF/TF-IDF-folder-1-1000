pitt revealed g p putnams sons publishers since published by the penguin group copyright by sandecker rlllp all rights reserved prologue barbarigo october the indian ocean the light of a halfmoon shimmered off the restless sea like a streak of flaming mercury to lieutenant alberto conti the iridescent waves reminded him of a monet waterscape viewed in a darkened room the silvery froth reflected the moonlight back to the sky illuminating a bank of clouds far to the north the fringe of a storm that was soaking the fertile coast of south africa some fifty miles away tucking his chin from the moist breeze that buffeted him conti turned to face a young seaman standing watch beside him on the conning tower of the italian submarine barbarigo a romantic evening catalano is it not the sailor gave him a quizzical look the weather is quite pleasant sir if thats what you mean though fatigued like the rest of the crew the seaman still held a rigid demeanor in the presence of officers it was a youthful piety conti considered one that would eventually vanish no the moonlight conti said i bet it shines over naples tonight as well glistening off the cobblestone streets it wouldnt surprise me in fact if a handsome officer of the wehrmacht isnt escorting your fiancée on a stroll about piazza del plebiscito at this very moment the young sailor spat over the side then faced the officer with burning eyes my lisetta would sooner jump off the gaiola bridge than associate with any german pig i do not worry for she carries a sap in her pocketbook while im away and she knows how to use it conti let out a deep laugh perhaps if we armed all of our women then neither the germans nor the allied forces would dare set foot in our country having been at sea for weeks and away from his homeland for months more catalano found little humor in the comment he scanned the horizon then nodded toward the dark exposed bow as their submarine sliced through the waves sir why have we been relegated to transport duty for the germans rather than the merchant raiding for which the barbarigo was built were all puppets on the führers string these days im afraid conti replied shaking his head like most of his countrymen he had no idea that forces were at work in rome that would in a matter of days oust mussolini from power and announce an armistice with the allies to think that we had a larger submarine fleet than the germans in yet we now take our operational orders from the kriegsmarine he added the world is not so easily explained at times it doesnt seem right conti gazed across the subs large forward deck i guess the barbarigo is too big and slow for the latest armed convoys so we are now little more than a freighter at least we can say our barbarigo attained a proud wartime record before her conversion launched in the barbarigo had sunk a half dozen allied ships in the atlantic during the early days of the war displacing over a thousand tons she was much larger than the feared type vii uboats of the german wolf pack but as german surface ship losses began to mount admiral dönitz suggested converting several of the large italian sommergibili into transport vessels stripped of her torpedoes deck gun and even one of her heads the barbarigo had been sent to singapore as a cargo vessel filled with mercury steel and mm guns for the japanese our return cargo is deemed highly critical to the war effort so somebody has to act as the mule i suppose conti said but deep down he was angered by the transport duty like every submariner he had something of the hunter in him a longing to stalk the enemy but now an enemy encounter would mean death for the barbarigo stripped of its weaponry and floundering along at twelve knots the submarine was more a sitting duck than a feared attacker as a whitetipped wave splashed against the bow conti glanced at his illuminated wristwatch less than an hour to sunrise heeding the unspoken command catalano hoisted a pair of binoculars and scanned the horizon for other vessels the lieutenant followed suit circling the conning tower with his eyes taking in the sea and sky his thoughts drifted to casoria a small town north of naples where his wife and young son awaited him a vineyard grew behind their modest farmhouse and he suddenly longed for the lazy summer afternoons when he would chase his boy through the sprouting vines then he heard it over the drone of the submarines twin diesel engines he detected a different sound something of a highpitched buzz snapping erect he didnt waste time fixing a position secure the hatch he cried he immediately dropped down the interior ladder the emergency dive alarm rang out an instant later sending the crew scurrying to their stations in the engine room a massive clutch was engaged killing the diesel engines and transferring drive power to a bank of batterypowered electric motors seawater began to slosh across the forward deck as catalano sealed the conning tower hatch then descended to the control room normally a welltrained crew could crashdive a submarine in under a minute but since it was loaded to the gills in transport mode there was little the italian sub could do quickly with agonizing leisure it finally sagged under the surface nearly two minutes after conti had detected the approaching aircraft his boots clanking on the steel ladder as he descended into the control room catalano turned and scurried forward to his emergency dive station the clatter of the diesel engines had fallen quiet as the sub converted to battery propulsion and the crew mirrored the silence by speaking in hushed tones the barbarigos skipper a roundfaced man named de julio stood rubbing sleep from his eyes as he asked conti if theyd been seen i cant say i didnt actually see the aircraft but the moon is bright and the seas are relatively calm i am sure we are visible we will know soon enough the captain stepped to the helm station scanning the depth gauge take us to twenty meters then full right rudder the submarines chief steersman nodded as he repeated the command eyeing the gauges before him as his grip tightened on a large metal steering wheel the control room fell silent as the men awaited their fate a thousand feet above them a lumbering british pby catalina flying boat released two depth charges that whirled toward the sea like a pair of spinning tops the aircraft was not yet equipped with radar it was the raf planes rear gunner who had spotted the milky wake of the barbarigo angling across the rippled surface thrilled with his find he pressed his nose against the acrylic window wideeyed as the twin explosives splashed into the sea seconds later two small geysers of spray shot into the air a bit late i believe the copilot said i suspected as much the pilot a tall londoner who wore a clipped mustache banked the catalina in a tight turn with all the emotion of pouring a cup of tea dropping the charges was something of a guessing game as the submarine had already disappeared from view though its surface wake was still visible and the plane had to strike quickly the airborne depth charges activated at a preset depth of only twentyfive feet given enough time the sub would easily dive beyond their range the pilot lined up for another run tracking a marker buoy they had released ahead of the initial attack eyeing the remnants of the subs fading wake he gauged the vessels unseen path then gunned the pigbellied catalina just past the buoy coming up on her he told the bombardier release if youve got a target the bombardier for the eightman crew sighted the sub and flipped a toggle switch releasing a second pair of depth charges stowed under the catalinas wings depth charges away spoton this time id say flight lieutenant lets try one more for good measure then see if we can raise a surface ship in the vicinity the pilot replied already banking the plane hard over inside the barbarigo the twin blasts shook the bulkheads with a deep shudder the overhead lights flickered and the hull groaned but no rush of water penetrated the interior for a moment the explosions deafening roar seemed to be the worst consequence ringing in each crewmans ears like the bells of st peters basilica but then the ringing was overpowered by a metallic clang that reverberated from the stern followed by a highpitched squeal the captain felt a slight change in the vessels trim fore and aft damage reports he yelled whats our depth twelve meters sir the pilot said no one in the control room spoke a cacophony of hisses and creaks permeated the compartment as the sub dove deeper but it was the sound they didnt hear that prickled their earsthe splash and click of a pair of depth charges detonating alongside the submerged vessel the catalina had dropped wide on its last pass its pilot guessing north while the barbarigo veered south the last muffled explosions barely buffeted the submarine as it plunged beneath the reach of the depth charges a collective sigh was expelled as to a man the crew realized they were safe for the time being their only fear now would be if an allied surface ship could be summoned to renew the attack their relief was cut short by a cry from the steersman captain we seem to be losing speed de julio stepped close and examined a bank of gauges near the pilots seat the electrical motors are operational and engaged the young sailor said wrinkling his brow but i show no revolutions on the driveshaft have sala report to me at once yes sir a sailor near the periscope turned to retrieve the barbarigos chief engineer hed taken only two steps when the engineer appeared in the aft passageway chief engineer eduardo sala moved like a bulldozer his squat frame churning forward in a blunt gait he approached the captain and stared at him with harsh black eyes sala there you are the captain said what is our operational status the hull is secure sir we do have heavy leakage at the main shaft seal which we are attempting to stem i can report one injury engineer parma who fell and broke his wrist during the attack very well but what about the propulsion are the electric motors disabled no sir i disengaged the main drive motors are you crazy sala we were under attack and you disengaged the motors sala looked at the captain with contempt they are irrelevant now he said quietly what are you saying de julio asked wondering why the engineer was evasive its the screw sala said a blade was bent or warped by the depth charge it made contact with the hull and sheared off one of the blades de julio asked no the entire screw the words hung in the air like a death knell absent its single screw propeller the barbarigo would be tossed about the sea like a cork its home port of bordeaux suddenly seemed as far away as the moon what can we do the captain said the gruff engineer shook his head nothing but pray he said softly pray for the mercy of the sea part i poseidons arrow june mojave desert california it was a myth the man decided an old wives tale often he had heard how the deserts broiling daytime temperatures gave way to freezing cold at night but in the high desert of southern california in july he could testify that wasnt the case sweat soaked the underarms of his thin black sweater and pooled in a damp mass around his lower back the temperature was still at least ninety degrees he glanced at his luminescent watch verifying it was indeed two in the morning the heat didnt exactly overwhelm him hed been born in central america and had lived and fought guerrilla campaigns in the regions jungles his entire life but the desert was new to him and he simply hadnt expected the nighttime heat he gazed across the dusty landscape to a conglomeration of glowing streetlamps they marked the entrance to a large openpit mining complex spread across the hills before him eduardo should nearly be in place opposite the guard station he said to a bearded man lying prone in a nearby sandy depression he was similarly clad in black from combat boots to the thin stocking cap pulled low over his head sweat glistened off his face as he sipped from a water bottle i wish he would hurry there are rattlesnakes around here his partner grinned in the dark juan that would be the least of our problems a minute later the handheld radio on his belt chirped with two static transmissions thats him lets move they arose and put on light backpacks lights from the mine buildings were sprinkled across the hillside in front of them casting a pale glow over the barren desert they hiked a short distance to a chainlink fence that encircled the complex the taller man knelt and rummaged through his pack for a pair of wire cutters pablo i think we can get through without cutting his partner whispered then pointed to a dry wash that ran beneath the fence the sandy ground was soft in the middle of the creek bed and he easily pushed some of it aside with his foot pablo joined him in scraping away the loose soil until they had excavated a small hole beneath the fence pushing their packs under it they quickly shimmied through a low blend of rumbling noises filled the air the mechanical bedlam of an openpit mine that operated around the clock the two men stayed clear of the guard station to their right and made their way up a gentle slope toward the mine itself a tenminute hike brought them to a cluster of aged buildings crisscrossed with large conveyor belts a frontend loader at the far end was shoveling piles of ore onto one of the moving belts which transported it to a hopper on stilts the two men were headed to a second cluster of buildings farther up the hill the mine pit blocked their way forcing them to cut through the operations area where ore was crushed and milled clinging to the shadows they darted along the perimeter then worked their way along the back of a large storage building reaching an exposed area between buildings they moved quickly striding past a semiburied bunker to their left suddenly a door flung open at the center of the building ahead of them the two men split up juan ducking to the side and scrambling behind the bunker while pablo sprinted ahead toward the side of the building he didnt make it a bright yellow beam snapped on blinding him hold it right there or youll regret taking that next step said a low gravely voice pablo stopped in midstride but as he made an exaggerated stop he deftly withdrew a mini automatic pistol from his left hip and concealed it in the palm of his gloved hand the overweight security guard walked slowly toward him keeping his flashlight pointed into pablos eyes the guard could see the intruder was a large wellproportioned man over six feet tall his coffeecolored skin was smooth and pliant in contrast to black eyes that burned with malignant intensity a lighter band of flesh crossed his chin and left jaw the souvenir from an ancient knife fight the guard saw enough to know he wasnt an accidental trespasser and stopped a healthy distance away clutching a magnum how about you put your hands on your head and then you can tell me where your friend went the rumble of a nearby conveyor drowned out juans footsteps as he sprinted from the bunker and plunged a knife into the guards kidney shock registered on the guards face momentarily before his whole body tensed a wayward shot erupted from his revolver whistling high over pablos head then the guard fell his body kicking up a swirl of dust as it struck the ground pablo thrust his gun forward expecting additional guards to rush to the scene but none came the gunshot had been lost amid the rumbling of conveyor belts and the pounding of the rockcrusher a quick radio call to eduardo confirmed there was no activity at the front gate no one else in the facility had realized their presence juan wiped his knife clean on the shirt of the dead man how did he spot us pablo glanced toward the bunker for the first time he noticed a redandwhite sign on the door proclaiming danger explosive materials that bunker houses explosives it must be under surveillance blind luck he cursed to himself the explosives bunker wasnt marked on his map now their whole operation was jeopardized should we blow it juan asked they had been ordered to disrupt the facility but to make it look accidental that had suddenly become a tall order the bunker explosives could be made useful but it was too far from their actual target let it be do we leave the guard here juan asked pablo shook his head he unbuckled the guards holster then pulled off the mans shoes he searched the guards pockets and retrieved his wallet and half a pack of cigarettes he stuffed those along with the magnum into his backpack a growing pool of blood was dampening the ground around his feet he kicked some loose sand over the blood then grasped one of the guards arms juan grabbed the other and they dragged the body into the darkness thirty yards away they reached an elevated conveyor on which melonsized chunks of ore whirled by with a labored heave the men swung the guards body onto the moving belt pablo watched as the guard was carried up the conveyor and deposited into a large metal hopper the ore a mixed fluorocarbonate known as bastnasite had already passed through an initial crusher and sorter the guards body joined a second round of pulverization that smashed the ore to baseballsized pieces a tertiary crushing repeated the process pounding the rocks into a fine gravel had anyone examined the rough brown powder that accumulated off the final conveyor they would have noticed an odd red tint that marked the guards last remains though the crushing and milling were important stages in the mines operations they were less critical than the secondary complex up the hill pablo eyed the lights of several buildings in the distance where the milled ore was leached and separated into a handful of mineral components spotting no moving vehicles in the area he and juan took off at a quick clip the men had to skirt the eastern edge of the open pit jumping into a culvert when a dump truck rumbled by a short time later eduardo alerted them that a security guard was making the rounds in a pickup truck they ducked behind a mound of tailings then lay frozen for nearly twenty minutes until the truck returned to the front gate they moved toward the two largest buildings in the upper complex then veered right and approached a small shack that fronted a towering propane tank juan took the wire cutters and snipped an opening in the surrounding chainlink fence pablo slipped through circled the big tank and knelt before its fill valve removing a small plastic explosives charge from his backpack he attached a detonator cap and placed it beneath the valve he set the digital timer for twenty minutes activated it and scurried back through the fence on the ground a few feet away pablo scattered the guards shoes gun and holster the wallet came next still containing its cash then the rumpled pack of cigarettes it was a long shot but a superficial investigation might finger the guard for accidentally igniting a leaky tankthen being vaporized by the blast the two men scurried toward the next building a large metal structure containing dozens of mechanized vats filled with leaching solutions a small group of graveyard shift laborers monitored the vats the two intruders made no attempt to enter the building instead they targeted a large pen storing chemical agents alongside one wall in less than a minute pablo attached a second timed charge to a pallet of drums labeled sulfuric acid then escaped into the darkness they made their way to a second extraction building a hundred yards away taking their time as the timers counted down at the rear of the building pablo found the valve for a main water line monitoring his watch until just before the detonations he twisted the valve shutting off water to the building a few seconds later the propane tank ignited with a boom that reverberated off the nearby hills night turned into day as a fiery blue glow enveloped the landscape the top portion of the tank blew off like an atlas rocket screaming into the sky before crashing into the nearby openpit mine in a ball of flame burning shrapnel flew in all directions peppering buildings cars and equipment within a hundred yards of the tank the debris was still falling when the second detonation launched a mountain of barrels filled with sulfuric acid into the first extraction facility screaming workers fled the interior as the projectiles shredded the oreleaching vats releasing a nasty soup of toxic chemicals smoke billowed as the doors were flung open and the occupants staggered out juan and pablo lay in a ditch near the second building dodging bits of raining debris as they watched a nearby door at the sound of the explosions a few curious workers poked their heads outside to investigate seeing the smoke and flames from the extraction facility they called inside to their coworkers then sprinted to the other building to help pablo counted six people rush out before he rose and moved toward the door stay here and cover me as he reached for the door handle it twisted from the other side he jumped back from the opening door as a woman in a lab coat burst out her eyes focused on the nearby smoke she never noticed him behind the door as she nervously followed after her coworkers pablo slipped through the door stepping into a brightly lit bay filled with dozens more extraction tanks he turned left and moved to the far end of the building where large storage tanks lined the wall he studied their labels then approached one of the larger tanks kerosene he tore away a bleed hose from its base then opened its brass drain valve a torrent of the liquid flooded across the floor and filled the bay with a gassy odor pablo grabbed a bundle of lab coats from a rack and scurried through the building stuffing them into all the floor drains the thin liquid spread quickly nearly covering the concrete floor the arsonist made his way back to the door then pulled a lighter from his pocket as kerosene trickled past his feet he leaned down and ignited it then jumped from the building with a low volatility and high flash point the kerosene didnt explode instead igniting in a river of flame as fire detectors erupted throughout the building ceilingmounted sprinklers kicked onbut only for a second as the disrupted water supply ran dry unabated the fire spread pablo didnt look back as he ran to his partner in the gully juan looked up and shook his head eduardo says the front gate sentry is on his way across the grounds sirens and alarms wailed but no one had yet noticed the swirl of smoke from the roof of the adjacent building at three in the morning no one at the facility was prepared to deal with multiple fires and municipal firefighters were thirty miles away pablo wasted no time watching the incineration he nodded at his partner then sprang off to the east juan had to scramble to catch up they crossed the dirt road that led to the front gate moments before an approaching vehicle drew near the terrain beyond the road turned to open rolling desert and they dove to the ground as the first security vehicle roared by another chainlink fence appeared a short distance away they cut a gap just big enough for one to slip under while the other pulled up the mesh in forty minutes of steady hiking they reached the main highway two miles away draining their supply of bottled water they paralleled the highway east a short distance until spotting a black fourdoor pickup truck parked near a culvert neatly hidden from easy view eduardo the third partner sat behind the wheel in a worn polo shirt smoking a cigarette the two men dropped their packs and pulled off their black hats and sweaters replacing them with tshirts and baseball caps congratulations eduardo said it appears you have succeeded for the first time pablo looked back at the mine facility billowing clouds of smoke hung over the complex illuminated by streaks of orange flame that leaped from several sources the mines firefighting equipment was woefully inadequate to deal with the fires by all appearances the inferno was still spreading pablo allowed himself a half grin except for the appearance of the watchman everything had gone according to plan the two main extraction facilities the heart of the complex would soon be reduced to charred wreckage unable to process ore the entire operation would grind to a standstill for at least a year maybe two and if they were lucky it might all go down as an unfortunate accident juan followed his gaze watching the pyre with satisfaction looks like we set the whole state on fire tonight the distant flames glistened in the big mans eyes as he turned to juan no my friend he said with a wicked grin we have set the whole world on fire sweat trickled down the presidents neck dampening the collar of his starched white shirt the mercury was hovering near triple digits unusual for june in connecticut a slight breeze off block island sound failed to cut the humidity leaving the riverside shipyard a sweltering hothouse inside a massive green assembly bay known as building the airconditioning fought a futile battle with the afternoon heat the electric boat corporation had begun building diesel marine engines on the site along the thames river in but ultimately submarine construction became the companys bread and butter the groton shipyard delivered its first submarine to the navy in and had since constructed every major class of us underwater warship nearing completion inside the green building stood the imposing hull of the north dakota the latest fast attack submarine of the virginia class from a scaffold stairway that led from the north dakotas conning tower the president stepped heavily onto the concrete floor with a grunt a largeframed man who hated confined spaces he was thankful the interior tour was over at least it had been cooler inside the submarine with the economy a mess and congress mired in another deadlock visiting a shipyard seemed like the last priority on his agenda but he had promised the secretary of the navy he would go boost the morale of the ship workers as a small entourage flocked to catch up with him he suppressed his irritation by marveling at the subs dimensions an amazing feat of construction yes sir said a blondhaired man in a tailored suit who hung at the presidents elbow as if attached by a string shes an impressive feat of technology assistant chief of staff tom cerny had specialized in defense issues on capitol hill before joining the administration shes slightly longer than the seawolf class boats but downright minuscule compared to a trident said the tour guide a chipper electric boat engineering manager most people are used to seeing them in the water where twothirds of their bulk is hidden from view the president nodded as it lay on huge supporting blocks the threehundredandseventysevenfootlong hull towered over them shell be a great addition to our arsenal i thank you for giving me the opportunity to see her up close a granitefaced admiral named winters stepped forward mr president while we were happy to have you preview the north dakota she was not the reason we asked you up here the president took off a white hard hat affixed with the presidential seal handed it to the admiral and wiped a bead of sweat from his forehead if a cold drink and a touch more airconditioning can be worked into the bargain then lead on he was escorted across the building to a small door guarded by a uniformed security man the door was unlocked and the presidential group led in one by one their faces captured by a video camera above the sill the admiral flicked on a bank of overhead lights illuminating a narrow bay that stretched nearly four hundred feet the president saw another submarine in a state of near completion but this vessel was like nothing he had ever seen before roughly half the size of the north dakota it sported a radically different design its unusually narrow jetblack hull tapered sharply at the bow a low eggshaped conning tower rose just a few feet above its top deck two large streamlined pods were affixed close to the stern almost in the shape of a dolphins tail but the most unusual feature was a pair of retractable stabilizers shaped like triangular wings that stretched from either side a pack of four large tubular canisters clung to their undersides the design reminded the president of a giant manta ray hed seen while fishing off baja california what on earth is this thing he asked i wasnt aware we were building anything other than the virginia class boats sir this is the sea arrow the admiral said its a prototype platform developed under a secret r d program to test highly advanced technologies cerny turned on the admiral why wasnt the president informed of this program id like to know how it was funded the admiral stared at the aide with the warmth of a starving pit bull the sea arrow was built with defense advanced research projects agency and office of naval research funding the president is presently being informed of its existence the president ignored them and strode along the vessel peering at the odd appendages along the hull he studied a concentric circle of small tubes that sprouted off the bow then made his way aft noting the sub had no propellers he gave winters a questioning look all right admiral you have my curiosity tell me about the sea arrow mr president ill pass that task to joe eberson who heads up the project you met joe earlier hes darpas director of sea platforms technology a bearded man with studious eyes worked his way to the front of the group he spoke in a measured tone with the hint of a tennessee accent sir the sea arrow was or is being built as a multigenerational leap in undersea technology were bypassing the traditional development process by integrating a range of cuttingedge technologies and advanced theories directly into the construction we started with a planned number of technical features that were purely at the conceptual stage through the crash efforts of numerous independent engineering teams around the country im happy to report we are very close to fielding the most advanced attack submarine in history the president nodded so tell me about all these odd appendages she looks like some flying creature from the jurassic age lets start at the stern youll notice she has no propeller eberson pointed at the rounded pods thats what these two external cases are for the sea arrow will be powered by a shaftless propulsion system the north dakota as you saw uses a nuclear reactor to power a traditional steam turbine which in turn drives a shaftmounted screw on the sea arrow weve gone to an external drive system which will be powered directly from the reactor each of these two flared pods will contain a permanent highintensity magnetic motor that drives a pump jet propulsion system eberson smiled aside from drastically reducing noise the design frees up a tremendous amount of interior space which has allowed us to shrink the vessels overall size what are these permanent magnet motors theyre an evolutionary if not revolutionary advance in the electric motor made possible by recent breakthroughs in material sciences a mix of rare mineral elements is synthesized to create extremely powerful magnets which are then wound into highperformance directcurrent motors weve invested a great deal of research in perfecting these motorsand believe they will revolutionize the way our future warships are powered the president peered through a baffle on one of the pods and saw light shine through from above it looks empty inside we havent actually received and installed the motors yet the first is due in next week from the navys research lab in chesapeake maryland you sure theyre going to work while we havent fielded motors of this size we are confident from our lab tests that they will provide the predicted levels of performance the president ducked beneath one of the extended stabilizers then glanced up at a pair of barrelshaped protrusions fore and aft of the conning tower eberson followed in his steps narrating as he walked the wingshaped extensions are retractable stabilizers for highspeed operations they automatically withdraw into the hull when speeds drop below ten knots the tubeshaped box is a torpedo canister capable of holding four fish on each stabilizer the canisters can be reloaded quickly when the stabilizer is retracted into the hull eberson pointed to the two barrelshaped objects above them those are subsurface gatling guns theyre similar to those used on surface ships which shoot depleted uranium pellets at rapid fire for lastditch missile protection ours have been developed to fire underwater using compressed air for lastditch torpedo suppression of course were banking that most enemy torpedoes will never come near us he followed the president as he stepped toward the hull the conning tower youll note is of a slipstream design to accommodate high speed doesnt look like shell allow for much of a periscope the sea arrow doesnt actually have a periscope at least not in the traditional sense eberson said she utilizes an rovtype video camera that is deployed on a tethered fiberoptic cable it can be released from a depth of eight hundred feet to give the crew a highdefinition picture of whats going on on the surface the president continued on to the tapered bow and reached up to stroke one of the small tubes that jutted forward like a thin lance and this thats the key link that will really make her go eberson said its a secondary upgrade we hope to implement based on a technological breakthrough from one of our contractors in california admiral winters cut him off mr president why dont we take a quick tour aboard then we have a short presentation to show you that should answer all your questions very well admiral though im still waiting for my drink the admiral hustled the group through a quick tour of the interior where they found a streamlined interior that contrasted with the north dakota in its sleek modernity and scale of automated systems the commander in chief remained silent as he viewed the hightech command center the small number of plush crews quarters and the odd assortment of padded seats with full safety harnesses that were positioned about the vessel after the tour the president was led to a secure conference room where he was finally given a cold drink his normally jovial demeanor had turned hard echoed by his aide cerny all right gentlemen the president bellowed what exactly is going on here i see much more than some test platform for new technologies thats a seaworthy vessel on the verge of launch sir the admiral said clearing his throat what we possess with the sea arrow is a complete game changer as you know there has been a recent surge in the threat to our naval forces the iranians have acquired a host of new subsea technologies from the russians and are working feverishly to add to their fleet of kilo class subs the russians themselves have dramatically kicked up their shipbuilding efforts with the help of oil revenues to replace their aging fleet and of course we have the chinese while they continue to claim their military expansion is strictly for defensive purposes its no secret that theyve been rapidly expanding their bluewater fleet sources expect their type nuclear sub to go operational any day that all makes for growing threats in the pacific the atlantic and the persian gulf the admiral looked the president in the eye and gave him a grim smile on our side of the ledger we have a continually shrinking fleet as the cost of each new deployed vessel skyrockets at a cost of over two billion dollars each we all know theres just a limited number of virginia class subs that can be squeezed out of an evertightening budget the national debt is still out of control the president said so the navy will have to take its medicine just like everybody else precisely sir which brings us to the sea arrow eliminating the lengthy researchtoproduction cycle and piggybacking on some economies of scale with the virginia program allowed us to construct her at a fraction of the north dakotas cost as you can see she has been built in utmost secrecy we intentionally built her alongside the dakota to divert attention and allow for delivery of components without suspicion we hope to secretly launch her for sea trials when the north dakota is publicly commissioned the president frowned youve done a splendid job of keeping her under wraps so far thank you sir as dr eberson mentioned what we have before you is the most technically advanced submarine ever built the shaftless propulsion drive the external torpedo tubes and the torpedo suppression system are all stateoftheart technologies but theres an additional element to her design that truly sets her apart eberson had already loaded a disk into a projection player on a whiteboard video footage appeared of the open stern of a small boat bobbing about a mountain lake two men lifted a bright yellow torpedoshaped device from the deck and placed it over the side the president could see by its winged appendages that it was a mockup of the sea arrow operated by remote control that is a scale model eberson said she was built to the exact configuration and uses the same type of propulsion system as the model was launched the image switched to an onboard camera view a row of tracking meters superimposed at the bottom of the screen indicated the models speed depth pitch and roll the model submerged a short depth into sage green waters and began accelerating a flurry of lake sediments rushed past the camera as the tiny submersible gained speed suddenly a surge of small bubbles filled the screen obscuring the image the video remained a snowy blur as the model continued to accelerate the presidents mouth dropped as he watched the speed gauge roll into triple digits eventually the model slowed and returned to the surface where it was retrieved before the video clip ended silence filled the room for a moment before the president spoke in a low voice am i to understand that this model attained an underwater speed of one hundred and fifty miles per hour no sir eberson replied with a smile she attained a speed of one hundred and fifty knots which would be on the order of one hundred and seventytwo miles per hour thats impossible ive been told naval propulsion technologies cant get past seventy or eighty knots even the north dakota only manages thirtyfive didnt the russians develop some kind of torpedo that can run over a hundred knots cerny asked yes they have the shkval eberson said which is a highspeed rocketpowered torpedo a similar principle is in play with the sea arrow its not the propulsion that allows the high rate of speed but rather supercavitation forgive my lack of engineering knowhow the president said but doesnt supercavitation have to do with disturbances in the water yes in the case here it involves creating a gas bubble around the object traveling underwater the bubble frees up the waters drag allowing for much higher speeds the array of tubes on the sea arrows prow will be part of the supercavitation system we hope to deploy combined with the highpower magnetic motors we fully expect to match those kinds of speedswithout the range limitations the russians have with their rocket torpedoes perhaps cerny said but theres a substantial difference between a torpedo and a twohundredfoot submarine the differences mostly come in the way of control at high speeds eberson said the sea arrows jurassic wings as the president described them will aid in providing stability the supercavitation system itself will more directly affect control by manipulating the size and shape of the gas bubble its an untested theory on a vessel this size but our supplier of the system is confident in its capability i will actually be monitoring a final sea trial of their model next week the president sat rubbing his chin finally he looked at the admiral with a knowing gaze admiral if she works as advertised what exactly does it mean the sea arrow will put us twenty years ahead of our nearest adversary the chinese russian and iranian buildup will be effectively neutralized well have a weapon at our disposal that is nearly invulnerable and with just a handful of sea arrows well be able to defend every corner of the globe on almost immediate notice what it really means sir is that we wont have to worry about the safety of the seas for the balance of our lifetimes the president nodded the heat and humidity seemed to disappear from the room and for the first time all day he smiled the customary southern californian earlymorning gloom hung over the marina the air damp with a misty drizzle joe eberson hoisted himself from behind the wheel of a rental car and eyed the parking lot then moved to the trunk retrieving a tackle box and fishing rod both had been purchased the night before shortly after his flight from the east coast landed at san diegos lindbergh field flipping on a battered bucket hat he ambled into the sprawling marina at shelter island eberson ignored the buzz of an e hawkeye surveillance plane taking off from the coronado naval air station across the harbor as he made his way past dozens of small sailboats and powerboats the playthings of weekend hobbyists eberson rightly suspected most of these pleasure boats seldom left their slips spotting a fortyfoot cabin cruiser with a large open rear deck he stepped alongside the boat was pushing its fifth decade but its gleaming white hull and polished brightwork revealed an owner who had long provided it loving care a gurgle from the stern indicated the engine was already warming at idle joe there you are said a man who stepped from the cabin we were almost ready to leave without you with his slight build thick glasses and white hair worn in a flattop dr carl heiland looked every bit the electrical engineer his eyes danced and he grinned easily exhibiting a nearconstant state of high energy even at six in the morning short on sleep and exhausted from his crosscountry flight eberson oozed the opposite sentiment he gingerly climbed aboard and shook hands sorry im late doctor eberson said suppressing a yawn i took a wrong turn out of the hotel and didnt realize it until i pulled up to seaworld i think even shamu was still asleep it gave me time to get everything aboard heiland nodded toward a mixed box of crates strapped to the bulwarks here lets stow your tackle next to our gear he reached for ebersons fishing rod then caught a glimpse of his hat he burst out laughing you angling for brook trout today eberson pulled off his hat and examined the worn crown a scattered band of brightly colored freshwater fishing flies encircled it you did say fishing attire i doubt anybody else noticed heiland snorted then called into the cabin manny go ahead and take us out a darkskinned man in cutoffs appeared and untied the deck lines moments later he was behind the wheel piloting the boat into horseshoeshaped san diego harbor they dodged an incoming navy amphibious ship before clearing the channel and entering the pacific manny kicked up the throttle and set a course to the southwest rolling through a light swell stirred by an onshore breeze soon eberson begin to feel queasy and he ducked past manny to grab a seat in the main cabin heiland poured him a mug of coffee and joined him at the galley table so tell me joe how are things back in arlington as you know we just spilled the beans to the president nevertheless were under the usual squeeze of trying to accomplish more with fewer resources well be lucky to avoid a big budget reduction next year im afraid i figured it was only a matter of time before the ax fell in our direction glad ive got five years worth of work under contract you neednt worry carl your firms work is of utmost importance as a matter of fact ive got approval to proceed with the block two retroactive upgradeif you can prove operational ability i assume thats why you called me out here on short notice heiland gave him a cagey look thats some riverboat gambling on your part you havent even fieldtested the block one system yet eberson shook off a bout of nausea to return heilands smile carl we both know its going to work did you source the propulsion components yes though there are some material issues going forward he looked at heiland with an expectant gaze but were more interested in the block two mods weve had some similar materials issues but i think weve made the breakthrough that weve been chasing after eberson smiled broadly thats why i jumped on the first plane from washington i know you like to keep things light and tight given the secure nature of the project i dont like to draw attention to our field tests seemed to work for block one so thats why were just keeping it to a little fishing trip today he looked again at ebersons hat and smiled weve done our best to keep a lid on things at our end of course you havent exactly given us much in the way of specs the fewer eyes around the better eberson took a swallow of coffee then leaned across the table do you think we can really get to the theoretically predicted levels heiland nodded his eyes sparkling well find out shortly a few minutes later manny cut the motor signaling they had arrived at their test site they had crossed into mexican waters almost twenty miles from shore and well off the path of the average san diego day sailor the water was too deep to anchor so the boat drifted while heiland went to work ignoring a long rectangular case strapped to the bulwarks he opened several smaller cases that contained a pair of laptops some cabling and connectors setting the computers on a low bench he knelt and began configuring them manny poked his head out from the wheelhouse doc theres a freighter coming up on us heiland glanced over his shoulder shell be well past us by the time were ready to go he returned his attention to the computers eberson took a seat on the large crate and watched the ship approach a midsized freighter it seemed of recent build by its streamlined design and lack of rust dark gray in color the ship almost had a navy look about it the bridge windows caught ebersons attention tinted black they gave off an odd almost menacing look a few crewmen in coveralls on the main deck worked behind a large container as the ship drew closer he could see they were adjusting a large dishshaped object mounted on a platform amidships the dish was painted a drab green and turned toward the sea rising several feet into the air like a hardened sail the men on deck soon disappeared and eberson noted the ship seemed to be slowing carl im not sure about this ship he rose uncomfortably to his feet weve got nothing for them to see heiland said why dont you pick up a rod and make like youre here to catch a tuna eberson grabbed one of the boats rods from a rack and cast a weighted hook over the side not bothering with any bait lest he actually have to fight a beast from the deep as the freighter pulled alongside a short distance away he tossed a friendly wave toward the blackedout bridge a burning pain shot through his hand quickly tracking down his arm to his torso he dropped his arm and shook it but the sensation was already spreading across his body in seconds it felt like a thousand red ants were biting his flesh the fire shot to his head where his eyes seemed to boil in their sockets carl he cried the words came out in a raspy gurgle heiland felt the same burning sensation on his back spinning around he processed two scenes at once one was the dying joe eberson still clutching the fishing rod as he fell to the deck his skin glowing scarlet the other was the freighters shieldlike device directed at him from a few dozen yards away ignoring the burning that seared through his body he staggered to the cabin manny was already on the deck gasping a last breath as blood dribbled from his nose and ears heiland stepped past his longtime friend as his own pain became amplified his entire body felt inflamed somewhere in his consciousness he wondered why his skin wasnt falling off in chunks a single urge drove him forward as he lurched to the pilots seat his head felt like it was going to explode as he reached under the console his burning fingers grasping a pair of hidden toggles he tripped them both then took his last breath are you going to get wet with me loren smithpitt stared at her husband just seconds ago it seemed he had risen from the pilots seat and tossed an anchor over the side of their rented speedboat yet now he sat on the transom clad in wet suit and dive tank anxious to explore the depths below loren could only marvel at how the sea acted like a magnet to the man drawing him in with an unseen force i think ill stay here and enjoy the sunshine and the clear chilean sky she said with congress back in session on monday i could use a healthy dose of fresh air for capitol hill earplugs might be a better choice loren ignored her husbands quip a congresswoman from colorado loren was only too happy to escape the partisan bickering of washington if only for a few days free from the pressures of work and an intrusive media she felt more relaxed in another country dressed in a skimpy twopiece bathing suit she would never wear at home she flaunted her curvaceous but firm body kept trim through yoga and daily runs on a treadmill stretching across the boats bench seat she hung a leg over the side and dipped her toes in the water yikes that water is cold im going to stay warm and dry up here thank you very much i wont be gone long her husband stuck a regulator between his teeth stared admiringly at his wife for a moment then fell backward into the blue pacific he playfully kicked a spray of water onto his wife with a fin before he disappeared under the surface toweling herself off loren tracked her husbands air bubbles for a few minutes then gazed across the horizon the afternoon air was crystal clear the sapphire sky nearly matching the color of the ocean theyd anchored the red speedboat a half mile off the chilean coast opposite a small beach called playa caleta abarca a towering sheraton hotel stood on a rock cliff nearby its outdoor pool crowded with sunworshiping tourists a short distance to the south lay valparaiso chiles colorful and historic seaport long known by sailors as the jewel of the pacific ancient buildings climbed the steep hills ringing the city reminding loren of san francisco she noted a large white cruise ship the sea splendour anchored in the bay shuttling passengers ashore to visit the beaches of viña del mar or to trek to chiles capital city of santiago sixty miles southeast a gentle swell rocked the speedboat as loren turned her gaze to sea a small yellow sailboat passed by then tacked north toward an approaching freighter its triangular sail fluttering she leaned back on the padded seat closed her eyes and luxuriated in the warmth of the sun sixty feet beneath her dirk pitt had just shaken the oceans chill that permeated the countrys coastal waters due to the humboldt current his breath rate eased as he slowed his descent the visibility was good about forty feet allowing him clear view of a rocky bottom anchored with thick seaweed kicking his fins lazily he glided over a coralstrewn ledge crowded with brightly colored urchins and starfish a small school of jack mackerel eyed him for a minute or two then darted away the sea relaxed pitt in a way nothing else could to some it was confining but pitt found the ocean depths produced in him an odd feeling of release that seemed to heighten his senses it was an experience born decades ago when he spent the better part of his youth exploring the coves along the southern californian coastline free diving and bodysurfing the allure was like that of flying which had led him to the air force academy and flight school as a young officer but the draw of the sea enticed him to leave the flight line and a promising military career to join a newly created federal organization the national underwater and marine agency created to study and protect the worlds oceans numa was the perfect home for pitt allowing him to work on and beneath the sea all over the world after years as its special projects director he now found himself heading the agency which only fortified his sense of stewardship of the worlds oceans loren often joked that she still competed with pitts first love his mistress called the sea pitts quest for underwater discovery along with a love of history had led him to discover dozens of shipwrecks but this afternoon the object of his search was considerably smaller eyeing a thick ridge of jagged rocks that stretched into deeper water he swam over and surveyed its crevices after several minutes he found what he was looking for he plunged an arm between two boulders and pulled out a spirited brown spiny lobster that weighed almost five pounds he eyed its long waving antennas for a moment and then stuffed the crustacean into a mesh dive bag and began a search for its twin above the noisy rhythm of his regulated breathing a faint tapping rippled through the water he held his breath to hear better the metallic rapping repeated a familiar cadencetwo short raps two long raps then two short raps it wasnt exactly the morse code distress call of sos which used three dots and dashes but pitt guessed the intent was the same he could not determine its direction only that the source was nearby it had to be loren he kicked toward the surface angling for the position of the speedboat he spotted the anchor line and approached it swimming hard surfacing a few yards behind the boat loren was leaning over the transom pounding a spare divers lead weight on the stern drive housing engrossed in her signaling she didnt notice him emerge whats wrong he shouted she looked up and pitt saw a desperate fear in her eyes lost for words she simply pointed behind him he spun his head aroundand was engulfed in a massive shadow it was a ship a massive bulk carrier bearing down on them barely a hundred feet away the speedboat bobbed in the direct path of the ships broad high bow which pushed an ominous mountain of white foamy water in front of it pitt cursed the fools on the bridge who were either blind or asleep without hesitation he kicked and stroked furiously to the boat until he could reach an arm over the side should i start the motor lorens face was drawn i was afraid to try while you were underwater pitt saw the anchor line was still set running up into a small locker on the bow behind him he heard the deep rumble of the ships engines as its towering hulk advanced it was too close any slip in cutting the anchor line or a delay in starting the motor and their boat would be smashed to bits with them in it with the regulator back between his teeth he shook his head at loren and waved for her to come closer she hurried to the side and reached to help him aboard instead he reached past her hand and hooked his arm around her waist before she could react she felt herself being jerked over the side she yelped as her body hit the cold water kicking and floundering she gasped for a last breath of air the towering mountain of steel was now just yards away then she was snatched like a rag doll and disappeared beneath the rippling surface the freighter neither slowed nor turned its broad steel hull smacked into the speedboat severing the anchor line before burying the tiny vessel in the bows wake the small boat bounced along the ships hull and then remarkably popped to the surface where it bobbed in the freighters receding wake its port beam only slightly mangled somewhere beneath the surface loren found herself clinging to her husband in a desperate plunge to the seafloor startled by the coldwater immersion she nearly panicked when she felt pitt yank her to the depths without air then she felt him force his regulator into her mouth while wedging her arm around his buoyancy compensator harness despite the cold her nerves began to settle she began to assist their progress by kicking as well remembering to clear her ears as they descended deeper the shimmering light of the surface water grew dark as the black hull passed over them loren glanced up feeling like she could reach out and touch the barnacleencrusted plates only a few feet away though they had escaped the mass of the hull pitt continued driving deeper with frantic kicks of his fins his lungs felt like they would burst which only made him push harder until they finally reached the seabed seeing a bussized rise of coral he pulled loren along its curved side as their knees touched the hard bottom he grabbed a nodule for leverage loren realized her husband had not taken a breath of air for almost the entire descent she quickly passed the regulator to his lips her pulse racing and her eyes wide she peered into pitts face mask he gazed back at her calmly and winked as if cheating death was a daily occurrence pitt gratefully inhaled several deep breaths then passed the regulator back to loren and gazed upward the hull was still sweeping past while the main source of his fear its churning bronze propeller glinted as it drew near pitt threw his arms around loren and gripped the coral mound with his gloved hands as the stern passed overhead even from thirty feet away pitt felt the suction from the enormous blades as they cut through the water sand swirled about them as they were tugged from the bottom then the ship passed and a wash of sediment rained down upon them pitt released his grasp on the coral and kicked to the surface with loren entwined around him their heads popped into the bright sunlight and they eagerly inhaled the warm fresh air i thought for a second loren said between gasps that you were going to kill me before the ship had the chance ducking under seemed the more prudent tack pitt gazed at the stern of the receding freighter noting its name tasmanian star loren pivoted in the opposite direction and scanned the sea as she treaded water beside him they ran right over a sailboat she said scanning the water for survivors it looked like an older couple i could tell we were next in its path quick thinking on your part saved us both though your morse code could use a little improvement pitt joined her in searching the nearby waters but neither spotted any debris we can report it to the police once we get ashore loren said theyll catch up with the crew in valparaiso pitt turned toward the coastline and was surprised to see their red speedboat bobbing a short distance away a section of the port hull hung loose and the boat sat low in the water but it was still afloat pitt stroked over with loren close behind he bellied over the side then pulled her aboard our clothes and lunch are gone she noted shivering as the sun began to dry her body my lobster too pitt said he stripped off his tank and wet suit then stepped to the boats console the key was still in the ignition so he tried pushing the starter the motor ground over several times then sputtered to life as the inboard compartment had remained mostly dry during the boats immersion easing the throttle forward he glanced ahead at the fleeing freighter the tasmanian star was still proceeding on its same heading and apparent speed another mile or two ahead lay the harbor of valparaiso which curved to the west in the shape of an open bowl the commercial port facilities were at the west end yet the freighter was sailing toward the east pitt tensed as he tracked the ships path then jammed the throttle to its stops with its bilge and cockpit filled with water the speedboat faltered as it tried to accelerate but it gradually surged forward gaining speed loren abandoned her efforts to bail water with a seat cushion and approached her husband she saw a heightened intensity in his deep green eyes why arent we headed to shore pitt pointed at the freighter look whats ahead of her loren peered past the bulk carrier the large white cruise ship was still anchored in the harborand lay exactly perpendicular to the oncoming freighter if the tasmanian star didnt change course she would barrel right into the sea splendour dirk theres probably a thousand people aboard that ship if theres something more than just a nearsighted helmsman driving the tasmanian star hundreds could die loren grabbed pitts shoulder as the speedboat lurched over a wave the damaged boat surged and wallowed before finding its legs the bilge pump caught up with the accumulated water allowing the boat to rise higher as it gained speed the damage was all above the waterline so pitt had no trouble controlling the boat as it bulled its way past twenty knots quickly gaining on the freighter can we alert the cruise ship loren yelled to be heard over the straining engine pitt shook his head we have no radio and the ship is anchored theres no way they can move in time at least we could warn the passengers pitt simply nodded that would be a tall order in the scant time available as they drew near the freighters stern he considered his few options there were no other boats nearby so a radio warning was impossible pitts immediate thought was to try to board the moving ship but as he pulled closer he discarded the notion there was no easy access and even if he could somehow find a way aboard he probably wouldnt make it to the bridge in time the sparkling white cruise ship lay dead ahead barely a half mile away pitt held down the button on the speedboats air horn as they ran past the ships port flank and shot past its bow loren jumped and waved at the forecastle but there was no response the tasmanian star neither slowed nor altered course simply plodding ahead on its catastrophic heading pitt glanced at the bridge but could see no moving figures behind the glass windows by all appearances it was a ghost ship out of control pitt urgently scanned the surrounding waters for assistance but there was none to be had a handful of vessels clustered about the commercial port a mile or so southwest but the waters ahead were empty all the way to the curling beachfront empty but for the towering mass of the anchored sea splendour crowding together on its upper deck passengers pointed and waved at the approaching freighter no doubt the helm watch had reported the approaching vessel and the liners captain was furiously hailing the tasmanian star by radio but the rogue vessel responded with silence on the speedboat pitt surveyed the length of the bulk carrier at its stern it rode strangely high in the water a look of determination was etched on his lean rugged face in times of crisis his mind seemed to work in overdrive processing all facets at play before calmly pursuing a course of action with few options pitts response came quickly spinning the wheel hard over he cut across the freighters bow and held the turn until he was running alongside the ships starboard side loren put on my wet suit what are we going to do try and nudge this behemoth out of the way in this little boat thats impossible pitt squinted at the ship in resolve not if we hit her where it counts panic had broken out on the sea splendour as screaming passengers alerted one another of the impending collision parents grabbed their children and ran to the opposite side of the ship while others scrambled up companionways to reach the upper decks even the crew joined the passengers in fleeing the anticipated point of impact by chance or design the tasmanian star was aimed toward the heart of the cruise liner at roughly the same size the bluntnosed freighter churned with sufficient momentum to split the passenger ship in two on the sea splendours bridge captain alphonse franco had few options he desperately tried to finesse the vessel aside but had only auxiliary power available as its main engines sat cold he slipped the anchor line and engaged the ships side thrusters in hope of pivoting the ship clear but staring at the oncoming vessel franco knew it was too late turn away for gods sake turn away he cried under his breath few on the bridge paid attention to him as a flurry of distress calls and emergency procedures occupied the panicked crew the captain stood immobile fixated on the approaching freighter as if he could stare it down his gaze was diverted by a small red speedboat that bounded over the waves toward the stern quarter of the freighter a tall lean man with black hair stood at the wheel beside a woman dressed in an oversized wet suit they were on their own highspeed collision course with the tasmanian star in what only could be viewed as an attempt at suicide insanity franco said shaking his head pure insanity pitt pulled back the throttle for an instant causing the boat to falter then turned to loren jump loren squeezed his arm stepped off the seat and leaped over the side she was still in midair when pitt slammed the throttle forward and the speedboat burst away bobbing to the surface after a hard splash loren watched the boat roar off praying her husband wouldnt kill himself trying to save others pitt knew hed have only one chance to pull off a miracle the freighter was just a quarter of a mile from the sea splendourno room for error taking aim for the freighters stern he braced for impact the tasmanian stars aft deck hung over the water its stern hull curving inward to the waterline that was where pitt aimed the speedboat closing quickly he spotted the rudders upper spindle mountingexposed at the surface he tweaked the steering wheel to adjust his aim inboard of the spindle was the ships churning propeller it could easily devour both him and the speedboat had the carrier been fully loaded his ploy could never have worked but the ship rode high at the stern so he had a chance aiming a few feet left of the spindle he braced himself and drove the boat in at top speed with a hammering bash the speedboats red hull smacked the freighters rudder smashing into the steering plates outer edge the small boats momentum propelled its stern up and out of the water until it was nearly on end pitt flew up out of the cockpit but kept his grip on the wheel as the boat fell back again the craft slammed into the rudder this time from above mangling the spindle and slightly bending the top plate its hull shattered the little red speedboat slid off the rudder and its inboard motor gurgled to a halt the freighters churning wake swept the boat asideand the big ship sailed on pitt grabbed a shin that had split open on the windshield but otherwise he found himself uninjured a moment later loren swam up and pulled herself aboard the slowly sinking boat are you all right she asked that was some collision im fine he tore off his tshirt and wrapped it around his bloodied leg im just not sure if it did any good he watched the imposing shape of the freighter as it churned closer to the cruise ship at first there was no apparent change in its heading but then almost imperceptibly the bow of the tasmanian star began to inch to port when pitt had rammed her rudder mashing it twenty degrees over the ships automatic pilot had attempted to correct course but the secondary impact from the speedboat arrived first mashing the spindle and wedging the rudder in place try as they might the automated bridge controls could not override the damage pitt had knocked the freighter off its course but would it be enough on board the sea splendour captain franco detected the change shes turning francos eyes focused on the narrowing gap shes turning inch by inch foot by foot then yard by yard the freighters bow began to ease toward shore hopeful eyes aboard the sea splendour prayed that the freighter would pass clear but the amount of separation between the ships was just too small there would be no avoiding contact a ships horn bellowed as the crew and passengers braced for impact the tasmanian star sped closer seemingly intent on ramming the liners starboard quarter yet at the last instant the freighters high prow swung clear of a crushing blow easing just beyond the sea splendours stern post twenty feet of the cargo ships bow slipped past before the first grinding squeal of scraping metal the freighter shuddered as it ground against an overhanging section of the sea splendours fantail the massive ship never slowed bulling forward as it was sprayed with shredded steel as suddenly as it struck the carrier pulled clear angling off toward shore still steaming at better than twelve knots the cargo ship now carried a twentyfoot section of the sea splendours afterdeck wedged atop its forward hold the cruise ship had keeled hard to port at impact but slowly righted itself her captain stood in disbelief the reports being radioed to the bridge cited only minor structural damage the fantail had been cleared of passengers and not a single injury was reported by the barest of margins theyd avoided disaster at the realization his ship had survived and no lives were lost the captain let relief turn to anger prepare to lower the officers launch he told a nearby crewman after i survey the damage im going to go deck that clownthe second he steps ashore he had failed to track the tasmanian star assuming it would eventually slow and turn toward valparaisos commercial port but the freighter didnt alter course it sailed on toward a thin sandy beach along the towns waterfront a middleaged canadian couple who had consumed a bit too much local chardonnay at lunch was dozing on the sand when the tasmanian star touched bottom a few yards off the surf line a deep chafing sound like an enormous coffee grinder filled the air as its hull scoured the bottom the prow cut easily through the soft sand before its momentum began to slow the ship burrowed through the beach leveling a small ice cream stand whose owner wisely fled as the ghost ship groaned to a halt nearby onlookers stared in disbelief only the moan of its engines and stillchurning propeller gave sign of any life aboard the stricken vessel hearing the noise and detecting a shadow cross his body the dosing canadian his eyes still closed nudged his wife honey what was that she opened a sleepy eye then sat upright ten feet away rose the towering slab side of the freighters hull they had come that close to being crushed harold she blinked and looked again i think our ship has come in captain francos face was beet red as he surveyed the sea splendours damaged stern from an enclosed launch yet the destruction was much less than he feared the shredded fantail showed primarily cosmetic damage divers would examine below the waterline but by all accounts the crew could handle the damage they would barricade the aft deck and the ship could continue its voyage with only minimal delay franco well knew the wrath hed receive from the corporate offices if the passengers had to be put ashore and their fares refunded thankfully that was one lesser tragedy averted but to him the ship was like a family member and he burned with fury at the disfigurement take us to the freighter he told the launchs young pilot a deck officer motioned for the captains attention sir a small boat appears to be in distress off our starboard beam captain franco leaned out the open entryway there was the red speedboat drifting half submerged the couple was not only still alive but sitting on the bow and waving at him thats the nut who rammed his boat into the carrier he shook his head go ahead go pick them up the launch pulled alongside the sinking boat pitt helped loren onto the launch then jumped aboard he turned and watched the battered speedboat a moment before it slipped under the surface he turned to face the frowning captain i guess im going to have to buy someone a new boat franco took a long look at pitt he wasnt a young foolor a drunk he was tall with a lean muscular body despite the bloody gash to his shin he stood upright with an easy confidence his face was rugged showing years spent outdoors and he grinned in easy bemusement then there were the eyes a beguiling green that burned with intelligence thanks for the rescue pitt said you saved us a healthy swim to shore i watched you destroy your own boat running into the freighter franco said why did you nearly kill yourself to knock the rudder over pitt gazed toward the cruise ships damaged stern guess i didnt get there quite in time the captains face turned white my heavens of course it was you who changed the freighters course at the last second he grasped pitts hand and shook it until pitts arm almost fell off you saved my ship and hundreds of lives we had no time to maneuverwe would have been mauled by that idiot he ran over a sailboat and nearly got us as well madmen they ignored our radio calls and just kept on coming look theyve run aground the bridge crew must be incapacitated pitt said they will be when im through with them the launch picked up speed and raced toward the grounded ship steering well clear of its stillspinning prop a crowd had gathered on the beach to gawk while distant sirens signaled the approach of the valparaiso police the ship sat upright with just a slight list to starboard her decks showed no sign of life a long metal conveyor ramp dangled over the side like a damaged limb nearly reaching the water used to fill and unload the freighters holds the conveyor had been knocked ajar during the collision with the sea splendour franco saw it offered a way aboard and he ordered the launch alongside the ramp just about matched the launchs deck height a seaman was ordered to walk on it to test if it would hold the man took a few tentative steps then turned and gave the captain the thumbsup he scampered up the heavy conveyor belt which tilted across the ships rail and hopped onto the deck captain franco came next nervously climbing on the dustcovered belt and making his way up too absorbed in keeping his footing he failed to notice pitt following a few paces behind franco reached the ships rail and was helped down by the waiting seaman he was startled when pitt jumped off the belt and landed beside him franco turned to admonish him for coming aboard but pitt beat him to the punch we better get those engines shut down pitt nudged past franco and headed toward the bridge franco vented at the seaman search the deck and crews quarters then meet me on the bridge he turned and hurried to catch up with pitt the bridge sat atop a multistory superstructure near the stern stepping aft pitt gazed at the large hatches that covered the ships five main holds the last one was partially open each hatch had two hinged covers that opened to the side hydraulically as pitt approached the hatch just ahead of the superstructure he peered through the gap the cavernous hold was empty except for a tiny bulldozer sitting under a layer of silvercolored dust pitt guessed the forward holds still contained their cargo which would account for the highriding stern noticing fragments of silver rock on the deck he pocketed a large piece in his swim trunks and continued toward the bridge is there no one aboard this vessel franco reached pitt as he started up a companionway i havent seen a welcome committee yet they climbed several flights then entered the bridge through an open wing door like the rest of the ship the expansive control room was empty of life the ghostly sense was broken by the ships radio which squawked with the voice of a chilean coast guard operator hailing the vessel franco shut off the radio then stepped to a center console and powered down the engines pitt examined the helm the autopilot was set on a course of one hundred and fortytwo degrees makes no sense that they would abandon a moving ship piracy is a more likely answer pitt said the number five hold looks like it was emptied after she left port taking the crew for ransom i could see franco said rubbing his chin but robbing a bulk carrier of its cargo at sea thats unheard of the captain noticed a dark splotch on the wall and similar stains on the floorand his face turned pale look at this one glance at the stains told pitt they were dried blood when he rubbed a finger across the wall the dry residue flaked off doesnt look recent can we backtrack the ships navigation system to see where they came from franco stepped to the helm glad to distance himself from the gore he located a navigation monitor which showed a tiny representation of the tasmanian star overlaid on a digital map of valparaiso harbor he tapped on an embedded keyboard and reduced the scale a yellow line traced the ships path off the top of the screen as valparaiso receded into the coastline of chile which gradually receded into the continent of south america the slightly angular line continued north before cutting sharply left off the west coast of central america franco tracked the line across the pacific locating its origin in australia she came from perth then he zeroed back in on the point where the ship changed heading he looked up at pitt and nodded your assumption of piracy makes sense she wouldnt be crossing the pacific with one of her holds empty lets see where that course change occurred pitt said franco adjusted the image looks to be about seventeen hundred miles due west of costa rica a lonely spot in the ocean to stage a holdup franco shook his head if thats where the crew left the ship then the tasmanian star sailed herself over thirtyfive hundred miles to valparaiso which means she was hijacked more than a week ago that leaves a pretty cold trail to follow francos crewman suddenly burst through the bridge wing door his face was flush and he panted from sprinting up the companionway pitt noticed his hand trembled on the doorframe the crew quarters are empty sir there doesnt seem to be anyone aboard he hesitated i did find one man dead the captain asked the sailor nodded i wouldnt have found him but for the odor hes on the main deck near the forward hatch take me to him slowly the seaman turned and led franco and pitt down the companionway they crossed the deck to the port side and marched past the rows of hatch covers the seaman slowed as they approached the forward hatch then stopped and pointed hes beneath one of the supporting braces the man said not moving any closer he must have rolled or fallen there pitt and franco stepped forward then they noticed a blue object wedged in the hatch covers hydraulics next to a supporting brace inching closer they could see it was the body of a man dressed in blue coveralls the odor of decomposing flesh was overpowering but the sight before them was even worse the clothes were unmarked and perfectly clean judging by the heavy work boots and a pair of gloves cinched to his waist pitt guessed he was an ordinary seaman but that was the only thing he could determine the exposed skin had bloated to grotesque proportions and turned the color of french mustard small rivulets of dried blood had pooled around his ears and mouth a swarm of flies buzzed around the seamans face and clustered on his open bulging eyes yet it was the bodys extremities marked beyond mere decomposition that was most grisly the seamans ears nose and fingertips were charred black though the skin remained unbroken pitt recalled photos of polar explorers who had suffered extreme frostbite marked by black blisters covering patches of dead skin yet the tasmanian star had sailed nowhere near any polar region franco slowly backed away from the figure santa maria he gasped hes been taken by the devil himself a scratched and battered crash helmet sat centered on pitts desk when he returned to his office in washington a short typewriten note taped on the visor welcomed him back dad really you need to be more careful pitt chuckled as he slid the helmet aside wondering if it came from his son or his daughter both children worked for numa and had just left for a project off madagascar involving subsea tectonics there was a rap at his office door and in walked a voluptuous woman with perfect hair and makeup although zerri pochinsky was north of forty her looks gave no hint of it pitts trusted secretary for many years she might have become something more in his life if he hadnt met loren first welcome back to the lions den she smiled and placed a cup of coffee on his desk i honestly dont know how that helmet got here pitt returned her smile theres just no sanctity to my inner sanctum i received a call from the vice presidents secretary pochinsky said her hazel eyes turning serious youve been asked to attend a meeting in his office today at twothirty any mention of the topic no they simply indicated it was a security matter what in washington isnt he shook his head with annoyance okay tell them ill be there also hiram is outside he said you wanted to see him send him in pochinsky slipped out the door and was replaced by a bearded man with shoulderlength hair dressed in jeans cowboy boots and a black allman brothers band tshirt hiram yaeger looked like he was headed to a biker bar only the intense blue eyes behind a pair of granny glasses revealed a deeper intellectual pursuit far from a roadhouse barfly yaeger was in fact a computer genius whose greatest love was writing software code managing numas stateoftheart computer resource center he had built a sophisticated network that collected detailed oceanographic data from a thousand points around the globe so the savior of the mighty sea splendour has returned he plopped into a chair opposite pitt you mean to tell me they didnt whisk you off on a free roundtheworld cruise for saving the most expensive ship in their fleet they were more than willing pitt said but lorens on a diet so the ships buffet would have been wasted and my shuffleboard games a bit rusty so there was really no point id be happy to take the trip for you and risk the whole agency falling apart without your presence true i am rather indispensable around here yaeger lofted his nose in the air remind me to mention that at my next performance review done pitt said with a grin so i take it you found something on the tasmanian star the basics she was built in korea in at a length of five hundred and ten feet and a capacity of fiftyfour thousand deadweight tons shes classified as a handymax dry bulk carrier she was fitted with five holds two cranes and a selfdispensing conveyor system which can make for a nice stairwell pitt noted shes owned by a japanese shipping company named sendai and has seen steady service in the pacific primarily as an ore carrier on her last voyage she was under contract with an american petrochemical company she departed perth three and a half weeks ago with a recorded cargo of bauxite bound for los angeles bauxite pitt pulled a small plastic bag from his pocket he retrieved the silver rock he had picked up from the deck of the tasmanian star and laid it on his desk any idea of the value of the bauxite she was carrying i couldnt locate the ships insured value but depending on the grade the stuff sells for around thirty to sixty bucks a ton on the open market doesnt make sense someone would hijack a ship over it personally id go for a freighter full of ipads any theories on where our thieves may have run to not really i took the coordinates you gave me where the ship changed course but i came up dry nro satellite images were a week old thats a dead part of the pacific it doesnt garner much attention from the spies in the sky tapping the national reconnaissance office i hope you didnt leave any footprints an accomplished hacker when circumstances dictated yaeger feigned insult footprints me should anyone even notice the intrusion im afraid the trail leads to my favorite hollywood celebrity gossip website a true shame if the government were to shut that down my sentiments precisely i do have a theory though about the tasmanian stars appearance in valparaiso id love to hear it the ship made an abrupt southerly turn nine days ago some seventeen hundred miles west of costa rica one of our freefloating weather buoys bit the dust in that area of the pacific about the same time turns out a pretty significant tropical storm blew through that area although it petered out by the time it hit mexico we recorded force winds before we lost the buoy so our pirates may have had to abandon their heist in a hurry thats what im thinking maybe thats why they left most of the cargo and left the engine running pitt thought for a moment are there are any islands in the area yaeger pulled out a tablet computer and called up a map of the area where the ships course changed theres a small atoll called clipperton island its only about twenty miles from the position you gave me and deadon along that same heading he looked at pitt and shook his head nice deduction they didnt have time to flood her so they probably set her on a course toward clipperton assuming shed founder on the reef and disappear only the storm blew her clear of the island yaeger said and she kept on sailing for another four thousand miles until arriving in valparaiso pitt took a sip of coffee that still doesnt put us any closer to who attacked the ship and disposed of the crew ive searched for port documents showing recent shipments of bauxite but nothings surfaced and it probably wont hiram see if you can find mention of any other pirate attacksor lost ships for that matterthat have occurred recently in the pacific and one more favor pitt picked up the silver rock and tossed it to yaeger i picked this up on the tasmanian star on your way back to the computer center drop this off with the boys in subsea geology and have them tell us what it is will do yaeger studied the rock as he headed for the door not our bauxite pitt shook his head a pang in my stomach and a large grounded ghost ship says not pitt jogged up the entry steps to the eisenhower executive office building trying to shake his creeping jet lag adjacent to the white house the imposing stone structure was pitts favorite federal building built in in the french second empire style of architecture it featured a steeppitched mansard roof and towering windows making it look like a transplant from a victor hugo story a monument to the use of granite and slate almost no wood had been used in its construction to reduce the risk of fire ironically a fire on the second floor had nearly destroyed vice president cheneys office in recent vice presidents had maintained only a ceremonial office in the building preferring to inhabit the west wing where they could stay glued to the president that all changed with the arrival of admiral james sandecker a reluctant appointee when his predecessor had died in office sandecker preferred to keep his distance from the spinmasters that infiltrated every administration instead he made the vice presidential office in the old executive office building his primary work domain he gladly hiked the underground tunnel to the white house several times a day if need be to the chagrin of his less physically fit aides after passing through several layers of security pitt reached the foyer to the vice presidents suite on the second floor and was escorted into the private office the large room was decorated with the nautical motif befitting a retired admiral showcasing several antique oil paintings of longforgotten clipper ships battling the high seas though right on time pitt walked into a meeting in progress two men and a woman sat in wingback chairs around a coffee table listening to the vice president who paced the lush carpet while clenching a large cigar dirk there you are he zipped across the room to shake pitts hand come take a seat though diminutive in stature sandecker had the energy of ten men a fiery intensity burned in his blue eyes which contrasted with his flaming red hair and matching van dyke beard a washington veteran who despised politics he was both respected and feared for bluntness and integrity for pitt he was something of a father figure having been his boss at numa for many years before becoming vice president good to see you admiral youre looking fit one keeps plenty fit in this office just smacking down the gadflies he said dirk let me introduce you around dan fowler here is with darpa tom cerny is a special aide to the president and ann bennett is from the naval criminal investigative service pitt shook hands then took a seat glancing at his watch youre not late fowler said we just had some earlier business with the vice president fair enough so how may a humble marine engineer be of service youre probably not aware sandecker said but theres been an alarming rash of security breaches in our weapons development programs stretching back at least three years without going into specifics i can tell you theyve been at a high level and are costing us dearly i take it the chinese are the primary beneficiaries yes fowler said how did you know i recall them introducing a new fighter jet last year it looked suspiciously like our f thats only the tip of the iceberg sandecker said unfortunately weve had only limited success at plugging the leaks a multiagency task force has been formed by request of the president to investigate the situation these breaches directly threaten the ability of our military forces cerny said he had a pasty face and large dark eyes and spoke with the fast delivery of a usedcar salesman the president is deeply disturbed by these events and has demanded whatever action is necessary to protect our vital technology pitt fought off the urge to cry hooray for the president cerny he pegged was a typical presidential yesman who relished the power he wielded while accomplishing nothing with it thats well and fine pitt said but isnt half the government already engaged in hunting spies and chasing terrorists theres plenty of risk to go around sandecker lit his cigar as the men engaged puffing it in defiance of the buildings smoking ban the task force has a need for some marine resources just a small project i thought you could assist with agent bennett has the particulars its a missing person actually bennett said pitt locked eyes with the thirtyish agent a pert attractive woman concealed behind a conservative appearance her blond hair layered short matched the serious cut of her charcoal business suit but the effect was softened by her dimpled cheeks and a petite nose that held up a pair of clearframed reading glasses she returned pitts gaze through lively aquacolored eyes then looked down at the folder in her lap an important research scientist with darpa joseph eberson disappeared several days ago in san diego she said he was believed to have gone on a fishing excursion aboard a private pleasure craft named cuttlefish the bodies of the boat owner and his assistant were found a few miles offshore by a passing sailboat local searchandrescue teams combed the area but failed to locate eberson or the boat you suspect foul play we have no specific reason to think so fowler said but eberson was involved with some of the navys most sensitive research programs we need closure on what happened to him we have no reason to suspect that he defected but an abduction has been viewed as a possibility what you really want is a body pitt said unfortunately if the boat sank and he drowned with his buddies his body could be halfway to tahiti by now or inside the stomach of a great white shark thats why wed like you to help us find the boat ann said a hint of pleading in her eyes sounds more like a job for the san diego police department wed like to recover the boat so our investigators can try to determine if eberson was aboard fowler said were told the waters could be rather deep so thats beyond the police departments capability pitt turned to sandecker wheres the navy in all this as it happens the navys west coast salvage fleet is engaged in a training exercise in alaska on top of that the bodies were found in mexican territorial waters things will be a lot less complicated if an oceanographic research ship handled the search and recovery sandecker walked to his desk and peered at a memo it just so happens that the numa survey vessel drake presently is docked in san diego awaiting assignment pitt shook his head ive been done in by my own kind sandeckers eyes twinkled ive still got a few friends over in your building well then pitt said giving ann a sideways glance it would seem that im your man exactly how will you go about the search cerny asked the drake has several different sonar systems aboard as well as a small submersible well set up a survey grid and perform a thorough sweep of the area with sonar to try and locate the cuttlefish once we find her well investigate with scuba divers or send down the submersible depending on the depth if the boats still intact well see about raising her ann will be joining you to observe the operations fowler said we would of course appreciate an urgent resolution to this matter how soon do you think you can get started about as soon as i can find a flight to san diego and agent bennett can rustle up some boat clothes pitt was thanked for undertaking the project and departed the meeting after he left the room sandecker turned to cerny i dont like leaving him in the dark theres not a man alive i trust more presidential orders cerny said its best that nobody knows what weve potentially lost can he do it fowler asked can he find the boat if it sank itll be a piece of cake for pitt sandecker said blowing a thick ring of smoke toward the ceiling what id worry about is what exactly he finds aboard the man strolled across the deck with a pair of scuba tanks under each arm showing all the strain of carrying a feather comforter his arms were almost as thick as his legs while his chest bulged like an overinflated tractor tire al giordinos brown eyes and dark curly hair reflected his italian heritage while his sharp brows and upturned mouth hinted at his devilish wit he broke stride when he spotted pitt and bennett approach and met them at the gangway still clutching the dive tanks greetings kemosabe he said to pitt welcome back to the salt air you have a good flight quite the vice president fixed it so we could hop a navy gulfstream that was flying a couple of admirals to coronado and i always end up on a greyhound bus giordino gazed at bennett and smiled another attempt to add beauty and sophistication to the crew ann bennett this is albert giordino numas director of technologyand occasional leering deckhand miss bennett is with the ncis and is joining us on the search im pleased to meet you mr giordino please call me al he rattled the tanks we can shake hands later i dont think well need those on this hunt pitt said the water will likely be too deep rudi only said that we had an underwater recovery job he didnt say what it was thats because he doesnt know is he aboard yes we all just returned from the funeral this morning buddy martin giordino nodded martin the drakes captain had died unexpectedly from a sudden illness im sorry i couldnt make it in time pitt said buddy was a man of true loyalty and a dear pal hell be sorely missed he bled turquoise giordino said referring to the color all numa craft were painted but now rudi has taken temporary command of the ship a regular captain bligh if you ask me pitt turned to ann i usually try to keep rudi as close to washington as possible in order to safeguard the numa budget youll find him in the lab al said tending to his flock of deepwater fish pitt and ann found a pair of empty cabins and tossed their travel gear in them then went hunting for rudi gunn the search didnt take long for the drake was compact both the newest and smallest in the numa fleet barely over a hundred feet the research ship was designed for inshore survey work but was also more than capable in blue water her cramped deck carried a threeman submersible and an autonomous underwater vehicle any enclosed space not devoted to her small crew was configured as research labs they entered one of the labs and found it nearly pitchblack with the lights off and the windows sealed the only illumination was cast by a few tiny blue bulbs overhead pitt figured the labs airconditioning unit must have been working nonstop as the temperature felt like the low fifties keep the door closed please as their eyes adjusted they spotted the voices owner a thin man in a jacket hunched over a large tank that almost filled the room he wore a set of night vision goggles and was staring intently into the tank spying on the mating habits of the grunion again rudi pitt asked recognizing the voice the man bolted upright and spun to greet the intruders dirk i didnt know it was you gunn tore off the goggles and replaced them with a pair of hornrimmed glasses a brainy exnavy commander gunn served as numas deputy director like his boss he escaped the confines of the washington headquarters at every opportunity pitt introduced gunn to ann why the cold dark room she asked come take a look gunn handed her the night vision goggles he guided her to the edge of the tank where she slipped on the goggles and peered inside a half dozen small fish swam in a lazy circle glowing blue under the augmented light but they were unlike any fish ann had ever seenflat translucent bodies giant protruding eyes and multiple rows of razorsharp teeth jutting from their open mouths she took a quick step back from the tank what are those things theyre hideous rudis pet creatures of the deep pitt said evermannella normalops is their scientific name gunn said but we call them sabertooths theyre an unusual species found only in very deep water we discovered a large school of them thriving around a deepwater thermal vent near monterey and decided to try and capture a few to study took quite a few dives with the submersible but we brought up twenty of them these are the last few we havent moved to shore yet they look like theyd eat you out of house and home despite their appearance we believe they are nonpredatory theyre actually quite docile they dont seem interested in eating other fish so we think they may be scavengers she shook her head im still not going to stick my hand in the tank dont worry pitt said your cabin door has a lock on it in case they grow legs in the night theyre no worse than a pet goldfish gunn said albeit an ugly goldfish that can live a mile deep well leave them in your care pitt said rudi how soon can we shove off gunn tilted his head i think we can make like that pizza delivery outfit thirty minutes or less then lets get under way pitt said im curious to find out where ann is going to take us true to his word gunn had the drake inching away from the dock a half hour later ann joined him on the bridge with pitt and giordino watching the green hills of point loma drift past as they exited the harbor feeling more secure at sea she opened up and explained their objective to gunn and giordino then handed pitt a small piece of paper heres the coordinates where the two bodies were picked up apparently they were within sight of each other that may be a good indication the currents didnt get too daffy with them giordino said pitt typed the coordinates into the drakes navigation system which plotted the position as a triangle on the digital map display it lay just beyond a small rocky island grouping off the mexican coast called the coronados the currents run southerly along the coast pitt said so that would likely define a lower boundary from which to conduct the search the coroners report placed their time of death between eight and ten hours earlier ann said that gives us something to work with pitt drew a box on the map with a cursor well start with a tenmilesquare grid working north of the discovery point and expand beyond that as necessary ann contemplated the size of the drake then asked pitt how are you going to handle the recovery pitt tilted his head at gunn rudi i found a local barge and crane thats waiting on call itll come to the site once we find her i guess i should have asked but how big a boat are we looking for ann glanced at her notes the cuttlefish was registered at forty feet well get her up gunn took over the helm and set the drake on a path to pitts grid two hours later they reached the site where a passing sailboat had found the bodies of heiland and his assistant manny pitt saw the depth was around four hundred feet he decided to conduct the search using the vessels towed array sonar choosing ease of deployment over the deeperdiving auv crewmen at the stern deployed the bright yellow sonar fish which was soon relaying electrical pulses to a processing station on the bridge via its tethered cable pitt took a seat at the controls and adjusted the cable winch until the fish was skimming a few meters above the bottom ann stood glued to pitts shoulder staring at the monitor that displayed a goldtinted image of the sandy undulating seafloor what will the boat look like were running a wide swath so it will appear small in scale but should be readily identifiable he pointed to the screen here you can see what a fiftyfivegallon drum looks like in comparison ann peered at a dimesized object as it scrolled down the screen easily recognizing it as an old barrel someone had dumped in the ocean the clarity is quite remarkable the technologys improved to where you can almost see a carbuncle on a clamshell giordino said the seas were empty save a large powerboat flying a mexican flag a mile or two away its occupants busy fishing gunn piloted the drake in a slow steady pattern running wide survey lanes north and south the sonar registered some tires a pair of playful dolphins and what looked to be a toiletbut no sunken boats after four hours of surveying they drew near the mexican powerboat which held its position with a pair of unmanned fishing rods protruding over its stern looks like well have to skip a lane to get around those guys gunn said pitt looked out the bridge window at the craft a quarter mile ahead then turned back to the monitor he smiled as a triangular object appeared at the top of the screen wont be necessary rudi i think we just found her ann leaned over in puzzlement then saw the shape expand into a boats bow and grow into the full image of a cabin cruiser sitting upright on the seafloor pitt marked the wrecks position and measured its length against a digital scale looks to be right at forty feet id say thats our missing boat gunn looked at the image then slapped pitt on the shoulder nice work dirk ill call the lift barge and get them headed our way ann stared at the image until it scrolled off the bottom of the screen are you sure you can raise it it looks intact gunn said so that should be no problem for the lift barge so were just going to wait here until the barge arrives not exactly pitt said giving ann a sly grin first were going to drag a washington spook to the bottom of the sea the submersible dangled from a suspension crane rotating lazily in the air before gunn lowered it into the cool waters of the pacific he engaged a hydraulic release clamp which allowed the submersible to drift free inside pitt tapped the electric motors powering the sub away from the drake while giordino flooded the ballast tanks from his perch in the copilots seat ann sat behind them in a cramped third seat watching with all the excitement of a small child giordino glanced over his shoulder and noticed her fascination with the green murk beyond the view ports ever been diving before lots ann said but only in a swimming pool i was a platform diver in college the submersible settled into a slow descent beyond the range of the exterior spotlights the sea quickly turned black i was never one to voluntarily throw myself off high objects giordino said howd you go from jumping off diving boards to chasing bad guys i was a marine brat growing up so i joined rotc in college took my commission with the navy at graduation and finagled them into paying for law school i worked at a jag unit in bahrain then spent a few months at guantánamo where i made a number of washington contacts my military marriage failed about that time so i decided to try something different a friend referred me to the ncis two years ago and i landed in their counterintelligence directorate you sound like a regular perry mason used to be in the jags office i enjoyed the investigations but not the prosecutions thats what i like about my current assignment most of my work is strictly investigative which allows me to spend a lot of time in the field i was assigned the eberson case to determine if he or the boat had been a target of espionage well know more shortly pitt said the bottoms coming up giordino neutralized their ballast as a sandy seabed appeared pitt eyed a lobster scurrying across the bottom which reminded him of his lost meal in chile he engaged the thrusters and propelled the submersible forward they traveled only a short distance before a large white object appeared to their left pitt swung the submersible to port and closed on the sunken boat in its underwater world the cuttlefish appeared like a lost alien still pristine and gleaming under the submersibles lights it appeared in stark contrast to the dark lifeless bottom pitt brought the submersible in tight slowly circling the boats perimeter sitting perfectly upright she showed no signs of major damage i think she might be breached underneath pitt said noticing a hairline crack in the hull well see when we raise her giordino replied looks like therell be no problem sliding under a pair of slings fore and aft we should be able to get her up in a jiffy pitt guided the submersible to the cuttlefishs stern then ascended to peer over the side ann gasped wedged against the transom was the body of a man his pale skin was bloated and shredded in spots where sea creatures had fed on the flesh a small school of rockfish floated above his face nibbling at his features joe eberson pitt asked in a low tone ann nodded then averted her eyes pitt took a closer look monofilament line was tangled around ebersons feet and ankles the line had looped around a deck cleat securing the body to the boat when it sank no wounds or burn marks were readily apparent on the darpa scientist but then pitt saw ebersons hands they were bloated to nearly double their normal size the skin discolored with charcoal blotches it was just as pitt had seen in chile like the dead crewman on the tasmanian star joe eberson had died a horrific and unexplained death it took two more dives for the submersible to remove ebersons body a large canvas tarp hastily sewn into an oversized body bag was carried to the sunken boat using a pair of articulated arms that protruded from the base of the submersible pitt slid the bag over ebersons head and torso the monofilament line was cut and the bag brought gently to the surface ann insisted on remaining aboard the submersible during the gruesome business of removing and transporting eberson to the drake once back on deck pitt and giordino set about laying out the slings they would use to raise the cuttlefish soon a decrepitlooking barge with a massive crane arrived at the worksite gunn had found the barge in san diego harbor where it was used to support municipal dredging operations pitt returned the wave of a friendlyfaced man with a gray beard who was steering the powered barge from a small pilothouse ann joined the two men on deck after she and gunn briefly examined the body is that your man giordino asked ann nodded we found a waterlogged wallet in his pocket that confirmed as much well have to leave it to the coroner for a definitive id and cause of death a week underwater wont make that an easy job pitt said at least it appears that his death was accidental perhaps they had trouble with the boat and simply drowned pitt kept silent about ebersons hands as he locked one of the slings into the submersibles steel claws ann observed his work is there much danger of damaging the boat when its lifted we cant really tell the extent of any structural damage so the answer is yes theres a chance she could collapse on usbut i suspect shell pop up without a hitch just in case ann said id like to examine the deck and interior before you make the attempt were about set to make the next dive so hop aboard the cuttlefish came into view a short time later somewhat less menacing without joe ebersons body aboard pitt hovered the submersible just above the rear deck then slowly rotated it to let the exterior floodlights expose the sunken craft stop ann cried pointing out the view port that box there pitt froze the controls allowing them to study an oblong box strapped to the starboard bulwark something of importance pitt asked might be judging by the padlock she was angry with herself for not spotting the box earlier lets take it up it looks pretty secure where it is giordino said she shook her head i dont want to risk damaging it while lifting the boat pitt shrugged suits me but weve got to empty our hands first he rotated the submersibles manipulator arms showing ann the sling they contained he maneuvered away from the boat dropped the sling in the sand and stretched it around the vessels bow he grabbed one end and pulled it under the hull as far as it would go then raised the looped end and deposited it on the cabin roof he then repeated the process with the slings opposite end piloting the submersible above the rear deck he set about extricating the hardened plastic box with some effort he loosened the straps with one of the manipulator claws until the box fell free clutching a handle with one claw he worked the second arm beneath the box as a cradle giordino purged seawater from the ballast tanks and the submersible floated to the surface gunn was waiting for them at the drakes rail and pulled the submersible aboard how goes the initial lasso he asked as they climbed out giordino smiled as easy as roping a baby calf the stern will be a bit harder pitt said well have to dig some to get the sling under her gunn noticed the long box held by the manipulator arms so you brought me a present that would be miss bennetts giordino raised his brows to warn gunn to keep his hands off as giordino removed the box from the steel arms and set it on a protected section of the deck ann followed his every move gunn helped pitt secure the second sling then mounted a thick section of pvc pipe with an attached hose to the forward ballast relief valve howre your battery reserves holding up gunn asked if we can get this second sling on without too much trouble we should have enough juice for one more dive to attach the lift cable ill tell the barge operator to stand by pitt and giordino were lowered into the ocean this time without ann once they reached the seafloor pitt proceeded to the boats stern and set the submersible down adjacent to the port quarter using the manipulator arms he set down the sling and grabbed the pvc pipe which he inserted into the sand along the boats seam ready for suction at your pleasure giordino released a small stream of compressed air from the forward ballast tank which fed through the flexible hose and into the lower third of the pvc pipe air bubbles sailed up the pipe and out the open end expanding as they rose and generating suction at the bottom end of the pipe the soft sand beneath the boat began swirling up the pipe disgorging in a brown cloud behind the submersible that dissipated with the current it took just a few minutes to clear a large enough gap beneath the boats stern quarter to insert the sling giordino killed the air release and they moved to the opposite side of the boat and repeated the process then they pulled the sling under the exposed corners and gathered the free ends above the cabin as pitt held them in place giordino retrieved a heavy d ring and snapped the four ringed ends of both slings into it sweat beaded on his forehead as he worked the manipulator claws to clasp the last ring in place now they just needed to attach a lift cable from the barges crane to the d ring and it could hoist away performed with the delicate hands of a surgeon giordino said securing the manipulator arms pitt glanced at his partners meaty paws and shook his head a surgeon who moonlights as a butcher perhaps nicely done all the same pitt purged the ballast tanks and the submersible began a lazy ascent the sun had just slipped beneath the horizon when they broke the surface off the drakes beam gunn stood by the crane as the sub drew alongside he expertly lowered the jaws and clamped onto the submersibles hoist ring gunn lifted the sub out of the water to deck level then left it dangling come on rudi giordino said bring us on in pitt stared out the view port then stiffened a large man unknown to pitt stood near gunn holding a pistol the man smiled at pitt but there was no warmth in the expression gunn eased his hands off the crane controls then gave pitt a grim shake of his head before stepping away giordino saw gunn abandon the controls and asked whats going on pitt kept his eyes fixed on the gunman aboard the drake i would say that weve been hung out to dry they had attacked the drake under the guise of helplessness the crew on the mexican powerboat floating nearby had surreptitiously monitored the numa vessel all dayuntil they spotted their objective when the sun began to follow the submersible beneath the waves a spanishaccented voice hailed the drake over the marine radio feigning a shortage of fuel taking the call on the bridge gunn told the boat to come alongside if they were able and he would pass across some gasoline the boat made a show of limping over at minimal speed swinging around the back of the barge before inching toward the numa ship while the boat was temporarily out of view a lone gunman leaped aboard the barges stern and sneaked his way to the pilothouse soon a large man stood on the boats afterdeck waving at gunn with a cold smile he wore black slacks and a loose knit black shirt odd attire for a fishing trip the approaching twilight obscured his coffee complexion and flat facial features more typical of central american heritage than mexican the man tossed a line to a waiting deckhand then turned to gunn who leaned over the rail with a fivegallon container of gas thank you señor he said in a baritone voice we stayed too long fishing and feared we would not make it to shore he reached for the can and set it on the deck then moving as quickly as a cat he grabbed the rail and leaped aboard the drake a glock semiautomatic materialized from his back paddle holsterand was leveled at gunns chest the instant his feet touched the deck tell your crewmen to put their hands on the rail and face the sea gunn relayed the order to a pair of shocked crewmen on the deck who nodded they raised their arms then shuffled to the rail two more gunmen climbed aboard and sprinted up to the drakes bridge gunn winced when he heard gunfire but then breathed easier a few moments later when he saw the helm watchman marched down to the deck one gunman had spotted the drakes rigid inflatable lifeboat and casually pumped several rounds into it making the rubber boat sag like a limp balloon when a scientist ducked out of the lab to see what the commotion was about he was grabbed roughly and herded together with the other crewmen gunn looked to the tall man in black what is it you want the man ignored him as a small radio clipped to his waist chirped the barge is secure radioed an unseen voice bring it alongside and join us aboard the research ship the gunman replied well be ready shortly the radio sounded again pablo the submersible has surfaced the man in black cursed as he looked over the side seeing the crown of the submersible pocketing the radio he grabbed gunn by the collar and marched him to the lift crane raise your friends out of the water but dont bring them aboard the ship he stepped back keeping his weapon drawn as gunn reached for the controls he searched for a way to warn pitt the idea was abandoned when he felt the glock pressed against his spine gunn attached the recovery clamp raised the submersible and stood by helplessly as he left it suspended in the air a few seconds later the old barge bumped against the drakes stern a fourth gunman also wearing dark clothes and carrying a pistol raced across the deck and jumped onto the drake he stepped over to pablo breathing heavily his shirt was ripped and a trace of blood trickled from his lower lip what happened to you pablo asked the captain gave me some trouble at first pablo shook his head and frowned get the crate aboard now the new gunman meekly joined the other two in hoisting the box recovered from the cuttlefish and placing it on their boat gunn suddenly thought of ann and realized she wasnt on deck the leader of the assault team turned to gunn waving his glock do not follow us or call for help or we shall return and kill you all pablo smiled at gunn his dark eyes glistening thank you for your assistance he stepped to the rail without looking back and climbed onto his boat pitt and giordino were forced to watch the drama from the confines of the submersible though they could have exited the subs hatch they would have had a precarious leap to get aboard the drake before they could act it was all over watching pablo step over the rail pitt detected a movement at the forward part of the ship he turned to al did you see something go off the side near the bridge no giordino said i was keeping tabs on the guy who pulled the gun on rudi they watched as pablo boarded the powerboat and it pulled away from the drake but as it turned and sped toward shore they caught a glimpse of its opposite deck in the fading light giordino poked a finger at the view port is that what i think it is pitt had seen it too and he nodded it was the outstretched figure of a drenched blond woman hiding on the narrow side deck of the boat as it thundered toward mexico gunn wasted no in time hoisting the submersible aboard as pitt and giordino waited at the open hatch is everyone all right pitt asked no one was hurt gunn replied they threatened to kill us if we call for help or pursue them who were they giordino asked gunn shook his head i have no clue the leader was called pablo they came for that box you guys lifted from the cuttlefish any idea what was in it no pitt said but i think ann does how did she get aboard their boat ann i thought she was in her cabin we saw her hiding beside the wheelhouse of their boat as it stormed away giordino said gunn turned pale they may kill her if they catch her call the coast guard pitt said maybe they have a drug interdiction patrol boat nearby but dont say anything about ann in case theyre listening in al and i will try and track them in the inflatable not going to happen gunn said they shot up the bridge radio and the inflatable weve got some handheld radios i can make the call with but youre out of luck with the rib what about the barge giordino said first we better check out the pilot i think they may have roughed him up rudi you go make the call pitt said al and i will check the barge pitt and giordino ran to the stern rail the bow of the barge was pressing alongside just below the deck the older vessel pushing the research ship at a turtles pace they jumped aboard and sprinted the length of its oily deck to the small wheelhouse at the stern they heard a dog growl as they approached and stepped inside a grayhaired man knelt by the helm holding his palm against a bloody gash along his hairline a blackandtan dachshund stood guard in front of him and barked at the intruders hush mauser the man said are you all right oldtimer pitt helped the man to his feet after easing past the dachshund he nearly matched pitts sixfootthree height but carried a few more pounds that son of a gun walked in out of nowhere and started smashing my radio as the old man spoke clarity returned to his blue eyes i gave him a good lick but he got me with the butt of his pistol giordino found a firstaid kit and applied a bandage to the mans wound thanks son who were those guys anyway i dont know pitt said but one of our people is aboard their boat do you have a launch we can borrow theres a small zodiac out back not much for an engine but help yourself the captain gazed out the windshieldand realized the barge was pushing the drake deuces let me back off your vessel before you boys cut loose he briefly jammed the throttle in reverse then shifted to neutral turning to pitt he raised his brows with worry you watch yourself with them will do pitt nodded at the man then turned to follow giordino out the door as he exited the wheelhouse he noticed the old mans commercial masters license hanging on the bulkhead seeing the name clive cussler printed on the document pitt wrinkled his brow then hurried onto the deck giordino had already unlashed the small inflatable from the wheelhouse rather than take the time to lower it over the side with a winch the two men manhandled it over the rail then climbed aboard pitt primed the outboard motor then gave a few tugs on the starter pulley bringing the engine to life easing the throttle to full he turned away from the barge and headed toward shore the mexican powerboat was still visible in the growing darkness and pitt set an angle of pursuit along its path but they were in a losing race as the cabin cruiser beat the waves a good ten knots faster than the little zodiac all pitt could do was try to keep them in sight long enough to determine where they would put ashore i hope you remembered to bring our passports giordino shouted their southeasterly tack had them on a clear course for the mexican mainland i wish i had remembered to bring an rpg instead giordino had already searched the zodiac their only potential weapon was a small anchor but pitt had no intention of going headtohead with the armed thieves his only concern was for anns safety as the faint shape of the powerboat faded in the distance he thought about the plucky ncis agent and wondered what on earth she actually planned to do lying soaked as she clutched the rail of the cabin cruiser ann was asking herself the same question she wanted to commandeer the boat and sail it to san diego but that was a tall order against four armed men she felt along her back at the waist making sure the holster containing a sig sauer p had survived the plunge into the ocean her decision to sneak aboard the mexican boat had been driven more by adrenaline than strategy she was exiting one of the ships labs while searching for a secure place to store heilands crate when she saw pablo on deck pulling a pistol on gunn she ducked into a companionway slipped down to her cabin and retrieved her own weapon when one of the gunmen drew everyones attention by blasting the drakes inflatable she crept up to the bridgeonly to find the ships radio destroyed while the crew had been startled by the attack she knew why the gunmen had appeared they were after the crate it not ebersons body was the real reason ann was aboard the gunmen acted quickly and offloaded the crate before she could devise a counterattack just one thought ran through her mind if it could not be saved then it must be destroyed with her heart pounding she stepped to the bridge doorway and peeked aft pablo was busy with gunn near the submersible while the other gunmen were securing the crate aboard the powerboat she took a deep breath stepped onto the bridge wing and dove over the side anns years of springboard diving kicked in she stiffened her body as she dove and stretched her hands above her head reaching for the sea she hit the water at a vertical angle the desired rip entry barely producing a splash the cool pacific made her body shudder as she dove deep then turned and swam toward the mexican boat surfacing off its outer beam she moved in close alongside to stay concealed she heard a man jumping aboard then noticed the boat was drifting clear of the drake with a swift kick she reached up the side of the hull and grasped a rail stanchion on the deck then the engines rumbled and the boat lurched forward ann held firm and let the boats momentum drag her across the surface as she swung one leg up and caught her foot on the deck she yanked her torso up and rolled aboard on the narrow deck that ran alongside the enclosed cockpit she lay patiently catching her breath and building her nerve as the boat raced toward shore it would be a halfhour journey with darkness her ally she waited for the sky to turn black salt water sprayed her face and she bounced like a rodeo rider battling to hold her position while praying no one looked her way pablo and his men hung on the stern deck rail for several minutes watching the drake behind them the barge faced them obscuring the launch of the small zodiac from its stern after several minutes the party moved into the cabin pablo made a phone call then sat and drank a bottle of dos equis when a charcoal wash crossed the skies ann crept backward along the rail until she could catch a peek at the open deck a dark heavyset man sat on a side bench cradling a handgun as he gazed off the stern he had a high forehead and a long full beard reminding ann of a young fidel castro secured on the deck in front of him was heilands crate which he used as a footrest though the odds were against her in a gunfight with the full crew this lone man she could subdue especially with the element of surprise on her side her objective was simple just get the crate over the side by any means she could perhaps pitt and the numa ship could find it later at least it would stay out of foreign hands she inched backward along the side rail and dropped quietly to the deck voices came from the main cabin which was several steps below deck and out of clear view just above the cabin was the boats cockpit where ann could see the pilots legs a few feet away with the boat closing in on the coast she could only hope the pilot kept his eyes on course she slipped the compact sig sauer from its holster reversed her grip and sprung at fidel he never heard her coming she aimed for his temple but struck high and the pistol butt skipped over the crown of his head he grunted and fell on his side dropping his handgun to the deck ann kicked it aside and knelt to free the case which had been tied to the bench only stunned by the blow the man cradled his bleeding head with one hand and groped the deck for his gun instead of locating it he found anns ankle he wrapped an angry fist around it and pulled with all the strength he could muster hunched over the crate ann was caught off balance and went sprawling across the deck but her reflexes were quick and she quickly rolled to her feet the gunman still clutched her left ankle so she let go with her right foot landing a vicious blow on the side of his head he grunted and pulled harder so she let fly with another kick connecting with his jaw his fingers finally went limp his eyes glazed over and he sunk to the deck ann scurried back to the crate untying one strap and then the other at last it was free she dragged it to the stern and hoisted one end onto the rail she bent to lift the other end then froze a cold ring of steel touched the back of her neck that will be staying here my dear boomed the deep voice of pablo as he pressed his glock pistol into her flesh twinkling lights blanketed the shore in a glowing wave of amber but the serene image only irritated pitt the full outline of the mexican boat had long since disappeared leaving only its running lights to track its position as the glow from the fast boat shrank in the distance it melded with the shore lights until becoming lost from view pitt held the tiller steady tracking to the boats last visible position while hoping it didnt dramatically alter course he didnt realize that the mexican coast from the border south offered no natural harbor for some thirtyfive miles after running blind for several minutes they approached the shoreline and the bright hillside lights above it around them the seas appeared empty so he angled the zodiac south two minutes later they caught sight of it there giordino shouted pointing off the bow a mile ahead they could just make out a small rock jetty that fingered into the pacific a primitive quay had been constructed over the first fifty feet of rockand here an illuminated boat sat idling as they motored closer pitt and giordino could make out several figures moving along the dock to a waiting fourdoor pickup truck two figures returned to the boat then carried an oblong crate to the truck and dropped it onto the rear bed thats our box giordino said do you see ann no but she might be one of the people in the truck ill try to get us to shore on the other side of the jetty he kept the boat well out to sea as they approached the jetty and backed off the throttle to lessen the motors whine when they had drawn close the mexican boat suddenly burst away from the quay it looped around the end of the jetty coming within a whisker of flattening the unseen zodiac as it sped down the coast rocked hard by the wake the zodiacs lone fuel can tipped over giordino shook the can before setting it upright we dont have the fuel to chase her any distance pitt spotted the trucks taillights illuminating as its engine started then we best get to shore he gunned the throttle ignoring any attempt at stealth while racing the inflatable along the jetty he could see by the lights of some nearby homes and businesses that the jetty extended from a shallow beach he ran the boat through the surf and straight up onto the sand just as the pickup began pulling down the street giordino leaped out of the zodiac and was dragging it past the tide line even before pitt could kill the motor both men sprinted to the dirt road the truck was just a block ahead without a ready alternative they took off after it the truck traveled slowly over the rough road until it came to a paved cross street brightly illuminated and dotted with traffic a string of tiny stores in crumbling stucco buildings ran along it most of them closed for the night but a handful of cantinas and small restaurants kept a steady stream of people flowing along the sidewalks turning left the truck picked up speed briefly then caught up to some slowmoving traffic pitt and giordino reached the intersection a few seconds later im not keen to run a midnight marathon without my glowinthedark racing shorts giordino gasped as they watched the truck accelerate ahead and i forgot my lucky headband pitt said between breaths they searched for something resembling a taxi but saw none then pitt motioned toward the next corner i think i see a loaner a pair of electricians in gray coveralls was busy working on the panel box of a twostory industrial building moonlighting from their day jobs with mexicos national electric company they were also making use of their employers small utility van several yards from the electricians the van was parked at the curb with both its doors flung open and its radio blaring pitt and giordino sprinted straight to the vehicle and leaped into the front seats the keys were dangling from the ignition before the electricians knew what was happening pitt had the engine started and was laying rubber alto alto shouted one of the men as he dropped a screwdriver and gave chase his partner stared for a moment then retrieved his cell phone and made a frantic call pitt caught a break in the traffic and quickly outdistanced the pursuer some tools and wire bounced out the back of the van until pitt stormed over a speed bump and the rear doors slammed shut those boys are going to have some explaining to do in the morning giordino said you dont think their supervisor will believe that their truck was stolen by a pair of mad gringos perhaps but i think we should be a little gentle all the same he said patting the dashboard pitt promptly hit a deep rut jarring both men out of their seats they had lost sight of the fourdoor pickup so pitt drove anything but gently he kept the pedal glued to the floor bursting around several slower cars on the narrow road he braked hard to avoid striking a woman who had darted across the road with a pair of caged chickens then narrowly avoided a pack of stray dogs at the edge of town the avenue meandered up a hill leaving behind both traffic and roadside businessesand also any lighting passing a rusty volkswagen beetle pitt caught sight of the truck a half mile ahead the utility vans small engine howled in protest as he kept the accelerator floored while the small tires lapped up the asphalt the road curved sharply and pitt screeched through the turn spraying a cloud of dust on a blue dodge charger parked on the shoulder the chargers headlights instantly popped on and it eased onto the road you still feeling sorry for those utility men pitt said a wee bit why do you ask i think they went and called the federales on us how do you know pitt glanced in the rearview mirror as flashing lights exploded on the chargers roof because theyre right behind us the chargers roofmounted light bar bathed the parched hillsides in alternating rays of blue and red a short distance ahead the pickup trucks driver clenched the steering wheel when he saw the lights behind him pablo its the police they were waiting at the last bend sitting in the trucks rear seat pablo glanced over his shoulder at the lights then looked at the speedometer you were not speeding no more than a kilometer or two over the limit i swear pablo showed no signs of concern on his bullish face lose them before we get close to the airport he said without emotion if necessary well ditch our weapons and the girl ann tensed wondering if they would kill her first sitting between pablo and the bearded man named juan she didnt know which man to fear more shrinking from pablo she turned toward her other guard with a black eye and dried blood on his cheek juan sat with a pistol against her ribs and a snarl etched on his face anns hands had been bound and a gun held on her after pablo discovered her on the boat fear had gripped her since but now a glimmer of hope surfaced in the form of the mexican police perhaps pitt had somehow informed them she silently prayed that she wouldnt get caught in the cross fire of a shootout the driver accelerated sharply which caused the fourdoor pickup to sway and bounce over the rough road it zipped through several switchbacks before cresting a high coastal ridge once over the summit the road wound down the opposite flank dropping into the broad valley that housed the border town of tijuana a million lights twinkled through the hazy smog suspended over the city that view soon vanished as the pickup raced down the slope and entered the citys outskirts looking back the driver saw he had distanced himself from the police cars flashing lights the truck approached a busy fourlane freeway that looped around the southern end of tijuana pablo noticed the driver begin to turn onto the highway no stay off the highway go through the city it will be easier to lose them the driver nodded and headed into the congested confines of tijuana he glanced into his mirror once more another vehicle was preventing the police car from closing pursuit the intervening vehicle was the utility van pitt was doing everything he could to keep within reach of the pickup despite the police car on his tail he had nearly melted the vans small engine whipping it up the hill at high revolutions to keep pace the more powerful police charger easily caught up to the van then rode its rear bumper with authority pitt created a slight advantage for himself on the downhill run driving the van on the very edge gravel flew as he rocketed through the turns more focused on staying with the pickup than eluding the police car the chargers driver was more cautious allowing pitt to create some separation as they barreled toward the city were going to have to do something about our companion pitt said as they entered the city of nearly two million people giordino glanced at the back of the van which was stockpiled with tools and electrical supplies that had been clanging back and forth ill see if theres a federales removal device in back he carefully climbed out of his seat as they swayed down the road the vans walls were lined with spools of wire and bins full of electrical connectors plus an assortment of tools hardly an arsenal of defense giordino thought then he spotted a short rack of conduit pipe used to protect exposed wiring the thin fourfoot sections of galvanized steel were threaded at each end giordinos brow arched as he found a binful of couplings he called up to pitt i think ive got something a minute later the van sped past the freeway onramp and continued into the city the pickup turned right at a stoplight two blocks ahead and pitt called out to giordino coming up he eased off the accelerator ensuring that the police car hung close behind when they got within a few car lengths of the stoplight pitt yelled now giordino kicked open the rear doors and slid out an eightfoot section of conduit he had coupled together he wedged one end against a chunk of wood braced by the rear wheel wells and secured its lateral movement with pieces of wire he wrapped around the door hinges pitt gave him a second to scramble out of the way and then slammed on the brakes the police officer had already slowed when he spotted the pipe slide out like some kind of medieval jousting lance and braked heavily when the vans rear lights lit up pitt had the advantage with a lighter vehicle and he pressed his case by slamming the van into reverse the instant it lost forward momentum the police car rammed into the vans rear bumper moments after being impaled by giordinos makeshift weapon the conduit pipe rammed through the chargers grille and radiator before striking the engine block and crumpling like an accordion a cloud of steam burst from the engine bay unseen by the policemen inside whose vision was blocked by exploding air bags pitt threw the van into first gear and stepped on the gas a grinding sound erupted from the rear as the van struggled to move forward the bumper finally broke free from the charger and the van lurched ahead giordino looked back to see the pipe jutting from the grille of the police car like the beak of a hummingbird steam billowing behind it giordino made his way back to the front seat now youre really going to cost those utility boys just proves those two gringos really were crazy pitt tightened his grip on the wheel and scoured the road ahead with renewed urgency every cop in tijuana would soon be searching for the battered utility van wheeling around the corner he pressed the accelerator to the floor theyd have to make a play for annand quickly i dont see the police lights anymore the pickups driver flashed pablo a dirty smile years of drug use had left his mouth a cavern of brown gums and decayed teeth i think we lost them do not draw attention to your driving pablo said but get us to the airport without delay the driver checked the route on the trucks navigation screen it angled across the city toward the airport on the northeast side of town glancing constantly in the mirror for police lights he paid little attention to the small utility van that followed a short distance behind as they approached the city center the streets became more congested the pickups driver turned east down a street called plaza el toreo where the dirty sidewalks were swarming with people as he dodged some jaywalkers the pickup hit a large pothole which sent the crate bouncing on the truck bed following close behind pitt and giordino saw the unsecured box move giordino rubbed his chin what do you suppose is in there thats causing all the excitement i wish i knew pitt had to suppress his anger over leading the crew of the drake into a dangerous situation without any advance warning giordino pointed at the truck if you pull alongside the bed i might just be able to grab hold of that thing pitt considered the idea driving a wanted vehicle and with no weapons they had little chance of overpowering the men in the pickup their options were limited if not suicidal maybe we could negotiate a swap for ann he said if they dont kill us outright they had the advantage of being in a crowded city one with a sketchy reputation giordino agreed it was worth the risk pitt kept the van close to the pickups rear bumper waiting for a break in the oncoming traffic so he could pull alongside the vehicles reached a stop sign which pitt eased past without stopping he was chagrined to look up and see a police car passing in the opposite direction he held his gaze ahead as the car passed then tracked it in his mirror the police car rapidly made a threepoint turn on the narrow street nearly flinging a boy off a motorbike i think weve been made pitt said giordino rolled down his window then lets at least get something for our trouble pitt edged closer to the truck as lights erupted behind him the police car tried to fight its way across the intersection but a semitrailer truck had turned in front of it slowly navigating through a tight turn pitt looked ahead waiting for a battered isuzu to pass in the other lane before catching a gap in the oncoming traffic flooring the accelerator he surged into the other lane and pulled alongside the truck giordino leaned out the side window and thrust his arms into the bed grasping for the crate the pickups driver alerted by the police lights in his mirror saw giordino lunge out of the van he immediately tapped his brakes giordino just managed to duck back inside his window to avoid colliding with the trucks cab for an instant the two vehicles traveled alongside almost got it he said to pitt give me one more try giordino sat nearly facetoface with juan who was desperately lowering his window pitt matched the trucks braking then looked ahead and saw a cement mixer rambling down the road directly in front of him make it quick pitt stepped harder on the brakes the pickup accelerated and pitt fought to match it before facing a headon collision as the van again pulled alongside the pickups bed giordino was true to his word hanging half out the window he snared a handle on one end of the box with a hard pull he yanked the box out of the bed letting it dangle alongside the van got it pitt had no room to accelerate past the truck so he braked hard but the truck also slowed keeping him hemmed in the opposite lane with the cement mixer just yards away a narrow side street appeared on his left and pitt stomped on the accelerator and turned the wheel hard over inside the truck juan finally lowered his window he climbed halfway out and aimed a glock at the van he fired a wild volley of shotsuntil the pickup driver shouted look out too late juan turned to see the front fender of the cement mixer a heartbeat before it clipped him just beneath his collar his clothes caught on the fender and he was plucked out of the truck both legs were smashed as he was ripped backward swerving left pitt barely escaped a collision of his own as the van screeched across the cement mixers path just missing its front bumper a spray of bullet holes opened along the side panel and up the passenger door only the last bullet did any damage splintering the crate and nicking giordinos hand nerve reflex caused him to release his grip and the crate plunged to the pavement panicked the cement mixers driver slammed on the brakes briefly clutching the fender juan slid off and under the left front wheel the opposite tire found the dropped crate and the mixer bounced over both the massive vehicle skidded to a halt but only after flattening the remains of juan and the crate under its dual rear wheels stunned by the sight in his rearview mirror the pickups driver lost rein of his own vehicle he drifted right and barreled into a chevy cobalt parked at the curb the fourdoor pickup rode up onto the little cars trunk before grinding to a halt a bang filled the air as the pickups front tire cut into the cars shredded body and burst across the street the utility van went from careening past the cement mixer to nearly rearending an suv the side street was clogged with traffic and pitt locked the brakes to slide to a halt crowds of people filled the sidewalks and street blocking the traffic ahead pitt noticed flashing lights reflecting off the storefront windows the police car was approaching the scene i think pitt said this would be a good time to kiss our utility van goodbye giordino shook his head and i was just getting rather attached to her he found a roll of electrical tape and began wrapping his bleeding hand you okay pitt asked just realizing his friend had been injured i may have to give up twofisted drinking for a spell but ill live they jumped out of the van and blended into the crowd that began to surround the cement mixer ignoring juans flattened body they moved to examine the smashed box there was little to see a mangled assortment of wires circuit boards and metal casings were spread under the truck like a disemboweled robot whatever the box had contained it was well beyond any attempt to resurrect they slid away from the mixer as two police officers approached with their sidearms drawn pitt and giordino worked their way toward the pickup truck using the mass of onlookers to avoid detection the crowds were thicker on the sidewalk so they joined the throng moving alongside the mangled sedan and truck with a sense of dread pitt stepped forward and peered inside the pickup both right doors were flung open but ann and the other occupants were nowhere to be seen pablo had watched the destruction of the crate with disbelief the death of his fellow gunman registered as little more than a nuisance but losing the box made his face turn crimson he vented his rage on ann what do you know of the device he jabbed his pistol against her ann gritted her teeth and said nothing pablo the police are approaching the drivers face was pale and his fingers shook atop the steering wheel pablo glared at ann you will talk later do as i say or i will kill you here now get out of the car ann followed him out the passengerside door as the driver grabbed a light jacket and draped it over her bound hands she glanced back toward the utility van but failed to see pitt or giordino she had been as shocked as pablo to see them appear alongside the truck and she wondered how they had been able to track her as they stepped onto the sidewalk a young man in a black silk shirt accosted the driver thats my car he said pointing to the smashed chevy look what you did pablo stepped over to him and discretely mashed his pistol into the mans stomach be quiet or die he said in a low voice the man stumbled backward nodding profusely his eyes wide he turned and fled down the street pablo stepped back and grabbed ann by the arm then glanced over his shoulder he saw the police officers exit their car and then he studied the crowd he quickly spotted two americans in work clothes looking under the cement mixers right rear wheels he had recognized them when their van had pulled alongside as the men who piloted the drakes submersible he turned and nudged ann forward move what about juan the driver gazed toward the cement mixer with a look of shock pablo said nothing ignoring the body of his dead partner as he guided ann into the center of the busy sidewalk arriving at the pickup a minute later pitt and giordino scanned the crowds for ann a small girl sat on the curb selling freshcut flowers out of a cardboard box she caught pitts eye and held out a clump of daisies pitt paid for the flowers then handed them back to the girl with a smile blushing she sniffed the daisies then raised a hand and pointed down the street pitt winked at the girl and took off in the same direction this way al the crowd grew thicker as they made their way down the block pitt surveyed the moving mass trying to spot anns blond locks they moved with the herd to the end of the street which opened into a large parking lot packed with cars finally pitt and giordino saw where all the people were headed a newly rebuilt stadium towered over the opposite end of the parking lot the structure was perfectly round yet much smaller than a typical american baseball or football stadium streams of people headed into the building following ramps at either end pitt looked up to see the top of the stadium capped in electric lights that read plaza el toreo soccer giordino asked no bullfight darn and i forgot to wear red giordino hadnt noticed that his bloody hand had stained one pant leg crimson they hustled up the nearest ramp jockeying to gain entrance with the other late arrivers the aroma of roasting corn from a vendors stand filled the night air giordino filled his lungs trying to mask the odor of burning trash from a nearby slum that was mixed with the sweat and alcohollaced crowd entering the arena keeping his eyes on the ramp ahead pitt spotted a large man enter the stadium holding a blond woman beside him i think i see her giordino made like a bulldozer pushing his way through the crowd with pitt close behind as they fought their way to the turnstiles pitt asked giordino do you have any money giordino fished through his pockets with his good hand extracting a loose handful of bills the latenight poker games aboard the drake have been kind to me thank goodness theres no talent aboard that ship pitt plucked a twenty and handed it to the attendant they didnt wait for the change bursting through the turnstiles and running up into the stadium trumpets blared from a live band as the evening troupe of matadors and their assistants was introduced the cuadrilla traipsing across the circular dirt arena in a colorful procession a raucous crowd filled the stadium standing and cheering lost in the mass of bodies ann and her abductors were nowhere to be seen they might be making for the exit on the other side pitt said giordino nodded in that case we better split up they descended a stepped aisle to the lower section of the arena where giordino moved right while pitt cut left pitt worked his way across the first section of seats scanning up and down with no success when the fans suddenly cheered he glanced at the ring and saw a lone matador entering for the first fight an ornery halfton bull named donatello was released to join him initially ignoring the matador the beast stood pawing the dirt and absorbing the crowds cheers pitt wormed his way through the next section of spectators dodging vendors selling cotton candy and cold drinks suddenly he caught a glimpse of a woman with blond hair seated by the aisle one section over it was ann the burly figure of pablo was wedged against her busily scanning the crowd he soon noticed pitt and locked eyes on him pablo spoke rapidly to the driver beside him then stood up pulling ann to her feet she looked at pitt for an instant her face a mask of fear and pleading while the driver stood and tracked pitt pablo jerked ann away leading her down the aisle steps to a narrow walkway that circled the ring separated by a full section of cheering fans pitt took off at a run down the nearest steps in the next aisle the driver hustled to match him when pitt reached the low wall that surrounded the bullring he turned and needled his way toward ann and pablo who were fleeing in the other direction just a few yards ahead then the driver leaped off the next set of steps and stood in his path he was an inch or two shorter than pitt but carried broad shoulders on a thick frame as he shook his head for pitt to stop he briefly hitched up his shirt to expose a gun holstered at his waist pitt moved without hesitation lunging forward and throwing a left cross that struck the driver on his cheekbone the driver staggered to the wall giving him no time to recover pitt pressed the barrage with a quick combination to the head the driver instinctively tried to block the blows raising his hands in protection rather than reach for the gun then he regained his senses he charged back at pitt swinging with both fists pitt ducked the first punch but caught a blow to the ribs that made him gasp pitt countered with more blows to the head as the driver hurtled into him knocking them both hard against the safety wall the driver got his left arm hooked around pitt while grabbing for his gun with his right but his feet became entangled with pitts causing both men to lose balance as they fell back as they teetered against the wall the driver pulled the gun free but was forced to catch himself with the same hand as he grasped for the wall pitt swung an elbow into his arm the gun fell free and both men tumbled over the side nearby spectators gasped as the men dropped six feet into the ring at its center a matador stood with his back to them not seeing their intrusion as he flirted with the fresh bull pitt took the brunt of the fall landing hard on his shoulder as the two men struck the dirt together then rolled apart the driver bounced to his feet first and searched the ground for his lost gun as he shuffled toward the wall he bumped into a wooden rack stocked with banderillas long razorsharp darts wrapped in colorful ribbons they were the tools of the banderilleros who assisted the matador they would fling the banderillas into a knotty mass on the bulls back which would agitate the bull and weaken his neck muscles so he would charge with his head lowered pitt was just regaining his feet when the driver grabbed one of the darts and flung it at him the throw was high and pitt easily ducked the projectile he backpedaled along the wall as the driver grabbed three more banderillas pitt spotted a matadors cape hanging on a peg beside him he grabbed it and wadded it into a makeshift shield across the ring a pair of banderilleros on foot noted the scuffle and began to make their way around the perimeter wall the matador was still oblivious his attention focused solely on the bull dangling his cape in an orchestrated movement called a veronica the matador lured the bull to charge the animal brushed by just inches from his body clearing the matadors cape the bull trotted a few pacesthen stopped seeing pitt and the driver moving along the wall some bulls are calm in the ring requiring much prodding and wounding to entice them to charge others are naturally aggressive bolting after anything that moves the rustcolored beast named donatello rated at the top of the belligerence scale yet to be speared by the banderilleros he was an ornery bull at full strength he trotted closer to the new targets carefully eyeing the two men pitt saw the bull draw near but was more concerned with fending off his attackers banderillas facing pitt the driver didnt see the bull the driver stepped forward and began to release his barrage on pitt heaving the darts like a lancer pitt kept his eyes focused on the projectiles still stepping backward he batted the first dart away with the wadded cape the second throw went a centimeter wide when pitt jumped to one side the driver yanked back his arm with the last banderilla then took a step closer for a better aim as he flung the dart the bull charged the throw was perfect the razor tip shot straight at pittand would have struck him in the chest if he hadnt blocked it with the cape the dart tore through the fabric losing just enough of its momentum before slicing pitts hand as if touching a scalding pot pitt hurled the balled cape and embedded spear back at the driver then dove to the ground any uncertainty over which figure to target vanished from the galloping bull the brute animal followed the airborne cape to the driver who reached out and grabbed the bundle the bull lowered his head and accelerated the driver was confused by pitts sudden dive to the ground and then he detected movement behind him he turned seeing the charging bull just a few feet away and froze donatello barreled straight into the man the crowd screamed as the bulls horns punctured the drivers stomach nearly breaking through to his back tossing his head the bull lifted the impaled man into the air and paraded him for several feet before dumping the limp bloodied body onto the dirt pitt heard a delayed solitary scream from the crowd and looked behind him a short distance across the ring ann tussled with pablo in a quick motion the big gunman scooped ann off her feet and tossed her into the ring her hands still bound she landed awkwardly and fell to the ground she struggled to get up then felt a burning pain in her ankle she could stand on only one foot frenzied by his fresh kill the bull studied ann for a moment and snorted lowering his head he angled toward the woman and charged the two banderilleros and the matador sprinted across the ring yelling but the bull ignored them they were too distant to attract the bulls wrath but pitt wasnt he jumped to his feet ran and scooped up the shredded cape then bolted for the bull charging hard the animal was less than twenty feet from ann she tried shuffling to the wall but could barely move from the pain in her ankle her heart pounded as she faced the charging animal then froze like the driver had her frightened trance was broken by a sudden shout toro toro she turned to see pitt rushing toward her wildly waving the shredded cape the bull took one look at the tall bounding man with the bright magenta capeand bit ann felt the heat from the beasts breath as it veered away from her at the last second and chased after pitt he skidded in the dirt as the bull overtook him extending the cape to his side he shook the material like a dusty rug drawing the bulls eye donatello followed the movement he burst into and through the cape his sharp horns skimming just millimeters past pitts body pitt yanked the cape upward as the bull tore through then spun to face the animal he was too engrossed in selfpreservation to hear the applause and chants of olé that poured from the crowd he shook the cape then stepped aside as the bull charged once more allow me señor the matador said rushing up with an embarrassed look with the aid of a banderillero the matador drove the bull to the center of the ring while two other men dragged away the drivers body pitt turned to approach ann only to see her hoisted into the stands by giordino he stepped closer and grasped giordinos outstretched left hand to the thunderous applause of the crowd pitt climbed over the wall a pale and shaken ann grabbed him by the arm that bull would have mauled me if you hadnt stepped in it was a crazy thing to do but thank you pitt gave her a tired grin you forget that i work in washington im fighting bull all the time then his face grew serious and he gazed around them your abductor pablo ann shook her head giordino was already scanning the crowds but he too came up empty the big man had made himself small in the crowd and disappeared im thinking we really shouldnt lollygag to chat with the authorities giordino said he tilted his head toward a bullring official who was making his way across the stadium with two security guards lead on pitt said and cinched his arm tight around anns waist she took a hesitant step with her injured leg then grasped pitts shoulder for support as a burst of pain bolted through her ankle just put your weight on the good leg and well get there pitt said he easily supported her onehundredandtenpound frame giordino charged through the crowd like a snowplow clearing a path for the hobbling duo following close behind they found the rear exit ramp and hustled out of the stadium to the crowds fading cheers unable to draw close the bullring authorities could only watch in puzzlement as the three americans jumped into a taxi and roared off into the night ann begged to be taken to the american consulate but was outvoted by the numa men who had already negotiated a supplemental fuel purchase from the taxi driver as the cab zipped across tijuana the exhaustion of the chase caught up with them and the conversation fell silent pitt had plenty of questions for ann but now was not the time to ask she had kept her emotions bottled up since leaving the ship refusing to allow her fears to overcome her now that she was free from pablos death threats and safe in the company of pitt and giordino the fright seeped out she shivered in the warm night air and fought back her emotions pitt gently tucked an arm around her and gave her a light squeeze which seemed to purge her stressful feelings within a few minutes she had drifted off to sleep the drive to the coast took over an hour at legal speeds pushing the clock to almost ten when they arrived at the small sandy beach pitt was relieved to spot the barges inflatable sitting where they had left it he dragged it down to the surf and helped ann climb aboard giordino retrieved the inflatables fuel can and passed it to the cabby who siphoned a few gallons of gas from his car with an old hose he kept in the trunk gracias amigo giordino said as he parted with the balance of his poker winnings then he hauled the fuel can down to the beach counting his cash windfall the cabby beamed and shouted buen viaje pitt attached the engines fuel line to the gas can and then with giordinos assistance shoved the inflatable past the surf line and climbed aboard the outboard fired up with little trouble and they were soon racing past the rocky breakwater you sure you can find the drake ann asked scanning the black horizon her eyes were again alert but tinged with apprehension pitt nodded i think rudi will leave the lights on for us once clear of the jetty he turned the inflatable north and followed the coast after a mile or so he veered out to sea to retrace their original course gazing over his shoulder he found a bearing the lights of a lone house high on a hill that lined up vertically with a pale yellow streetlamp near the shoreline steering to keep the two lights in alignment he guided the inflatable offshore until the beacons vanished they motored on for several minutes in complete darkness ann fighting her fears that they would become lost at sea just as the waters around them became blackest a faint glow appeared a few points off the bow a single white light emerged from the distant sea gradually morphing into several lights as they bore closer they could see they belonged to three vessels grouped together the drake and the barge were stationed alongside each other while a larger ship waited nearby pitt observed its whiteandorangebanded hull signifying a us coast guard vessel a pair of lookouts on its deck monitored the inflatable as pitt eased it alongside the drake and killed the engine when he saw ann a visibly relieved rudi gunn leaned over the rail above them thank heavens youre safe careful shes got a bad wheel giordino said he lifted her to the rail where gunn helped her aboard the ship ill call for the edistos medic to come aboard gunn said ann shook her head all i really need is some ice me too giordino said pulling himself onto the deck in a glass with a shot of jack daniels pitt remained in the inflatable acting as taxi driver to shuttle over the coast guard medic ann was quickly settled into her cabin with her ankle iced and a dose of painkillers in her stomach pitt returned the medic to his ship tied off the inflatable and climbed aboard the drake when he met up with gunn and giordino on the bridge al had already explained their chase through tijuana el matador pitt eh gunn smiled i must have some spanish blood in me pitt sighed and gazed out the bridge window toward the edisto nice work getting the coast guard out here but why arent they pursuing the mexican boat absent a lifesaving emergency they werent prepared to encroach on mexican territorial waters without authorization theyve called in the mexican navy who will take the lead gunn took off his glasses and wiped the lenses unfortunately they dont seem to have a vessel in the area so the outlook isnt good i thought it best if the edisto stood by until we heard back from you a prudent call it seems the thieves were standing by waiting for us to salvage the cuttlefish gunn said what was in that crate that was so valuable pitts eyes narrowed thats a question id like an answer for whatever it was giordino said nobodys going to be too happy about its demise now its nothing but a worthless bundle of mashed wires speaking of which gunn said we replaced the bridge radio with a spare unit from belowdecks i guess i should let the edisto know we can all head back to san diego now rudi arent you forgetting some unfinished business downstairs giordino said pointing toward the sea he looked down his angular nose at giordino do you think weve been sitting around playing tiddlywinks while you were gone he stepped to the rear of the bridge and pointed out the window at the barge bathed in the glow of a dim deck light sat the cuttlefish supported on a pair of wooden cradles you landed her without us giordino turned to pitt now how did we miss that guess we were too focused on the coast guard cutter nice work rudi did she give you any trouble coming up none at all we just ran the sling cables from the submersible to the barge crane and hoisted away she came up clean as a whistle but i think youll want to take a look at her hull nows as good a time as any pitt said gunn gathered some flashlights and they motored in the inflatable to the bow of the barge the vessel was ghostly quiet its pilot asleep in his bunk with the dachshund curled at his feet the cuttlefish stood tall above them the hulls sides were clean and dry and the boats chrome sparkled bright under their lights showing little indication it had been submerged for nearly a week giordino let out a low whistle as they viewed a gaping hole ripped in the base of the hull she must have sunk in a heartbeat i guess the darpa folks had reason to be suspicious gunn said by the looks of it this was no accident our buddies in the cabin cruiser probably attached some explosives to the hull giordino said must have detonated prematurely before they could lay their hands on the crate actually they planted the explosives inside the boat pitt studied the damage with his flashlight the blast marks seem to indicate an internal explosion gunn put his hand on a serrated section next to the hole it flared outward youre right the explosives must have been placed inside the cabin pitt knelt beneath the opening and shined his flashlight into the dark interior the remnants of the boats galley were visible above him with blackstained bulkheads and a cratersized blast hole through the ceiling still the interior damage was less severe than the breach in the hull examining the damage pitt noticed a pair of frayed orange wires trailing from the hole he traced the wires path across the galley to an aft corner bulkhead where they rose through a drilled hole squeezing through the blast hole pitt climbed into the galley and stepped aft past the cramped dining area to a flight of steps he followed them up to the wheelhouse where he stopped and studied the helm in front of the pilots seat he pulled open a kick panel which contained a rats maze of colored wires that powered the boats electronics he soon found the orange wires one was spliced to a power lead while the other ran up to the throttle housing a minute later he found its terminusa hidden toggle switch mounted beneath the helm panel giordino and gunn had walked around the cuttlefish and climbed up its stern finding pitt standing at the helm lost in thought gunn asked what he had discovered a slight twist in my theory pitt said it wasnt the mexicans who blew up the cuttlefish it was heiland himself stepping into the drakes mess just after sunup pitt was surprised to find ann seated across from gunn finishing her breakfast grabbing a cup of coffee he headed to their table good morning mind if i join you gunn waved him to a seat next to ann always interrupting my fun pitt looked to ann sleep well just fine she said softly averting his gaze pitt smiled at her sudden sheepishness returning from the barge the night before he had gone straight to his cabin to go to bed hed answered a light knock at his door to find ann in the doorway an expectant look on her face shed worn a loosefitting ships bathrobe that failed to conceal the straps of her lingerie barefoot she stood on her good leg relieving the pressure on her wrapped and swollen left ankle i was hoping you would stop by to say good night she whispered pitt quelled an uneasy desire as he gazed into her needy eyes negligence on my part he said with a smile he bent down and plucked her off her feet holding her tight she buried her head in his neck as he carried her down the narrow corridor and into her cabin setting her gently on the bunk he leaned over and kissed her forehead good night my dear he said softly before she could respond hed backed out of her cabin and closed the door behind him your cook is excellent ann said to gunn now pushing away her empty plate while trying to change the subject food is a key element of shipboard morale particularly on long voyages we insist on highly trained chefs for all our vessels gunn took a bite of toast and turned to pitt ann was just telling me how she put her college springboard experience to good use by diving from the bridge wing last evening id give her a pitt winked though i might raise my marks if she would dive into what this expedition was really all about ann gave a nervous cough into her napkin what do you mean we were searching for much more than just a missing boat werent we it was important that we find the boat and any equipment that was still aboard we succeeded on both counts pitt said so how about you tell us something about that equipment i cant disclose that pitts eyes narrowed aside from nearly getting yourself killed you also placed this ship and crew in danger i think were entitled to some answers ann looked pitt in the eye for the first timeand realized she couldnt sidestep the issue she gazed around the room to ensure no one was eavesdropping as you know dr heilands company was engaged in a highlevel researchanddevelopment project for darpa his work was in support of a secret navy submarine program called sea arrow heiland was specifically involved in the development of an advanced propulsion system i really cant tell you more than that except that he was doing some final prototype testing on a breakthrough development when his boat was lost at sea that was the item in the crate a scale model ann said while there was a suspicion of foul play in the loss of the cuttlefish no one anticipated any interference with our searchandrecovery project im truly sorry your crew was placed in danger it was thought that the fewer people aware of heilands research the better i know the vice president wasnt happy about keeping you in the dark but he was forced to go along at the request of tom cerny so who were those guys who tried to steal it gunn asked ann shrugged a mystery at the moment by their looks i dont believe the men were from mexico but possibly central or south america ive already spoken to washington and been assured well have the mexican authorities assistance in examining the two bodies and tracing the pickup truck weve provided a pretty good description of their boat to the mexican navy gunn said they dont seem like the usual suspects for a defenserelated theft pitt noted did you think they had already absconded with heilands magic box yes ann said when the bodies of heiland and his assistant were found we presumed they had been hijacked at sea and the prototype stolen thats why i was so shocked to see the crate still secured aboard the cuttlefish i guess you have heiland to thank for that pitt said he described his discovery of the orange wires and hidden toggle switch im guessing that heiland realized he was under attack and blew up his own boat the two bodies showed severe trauma consistent with a fire or explosion ann said we never considered it was of their own doing but that may need to be reevaluated now i think heiland beat them to the punch pitt said and to make matters worse for the bad guys the cuttlefish sank in water too deep for conventional diving they were probably scrambling to locate their own salvage ship when we showed up so they let us raise it for them gunn turned to ann your high diving saved the day no it was dirk and al who recaptured the crate though its destruction saved it from falling into the wrong hands the loss of the model has magnified some other problems namely pitt asked ive been told that neither darpa nor the navy have any detailed plans or design specs for heilands work carl heiland was a highly respected engineera genius reallyand because of that he was given free rein over the years hes made many brilliant modifications in submarine design and torpedo development as a result he wasnt required to submit the usual mountain of documentation demanded by most defense contracts so no one else knows how to complete the sea arrow pitt asked exactly ann replied with a tightlipped grimace with heiland dead and his model destroyed gunn said those plans would be extremely valuable fowler tells me that is now our top priority she looked at her watch and then at pitt the vice presidents office has arranged a return jet for us to washington it leaves san diego at one oclock id like to visit heilands headquarters in del mar before we go could you drive me there on the way to the airport pitt rose from the table and offered ann her crutches i never fail to heed the call of small children little old ladies or pretty girls with wrenched ankles he gave a slight bow just show me the way an hour later they pulled into the headquarters of heiland research and associates the office occupied a shared building on a rise overlooking the beach town of del mar just north of san diego the site offered a clear view of the ocean to the west as well as del mars famed racetrack in the valley below ann flashed her credentials at the front desk and signed them in welcome miss bennett the receptionist said mrs marsdale is expecting you a minute later a stylish woman with short dark hair entered the lobby and introduced herself as carl heilands operations manager as she led them to a nearby conference room ann followed awkwardly on her crutches we wont take much of your time mrs marsdale ann said im on the team investigating the death of mr heiland and i am concerned about securing his working papers related to the sea arrow project i still cant believe hes gone the shock of heilands death still marked her face i assume his death was no accident why would you think that carl and manfred were just too competent to die in a boating accident carl was a safe and prudent man i know he always had concerns about maintaining the secrecy of his work we dont think it was an accident ann said but the investigation is still ongoing we do believe that someone was trying to acquire his test model marsdale nodded the fbi was here a few days ago and we gave them what we could but as i told them this is dr heilands business headquarters we handle the government contracts and related admin support and thats about it the entire firm employs only twelve people where is your research facility pitt asked we dont really have one theres a small shop out back where we employ a few interns for ongoing research topics but carl and manfred seldom worked here they traveled frequently but actually conducted most of their research in idaho idaho ann asked yes theres a navy research facility in bayview dr heiland has a cabin nearby where he and manfred would escape to problemsolve that would be manfred ortega dr heilands assistant yes carl called him manny a brilliant engineer in his own right the two of them together created magical work they were the brains of the whole company i dont know what well do now there was a long silence as they all realized the deaths of carl and manny meant the likely demise of heiland research and associates did the fbi gather all of the materials here on site ann asked they took all of our admin filesand even our computers for a time we had sent the technical files to darpa headquarters which was just as well the fbi agents were like a bull in a china shop so i didnt let them in carls office but they had the run of the rest of the place would you mind if i had a look around his office ann said im sure you can understand the national security ramifications of securing all of his work sure he never left much here but his office is just down the hall marsdale grabbed some keys from her desk and led them to a corner office of modest size heilands office looked seldom used like the man it was frugal in décor sporting a few submarine models and a painting of a mahogany rumrunner under sail the only incongruous item was a stuffed moose head with an assortment of fishing caps dangling from its antlers mounted just above the desk marsdale gave a puzzled look when she saw several desk drawers had been left open thats odd she suddenly stiffened someones been in here and searched his desk i remember leaving a contract in his inbox for signature and now its gone she turned to ann with a worried expression im the only one in the building with keys to his office were there any other important documents in here i cant say for sure but i dont think so like i said he was seldom here for very long she looked at the desk and then glanced up at the moose there was a picture of his boat and cabin on his deskits gone too and carl used to hang the keys to his cabin on the moose antler when he was here and theyre also missing do you have security cameras in the building pitt asked we do ill contact our security firm immediately her voice cracked in distress im very sorry if you dont mind ann said id like to call the fbi back in to scour the office combined with your security video that should allow us to develop some potential leads yes of course whatever it takes to find out who is behind all this as ann and pitt returned to the car she stopped and stared out at the ocean they were here werent they id bet on it pitt said ive got a favor to ask she turned and locked eyes with him would you mind delaying our return to washington a day id like to redirect our flight to idaho if marsdale is right all of heilands plans may be safe in bayview without us even knowing it im game pitt said fact is ive always been curious to see where all those famous potatoes come from the government gulfstream jet descended out of a sapphire sky and touched down on the main runway of coeur dalene airports pappy boyington field a native son of the scenic idaho town gregory pappy boyington had grown up to fly fu corsairs in the pacific winning the medal of honor while commanding the legendary black sheep squadron the airport that bore his name was now home to tame piper cubs and private jets of wealthy tourists pitt grabbed anns crutches and helped her off the plane at the private jet terminal where they negotiated the use of a rental car pitt took the wheel as they headed north on route they were traveling up idahos northern panhandle a region of rich forested hills and pristine blue lakes far from the potato fields in the states southern plains traffic was light and pitt nudged the rental car past the sixtyfivemileperhour speed limit twenty minutes later they reached the town of athol where pitt turned onto a side road and drove east a large sign welcomed them onto the grounds of farragut state park an idaho state park named after a civil war admiral pitt said as a matter of fact it is ann scanned a travel brochure she picked up at the airport in the early days of world war two the navy established an inland base here after it was feared the japanese would bomb the west coast the farragut naval training station was indeed named for david farragut hero of the battle of mobile bay and the first full admiral in the us navy nearly fifty thousand men were stationed here at one point after the war the base closed down and the land was conveyed to idaho which turned it into a state park theres some trivia to fling at your next pentagon cocktail hour pitt said the road exited the park and corkscrewed down a hill into bayview the hamlet was at the tip of a narrow inlet on the large glacial lake of pend oreille pitt had to squeeze past some road construction equipment before dropping down to the main waterfront drive several marinas filled with bass boats day cruisers and a large number of houseboats occupied the northern half of the bay the navy acoustic research detachment controlled the southern shore theres the labs entrance ann said pointing to a gated entry pitt pulled into the visitors lot and parked next to the guard station after they signed in with the guard a uniformed escort arrived and chauffeured them into the facility in a gray sedan as they drove along the waterfront pitt noticed an oddly shaped submarine with the designation sea jet tied up at dock the driver stopped at a towering beigeandteal metal building built over the water then escorted ann and pitt to the door an animated man with bright red hair and dancing blue eyes greeted them chuck nichols assistant lab director he said in a rapidfire voice please follow me he waved off the driver and led ann and pitt to a small office crowded with papers and technical journals he cleared off a pair of chairs overflowing with binders so they could sit down we were all pretty shocked to hear about carl and mannys accident nichols said have you figured out what happened not entirely ann said but we dont believe it was an accident we have reason to believe they were killed during a failed attempt by a foreign party to obtain the model prototype they were testing nicholss lips tightened yeah slippery mumm he was pretty secret about that one i cant believe anybody would have known about it slippery mumm he always had a pet name for his models he called his last hull model pig ghost he gave us lots of grief over naming our test boat sea jet any significance to the name pitt asked sure but probably only to carl and manny he said the mumm was from a champagne he liked he talked a lot about speed and bubbles in attacking the supercavitation issue so that must be the connection tell us about your facility here ann said heiland practically built the place his family had a cabin here on lake pend oreille so he fell in love with the area pitt noticed he pronounced the lakes name pondoray when he headed up acoustics at the naval surface warfare center nichols continued he convinced the brass in washington to open an offshoot research lab here using some remnants from the old farragut naval base he pretty much built it all from scratch about ten or twelve years ago he grew tired of the daytoday management and decided to retire thats when he started his consulting business carl was always an engineer first youre a long way from blue water pitt said yes but the lake is an ideal testing ground its large lightly populated and features depths of over a thousand feet our work here focuses on research in advanced hull and propulsion designsones that allow for submarines to operate with a minimum acoustic signature the lake is a nearly perfect controlled environment in which to test new designs and technologies the sea jet being a test platform pitt asked exactly nichols said its what we call an advanced electric ship demonstrator though it looks a bit like a submarine it is actually a quarterscale model of the new ddx class of destroyer weve used it to experiment with some radical new hull designs and propulsion systems it was originally built with waterjet propulsion but weve migrated to some other technologies i probably shouldnt talk about we were scheduled to test carls latest tinkering related to the sea arrow project but were at somewhat of a loss there now the technology in the slippery mumm ann asked yes he was here testing it in the lake just a few weeks ago i remember him telling the boys that he was really going to be scaring the fish with it a couple of the fellows were out on the lake at the time and they claimed he was registering some crazy speeds didnt he work on it here at the facility not much hed come in and run things on our computers but he was always three steps ahead of us when he was in town he was usually holed up at his cabin with manny tinkering away its important that we find and secure all of his research related to the slippery mumm ann said i already received that request from the folks at darpa and im pulling together what we have nichols said the fact of the matter is carl maintained ninety percent of the data what wasnt in his head is probably still out at his cabin here let me give you the address he checked his rolodex and jotted down the address for ann giving directions as he wrote theres a rusty bell sitting on the patio table in back underneath it should be his spare keys to the house and boat ann gave him a how did you know that look ive downed more than a few beers with carl on his porch and his boat nichols said with a wink ann thanked him for his time and they were escorted back to the front gate ann felt a sense of optimism for the first time see i think this little side trip is going to pay off lets go check out heilands cabin and then ill call the fbi to come secure the place no objection to having dinner first pitt said itll be getting dark soon only if i can buy their options in the small town were limited pitt selected a waterfront restaurant called the captains wheel just down the road ann sampled a greek salad while pitt polished off a cheeseburger and beer as they watched the marina lights begin flickering on ann noticed a tranquil look cross pitts face as he gazed at the lakes still waters there was something enigmatic about the man yet she felt entirely safe with him she had met him just days before and knew almost nothing about himother than the disappointing discovery that he was married im not sure i ever thanked you for saving my life in tijuana she said pitt looked at her and smiled im not sure jumping aboard a boat filled with armed thugs was the smartest act of law enforcement ive ever seen but im glad things worked out im occasionally prone to rashness she thought of her uninvited visit to his cabin the night before im hoping that we can be friends in washington after this case is resolved id like that with a grin he slid the check across the table to her but for now how about we go find heilands cabin before it gets completely dark nichols had told them they couldnt get lost and he was right his directions sent them down a singlelane road that skirted the acoustic research center and continued along the southern edge of the inlet they passed clusters of cabins that grew fewer in number as the town lights receded behind them the road tracked toward the bays entrance then turned south following the lakes irregular shore they drove another few miles before the road ended in a pineclustered culdesac a narrow gravel drive led to a red wooden house facing the water that looks like the place ann said confirming the address on a mailbox pitt drove the rental car down the drive and parked beside an attached garage that looked large enough to house a dozen vehicles no lights were on in the house and a desolate silence permeated the grounds ann noticed the first stars visible overhead as she felt a light breeze blow in from the lake i wish we had a flashlight she said poking her crutches at the uneven ground that sloped toward the lake why dont you just head for the front door and ill go look for the keys out back pitt said he stepped around the side of the garage and followed a footpath to the rear of the house just a thin band of tall pines separated the backyard from the water pitt could tell the house sat on a prime parcel of land that offered a breathtaking view of the lake he swatted at a mosquito buzzing in his ear as he stepped onto a wide porch that ran the length of the house he quickly spotted the old bell centered on a coffee table surrounded by some adirondack chairs the keys were indeed there attached to a floatable chain used by boaters retracing his steps he glanced toward the lake noticing a private dock at the property line with a darkcolored boat moored alongside ann had made her way to the front door and stood resting on her crutches any luck pitt dropped the keys into her hand just as advertised she unlocked the door and stepped inside groping for a switch pitt followed her in as she flipped on a bank of overhead spotlights that illuminated the interior the antique cabin had been tastefully updated over the years the kitchen glimmered with stainless steel appliances and granite countertops while the living room featured a large flatpanel television a pair of stuffed trout hung next to an antique fly rod above the rock fireplace an ode to one of the owners longtime passions uncomfortable scouring the dead mans refuge ann quickly hobbled through the house searching for an office or workshop all she found were four large bedrooms we better hope theres something in the garage she looked toward a door at the end of the hall pitt followed her as she opened the door and flicked on the lights the sight surprised them both though they expected to find a workshop of some sort they never anticipated that a topdrawer research lab would be hidden in the idaho woods the garage looked like it had been transferred from the heart of silicon valley the bright overhead lights illuminated a spotlessly clean white room filled with stainless steel workbenches rack after rack of electronic test equipment lined one wall another corner was set up as a fabrication area a long narrow tank filled with water used for marine hull and propulsion testing stretched nearly the length of the building but the space wasnt entirely devoted to work pitt noted in one corner stood a sera pinball machine next to an elaborate espresso machine jackpot pitt said ann limped her way across the room where a large executive desk was positioned next to two easy chairs a pair of laptop computers sat open beside several bound journals and stacks of schematic diagrams ann picked up a journal and read a few lines of the handwritten notes this is dated just a few days ago she said he describes a series of successful tests of sm in the lake and his plans for a final saltwater proof run in san diego sm that would be slippery mumm thank goodness his notes and data look to be all here the plans havent been lost the words had barely left her mouth when the lights to the house went off leaving them in a sea of blackness the two men had pulled up short of the cabin upon seeing a car parked in the drive the driver opened the trunk and each man retrieved a glock semiautomatic pistol and a pair of night vision goggles darkness had enveloped the mountain lake by then and a moonless night offered little illumination with trained stealth they surveyed the cabins perimeter and located the electrical panel box prying open the cover one of them found the main breaker and flipped it off inside the windowless lab it turned as black as a mine shaft at midnight ann let out a faint gasp what a place to be when the power goes out she said a nervous uptick in her voice may be just a power surge pitt said stay still for a moment so you dont trip and fall as they waited an uneasy apprehension bedeviled pitts thoughts try turning on the laptop computer for light he said it should have some battery power good idea ann set down the journal and felt on the desk for one of the laptops she located one and pressed a variety of keys hoping to locate the power button from inside the house pitt heard the hall floorboards creak they werent alone he reached toward the workbench beside him and ran his hand across its surface probing for a weapon ignoring some strands of loose wire he felt a toola tiny pair of needlenose pliersand he palmed it in his hand there i think i got it ann said the computer began to boot up and she spun the screen toward pitt casting the room in a turquoise glow the faint light reached the house door just as it burst open two intruders charged in then froze as they surveyed the interior pitt saw they were both short but muscular dressed in dark clothes and wearing night vision goggles they held glocks at arms length and swept the room mechanically until locking sights on ann and pitt do not move the lead assailant shouted with a slight spanish accent he produced a flashlight and aimed its beam at them ann had to squint when the light lingered on her face the gunman strode forward keeping his weapon trained on pitt back against the wall he said illuminating the path with his flashlight ann eased up her crutches and hobbled over to pitt then they both stepped to the side wall a door in the wall led to the backyard and pitt gently nudged ann closer to it as the gunman called to his partner the second man approached and took up a guard position in front of ann and pitt his gun fixed on them the other man holstered his weapon raised his goggles and used his flashlight to begin searching the lab he was thorough pitt noted and he knew what he was looking for he started by examining the laptops and desk journals ann had found then methodically searched the lab itself it took nearly ten minutes before he returned to the desk and organized the items he wanted locating an empty plastic bin he stuffed it with heilands notes and journals ann huddled close to pitt stunned that she was staring down the barrel of a gun for the second time in two days anger began to push aside her fear as she saw heilands work being stolen right in front of her emptying the desk drawers the burglar stuffed the contents into the bin finishing it off with the two laptops are you done the man standing guard asked almost the other man glanced at ann and pitt with annoyance stay here with them until i get back he hoisted the bin onto his shoulder and crossed the lab guided by his flashlight a few seconds after he left the room the guard called out to him but he received no reply pitt could hear the intruder as he lumbered through the house and exited the front door he didnt have to be a psychic to know nothing good would come from his return without the lights from the flashlight and computer the garage had again turned inky black too black pitt realized with a sudden flicker of hope the guards night vision goggles required some form of ambient light to function be it only faint starlight but the only source of ambient light in the garage was the laptop computer and it had been removed thats why the guard had called to his partnerbecause he could no longer see anything pitts theory was confirmed when he heard a zipper being pulled open on the guards jacket he was fishing for his own flashlight pitt didnt let him make the catch pulling one of anns crutches from her grasp he spun it into a battering ram and charged forward he could only hope that the guard remained where he was when his partner had left five feet directly in front of pitt as he fumbled for his light the guard had lowered his gun hand and was totally unprepared when the rubberized foot of the crutch slammed into his sternum the unseen blow thrust him backward sprawling across heilands desk he whipped his gun around and fired several blind shots not realizing he was aiming three feet over pitts head ann get out the back door now pitt shouted ducking low he spun the crutch around again and started swinging it trying to make contact with the prone gunman the muzzle flashes gave him guidance and he batted the aluminum crutch against the mans wrist with a boneshattering crack sending the gun flying ann had dropped to the ground at the first gunfire and felt along the wall until locating the door then the handle she twisted the knob of the dead bolt above it and flung open the door grabbing her remaining crutch she crawled out then hopped away from the building before the door swung shut she heard the gunman let out a wail from the pain of his fractured wrist he scrambled off the desk to escape pitts onslaught pitt could hear him stagger to his feet but now he was beyond reach and out of sight knowing that ann couldnt move fast with her hurt ankle pitt pressed the attack to buy her more time he dropped the crutch and hurled himself onto the desk sliding across the spot where the guard had backpedaled seconds before spinning as he slid pitt landed on his feet and took a step forward blindly swinging his fist in an arc in front of him his knuckles only grazed the jacket of the guard who had stepped to pitts left the guard countered with his good hand striking a solid punch to pitts shoulder pitt recoiled and shook off the blow he knew where his target was and he stepped forward with two quick strikes he connected with both fists barreling a left and a right into the guards chest the man grunted as he staggered backward tripping over a chair and clattering to the ground pitt had no time to finish the attack the hallway door flew open and the other gunman alerted by the shooting ran in he scanned his flashlight across the room hesitating on the guards fallen body before focusing on pitt a few steps away pitt reacted instantly flinging himself back across the desk the gunman tried to track his movements with the light while firing a snap shot but the bullet went high pitt slid off the desk and onto the floor ducking out of the shooters sight he wasted no time lying still scurrying across the floor to the back wall he bumped against the discarded crutch and plucked it up the gunman bolted after pitt the beam from his light bounced across the floor as he moved gradually zeroing in on his prey but the light also illuminated the rear door just a few feet beyond pitt still crouching he lunged for it reaching for the handle a second before his torso slammed against the lower half of the door he caught the handle and twisted and his weight blasted the door open halfway across the lab the gunman raised his arm and fired three quick shots on the run pitt felt a sting in his leg as he yanked the crutch after him and slammed the door closed springing to his feet pitt wedged the crutchs arm pad beneath the door handle as a makeshift lock it might give him an extra ten maybe twenty seconds but that still wouldnt be enough somewhere in the darkness ann was hobbling about he had to find her and fast they would both be sitting ducks for the gunmen with their night vision goggles once they exited the lab he scrambled toward their car but then heard a motor cranking over nearby it didnt come from the road but down by the lake pitt spun in his tracks and ran for the water thinking that they might just have a chance after all the motor rumbled to life not the tinny whine from a compact rental car but the throaty gurgle of a powerboat pitt took off toward the dock admiring anns plan to escape in heilands boat for her part it was simply easier to navigate downhill on her tender ankle and the boat represented a closer target with the keys already in her pocket she had just prayed that she could get it started inside the lab the gunman found himself stymied by the back door the aluminum crutch had pinned it closed at least momentarily the angered man shoved violently at it finally bending the crutch until it slid from beneath the door handle and fell to the ground charging out the door he turned toward the sound of the boat he spotted the shadowy blur of pitt running amid the shoreline trees and took off in pursuit pitt was breathing hard and his left leg ached as he reached a gravel footpath that led to the lakefront he could faintly make out the figure of ann standing in the boats cockpit looking in his direction having heard the crash of the lab door opening he didnt have to look behind him to know the gunman had no plans to let them get away cast off ann he shouted dont wait ann crawled onto the dock and untied the stern line then limped over and released the bowline she was sliding back into the passenger seat when pitt pounded onto the dock as pitt approached he was surprised to see the boat was an old dual cockpit runabout built of mahogany had there been sufficient light he would have recognized it as an early s chriscraft not losing a step pitt crossed the dock and leaped into the rear cockpit he bounded off the cushion and vaulted into the front pilots seat jamming down the boats throttle as he fell into the seat the old boat charged away from the dock with a bellow from its vintage sixcylinder chrysler engine this was fast thinking he told ann as he guided the boat away from shore i was afraid youd never make it out of there he looked back at the dock to see the dark figure of the lead gunman charge onto the platform better get down pitt yelled spinning the wheel hard over the cockpit floor was spacious enough for both of them and they ducked beneath the cowl as the boat jutted left pitt reached up and eased back the wheel letting the boat run blindly ahead his move had turned the boat parallel to shore as it sped across the lake its occupants hidden from view the gunman ran to the end of the dock and aimed at the pilotless craft firing until his clip was empty the roar of the engine drowned out the gunshots but pitt detected several faint thumps when a few rounds struck the hull he waited a minute then popped his head up for a quick look the dock was lost from view among the trees as the boat skittered toward shore pitt slid into the seat and bumped the wheel over to keep them in deep water once on course he pulled ann up beside him with all focus on their escape he had ignored the throbbing pain in his leg and the sticky wetness that told him he was now bleeding are you all right he asked she nodded that was a little too close for comfort it would have been even closer if i hadnt had your crutch handy sorry to leave you off balance i was so scared i didnt even think about my ankle i just saw it was downhill to the dock and remembered i had the house keys in my pocket fortunately the boat keys were also attached she unconsciously rubbed her ankle now noticing the pain where to now she asked the wheels of justice had already been turning in pitts mind simple he said we head them off at the pass there was only one road out from heilands cabin pitt knew the thieves would have to pass through bayview to escape with the stolen documents they could be stopped but only if he and ann got there first it was a race that would depend on a seventyyearold boat though long in the tooth heilands chriscraft was no turtle the custom runabout was fitted with the companys model m engine which churned out horsepower the old speedboat was as stylish as she was speedy featuring a varnished mahogany finish dual cockpits and a rakish barrelback stern a desirable boat when it had left the algonac michigan factory in it was now a prized collectible for classic boat lovers the elegant boat cut easily through the waves as pitt kept the throttle down mustering full speed from its inboard engine although they had a healthy head start pitt knew the gunmen would be desperate to escape and could travel the road back at nearly twice the boats speed a starfilled sky gave him ample light and he nudged the boat near the shoreline to trim the distance after a few minutes of hard running a wide inlet appeared on pitts left and he angled the boat into it the lights of bayview appeared off the bow twinkling at the far end of the aptly named scenic bay pitt glanced toward the shoreline road but didnt spot any headlights how do we stop them ann shouted pitt had been ruminating on that question since they had cleared the dock sitting weaponless in a seventyyearold boat with a woman who could barely walk did not give rise to many options the obvious course of action would be to storm into the navy facility and request help but such an assault would more likely get them shot or arrested than gain them immediate assistance peering ahead he spotted a marina dock close to the labs fenced security entrance the road from heilands cabin intersected the towns main street just a short distance away he pointed out the dock to ann ill run us in there pitt said see if you can make it up to the guard hut and convince them to call for some security to seal the road ill see if i can find something to slow them down okay but be careful she reached into the rear seat for her lone crutch and braced herself to exit the boat the old speedboat roared through a nowake zone and past the main marina angry houseboat residents ran to their windows staring at the noisy source of their homes rocking the shoreline dock was filled with small fishing boats but pitt spotted an empty berth and barreled toward it cutting power at the last second he slid in with just a slight bump to the side of the boat he popped from his seat and leaped to the dock helping ann up after him im fine she said tucking the crutch under her arm and hobbling down the dock pitt sprinted ahead of her and ran toward the main road leaving a trail of bloody footprints behind him ann cringed when she realized the damp prints werent created from lake water the streets of bayview were deserted and the town almost silent in the distance pitt detected the sound of a speeding car and he looked down the inlet sure enough headlights glimmered through the trees on the road from heilands cabin pitt scanned the roadway where it entered town searching for something he could use as a barricade the road was lined by the acoustic labs tall security fence on one side and a sloping hill on the other there were no rocks logs or even other cars within view that he might use as a blockade the only vehicles in sight were for construction parked up the hill a gravel truck and a yellow earthmover he glanced again at the approaching lights theyd arrive in less than a minute road crew it is he muttered then ran up the hill as fast as he could ann charged into the acoustic labs guard station with all the subtlety of a kansas tornado the labs been robbed she shouted i need your help out front now the duty guard had been seated behind a tall security glass casually reading the sports page he flew out of his chair as if stung by a cattle prod maam i cant leave my station he stuttered now calm down and tell me who are you and what this is about ann already had her identification pressed against the glass call for your backup i need all the roads out of this town closed off immediately the guard noticed a general resemblance between the wildeyed woman screaming at him and the neatly groomed female pictured on the ncis badge he nodded at ann and picked up the telephone he was still dialing when a loud screech resonated outside they both turned to see a speeding dark sedan swerve across the lakeshore road from over the hill the yellow earthmover suddenly appeared sliding down the steep incline apparently out of control ann could see it was on a collision course with the car which the cars driver had realized too late in the glow from a nearby streetlight ann caught sight of a blackhaired man in the cab of the earthmoverpitt as he had staggered up the hill with a sharp pain in his left leg pitt had seen no other options the gravel truck had been parked too close to the earthmover to maneuver around it leaving the yellow mover his only option the construction workers in this quiet town hadnt bothered to lock either vehicle pitt climbed behind the controls looked down the hill and saw the headlights of the fleeing car already skirting the naval center in seconds it would pass directly below him pitt depressed the clutch and slapped the gearshift lever into neutral releasing the parking brake with his other hand the big machine lurched forward downhill prompting pitt to tap the unassisted brakes he gripped the rubberized steering wheel and tested the play the wellused earthmover didnt have a locking steering column so pitt had some maneuverability as long as he could muscle the wheel glancing again down the hill he saw the car emerge from the trees a short distance away he had no time to waste releasing the brake pedal he let the earthmover roll forward a few feet to gain momentum then bulled the steering wheel sharply to his right the two front wheels turned easily slicing through the earth at the foot of the hillside the big steel blade scraped into the berm slowing the mover momentarily before lurching ahead the ungainly machine nearly jackknifed as it tumbled over the ledge managing to right itself with a heavy bounce the steep hill dropped almost fifty feet causing the mover to accelerate quickly pitt straightened the wheels hoping to keep it upright the glare of oncoming headlights filled his right windshield had the cars driver not been speeding he might have been able to brake to a stop ahead of the runaway earthmover but his rate of speed combined with the shock of seeing the big piece of construction equipment bounding down the hill caused him to overreact rather than brake first he instinctively flicked the steering wheel to the side to escape the mover he then stood on the brakes it was the worst choice the car skidded twenty feet before the right front fender slammed into a telephone pole sitting unbuckled in the passenger seat the man who had played guard in heilands house flew into the windshield his neck snapped and he died instantly the driver suffered only a crushed leg but his reprieve was temporary he looked up over a now deflating air bag to see the charging yellow monster only inches away the prow of the earthmover struck the drivers door square knocking the car clear of the telephone pole and driving it sideways pitt dropped the movers steel blade slowing the mover as a shower of sparks erupted from the asphalt it was just enough to halt the momentum of both vehicles when the passenger side of the car smacked against the navy labs fence both jarred to a halt ann was already hobbling toward the scene followed by a sirenblaring security car racing through the labs main gate she made her way alongside the earthmover as pitt climbed out of the cab his left leg was bloody and he looked pale your leg she said are you all right its not serious he said moving gingerly they walked to the mangled car and peered inside the body of the driver was flung forward his eyes locked in a lifeless gaze his bloodied partner equally frozen in death sprawled across the passengerside dashboard you cut them off all right ann whispered she took a closer look at their features noticing details that had gone unseen in the darkness of heilands lab associates of our friends in tijuana they might have accessed heilands office in del mar and tracked down his cabin here pitt said he looked again at the gruesome scene in the car as the navy security car pulled up i hope it was worth it ann limped to the rear of the car and pried open the crashdamaged trunk inside was the bin containing heilands documents she gazed at pitt with look of grim satisfaction it was part ii rare earth the gulfstreams wheels touched down with a thump jarring ann awake the excitement of the past few days had finally caught up with her and she had slept since the plane left the ground in idaho she yawned and glanced across the aisle at pitt who sat engrossed reading a jeff edwards novel home at last she said pitt looked up and smiled then gazed out at the gray gloom hanging over reagan national airport as evening fell i was beginning to have my doubts wed ever make it back he had spent the better part of the morning being interrogated by navy fbi and local idaho law enforcement authorities about the previous nights fatal accident ann redirected the questioning as best she could and ultimately gained his release along with heilands plans salvaged from the wrecked car the gulfstream rolled off the runway bypassing the commercial terminals for a private hangar reserved for government aircraft a blue ford taurus shot onto the tarmac and pulled alongside as the jets wheels were chocked dan fowler climbed out of the car and stood by tapping his foot and checking his watch until the jets door opened he rushed over to ann took her hand and helped her down the steps ann are you okay dan i wasnt expecting to see you here were both a little tired but holding up fine i thought you could use a lift home pitt followed her out of the plane and handed her a new pair of crutches good to see you dirk fowler reached out to shake pitts hand after the last two days im not sure im so happy to see you pitt said returning his handshake fowler noticed pitt was moving with his own limp were you hurt too a bullet grazed my calf i got off easier than ann i cant tell you how sorry i am fowler said we obviously had no idea of the danger you both were walking into we had only speculated that someone might be trying to obtain heilands research when he disappeared we certainly had no idea of the seriousness of the threat you mean threats ann said at least they ended up as failed threats fowler gave ann an anxious look do you have heilands plans pitt ducked into the gulfstream and returned with the bin containing heilands laptops and research journals its all here pitt said fowler looked relieved he stepped to the rear of his car and opened the trunk pitt followed shooting the security director a sharp glance as he dropped the bin in you may not know it fowler said but that represents a priceless bit of naval technology then why didnt you arrange an armed security escort to keep it safe someone is willing to kill for that data dont worry its headed to a secure room in the bowels of the darpa headquarters buildingjust as soon as i take ann home pitt retrieved anns bag from the gulfstream and placed it in the trunk beside the bin can i give you a lift too fowler asked no thanks pitt said i actually live within walking distance of here after being cooped up the last few hours i could use a good stretch of the legs he turned to say goodbye to ann good luck with the investigation ann threw her arms around pitt and gave him a tight hug and a kiss on the cheek thanks she whispered you take care of that leg he helped her into the car and waved as they drove off into the gloom pitts left leg ached from the bullet wound while his right shin was still tender from his boat collision in chile he paused and sucked in a deep breath of the night air cool and crisp from a recent rain shower hoisting his duffel bag over his shoulder he ambled across the tarmac his tight limbs slowly loosening as he moved the whine of engines sounded from across the tarmac as he made his way past a row of private jet hangars toward a littleused section of the airport he crossed an empty field and approached a lone hangar that looked as if it hadnt been occupied in fifty years high weeds surrounded the structure which was coated in equal parts of rust and dust a bank of windows beneath the roofs eaves showed a continuous web of cracks with shards of glass scattered on the ground near a battered trash can only an expert eye examining the building up close could discern that the derelict appearance was in fact a façade designed to deter attention pitt stepped to a side door illuminated by a dim yellow bulb and reached for an industrialgrade light switch the switch assembly flipped open on a hinge revealing a concealed keypad pitt entered a code that deactivated the alarm system and opened the doors lock he stepped inside turned on the lightsand was greeted by a fleet of gleaming antique cars parked in rows across the hangar floor their polished chrome glistening under the overhead illumination the culmination of a lifelong passion for the fast and the beautiful in automotive design he had assembled an eclectic collection that spanned the dawn of the twentieth century through the s the museumlike appearance was augmented by a ford trimotor aircraft parked to one side near a beautifully restored pullman railroad car that his adult kids occasionally used as a temporary apartment pitt drifted across the hangar patting the fender of a packard speedster runabout that was parked next to a workbench the right side of its hood raised he reached a castiron circular staircase and climbed to his secondfloor living quarters which he shared with loren dropping his duffel on a chair he pulled a shiner bock beer from the refrigerator then read a note taped to the freezer door dirk im staying at my georgetown condo until you get back too many automotive ghosts around here extended committee hearings will probably keep me on the hill working late missed you xxxx loren pitt downed the beer and returned to the hangar floor something was gnawing at him about the heiland case something he couldnt quite put his finger on replaying the recent events had failed to spark a clue so he slipped on a worn mechanics jumpsuit and made his way over to the old packard with a careful devotion he began disassembling its updraft carburetor by the time he had the mechanism overhauled an hour or so later he knew exactly what was troubling him i guess it was a good call enlisting pitt on the case fowler said as he drove away from the airport hes quite a resourceful man ann stared out the window and considered her impressions of pitt he saved my life twice he evidently has quite a track record for averting disaster fowler said im sure he can be trusted but just for the record did he become aware of heilands work and its capabilities he has the basic idea but he didnt press for more he seemed primarily concerned about the safety of his ship and crew ann reached down and rubbed her ankle we really should have told him all the facts in the beginning couldnt be helped tom cerny was firm that discussion of the technology was offlimits i think we were all surprised by the tenacity of those chasing after it fowler cleared the gates of the airport and stopped at a red light you live in alexandria right yes im near old town right off king street just take the jefferson davis highway into town fowler nodded and turned south any updates from the fbi while we were in the air ann asked nothing yet it will probably be several days before we learn anything from the mexican agencies and you probably know more than me about the two guys in black from idaho they were latin in appearance if they are in fact connected to the men in tijuana i suspect they may be operatives from central or south america venezuelan rogues possibly there is certainly no shortage of world powers that would like to use that technology china or russia probably head the list maybe theyve got a surrogate working for them dont forget the iranians fowler gunned the car to clear a yellow light he turned onto king street a main drag that bisected alexandria the attackers were pretty brazen ann said and well informed yes it sounds like they were fearless you thinking what im thinking ann asked whats that fowler said turning down a side street inside help there must be a security leak possibly at a high level possibly but you know how much classified information winds up in the press it may not have been that difficult for someone to figure out that heiland was working on something important since he wasnt working in a secure environment he made an easy target you may be right ann pointed down the street im up ahead on the right just past the big oak fowler spotted an empty space at the curb and pulled in behind a car that was idling with its lights off ann recognized it as a chrysler sedan why dont you take the day off tomorrow fowler said youve been through the wringer the last fortyeight hours you could probably use some rest thanks but id go crazy just sitting around i need to find out who these people are fowler turned off the cars engine and ann climbed out as she turned to retrieve her crutches she was grabbed from behind she just caught a glimpse of her assailant a tall black male who wrapped his hands around her and hurled her onto a small patch of lawn the heavy man was on her instantly jamming his knee into the small of her back while mashing her face into the grass with a platesized hand she struggled to break free then relented when she felt a gun barrel press against her temple dont even breathe the big man said she heard fowler cry out followed by the dull thumping of a body being pummeled a few seconds later car keys jingled and the fords trunk was popped open from the corner of her eye ann saw a second man carry something to the backseat of the chrysler then jump into the drivers seat the thug on her back leaned down and whispered into her face with foul breath now you lay nice and still for five minutes or else old clarence will have to come back and hurt you he eased himself off her loped over to the chrysler and climbed casually into the passenger seat the car shot forward with a chirp of its rear tires and sped down the street ann looked up to scan the cars rear license plate but it had been temporarily covered with a few strips of duct tape pros she thought theyd rip the tape off a block away then meld into traffic driving safely under the speed limit ann jumped up and limped to the far side of the taurus where she found fowler lying facedown next to the front wheel dan she cried kneeling beside him he pried his eyes open and eased himself to a sitting position im okay he rubbed his jaw never saw that coming his eyes gradually focused on ann are you hurt no im fine but that was no random stickup she tilted her head toward the open trunk not the files blurted fowler struggling to his feet holding each other for support they stepped to the rear of the car and peered into the open trunk inside sat anns travel bag and nothing else the memorial service for joe eberson was well attended by his fellow research scientists at darpa many of whom stepped to the annandale church podium and expressed their esteem for him sitting in a middle pew ann felt a bit uncomfortable because shed been assigned to the agency only at his death but clearly eberson was a respected man and that sharpened her resolve to catch his murderer fowler sat at her side a small bandage on his chin reminding her of the attack the night before alexandria paramedics and police had responded quickly to anns residence and found no serious injury to either one of them but the authorities also found no trail to the muggers ann alerted federal officials of the theft and an alert was put out on the assailants chrysler for the greater washington metro area by morning it had been found in a grocery store parking lot reported as stolen the day before it also had been scrubbed of any incriminating fingerprints and heilands records as well a special fbi team was assigned to the theft but they had very little to go on id like to pay my respects to joes family fowler said as the service ended how about i meet you at the car ann nodded thankful that he had offered to drive when they climbed into fowlers car a short time later ann commented on ebersons popularity he had a lot of years in the business fowler said made a lot of friends and also a few enemies what kind of enemies ann asked the professional sort the typical darpa research project parcels out work to different companies and universities then we tie everything togetherand garner all the credit the little guys who make the real breakthroughs often go unnoticed he turned to ann i dont think that any research scientist knocked off eberson and heiland if thats where youre headed just touching all the bases ann said i know weve talked before but i want to ask again what the prospects are that a leak came from inside darpa fowler frowned anythings possible but i just dont think thats the case theres just a relatively small team here running the sea arrow program most of the work is farmed out thats where i think the real risk iswith our external subcontractors of course there are people at the shipyard with knowledge and thats an obvious focus yes thats why weve already assigned a dedicated ncis team to groton it may not mean anything fowler said but i find it somewhat curious that heiland and eberson were killed shortly after the president toured the shipyard i wasnt there but i ran the security list are you suggesting someone at the white house might be involved not directly but you know the white house is a sieve although this administration is better than most it wouldnt surprise me if details about the sea arrow were released to the wrong people can you give me the security list ann said sure its in my officeif you dont already have enough on your plate at this point we have to cast a broad net id like to check the history of any recent technology thefts of a similar nature have you dealt with any foreign espionage cases not since ive been at darpa fowler said our issues are mostly lost computer disks and the like but ive been here only a year we had a few espionage cases while i was with the army research laboratory both suspected chinese and israeli spies but we never had enough to prosecute the bagmen in this case seem a bit out of character for the typical espionage operatives ann said true but you never know whos footing the bill i suppose ann said any idea of the impact to the sea arrow program im not technically savvy enough to know but apparently the program hinged on heilands supercavitation model which would totally transform the sea arrows capability now that his original research is lost the program may be set back several years no one believes they can duplicate heilands work easily without his designs i cant believe they robbed us of them in alexandria how could they have known hard to say perhaps someone was tracking you after the incident in tijuana id have to think there was a third member of the party in idaho monitoring events somehow they arranged a jump on us here at short notice he gave her a worried look maybe you should check into a hotel for a few nights just to be on the safe side no im fine she said her own safety not a concern still ill follow up with the alexandria police to make sure they patrol your town house on a regular basis he rubbed his jaw beneath the bandage id like to see those guys go down hard fowler turned into the parking lot of the darpa headquarters building in downtown arlington ann preferred to work at the darpa site rather than her ncis office across the river in anacostia having commandeered a small windowless office next to fowler with her laptop computer she could access nearly the same criminal resources while establishing relationships with the darpa team working on sea arrow as she returned to her desk she felt oddly energized aside from its importance to national security the case had become personal she shrugged off the physical and emotional drain of the past few days motivated to dig into the evidence and discover who was behind the thefts and murders her first call was to the fbi field office in san diego an agent named wyatt was managing the local investigation have you heard anything from mexico yet she asked a few things wyatt said the two deceased males both in their early thirties were not mexican nationals colombian passports were found on both bodies i can give you the names but in all likelihood theyre phony we checked with the state department in bogotá and both names came back negative with the colombian government the passports were fake yes highquality counterfeits we checked the prints on the deceased and found no matches in either the fbi or interpol databases our best guess is they were lowlevel hired muscle customs showed that they actually came into the us with three other men a few weeks ago they crossed the border at tijuana with temporary visitors visas any of them go by the name of pablo no nothing close to that how about the pickup truck and the boat the truck was recently purchased from a usedcar dealer in tijuana paid cash registered to one of the colombians at a taco stands address in rosarito beach im afraid the mexicans havent found anything on the boat any record of their activity while in the us were still looking interesting thing is five individuals were recorded crossing the border in the truck but only three returned we followed up your tip about a possible breakin at heilands company office surveillance video shows a janitor entering heilands office after hours the individual appears to match the passport photo of one of the colombians wyatt i suggest you call the spokane field office when were finished two men were just killed in bayview idaho after a breakin at heilands lake house ill wager a months salary that those are your two missing men how about a bonus if one is our janitor wyatt asked they seem to be a persistent bunch thats for sure agreed do you have anything else we had an explosives expert examine heilands boat he confirmed that a charge of lowgrade plastic explosives was embedded in the boats interior and mechanically detonated the wiring looked to have been in place for some time so heiland triggered the explosion she saidpitt had been right after allany idea why he may have been aware of the threat or maybe just sensitive to the nature of his work was it anything worth killing over it would seem so theres one more bit of mystery tied in with the event whats that the autopsy report on eberson based on the physical evidence and the position of his body at the back of the boat we believe he was not killed by the explosion his feet were tangled in fishing line ann said i assume he panicked when he couldnt get clear of the boat and ended up drowning actually the pathologist says he was dead before he hit the water was he shot no wyatt fumbled for the proper description his skin showed signs of severe burns his death was attributed to trauma related to burn damage ann had seen his gruesome blackened limbs but assumed it had to do with his bodys submersion at such depth why doesnt the pathologist think he was killed by the explosion because his surface burns were atypical of fire damageand extended beneath the skin in other words he cooked from both inside and out ann shook her head from the inside the damage is consistent with acute microwave irradiation ann fell silent trying to make sense of the report could it have anything to do with the equipment heiland was testing wyatt asked i cant imagine it was still in its case understood its got everyone here stumped too ill send you the report and we can talk again thanks wyatt and let me know if you hear any more from mexico ebersons death was an odd twist that didnt make any sense if pablos crew was going to kill him why didnt they simply shoot him and what could have caused the microwave irradiation ann beat wyatt in phoning the fbis spokane field officeand confirmed what shed already guessed the two men killed in bayview had also carried phony colombian passports they had arrived in idaho on a private chartered flight which accounted for their ability to bring in weapons the charter operator was being investigated but had no apparent connection to the colombians ann opened her laptop and began scouring national law enforcement databases searching for criminal acts in the us by colombian nationals in the national crime information centers system she assembled a list of such felonies prosecuted in the past five years aside from a few random murders and a bank robbery the major crimes were primarily drug related concentrated in miami and new york a search of the fbis guardian threat tracking system also failed to trigger any obvious links until the fbi completed dna testing on the bodies in idaho she was only chasing ghosts anyway so she turned her attention to potential internal leaks fowler had given ann detailed profiles of fifteen darpa scientists and administrators assigned to the sea arrow project she spent the next hour sifting through the reports keeping an eye out for the three ds of nonideological subversion debt drugs and divorce she made note for fowler to check up on a female physicist who was undergoing a bitter divorce as well as a lowergrade engineer who had recently acquired a new corvette but on the surface none of the employees fit the profile for a security risk got a second fowler appeared at her door walked in and placed a thick folder on her desk here are the staff reports on the darpa subcontractors working on sea arrow groton obviously has their own subs under review plus the office of naval research has a number on their end whats the damage locally eight private defense contractors not counting heiland plus three university research programs enough to keep us busy a while thanks dan can you do me one more favor sure name it can you pull the travel history of your darpa team assigned to sea arrow i want to check for any trips to the major hot spots east asia russia and the middle east no problem by the way heres the security list for the presidents shipyard tour at groton a few weeks ago he handed her a sheet which she placed to the side of her desk interested in lunch no im good she said diving into the subcontractor data thanks for the reports as she dug into the files ann soon realized there was only a peripheral connection between the other contractors and heiland most of the subcontracts focused on hull design and electronic systems with little if any interplay with heilands supercavitation system eberson had been the central conduit for all the systems heiland was developing ann stood and stretched before picking up the security list from the presidents groton tour there were only seven names three from the white house and four from the pentagon she immediately noted tom cernys name with only fowlers offthecuff remark as a basis she phoned in the names to an ncis colleague and requested an online background check while she waited to receive an email with the results she thought of the rarity of a murder like heilands the theft of industrial or defense secrets seldom crossed over the line to homicide yet heiland eberson and manny had been murdered for their work on the sea arrow while ann and pitt were nearly added victims only a handful of rogue nations would risk such provocative measures but others might if working through a proxy the colombian government certainly wasnt competing with the us in defense weaponry so clearly the thieves were working for someone else but who ann began examining other domestic espionage cases searching for a pattern ignoring terrorist and computer hacking cases she found that most spy busts involved diplomatic and policy secrets from individuals or groups serving the old antagonists of moscow beijing and havana of greater interest were a handful of cases involving military and commercial technology thefts by chinese operatives though none had the earmarks of heilands case it was clear that china more than anybody was aggressively pursuing foreign military technology she found that china had a long history of stealing and imitating technology from foreign powers primarily the russians copycat artillery systems antiaircraft missiles and even navy destroyers had long upset the kremlin brass but the russians werent the only target several items in the chinese arsenal bore strong similarities to american weapons aviation experts found a suspicious resemblance between chinas j stealth fighter jet and the american fa raptor the country had recently announced the deployment of a crowdcontrol system identical in appearance to a device developed by the us army and a new chinese helicopter that mimicked the uss apache was said to be imminent engrossed in her work ann didnt realize it was nearing six oclock until her phone rang she had covered a lot of ground but had little to show for it she answered the call with a weary voice becoming alert when she heard a familiar voice hi ann its dirk still at the salt mine yes chipping away how are you just fine say i was wondering if you could meet me for dinner tomorrow night i have something we need to discuss tomorrow yes that would be fine is it something important could be pitt said hesitating id like to know if youd go on a cruise with me ann caught several men staring at her as she swept through the dining room of the bombay club with only a slight limp dressed in a saffron linen dress that clung to her curves she resembled a runway model more than a criminal investigator she ignored the looks as she stepped through the restaurant onto an elegant patio that overlooked lafayette park she quickly spotted pitt at a corner table he was seated next to a tall attractive woman who looked vaguely familiar with a touch of unease ann forced a smile as she approached the table pitt rose and greeted her warmly no more crutches no the ankle is much better im happy to say ann id like you to meet my wife loren loren sprang to her feet and gave ann a warm hug dirks told me all about your ordeals in mexico and idaho though he apparently forgot to mention how pretty you are she added without spite whatever instinctive resentment ann may have felt toward loren melted at the unexpected compliment im afraid to say that all our troubles went for naught ann gave pitt a guilty look and described how she and fowler had been robbed of heilands research that sounds like no coincidence pitt said concern etched on his face more like blatant espionage loren said we need to get some highpowered resources involved theres already at least three fbi teams assigned to the case ann said along with darpas staff security and several ncis investigators besides me she looked at loren her eyes brightening in recognition youre the congresswoman from colorado careful youll blow her cover pitt said with a laugh i thought you looked familiar ann said i remember your efforts to pass legislation to improve benefits and leave for enlisted parents in the military youre a hero to women in the armed forces loren shook her head they were just some minor changes that should have been enacted long ago seriously though if there are any chains that i can rattle at homeland security to help your case just say the word thank you weve got the support of the vice president as well as the white house so i think the resources are in place we just need a break or two so we can find out who these people are a waiter arrived and they each ordered a curry dish for dinner with pitt tacking on a bottle of saint clair sauvignon blanc from new zealand how long have you two been married ann asked just a few years loren said with both our travel schedules it often seems were two ships passing in the night but we make it work the trick pitt said is making sure the ships collide on a regular basis loren turned to ann is there a special person in your life no im happily unattached at the moment their entrees arrived all spicy enough to mandate a second bottle of wine this shrimp curry is withering my tongue but i cant stop eating it ann said its really delicious later ann excused herself to visit the ladies room once she was out of earshot loren leaned over to pitt that girl is attracted to you can i help it if she has good taste in men he said with a grin no but if you get any ideas ill cut out your spleen with a rusty butter knife pitt laughed then gave loren a long kiss not to worry im quite attached to my spleenand prefer to keep it that way when ann returned they nibbled on sorbet for dessert then pitt pulled a silver rock from his pocket and set it on the table one lump and not two loren said its a souvenir from chile pitt said i think it may have something to do with the heiland case what exactly is it ann asked one of our numa geologists identified it as a mineral called monazite i found it aboard an abandoned freighter that was barreling toward valparaiso i heard about that ann said you diverted the freighter from crashing into a crowded cruise ship more or less pitt said the mystery is what happened to the ships crew and why did the ship end up thousands of miles off course was it hijacked it was a bulk carrier supposedly loaded with bauxite from a mine in australia by all appearances the cargo was of limited value we discovered that of the ships five holds three contained bauxite but the two aft were empty pitt picked up the rock i found this chunk of monazite by one of the empty holds you think the monazite was stolen from the ship ann asked i do why would someone steal that and not the bauxite loren asked i had the rock assayed and the results were quite interesting this particular monazite contains a high concentration of neodymium and lanthanum loren smiled sounds like a disease they are actually two of the seventeen elements known as rare earth metals several of which are in very high demand by industry of course loren said we held a congressional hearing on the limited supply of rare earth elements theyre used in a large number of hightech products including hybrid cars and wind turbines and a few key defense technologies pitt said as i recall loren said china is the dominant producer of rare earth elements in fact theres only a handful of other active mines around the world russia india australia and our own mine in california round out the bulk of global production pitt said ann shook her head i dont see what this rock has to do with the heiland case it may have absolutely nothing to do with it pitt said but there are two interesting coincidences the first is that clump of monazite in your hands the neodymium it contains happens to be a key material in the sea arrows propulsion motors how could you possibly know that ann asked my information systems manager at numa found that several rare earth elements were critical components in the propulsion system of the new zumwalt class of navy destroyer some additional digging and guesswork led us to conclude they would be even more important to the sea arrows electric motors id have to verify that but i dont doubt thats true ann said still i dont see a significant connection maybe not pitt said yet there is a second curious linkthe darpa scientist killed on the cuttlefish joe eberson ill wager that he didnt die by drowning but was killed by an acute dose of electromagnetic radiation ann dropped the rock and her jaw followed suit how could you have known that i just received a copy of his autopsy report this morning it confirms exactly that it was on account of ebersons condition his extremities were bloated and his skin was blistered and blackened the bloating isnt unusual in a drowning victim but the blackened skin was odd we found a dead sailor aboard the freighter in chile who exhibited even more extreme characteristics chilean authorities say he died from thermal damage believed to be caused by microwave irradiation the same cause ann said ebersons pathologist failed to identify a possible source of the irradiation how could they have died in that manner aside from falling asleep on a microwave antenna dish its hard to say i asked a number of my scientists and we came up with a weak yet possible theory id like to hear it theres been a number of crowdcontrol devices fielded in the past few years that use microwave beams to lightly burn the skin of people in its path our army has deployed one they call the active denial system or ads often referred to as the pain ray the systems are not meant to be lethal but weve learned that simple modifications could make them deadly could they be used at sea loren asked they are currently truckmounted so they could easily be placed on the deck of a ship the ads system has a range of up to seven hundred meters people inside a ship would be immune but anyone on deck or accessible through a window such as on the bridge would be susceptible a powerful enough design might even damage the communications systems its also possible they might simply use it against a larger vessel as cover for an armed boarding party you think something like that was used on both vessels ann asked they could have used it to stun the crew of the tasmanian star to steal its monazite pitt said and against the cuttlefish to kill heiland manny and eberson in order to steal the sea arrow test model they would have obtained the model directly from the cuttlefish if heiland hadnt blown up the boat ann said any clue to the attacking vessel were searching but havent found anything yet then we dont seem to be any closer to identifying who these people are pitt gave her a sly look on the contrary i intend to find out within the week but you have no idea where to find them loren said actually pitt said i intend to let them find me just like baiting a trap with cheese to lure the mouse only our cheese is a rock called monazite he pulled a world map out of his coat pocket and spread it on the table hiram yaeger and i were intrigued by the tasmanian stars hijacking so we conducted a search of known shipwrecks and vessel disappearances over the last three years insurance records show that more than a dozen commercial vessels sank either with all hands or without a trace of those no less than ten were carrying either rare earth elements or related ore he pointed to the map seven of the ships were lost in the vicinity of south africa while the remaining vessels disappeared in the eastern pacific ann could see small shipwreck symbols had been marked on the map a few near a small atoll marked clipperton island why havent the insurance companies investigated this many of the ships were aged freighters independently owned and probably underinsured through multiple carriers i can only guess but its likely no single insurer has taken a large enough hit to detect the pattern why would someone go to the trouble of sinking or hijacking these ships loren said if they can buy the minerals on the open market pitt shrugged the global supply is very tight perhaps someone is trying to control the reserves and manipulate the market so what is your plan to identify these people ann asked pitt pointed to the clump of monazite that bit of ore came from a mine in western australia called mount weld the mine is being closed temporarily so they can expand production we discovered that their last scheduled export shipment was loaded on an ore carrier last week bound for long beach you think shes going to be hijacked loren asked shes sailing on the same route where two other ships disappeared and the tasmanian star was attacked its the last scheduled shipment of rare earth from australia for at least six months im willing to roll the dice and say shes a pretty good target so thats the cruise you invited me on ann said with a twinkle in her eye pitt nodded the freighter is owned by a shipping line whose ceo happens to be friends with vice president sandecker hes made arrangements for us and a coast guard swat team to rendezvous with the ship south of hawaii is that enough protection lorens concern for her husband was evident in her violet eyes were not going up against a warship plus ill be in constant communications with rudi at headquarters if we need any extra muscle he turned to ann well have to leave for hawaii in two days are you in ann picked up the rock and turned it around id love to but im in the heart of the investigation and i would hate to break things off now plus i wouldnt be much help aboard ship she looked in pitts eyes but i tell you what if youre right then loren and i will be waiting for you at the dock in long beach pitt smiled at the two attractive women and raised his wineglass that would be a sight any lonely sailor would welcome viewed from the air the dense jungle spread across the horizon like a lumpy green carpet only the occasional wisp of smoke or a quick glimpse of a shack in a clearing gave any sign that human life existed beneath the foliage though the helicopter had departed panama citys tocumen international airport just a few minutes earlier the roar of its turbine was already grating on pablos nerves he gazed ahead and spotted the sprawling green waters of gatun lake a massive body of water formed during the construction of the panama canal their destination was close the pilot banked the chopper and followed the eastern shore of the lake passing several large islands known for their assortment of primates a narrow peninsula rose up ahead and he guided the helicopter back over the jungle gradually reducing speed as he reached the center of the landmass the pilot put the craft into a hover pablo gazed at the treetops belowand noticed them move the trees werent swaying from the choppers rotor wash but instead began to spread apart a seam appeared in the foliage and it grew into a large square opening with a helicopter landing pad marked with lights and a reflective white circle the pilot centered the helicopter and gently dropped onto the pad the moment the pilot cut the power pablo tore off his headphones and climbed out once beyond reach of the twirling rotor he glanced up as the artificially landscaped roof closed overhead the hydraulically powered cover was a standalone structure built on pilings in a jungle clearing two armed men in fatigues operated the controls from a panel box at the side as the sky disappeared a golf cart emerged from the surrounding jungle and pulled to a stop in front of pablo el jefe awaits the driver said with the hint of a swedish accent out of place in the panamanian jungle he was a husky blond man with pale skin and ice blue eyes he wore a nondescript army officers uniform and a holstered beretta the two men stared at each other with a mix of respect and disdain both employed as hired muscle they observed a cold formal truce good day to you too johansson pablo said and yes i had a very enjoyable flight thank you johansson stomped on the accelerator as pablo climbed into the golf cart not waiting until he was fully seated the two men rode in silence as johansson followed a paved path through the jungle they entered a shaded clearing dotted with more armed men in fatigues to their right sat a pyramidshaped pile of gray rocks a group of ragged men wearing dirty sweatstained clothes were shoveling the rocks into small carts and pushing them down a carved path the golf cart bounded through another stretch of dense jungle then stopped in front of a large windowless concrete structure its flat reinforced roof landscaped with vegetation disguised it from the air even more realistically than the landing pad only a row of palm trees on either side of the entrance offered the structure any semblance of warmth pablo jumped out of the cart thanks for the lift dont bother to keep the motor running i wouldnt plan for a long visit if i were you johansson said then drove away as pablo climbed a short flight of steps to the doorway a breeze from the lake helped stir the muggy air a guard at the threshold opened the door and escorted him inside in marked contrast to the plain walls outside the buildings interior was an exercise in opulence built as a personal residence it was decorated in bright tropical colors illuminated by a surplus of overhead lighting as pablo was led down a whitemarbled corridor he passed a sunken living room decorated with modern art on one side and an indoor glassenclosed lap pool on the other the rear of the house ran along the rim of a low hillside that jutted above the water floortoceiling windows showcased an expansive section of gatun lake pablo was led to a large open office that overlooked the rocky shoreline below in the distance a containership could be seen heading south through the canal on its way to the pacific he stood in the doorway a moment until he gained the attention of the man seated behind an antique mahogany desk edward bolcke peered over a pair of reading glasses and nodded for pablo to enter beginning with his conservative suit and tie every detail of bolckes appearance testified to his exacting nature his silver hair was perfectly coiffed his fingernails precisely trimmed and his shoes highly polished his office was almost spartan in décor his desktop devoid of clutter bolcke took off his glasses leaned back in his chair crossed his arms and stared at pablo through hawklike brown eyes pablo took a seat across the desk and waited for his employer to speak so what went wrong in tijuana bolcke asked the words tinged with a german accent you know that heiland destroyed his own boat during our initial operation pablo said this of course upset our planned extraction before we could get an appropriate recovery vessel there the americans arrived and raised the test model they were from their civilian group numa though so we had no trouble getting the device from them at sea but two of their men managed to follow us to shore in mexico and there was also a female investigator involved yes so i hear surprised at bolckes comment pablo cleared his throat there was a traffic incident in the streets of tijuana as we were making our way to the airport the device was destroyed and juan was killed in the collision i lost my man eduardo as we made our way out of the situation quite the blown opportunity bolcke said his eyes narrowing at least there appear to be no repercussions all the men i work with are trained mercenaries from colombia with manufactured identities and no criminal records there will be no connection to you a good thing as the team you sent to idaho was also killed pablo stiffened in his chair alteban and rivera are dead yes they were killed in a traffic incident after departing heilands cabin bolcke said his expression stern the female investigator one ann bennett and the director of numa whom you apparently met in tijuana were responsible fortunately i was able to arrange the recovery of the research plans in washington bolcke reached into a desk drawer retrieved a thick envelope and slid it across the desk you shall enjoy a fine payday my friend your own wages plus those of your four dead comrades i cannot accept this pablo said as he reached over and grabbed the envelope no i pay for the job not the results in light of the events however i have decided to rescind the bonus i had intended to pay for your good work at the mountain pass mine pablo nodded grateful to get his hands on the envelope you have always been generous i will not be so generous should there be any more failings i presume you are prepared for the next assignment he crossed his hands on the desk as he gave pablo a fixed stare pablo avoided the gaze instead looking at bolckes hands thats what gave the man away the hands they were thick gnarled and blemished by the sun they werent the hands of a man who had spent his life in corporate boardrooms as bolcke appeared to be they were the hands of a man who had spent a lifetime digging rocks born and raised in austria edward bolcke had spent his youth scouring the alps for gold and rare minerals it was his means of escape after his mother had run away with an american gi leaving him in the care of an alcoholic father prone to violence the young bolckes mountain hikes fostered a love of geology which led to a degree in mineral resources engineering from austrias university of leoben he took a job at a copper mine in poland and before long was hopscotching the globe working tin mines in malaysia gold mines in indonesia and silver mines in south america with an uncanny ability to locate the richest ore concentrations he boosted recovery rates and profits everywhere he went but in colombia life threw him a twisted bone bolcke took an ownership interest in a small silver operation in the tolima district his astute analysis of the claim revealed a more valuable deposit of platinum alongside his property he secured the rights and struck a major deposit making him wealthy in a matter of months while celebrating his good fortune in bogotá he met the vivacious daughter of a brazilian industrialist and soon married he led a storybook life for several years expanding his riches from the mineuntil one day he returned to his home in bogotá to find his wife in bed with an american consulate worker with a fury he never knew he possessed he shattered the mans skull with a rock hammer his wife came next her throat crushed by his thick burly hands a colombian jury well greased by his defense attorneys acquitted him on the grounds of temporary insanity he walked away a free man he was free physically but not psychologically the event reopened childhood scars of abandonment while slashing new wounds a bloodthirsty anger flooded his souland refused to recede he sought revenge turning to the easiest victims he could find helpless young women cruising the slums of bogotá at night he would hire young prostitutes then beat them unmercifully to vent his rage nearly gunned down one night by a watchful pimp he finally abandoned that outlet for his rage and left colombia selling his remaining interest in the mine bolcke had invested in an underperforming gold mine in panama and he relocated there years earlier he had studied the mines operations and knew it had been mismanaged a privately held american firm with other holdings owned it and to take control he was forced to purchase the entire company but to enable the deal he had to forfeit a portion of the mines equity to panamas corrupt government headed at the time by manuel noriega when the us military ousted noriega the succeeding government laid claim to the mine and harassed bolcke into amassing a mountain of legal bills before he reacquired ownership at a considerable cost he blamed the americans for his losses inflaming an already deepseated hatred against the country as part of the mining conglomerate he found himself ironically owning a small enterprise in america a trucking firm several commercial freighters and a small security business what began as a minor annoyance turned into a major opportunity for revenge every night the vision of his wife with the american officer haunted his dreams replaying his childhood abandonment and every morning he woke enraged the perpetrators though both long dead remained targets of wrath and by association their country of origin the anger never left him but rather than venting it through random violence he turned down a new path of vengeance using the skills and knowledge from a lifetime of mining he initiated his own economic war of retribution bolckes joyless dark eyes set in a lean hardened face probed his visitor while his hands flattened on the desk pablo spoke uneasily i am not eager to return to america right away my understanding was that i would remain in panama city for several weeks before the next phase we had an outdated delivery schedule and now the time line has been moved up the shipment is being made in four days youll need to return at once pablo didnt balk the excolombian special forces commando never refused an order hed worked for the old austrian for more than a dozen years since first being hired to help quell a labor unrest at the mine his unwavering loyalty had been well rewarded over the years particularly as his boss drifted further over the line i will need to assemble a new support team pablo said there is no time you will be assisted by two american contractors outside help cannot be trusted we will have to take that chance bolcke snapped you lost your entire team i can give you some of johanssons men but they are untrained in your line of work my washington representative assures me these contractors are reliable and besides he said looking pablo in the eye they accomplished what your team could not they recovered the supercavitation data bolcke slid pablo a smaller envelope the phone number of our man in washington contact him when you get in and he will arrange a meeting with the contractors all other arrangements are in place so you simply need to make the acquisition and delivery it will be done the company jet will be standing by tomorrow to take you into the country any questions this female investigator and the people from numaare they a problem the woman is of no concern bolcke sat back in his chair and further contemplated the question i dont know about the numa personnel perhaps they are worth monitoring he gazed back at pablo i will take care of it proceed with the plan i will be in beijing waiting for your confirmation his eyes grew darker as he leaned forward i have been working toward this moment for many years everything is in place do not fail me pablo pablo puffed out his chest do not worry jefe it will be like taking sweets from a baby ann hit the office running at seven in the morning inspired to investigate pitts potential link with the ship hijacking her first stop was joe ebersons replacement as the darpa director of sea platforms technology dr roald oswald she had met the scientist a few days earlier and wasnt surprised to find him already at his desk working on a status report she poked her head through the doorway may i intrude on your morning silence of course miss bennett i could use a diversion from the depressing state of our new submarines delivery schedule please call me ann will there be a launch without the supercavitation device thats our dilemma the collective loss of eberson and heiland has put us back monthsif not years the vessels capabilities are cut to the bone without the device there will still be merit in testing the propulsion system i suppose if we can ever complete the final assembly whats holding you up critical material delays im told would any of those materials include rare earth elements oswald took a draw from his coffee and probed ann with his pale blue eyes i dont have enough information here to answer that but yes certain rare earth elements play a significant part in the sea arrows designespecially in the propulsion system and some of the sonar and electronic systems why do you ask im exploring a possible link between dr heilands death and a hijacked shipment of monazite ore containing high concentrations of neodymium and lanthanum how important are those elements to the sea arrow very our propulsion system relies upon a pair of highly advanced electric motors which in turn power two external jet pumps as well as the rest of the vessels operating systems both components contain rare earth elements but especially the motors oswald took another sip of coffee they utilize permanent highintensity magnets to achieve a multigenerational leap in efficiency and output these magnets are produced under exacting standards at the ames national laboratory and they contain a mixture of several rare earths most certainly including neodymium he hesitated a moment we believe that heilands supercavitation system relies on some rare earth components as well i suspect you may be onto something why do you say that the sea arrows motors have yet to be installed the first motor was just completed at the naval research lab at chesapeake bay and is ready for shipment to groton the second has been delayed due to a disruption in the materials supply chain i havent caught up with all the information but i understand that a shortage of rare earth elements is holding us up could you find out exactly which materials are involved ill make some calls and let you know he sat back in his chair with a look of introspection joe eberson was a friend of mine we used to go fishing in canada every summer he was a good man make sure you find his killers ann nodded solemnly i intend to she had been back at her desk for only a few minutes when oswald called with an alphabet soup list of elements whose short supplies were delaying the sea arrow gadolinium praseodymium samarium and dysprosium at the top of the list was neodymium the very element in pitts monazite sample from chile a quick online search revealed the market prices for those elements had recently skyrocketed commodity analysts cited two factors for the increase one was a fire that had devastated the facilities at mountain pass california the site of the only active rare earth mine in the us the second was something ann already knew an announcement by the owners of australias mount weld mine that they would temporarily cease production to modernize and expand the mine as she digested all this ann picked up the sheet fowler had left on her desk it was the file of biographies for all the nonmilitary personnel who had toured the sea arrow skipping those who worked at darpa and onr she studied the remaining names her eyes widened when she scanned the bio of white house aide tom cerny she reviewed it a second time jotted down some notes and printed the entire file fowler appeared at the door and stepped into her office with a donut and coffee youre rustling the leaves early where is the hunt taking you today would you believe the south pacific she told him of pitts suspicions about the ore carrier in chile and his plans to protect the ship inbound from australia its carrying rare earth elements yes i think he said she was called the adelaide sailing from perth youre not going to join him are you i considered it but hes leaving tomorrow its probably a wildgoose chase and frankly i feel like im making some progress here she slid the bio of tom cerny across the desk to him im not prepared to pronounce a leak in the white house but look at cernys background fowler read aloud a few of cernys biographical entries exgreen beret officer served as military adviser in taiwan later panama and colombia left army for a stint at raytheon as a program manager for directed energy weapons programs later moved to capitol hill as a defense specialist served on the board of directors of three defense contractors before joining the white house married to the former jun lu yi a taiwanese national operates a child education charity in bogotá he set the paper down interesting range of experiences he seems to have been in the vicinity of a few defense systems that the chinese have duplicated ann said the colombia bit certainly caught my eye worth looking into i suspect you could make some discreet inquiries without raising any red flags i agree im not ready to throw away my career by barging into the white house but ill press the fringes a bit more how are things going with your internal reviews he shook his head ive doublechecked every darpa employee working on the program to be honest i havent found a single nugget of suspicious behavior ill pass the files to you when i finish the interviews thanks but ill trust your review where are you headed next i figured on making site visits to our three largest subcontractors maybe you should join me it would make the work go faster im thinking of looking at a few of the smaller subcontractors these three caught my eye too far down the food chain fowler said theyd likely have only limited access to anything classified no harm in a little probing ann said you know the saying about the blind pig finding the acorn fowler smiled suit yourself ill be around the rest of the day if you come up with any nuts to share late in the day she got her next break after more followups with the fbi she went back to her list of subcontractors the first two companies were publicly traded so she readily obtained background information on their businesses but the third firm was privately held and required more digging she found an article about it in an engineering periodical and rushed into fowlers office dan take a look at this one of the subcontractors a firm called securetek provides secure data lines for engineers in remote locations to share their work without having their own security clearance they could gain access to private engineering work thats probably harder to pull off than you think more interesting is this securetek is part of a small conglomerate based in panama that also owns a transportation company in the us and a gold mine in panama okay but i dont see where that leads the company holds a minority interest in hobart mining hobart owns a mine in australia called mount weld all right so theyve expanded their mining operations mount weld is one of the largest producers of rare earth elements outside of china dr oswald told me this morning how vital rare earth elements are in the sea arrows developmentand how shortages have delayed the program there could be a connection seems a bit tenuous fowler said shaking his head whats the motivation the mine owner should be happy were buying what he produces not cutting off one of his best customers i think youre letting dirk pitt lead you astray maybe youre right she said it seems like were grasping at straws that happens maybe things will look different in the morning i find exercise helps me in solving problems every morning i take a run along the potomac and find its a great way to relax my mind you should try it maybe i will just do me one favor will you she said add securetek to the list of contractors on your site visits that ill be happy to do he said ann took his advice and stopped at a health club on the way home and ran a few miles on a treadmill before grabbing a chicken salad to go at a café she thought of pitt on the way home and called him the second she entered her town house there was no reply so she left a lengthy message about her findings and wished him luck on his voyage as she hung up a deep voice grumbled from the hallway i hope you remembered to say goodbye ann nearly jumped out of her shoes she wheeled around to see two large black men emerge from her darkened bedroom she recognized the first man and began to tremble clarence smiled coldly as he walked into the room and leveled a at her head zhou xing had the face of a peasant his eyes were set close together his chin was almost nonexistent and his nose listed to starboard from a longago fracture a pair of jug ears and a paupers haircut completed the rural simpleton appearance it was a countenance perfectly suited to the undercover intelligence agent aside from allowing zhou to fit into almost any field situation it habitually caused his superiors in the chinese ministry of state security to underestimate his guile and ability at the moment he was counting on the same effect for a less sophisticated crowd wearing the worn and dusty clothes of an unskilled laborer he looked like most of the inhabitants of bayan obo a company town in inner mongolia that was itself worn and dusty zhou crossed a paved street bustling with trucks and buses and made his way to a small drinking establishment even from the street he could hear the voices inside he took a deep breath then pulled open a wooden door emblazoned with a faded red boar the scent of cheap tobacco and stale beer filled zhous nostrils as he stepped through the door and scanned the confines with a practiced eye a dozen tables filled the narrow room occupied by a coarse and rugged assortment of miners off duty from the towns openpit mine a fat oneeyed barkeep poured shots behind an elevated platform lined with harddrinking locals the bars only decoration was its namesake a stuffed and mounted boars head that was missing several tufts of fur zhou ordered a baijiu a grain alcohol that was the locals favorite and slid onto a corner chair to study the clientele cloistered in groups of two or three most were well on their way to numbing themselves from the days labor he scanned from face to hardened face searching for a suitable target he found one a few tables away a brash loudmouthed young man talking the ears off his silent towering partner zhou waited until the talker had nearly drained his shot glass before approaching the table pretending to stagger he flung an elbow against the talkers glass sending it flying hey my drink a thousand pardons my friend zhou said slurring his words please come to the bar with me and i shall purchase you another the young miner realizing he had just scored a free round rose quickly if unsteadily to his feet yes another drink with a full ceramic bottle of baijiu in hand zhou was welcomed back to the table i am wen the man said and my quiet friend here is yao i am tsen zhou replied you both work at the mine of course wen flexed his biceps we didnt build this strength by plucking chickens what is your job at the mine why we are the crushers wen said with a laugh we feed the mined ore into the primary rockcrushers theyre as big as a house and can mash a boulder the size of a dog down to this he balled his fist in front of zhou i come from baotou zhou said and am in need of work are there any jobs available at the mine wen reached over and squeezed zhous arm a man like you you are too scrawny to work in the mines he laughed spraying a shower of saliva across the table then noting a sad look on zhous face he felt a touch of pity men get injured so they occasionally bring on replacements but there will probably be a long line ahead of you i understand zhou said more baijiu he didnt wait for an answer and refilled their glasses the silent miner yao peered at him through listless eyes and nodded wen raised his glass and downed a shot tell me zhou said as he sipped at his drink i hear there is a black market mining operation at bayan obo yao tensed and looked at zhou suspiciously no it all comes from the same place wen wiped his mouth with a sleeve it is not safe to speak of yao said breaking his silence with an earthy bellow wen shrugged it all takes place beyond us what do you mean zhou asked the blasting the digging the crushing that is all performed by the state operation that pays yao and me he said its only after the crushing that other hands start dipping into the pot what hands are those yao slammed his glass down on the table you ask a lot of questions tsen zhou bowed slightly to yao im just trying to find myself a job yaos just touchy because his cousin drives a truck for the operation how do they operate i guess theyre paying off some of the mines truck drivers wen said at night some of the trucks that haul the raw diggings to the crusher pick up a load of crushed ore and deposit it at a remote part of the mine then jiang and his private fleet of trucks come in and haul it away hey there he is now wen waved over a squat gritfaced man who had just stepped into the bar the man moved with a determined swagger jiang i was just telling my friend how you haul hot rocks from the mine jiang flung an open hand against the side of wens head nearly knocking him out of his chair you need to quit your babbling wen or youll lose your tongue youre worse than an old woman he sized zhou up then regarded his cousin yao the big man faintly shook his head jiang eased around the table and stood close to zhou he suddenly reached down grabbed zhous collar and jerked the agent to his feet zhou kept his arms at his sides and smiled harmlessly who are you jiang said his face millimeters from zhous my name is tsen i am a farmer from baotou now you tell me your name jiangs eyes flared at his boldness listen to me farmer he held zhous collar tightly if you ever want to tread the soil of bayan obo again then i suggest that you pretend you never came here you saw no one and talked to no one do you understand jiangs breath reeked of smoke and garlic but zhou never flinched with a pleasant grin he nodded at jiang of course but if i was never here then i didnt spend eighty yuan on drinks with your friends he held out an open palm as if waiting for reimbursement jiangs face turned red dont ever enter this bar again now get out he freed his grip on zhous collar so he could punctuate the threat with his fist but he was too close to throw a punch and he took a step back zhou anticipated the move and scissored his foot behind jiangs catching the back of the truck drivers ankle jiang stumbled but still unleashed a hard right as he fell back zhou moved left absorbing the punch to his shoulder then countered by shoving jiangs torso jiang lost his footing and fell backward out of control zhou kept a grip on him driving him toward the table where jiangs head smashed against the lip he collapsed to the floor like a felled redwood knocked out cold at the sight of his cousins takedown yao leaped up and tried to grab zhou in a bear hug the smaller and more sober zhou easily spun away then launched a sharp kick to yaos knee the big man buckled allowing zhou to deliver several lightning strikes to the head a final blow struck his throat yao turned and fell to his knees clutching his throat while overcome by a false sense of suffocation the bar fell silent and all eyes turned to zhou drawing attention to himself was foolish but there were times he couldnt help himself no fighting the bartender shouted but he was too busy pouring drinks to bother throwing out any of the culprits zhou nodded at him then casually picked up his glass of baijiu from the table and took a swig the other patrons returned to their drinks and jokes ignoring the two men on the floor wen had watched the brief fight in a stupor not moving from his chair you have quick hands for a farmer he stuttered lots of hoeing zhou swung his hands up and down what do you say our friend jiang buys us a drink he asked sure wen slurred zhou reached into the unconscious mans pocket and took out his wallet finding his resident identity card he memorized jiangs full name and address he replaced the wallet but not before retrieving a twentyyuan banknote which he handed to wen you drink for me zhou said it is late and i must go yes my friend tsen if you say so wen raised himself in his chair with some difficulty see you at the mine zhou said the mine wen asked he looked up in puzzlement but the little farmer from baotou was already gone jiang xianto the truck driver crept out of his apartment complex at half past seven the next morning a bandage was plastered across his forehead and he walked with rigid strides to try to minimize the spasms that shot through his skull with each step had he been less preoccupied he might have seen his assailant from the red boar seated in a chinesebuilt toyota parked across the street reading a peoples daily zhou smiled to himself as he watched jiang hobble down the street he had felt no joy in flooring yao the night before but he felt no empathy toward jiang he had recognized jiangs type instantly a hotheaded loser who tormented weaker men to make himself feel better the black market truck driver walked down the street to a crowded bus stop true to form jiang bullied his way to the front of the line then took one of the few remaining seats when the bus arrived zhou started his car and pulled into traffic keeping the bus a few car lengths ahead by the time the bus stopped in front of a dilapidated apartment building at the southern edge of town most of the passengers had departed zhou wheeled his car around a corner parked behind a street vendor and watched jiang step off the bus pulling a brimmed hat low over his eyes zhou locked his car and followed on foot jiang walked a little way down a side street then turned into a trashstrewn alley a morning breeze chilled the air and jiang zipped up his jacket as he reached a large fenced lot topped with rusty barbed wire he stepped through a slit in the fence and walked past stacks of empty pallets that towered over the dusty lot at the rear of the property beneath a corrugated tin awning stood five large canvascovered trucks and a battered pickup several roughlooking men stood around the trucks drinking hot tea from paper cups jiang one of the men said did your wife brush your hair with a wok this morning ill brush yours with a tire iron jiang said wheres xao a tall man wearing a black peacoat stepped from between two of the trucks jiang there you are late again i see keep this up and youll be back digging ditches he turned to the other men okay everyone were ready to move the men gathered around him as he pulled a folded paper from his pocket well be dropping the load at dock xao said ill take the lead truck so follow me as well be entering through an auxiliary gate were expected to arrive at eight oclock so lets not have any delays where will we stop for fuel asked a man with a threadbare wool cap the usual truck stop in changping xao looked about for other questions then nodded toward the trucks okay lets get moving xao jiang and three other men drifted to the large trucks and the remaining men piled into the pickup jiangs truck was at the end of the line he climbed in and started the engine which kicked to life with a cloud of black smoke adjusting the heater he waited for the other trucks to exit the lot ahead of him when the truck next to him pulled ahead he shifted into gear and lurched forward catching sight of a dark blur in the sideview mirror the trucks drove through an open gate attended by a burly bald man who carried a russian makarov pistol under his coat when jiang got to the gate he mashed on the trucks brakes check the back he said reaching out the window and slapping the side door to catch the guards attention the guard nodded and stepped to the rear of the truck as he peered over the tailgate he was greeted by zhous boot slamming into his jaw the blow sent him sprawling yet he yanked out the makarov even as he fell he raised the pistol and aimed it toward the truck but zhou was already on him the agent kicked the pistol aside then dove forward and thrust his elbow into the guards jaw the boneonbone collision emitted a muted crack and the guard fell limp zhou popped to his feet and spun around jiang was already there lunging at him with a knife he carried on his belt zhou saw the glint as the blade thrust toward his chest he tried twisting away but the tip caught his sleeve and he felt it slice across his right bicep he ignored the cut and hurled a left cross into jiangs temple jiang let out a curse realizing he was battling the man who had crushed his head the night before zhou gave him no time to contemplate that the makarov was too far away to retrieve so he did the unexpected and pressed the attack he followed his punch with a roundhouse kick that struck jiang in the thigh it was designed less to punish than to incite a response and it succeeded jiang pulled back the knife and recklessly thrust toward his opponents stomach zhou was ready he threw his left hand on jiangs wrist easily shoving the parry aside using jiangs momentum he pulled and twisted the knifewielding wrist propelling jiang forward zhou continued the spinning motion driving his opposite shoulder against jiangs arm with his full weight jiangs arm felt like it was being yanked from its socket and he stumbled forward in agony the knife dropped free and he fell to the ground in the blink of an eye the knife was in zhous hand driving toward jiangs head zhou wanted to kill the man and could have done so easily but he resisted the impulse jiang would suffer more by rotting in a jail cell he reversed the blade striking jiang below the ear with the butt of the knife jiangs world turned black as the blow to his carotid artery cut the flow of blood to his brain zhou stood over him catching his breath a phone call to the peoples armed police would ensure the bully an unpleasant welcome when he awoke but first zhou had to catch the caravan the trucks had disappeared down the street zhou found the makarov and stuffed it in his pocket then he flipped jiang on his stomach and stripped off his jacket with the mans knife he sliced off a strip of jiangs shirt for a bandage zhous right arm was wet and sticky but the bleeding had already stopped hed have to mend himself on the fly zhou jumped into the truck and gunned the motor spraying the two prone men with a blanket of dust as he rumbled out of the lot toward bayan obos main highway the mine was north of town so he turned that direction and mashed the accelerator cutting through traffic and passing wildly he raised a symphony of honking horns and angry shouts the traffic lessened as he neared the citys northern limits and the road began climbing through dry scrub hills cresting a ridge he spotted the caravan a mile ahead and he soon closed ranks with the last truck with zhou tailing the crowded pickup the line of cargo trucks drove past the main entrance to the bayan obo mine then turned onto a rutted dirt road two miles beyond that circling back to the south they crossed a downed section of fence and entered the mine site a pair of massive open pits appeared ahead the trucks skirted them and approached the main operational area the pickup veered away leading the cargo trucks to a firedamaged warehouse that looked abandoned they pulled to a stop in back of the building where a massive mound of crushed ore was piled high the theft operation was simple on certain night shifts every third dump truck transporting crushed ore to the extraction plant would get lost along the way and dump its load behind the old warehouse all it took was a few large bribes to select drivers and administrators who adjusted the mines production records and the ore was there for the taking every few days the truck convoy would haul it away to market the men from the pickup opened a back door to the warehouse where a portable conveyor was stored they rolled it to the mound of ore and connected a portable generator zhou watched as the lead cargo truck backed up until the end of the conveyor poked over the truck bed the work crew began shoveling the ore onto the belt which carried it into the truck it took less than fifteen minutes to fill the bed then the next vehicle backed in zhou wiped his arm and rewrapped the makeshift bandage around the knife wound feeling lightheaded from the loss of blood he replenished himself with some rice balls he found in a paper sack on the seat he swapped jackets with the one hed taken from jiang and raised the collar breathing heavily onto his side window he fogged up the glass so the others couldnt see him while he waited his turn when the fourth truck pulled clear xao waved him over and guided him to the conveyor zhou kept his hands high on the steering wheel to obscure his face as xao walked in front of the hood and waved him backward the ore spilled into the truck bed with the roar of an avalanche the minutes trickled by as zhou held his breath fearful someone would try to speak with him finally the rumbling ceased and the conveyor fell silent zhou looked in the sideview mirror and saw the crew drag the conveyor back to the warehouse xao rapped his knuckles on the fender then continued to his own vehicle the convoy leader climbed into the first truck stuck his arm out the window and pointed ahead the rest of the trucks started their engines and followed xao the heavily loaded trucks moved slowly down the rough road until they reached the main highway then they rolled south through the dusty town that was built by the mining operation leaving behind that small bastion of civilization they drove across the same barren steppes of inner mongolia that genghis khan had conquered eight centuries earlier zhou figured they would offload their cargo at the nearest railroad depot when they reached the populous city of baotou several hours later and turned east he knew otherwise the convoy rolled onto the busy jingzhang expressway which ran to beijing outside of the capital city they paused at a truck stop in the suburb of changping as dusk was settling a light wind had picked up blowing swirls of sand from the gobi desert zhou wrapped his face with a scarf he found in jiangs coat pocket and stretched his legs away from the others while the trucks were refueled the trucks moved off slowly fighting their way through the thickening city traffic they looped around the west side of beijing to avoid the worst of the congestion and continued southeast it took the better part of two hours before they reached the port city of tianjin xao led the trucks through a maze of streets to the center of the large commercial docks they reached an old dockside warehouse and pulled down a side alley two men appeared from the shadows and accepted a sack filled with yuan that xao passed out the window a gate opened at the end of the alley and the trucks rumbled through entering a cavernous warehouse that opened to a dock on the far side the trucks drove through the building and stopped beside a moderatesized freighter whose lights illuminated the pier a large conveyor system stretched from the dock to an open hold on the ship and xao backed his truck to the end of it a work crew appeared with shovels and began emptying the trucks load of ore as zhou watched from the end of the line he realized hed seen all he needed he slipped out the passenger door and crept toward the back of the truck a deck officer from the freighter who was standing on the dock checking the ships lines glanced over at zhou playing the part of a tired driver zhou stretched his arms and yawned as he stepped toward the officer good evening he said with a slight bow a fine ship you have here the graz is old and tired but she still plows through the sea like a hefty ox where are you headed we do a cargo swap in shanghai then were off to singapore he looked at zhou closely under the lights noticing a damp streak of red on the sleeve of his jacket are you okay zhou glanced at the blood and grinned its transmission fluid i spilled it adding some to the truck zhou saw xaos truck was finished unloading and the next truck in line was moving to take its place he nodded at the officer and smiled have a safe voyage he said turning his back on the loading operations and walking away the officer looked at him oddly what about your truck zhou ignored the query sauntering away from the dock until he vanished into the night the sea arrows propulsion motor looked like a stretch limousine driven through an oversized tire the limousine part in fact was a rectangular induction housing that drew in water and expelled it through a trio of gimbaled exhaust outlets in the back just forward of it at the motors midpoint a donutshaped nacelle contained the sophisticated jet pump that could push the submarine to high speeds the entire motor was coated in a slippery black substance which deflected water and gave the entire device a cold futuristic appearance high overhead lights shined starkly on the prototype propulsion motor as a crane lifted it from its floor blocks and placed it on a large flatbed trailer an army of workmen secured it with steel cables and covered it with canvas tarps a semitruck operated by a company that specialized in hauling secure freight was backed in and hitched to the trailer it was half past six in the morning when the truck pulled out of the naval research laboratorys facility at chesapeake beach maryland as it drove inland from the bay the surrounding woods and fields were damp with morning dew while a leaden sky obscured the sunrise whats our eta to groton the codriver asked suppressing a yawn the trucks driver glanced at his watch the gps says seven hours probably longer if we dont beat the worst of the beltway traffic in the lightly populated region of southern maryland the earlymorning traffic leading toward washington was almost nonexistent as they rounded a sweeping curve the two men noticed a wisp of black smoke rising ahead when it became apparent that the smoke originated from the road the driver downshifted is that a car on fire his codriver asked i think so looks like some old clunker it was in fact a twentyyearold toyota camry that had been severely wrecked at some point in its life now it sat in the middle of the road on four bald tires flames sprouting from beneath its crumpled hood the truck driver eased the flatbed to a stop a few yards away and searched the road for victims a white van was pulled off the road a short distance ahead but there were no signs of life around it or the burning car we better call this in the driver said as his partner reached behind the seat for a fire extinguisher a crash jarred them out of their seats as the head of a sledgehammer burst through the passengerside window a gloved hand thrust through the shattered glass and dropped a smoking canister of tear gas in the cab in an instant the trucks interior was filled with an acrid white smoke that made the men gag their eyes burned as if hot lava had been poured under their lids and they groped for the door handles to escape the agony the driver made it out first leaping from the cab onto the roadway a man wearing a ski mask zapped him with a stun gun sending him to the ground convulsing on the other side of the truck the codriver had managed to pull out his gun as he exited the cab but with his eyes clenched shut from the gas he failed to see the second assailant strike him with another stun gun a third man wearing a gas mask climbed into the cab and hurled the stillsmoking canister out into an adjacent field he slid behind the wheel and jabbed a knife into the cabs headliner he pulled away the fabric until spotting a wire which he deftly sliced disabling the roofmounted gps transmitter that allowed the shipping company to track the vehicle jamming the truck into gear he eased it forward until its broad chrome bumper kissed the burning car then he floored the accelerator while nudging the steering wheel to the right the torquestrong truck brushed the toyota aside like an insect and flipped it into a ditch straightening back onto the small road the new driver shifted gears and lowered his side window within seconds the last remnants of gas had been flushed out pablo pulled off the uncomfortable gas mask and tossed it on the seat beside him he glanced at his watch and smiled in just two minutes he had taken one of americas most secret technologies he pulled out a cell phone dialed a long string of numbers and smiled thinking about his payoff to come pablo drove the long flatbed another mile before maneuvering it off the highway and onto a small dirt road the narrow rutted track crossed a large pasture dotted with sleepyeyed cows a half mile in the road passed a large pond then ended at an abandoned farm just beyond the charred remnants of the farmhouse were still visible scorched by a fire decades earlier nearby a large weathered barn leaned to one side as if the next noreaster would send it tumbling pablo drove to the barn and guided the truck into an opening at one end of it inside he found a high stack of freshly cut bales of hay guarded by a mini forklift at the opposite end of the barn stood another semitruck cab he pulled the flatbed alongside the bales parked the truck and climbed out to examine the object under the tarps a few minutes later the white panel van pulled in and two large black men jumped out you take care of the drivers pablo asked the first man nodded clarence cuffed them together around a big oak off the highway some farmer will find them in a day or two good now lets get to work im on a tight schedule the two hired thugs pulled away the tarps covering the sea arrows motor then they donned heavy gloves and went to work on the bales of hay clarence started up the forklift and using an attached device called a bale squeeze he began hoisting blocks of multiple bales onto the flatbed the second man stood on the bed guiding the bales into place around the motor meanwhile pablo unhitched the truck from the flatbed he parked the truck off to the side and returned with the other big rig a blue kenworth in ten minutes he had the new truck hitched to the trailer he scrutinized the flatbed for a second gps tracking device finding none he swapped the rear license plate the other two men had nearly finished building a wall of hay around the sea arrows power plant pablo helped them pull a tarp across the top of the bales and tie it to the sides of the trailer completing its disguise as a hay truck clarence the larger of the two men pulled off his gloves and approached pablo that concludes our part of the job he said in his raspy voice you have our pay yes pablo said and you have the plans in the back of the van along with an added present for you he said grinning bring the documents to the truck ill get your money clarence opened the back of the van and pulled out the plastic bin containing heilands supercavitation plans he followed pablo to the kenworth and placed it on the passenger seat pablo reached behind the seat and handed the hired thug a thick envelope the big man ripped off one end revealing several bound stacks of hundreddollar bills my that does look pretty he folded the envelope closed now if youd be kind enough to retrieve your gift well be on our way pablo gave him a puzzled look clarence jerked his thumb toward the van and led pablo to the open back doors where the other man stood smiling as pablo peered past him into the vans interior his eyes flared in anger coiled on the vans floor was the boundandgagged ann bennett a look of rage seared her face until her eyes met pablos then the shock of recognition hit home the colombian terrorist was the last person she expected to see here her brazenness evaporated and she wriggled farther into the confines of the van pablo turned to clarence what is she doing here we got a call to pick her up clarence said we were told not to waste her so here she is pablo reached under his jacket pulled out a glock pistol and aimed it into the back of the van yo man dont do her in the back of the van clarence said its a rental okay pablo wheeled around and fired the glock pointblank in clarences face as he fell back dead his partner lunged at pablo but the colombian was quicker he turned and pumped three shots into the mans chest the dying thug could only grip pablos collar and pull him to his knees before collapsing ann screamed but her cry was muffled by a band of duct tape pablo gazed at her a moment then calmly holstered the glock he reached into the van yanked ann out and tossed her onto a leftover bale of hay im afraid it wont do to kill you here as she watched in terror he hoisted the two dead bodies into the back of the van and closed the doors tossing the now bloodied cash envelope toward ann he looked at her and said dont move an instant later pablo peeled the van out of the barn spraying dust and loose hay he drove just a short distance then stopped and carefully positioned the van he lowered the windows removed all the keys from the fob except for the ignition key then walked around searching for a large flat rock finding one he placed it on the accelerator pedal and mashed it down flat climbing out of the truck he reached in through the open window and started the engine before the revolutions could skyrocket he pulled the column shift into drive and jumped away the rear tires spun in the loose dirt and the van shot down the road it traveled less than fifty feet before it angled off the road and careened through a small ditch its momentum carried it up the opposite side and over a small embankment where it lunged into the pond a lone goose scattered with an angry honk as the van hurled up a wall of green water after a few seconds the van filled with water and disappeared into the deep pond leaving only a diminishing froth of bubbles pablo didnt wait for it to sink but instead jogged back to the barn he picked up the envelope and threw it into the trucks cab before coming back for ann without a word he carried her to the cab and dropped her in a flat compartment behind the front seats you might as well get comfortable he said starting the truck and shifting into gear we have a long trip ahead of us the helicopter flew in fast at treetop level zooming low over the hangars to surprise the waiting dignitaries seated along the runway it was a military chopper its fuselage designed with sharp angles and coated with an absorbent material that rendered it nearly invisible to radar a special composite fiveblade main rotor and matching tail assembly added to its stealth qualities by dramatically reducing its noise signature an aviation expert from janes defence weekly would take one look at the chopper and identify it as a stealth hawk one of the us armys heavily modified uh black hawks like the one used in the raid to capture osama bin laden but this helicopter was entirely chinese built the craft swooped about the yangcun air base south of beijing buzzing the field several times before alighting the crowd of generals and defense officials stood and applauded the exhibition of the countrys latest technological triumph the cheers became muted when a party official took to an elevated podium and launched into a tired diatribe touting chinas greatness edward bolcke leaned over to a bulleteyed man wearing a uniform draped with medals splendid aircraft general jintai yes it is jintai said and we didnt even need your help to build it bolcke shook off the jab with a grin having just received pablos call from maryland he was brimming with confidence the crowd suffered through several more longwinded speeches before being herded into an open hangar with a buffet line bolcke trailed the general a vicechairman of chinas central military commission as he mingled with other top peoples liberation army officials after inquiring about a fellow generals new condominium in hong kong jintai backtracked to bolcke my hospitality duties are now complete he said to the austrian we have some business to discuss if you please bolcke replied very well let me find our chief spymaster and well speak in private jintai scanned the crowd until locating a slight bespectacled man drinking a heineken beer tao liang was a directorate head in the ministry of state security the agency that handled chinas intelligence and counterintelligence activities tao stood talking with zhou xing the field operative from bayan obo who calmly studied the assembled dignitaries the peasantfaced man subtly alerted tao that jintai was stalking him while the general was still halfway across the room tao there you are the general said come we have a business proposal to evaluate with our old friend edward bolcke our old friend bolcke tao said with an acid tone yes i am curious to hear his latest offerings with zhou following the men crossed the hangar to a small private office it had been prepared for them with a portable liquor cabinet and a platter of dim sum jintai poured himself a whiskey and sat down with the others at a teak conference table may i offer my congratulations gentlemen on your latest deployment bolcke said it is an admirable day for chinas guardians in a small way he paused letting his insult register i would propose that tomorrow however may bring a revolutionary day to your countrys defense are you going to emasculate the russian and american military for us jintai said chuckling to himself as he downed the last of his whiskey in a manner of speaking yes you are a miner and a petty thief bolcke what are you saying bolcke peered at the general with narrowed eyes yes i am a miner i know the value of important minerals such as gold and silver and rare earths we understand the value of rare earth elements tao said that is why we manipulate the price by using you as a broker to make acquisitions on the open market its no secret that china holds a near monopoly on the production of rare earth elements bolcke said but that monopoly has been put at risk by activity at two large mines outside your country the americans recently reopened their mountain pass mine while australias mount weld operations are undergoing expansion jintai puffed out his chest we will always be dominant perhaps but you will no longer control the market bolcke removed a large photo from his attaché case it showed an aerial view of some smoldering buildings in a desert setting next to an openpit mine this is the remains of the american facility at mountain pass bolcke said their processing operations were destroyed by a fire last week they will be unable to produce an ounce of rare earth elements for the next two years you know something about the fire tao asked bolcke stared at him in silence his lips upturned in a smug grin he placed a second photo on the table it showed another openpit mine in a desert setting this is the mount weld mine in western australia its owned by the hobart mining company in which i have recently become a minority shareholder i understand the australians have temporarily halted production while they modernize the facility tao said you are correct that is all very interesting jintai said but what does this have to do with us bolcke took a deep breath and looked down his nose at the general it has to do with two actions that you are about to undertake first you will underwrite five hundred million dollars so i may purchase outright the australian mine at mount weld second you will institute an immediate ban on chinese exports of rare earths the room fell silent a moment before jintai chuckled anything else you desire he said rising to fetch himself more whiskey chief executive of hong kong perhaps tao stared at bolcke intrigued tell us why we will do these two things economics and security bolcke said together we can control the entire market in rare earth elements as you know i broker much of the remaining world outputfrom places like india brazil and south africawhich i sell to you bolstering prices i can easily contract for longterm delivery from these sources before you announce a halt in exports locking in those supplies as for mount weld if you fund my purchase i will repay you in ore which you can quietly resell to select trading partners at exorbitant profits if you so desire with the americans out of commission china will control virtually the entire global output of rare earth we already control the bulk of the market jintai said true but you can control it all the fire at mountain pass didnt happen by accident mount weld didnt suddenly suspend operations of their own volition it was all due to my influence you have been a valued trading partner for both minerals and american defense technology tao said soprices are driven up and we ultimately profit from the sale of the minerals no bolcke said you can do better than that with full control of the market you can force every global company that uses rare earth elements to consign their manufacturing and technology to china every smartphone and laptop every wind turbine every space satellite will be yours and technologys the key nearly every cuttingedge technology today makes use of rare earth elements and that will place you in a dominant position for tomorrows advances in consumer products and more importantly defense weaponry he stared at jintai wouldnt you rather introduce the most advanced attack helicopter yourself rather than copy somebody elses the general simply nodded instead of playing catchup with western technology china will lead the way by totally controlling the supply of rare earths you put an immediate halt to a multitude of western military advances new generations of american missiles lasers radarseven ship propulsion systemsrely on rare earth elements by shutting off the supply you can erase the technology gap rather than china copying western defense technologies they will be copying you bolcke casually collected the photos and returned them to his briefcase as i said its a matter of economics and security they go hand in handand you can dominate the world in both arenas the comments struck a nerve with jintai who constantly decried the inferior weapons the peoples liberation army fielded perhaps it would be an appropriate time to act he said to tao perhaps tao said but wouldnt it create havoc with our western trading partners its possible bolcke said but what can they really do to maintain their own shaky economies they will have no choice but to partner with you and share in their developments the spymaster casually lit a cigarette with an expensive lighter what is in all this for you mr bolcke your actions will increase the profitability of my mineral brokering business and i trust you will allow me to sell a portion of the mount weld output to friendly trading partners at a healthy profit he said nothing of his intent to supply the growing black market in rare earth elements from the mine nor the fact that he could purchase the property for two hundred million dollars less than he demanded tao nodded we will take the matter up with the politburo as an urgent priority he promised thank you in hope of arriving at a mutually beneficial outcome i have one other item to offer in the past ive been able to pass along a few military technologies from my us security firm for which you have generously compensated me yes jintai said we have already fielded the crowdcontrol device to quell some incidents of unrest in the western provinces i have installed units aboard two of my ships which have been modified to an impressive level of lethality i will be happy to share these modifications if you are interested but that technology is inconsequential compared to what i can now offer you he spread two more photos on the table this is an artists rendering of the sea arrow bolcke pointed to the first glossy the sea arrow will be the worlds most highly advanced stealth submarine jintai gave a curious look and tao nodded in recognition the sea arrow will operate at extremely high speed using a complex propulsion unit in conjunction with a supercavitation system bolcke pointed to the second image it will place the american navys submerged fleet several generations ahead of your own jintais face simmered red we are always three steps behind not this time bolcke said with a sharktoothed grin less than one hour ago i came into possession of the initial power plant that was scheduled to be installed on the sea arrow next week in addition i now have the one and only copy of the plans and drawings for the submarines supercavitation system he leaned over the table in a gloating pose the americans can duplicate the power plant only with rare earth elements and without the supercavitation plans their submarine is worthless the chinese officials did their best not to appear too eager you are willing to share these items with us tao asked with feigned indifference sources tell me the americans have secretly spent over a billion dollars in developing the sea arrow if we have a deal on the other items we discussed i shall be happy to sell you the motor and the plans for an additional fifty million dollars tao didnt blink when could you deliver it the motor and plans will arrive by ship in panama in five days ill be happy to make the transfer there it is an attractive proposal tao said we will afford it appropriate consideration excellent bolcke collected the photos and glanced at his watch im afraid i have to catch a flight to sydney ive opened preliminary discussions for the acquisition of mount weld so i will eagerly await your reply we will move as quickly as we can jintai said the general called for an aide and bolcke was escorted out after everyone stood and shook hands jintai poured a whiskey for tao and another for himself well tao our austrian friend makes a compelling case since our economy is strong we can afford to muscle the marketplace and why not try to make the technological leap that will assure our safety for the next century there could be potential economic repercussions that the general secretary wont relish tao said but i agree that it is worth the risk will he balk at the loan and cash payments not when i explain the value of the sea arrow technology weve had agents trying to penetrate the program but with no success i dont question bolckes estimate of their expenditures in fact he may be understating their costs he studied his glass of whiskey we must do what we can to obtain it jintai smiled then it is agreed we will jointly support the proposal to the general secretary but there is one problem with our austrian friend tao turned to zhou who had been sitting silent throughout the meeting please tell the general what you have learned zhou cleared his throat general i was assigned to investigate thefts of rare earth elements from our primary mine operation in bayan obo there i found an organized crime ring that was systematically stealing crushed ore and transporting it to tianjin i tracked an illicit delivery that was loaded aboard a freighter called the graz he paused glancing at tao for confirmation to keep talking should the name mean something to me jintai asked the graz tao said is owned by bolckes shipping company bolcke is orchestrating the theft of our own rare earth yes tao said he was brought in as a consultant at the mine some years ago giving him opportunity to establish the theft ring but its worse than that he nodded at zhou i examined a number of port records to track the freighters path zhou said from tianjin it sailed to shanghai and then to hong kong where it offloaded thirty metric tons of crushed bastnasite that the ministry of commerce had purchased on the open market the purchase was brokered through bolckes firm habsburg industries bolcke is selling us our own rare earth jintai nearly popped out of his chair zhou nodded the greedy swine catching his breath he turned to tao what do we do now tao carefully snuffed his cigarette in an ashtray before locking eyes with jintai the american technology must be obtained at all costs we will send zhou to panama to proceed with its acquisition what about the rare earths do we proceed with the export ban and fund the mine acquisition we will still push for the export ban as for the mine funding his hardened face turned sly we will arrange to pay back mr bolcke in a manner that will produce the same ends plumeria blossoms mixed with the faint aroma of aviation fuel filled the air as pitt and giordino exited the terminal at honolulu international airport the bright sunshine and tropical breeze instantly washed away the fatigue of their twelvehour flight from washington giordino hailed a cab and they hopped in for the short ride to pearl harbor the palmlined streets brought back a flood of memories to pitt he had spent considerable time in the hawaiian islands during his first years with numa it was here he had fallen in love with a radiant woman named summer moran though it had been decades since he had last seen her alive her delicate face and sparkling eyes remained as clear to him as the sky overhead the deceased mother of his two grown children she lay buried in an oceanview cemetery on the other side of the island pitt shook away his recollections as they reached the entrance to the navy base a young ensign was waiting for them at the visitors gate and politely loaded their bags into a jeep he navigated onto the docks and pulled up next to a slabsided vessel with a slim round superstructure that looked like it had been lopped off with a sharp knife what is it giordino asked some sort of car ferry on steroids youre not far from the mark pitt said the fortitudes design is based on a highspeed automobile ferry built by an australian company catamaran hull giordino said noting the ships rotund bow was supported by twin vertical hulls yes and made of aluminum the fortitude is driven by waterjet propulsion shes part of the military sealift command and is designed to transport troops and equipment quickly the navys building a small fleet of them as they retrieved their bags from the jeep a lanternjawed man in fatigues approached them mr pitt yes im pitt lieutenant aaron plugrad coast guard maritime safety the man reached out and shook pitts hand with an iron grip my men are already secured aboard the fortitude im told we can shove off at any time whats the size of your team lieutenant i lead a squad of eight men well trained to combat piracy operations if theres a hijacking attempt well stop it plugrad and his men came from a littleknown command called the coast guard deployable operations group essentially a swat team at sea they were trained in counterterrorism highrisk ship boardings and explosives detection one question for you sir plugrad said we received a crate from numa containing a dozen highend hazmat suits we went ahead and loaded the crate aboard ship those are for your men pitt said be sure each is issued a suit when we board the adelaide we have a theory that the potential assault may involve the use of a beefedup microwave system similar to those developed by the army for crowd control im familiar with that system plugrad said well take the necessary precautions pitt and giordino boarded the sleek ship where they were greeted by the fortitudes captain a prematurely gray navy commander named jarrett he led the numa men to the bridge where he outlined their proposed course on a navigation monitor well be looking to rendezvous with the adelaide here jarrett said stabbing a finger at an empty expanse of ocean southeast of the hawaiian islands its about eleven hundred miles from oahu well zero in on the adelaides course once we get closer but we should catch her in less than twentyfour hours twentyfour hours giordino shook his head do you have jet engines on this thing no just four big turbocharged diesels on a good day we can run close to fortyfive knots since we are carrying a light load we should be able to sail close to that speed why fly and miss out on a nice sea breeze giordino said thats what the fortitude was designed for we can transfer a battalion of men across the atlantic in two days jarrett eyed a nearby chronograph if you gentlemen have no objection well get under way the fortitudes diesels started with a rumble the lines were cast and the threehundredandthirtyeightfoot ship maneuvered out the narrow entrance of pearl harbor and turned southeast it cruised past waikiki and the towering face of diamond head before cranking up speed the brickshaped ship accelerated quickly rising up on its sharp catamaran hulls the seas were calm allowing jarrett to run at nearly full out pitt watched the navigation monitor in awe as the vessel easily eclipsed the fortyknot mark in a few hours the last of the hawaiian islands disappeared off the stern horizon as they raced into an empty expanse of the pacific pitt and giordino joined plugrad and his team on deck sharing insights on what they might encounter as they reviewed defensive boarding measures after dining in the ships cavernous mess hall they turned in for the night pitt detected the fortitudes engines slowing later the next morning while he was exploring the hold with giordino the two men climbed to the bridge where they spotted the adelaide a mile off the bow she was a dry bulk carrier six hundred feet long sporting a forest green hull and a gold superstructure a blackstained funnel and rust around her hawsehole indicated a seasoned career but she otherwise looked well cared for she cut through the waves low to the surface her five holds filled to their hatch covers her captain has acknowledged our arrival and is prepared to take you on board jarrett reported thanks for the quick run captain pitt said you have a gem of a vessel sure you boys cant stick around giordino asked jarrett if the adelaides a dry boat i may need you to make a beer run sorry but were due stateside in thirtysix hours jarrett shook hands with both men ive ordered our launch deployed for you good luck and safe travels plugrad had his coast guard contingent assembled when pitt and giordino reached the deck they climbed into a covered launch and were piloted to the freighter where an accommodation ladder had been lowered along the adelaides flank plugrads men leaped onto the platform and bounded up the ladder seemingly oblivious to the weapons and sixtypound packs they carried pitt waved to the launchs pilot as he stepped off it and followed giordino up the ladder a dour pair of crewmen in illfitting jumpsuits and black boots met them on the deck your quarters are this way one of them said motioning toward the stern superstructure the captain will meet with you in twenty minutes in the ships mess the two crewmen led the party aft as the adelaides engines rumbled to higher revolutions and the big ship resumed speed as they were led to their berths on the second level of the superstructure giordino glanced back at the fortitude speeding off to the northeast and he suddenly felt thirsty for a beer the master of the adelaide was nothing like pitt had expected rather than the staid experienced captains that typically commanded large commercial ships the adelaides master was a young scrawny man with jittery eyes he stepped into the mess and regarded pitt giordino and plugrad coolly before shaking hands and sitting down with them my name is gomez im told you are expecting a hijacking attempt if he was concerned by the news it didnt show on his face weve found a pattern of attacks in the pacific pitt said the ships were all carrying rare earth elements the same as your cargo you must be misinformed gomez said this ship is loaded with manganese ore manganese giordino asked didnt you take on a full shipment of monazite in perth we shipped from perth but our cargo is manganese your corporate headquarters pitt said confirmed otherwise gomez shook his head an honest mistake the electronic manifest record must have been confused with another of the companys vessels these things happen ill call your supply ship and have them retrieve you that wont be possible pitt said the fortitude has its own schedule to keep plus giordino said we might not be the only ones who are misinformed thats correct plugrad said i wouldnt want to pull my men off then find out later that you ran into trouble were supposed to remain aboard until you dock in long beach so well stick to the plan very well gomez said his words laced with irritation please confine yourselves to the main deck and the secondlevel staterooms al and i will take shifts on the bridge and act as liaison to the lieutenant should we encounter another vessel gomez noted pitts determined tone and nodded as you wish but no armed men will be permitted on the bridge gomez stood up from the table i must return to my duties welcome to the ship im confident you will enjoy a quiet and routine voyage after gomez left giordino looked at pitt and plugrad and shook his head well how do you like them apples no rare earth and a cranky punk for a captain to entertain us the rest of the way not much we can do about it now pitt said and if were wrong quiet and routine isnt exactly the worst of outcomes the truth was pitts radar had been on full alert since he stepped aboard the adelaide something about the crew and captain wasnt right hed been aboard enough merchant ships to know that crews came in a variety of flavors and attitudes and a salty welcome in itself wasnt anything unusual but the circumstances made it peculiar facing a potentially deadly hazard the ships crew should have been happy for the added insuranceor at the very least curious as they settled onto the ship pitt and his men were instead treated as a nuisance crew members seemed to watch their every move yet refused to engage in even casual conversation on the bridge pitt and giordino were shunted aside and ignored their requests for information falling on deaf ears gomez barely acknowledged their existence and refused even to dine with pitt holing up in his cabin when not on duty during their second night aboard pitt paced the bridge his presence ignored as usual shortly before the shift ended at midnight a crewman appeared and approached gomez glancing at pitt as he spoke in hushed tones surveying the radar screen pitt noticed the image of a vessel appear ahead of them traveling on a similar heading he stepped closer to the screen to see the ships ais registry the automatic identification system a satellitedriven program required of all commercial ships over three hundred tons provided speed and heading data as well as an identity for all such ships at sea but for the ship on the radar now there was no ais display she doesnt have her ais turned on pitt said to gomez that seems a bit suspicious out here sometimes the signal is lost gomez said or she could be a military vessel it means nothing the captain stepped close to the helmsman whispered something in his ear and then moved to the opposite end of the bridge pitt ignored the captain and kept tracking the adelaides speed and heading he wasnt surprised when the mystery vessel slowed a knot or two until it vanished from the radar screen forty minutes of silent tension passed before giordino entered the bridge to relieve pitt are we sailing happy seas tonight cruising on waves of hysteria pitt preparing to leave quietly reported the earlier encounter with the ship a new helmsman arrived to relieve the one on duty but gomez remained on watch as pitt turned to depart the bridge he glanced once more at the radar screen something caught his eye and he hesitated studying the numbers it was the course heading the ship had suddenly changed from an eastnortheast heading to eastsoutheast why are we running southeast pitt asked there is a strong head current at this latitude gomez said we will drop below it for a day or two to maintain speed then readjust our heading to long beach pitts recollection was that the north equatorial current ran some distance south of their position but he didnt argue he turned and gave giordino a skeptical look guess ill turn in see you on the next shift pitt finally exited the bridge and climbed down the companionway rather than exit on the second level to go to his stateroom he continued down to the main deck to get some fresh air reaching it he ran into plugrad racing up the companionway the coast guard lieutenant had an agitated look youre up early pitt said trying to find two of my men who didnt report for their watch you didnt see them up on the bridge no id suggest the mess they probably went for some coffee to stay awake plugrad grumbled an acknowledgment and trodded off toward the mess out on deck pitt found the night cool with a fresh breeze rippling over the port beam after several hours on the unfriendly bridge the air felt refreshing pitt stretched his legs by hiking across the long open deck stopping at the prow and gazing over the rail a faint light appeared briefly ahead on the horizon vanishing and reappearing as the adelaide rose and fell with the sea the mystery ship was still there directly ahead at the edge of visibility for both eye and radar pitt watched for several minutes confirming the other vessel was holding position then ambled toward the deckhouse he stopped as he passed the forward hold noticing some debris on the deck part of the cargo of manganese had spilled near the hatch cover during loading pitt picked up a fistsized chunk and held it under a nearby deck light silver in color the ore appeared to be identical to the monazite he had found in chile on board the tasmanian star gomez was lying about the manganese but why why also was the crew acting so strange and what of the ship steaming ahead of them an uneasy feeling suddenly struck pitt square in the gut plugrad he had to alert plugrad pitt started aft but froze when several figures emerged from the deckhouse pitt ducked alongside the nearest hatch cover and watched two men drag a third man between them they crossed the deck laterally passing under a bright light for a second pitt could see the two men walking were armed crewmen the limp body between them was plugrad with a splatter of blood glistening on his forehead they dragged plugrad to the port side of the deckhouse where they unlocked a door and hauled him inside once they disappeared from view pitt crossed the deck and sprinted aft to the superstructures opposite side racing up the companionway he exited onto the second level and rushed to the four cabins that housed the coast guard team he knocked on the first door and flung it open but found no one inside when he found the second cabin empty he began to fear the worst the third and fourth cabins were also empty the entire coast guard team had quietly been neutralized pitt was exiting the fourth cabin when he heard whispers in the corridor he stepped back into the cabin and slipped behind its open door through the crack he watched as two armed crewmen crept down the hall and stopped in front of pitts door they readied their weapons then one twisted the handle and both charged in finding the cabin empty they returned to the corridor speaking quietly to each other in spanish one stomped off toward the companionway while his partner lingered moving slowly he stepped to the opposite end of the corridor and cautiously entered giordinos cabin finding no one there he began working his way back checking the other cabins pitt held his breath when the gunman approached where he was hiding the barrel of an assault rifle poked past the door as he took a step into the cabin pitt waited a second then burst from his spot shoving the door with all his strength he crushed the gunman against the bulkhead still clutching the chunk of ore he clubbed the man in the side of the head with it the man lost consciousness and collapsed to the deck before he could find the trigger on his weapon pitt pulled the gunman all the way inside the cabin and listened for his partner hearing nothing he took the mans ak and stepped into the hall closing the door behind him he reached the companionway and was about to move down the steps to release plugrad when he heard a gunshot the shot seemed to come from above if it had been fired from the bridge then it meant one thing giordino pitt reversed course and raced up the steps as silently as he could at the bridge he stopped and peered around the door the lights had been dimmed for nighttime running darkening the bridge except for the glow of a few monitors a nearby console obstructed much of his view but all seemed quiet perhaps the shot had originated elsewhere spotting only the helmsman he quietly advanced into the bay mr pitt hailed the voice of gomez i thought you would come for your friend the captain rose from a crouched position firmly holding an outstretched pistol it wasnt aimed at pitt however but at the floor pitt took a step closer to see that gomez was aiming the weapon at giordino who lay on the floor clutching his leg put down your weapon gomez said or you both shall die pitt caught a movement out of the corner of his eye the earlier gunman had materialized from behind another console his ak aimed at pitts back as pitt looked from his wounded friend to gomez his eyes flared with anger without a word he let the gun fall to the deck the president rolled an unlit cigar between his thumb and forefinger why he asked in an irritated tone why would the chinese suddenly halt all exports of rare earth elements an uncomfortable silence filled the oval office i can only suspect its for leverage the secretary of state said something they can use as a bargaining chip to counter our pressure on their support of trade with iran or their refusal to float the yuan have they told you as much no the foreign ministry has only indicated it was done out of strategic necessity sure said vice president sandecker the necessity to torpedo our economy a cigar aficionado himself he eyed the presidents stogie with envy it is quite a bold move the secretary of state said i would have expected some hint of negotiation over the matter but the chinese are playing it close to the vest the president turned to his national security advisor a ravenhaired woman named dietrich how bad is it going to hurt us over ninety percent of our rare earth imports come from china she said commercially it will devastate a number of industries particularly electronics and the alternative energy fields almost every hightech industry in the country will be affected are we just talking higher prices asked tom cerny skyrocketing prices will be just the first impact until workarounds can be developed products will be in short supplyor simply unaffordable either way demand will evaporate and jobs along with it it could easily drive the economy back into a serious recession what about other sources of rare earth the president asked i know weve got that mine in california tell me the chinese arent the only game in town the mountain pass mine came on line a few years ago and was just ramping up their production dietrich said but a recent fire at the facility destroyed the mines extraction operations its effectively closed for an indeterminate period probably two years that was our only domestic source has anyone looked into the cause of the fire sandecker asked it was believed to have been accidental but now the owners have called in the fbi to find out if it might have been arson how about other foreign sources of rare earth the president asked we do source a fraction of our imports beyond china dietrich said australia has been the primary backup with additional smaller amounts from russia india and malaysia but theres also a problem down under im afraid the major australian producer has announced a temporary shutdown due to an expansion program the president shoved his cigar into an ashtray so were left whistling past the graveyard while our economy sputters to a halt dietrich nodded bleakly im afraid we have little if any control over the supply situation thats only the half of it sandecker said the shortage strikes a pretty nasty blow to several of our key defense technologies the vice president is correct dietrich affirmed wheres the damage the president asked the navy gets hit hard she said the propulsion system for the zumwalt class destroyer and the new stealth cruiser relies heavily on rare earth elements so those programs will come to a crashing halt im waiting for a report from the air force but ive been told theres a significant impact to the new joint fighter and several satellite development programs were talking programs that are budgeted in the billions of dollars cerny said sounds to me the president said as if the chinese might be exploiting their monopoly as an opportunity to catch up militarily the heads in the room nodded what if we tell the chinese their export ban is unacceptable the secretary of state squirmed in his seat i dont think that dog will hunt sir the chinese leadership wont take well to any threats if we get into a trade war well be the bigger loser and if they stop purchasing our debt securities that would create even worse problems so were facing an economic nosedive when we can least afford it the president said on top of that were sacrificing our military readiness by delaying the next class of destroyers fighters and spy satellites theres one other casualty sandecker said he moved close to the president and spoke in a whisper the sea arrow the president nodded of course the president walked to his desk and peered out the high windows behind it for several minutes when he turned back to his audience he spoke in a soft defeated voice find out what the chinese want he said and give it to them the hijacking of the sea arrows motor incited an immediate nationwide dragnet roadblocks were quickly set up along every major road and highway leading north or south out of washington fbi teams were dispatched to all nearby airports and to every east coast port facility from where analysts assumed the motor would be smuggled out of the country extra security was even called in to the northeast border crossings into canada yet the stolen motor wouldnt be found in any of those places it had been driven west away from the major ports and airports and across rural appalachia hidden in the back of a hay truck entering lexington kentucky pablo slowed the big rig keeping a wary eye out for passing police cars ann was relegated to the back of the cab one wrist cuffed to the frame of the bench seat she could partially stretch out on the narrow seat but had to lean at an awkward angle to glance out the window they traveled in silence after pablo ignored her initial barrage of probing questions shed decided to save her energy it took a bit of conjecture but she eventually linked pablos theft of the sea arrow plans with the large device hidden on the flatbed it had to be the submarines new propulsion motor pablo was pleased with the time he had made covering four hundred miles in seven hours before pulling onto a quiet side road and letting ann stretch her legs a short time later they pulled into lexington where he found a truck stop and parked at a distant fuel pump after filling the trucks tank he opened the cab door and peered at ann do you want something to eat yes please ann said im very hungry ill be right back he slammed the door and locked it ann watched him stroll past several fuel islands and enter the truck stops building she scanned the parking lot searching for potential help the hour was late and she spotted only one person nearby a bearded truck driver washing the windshield on his idling rig a dozen yards away she waved and screamed at the top of her lungs but the sealed cabs tinted windows rendered her nearly invisible and her muffled cries went unheard over the idling engine she reached for the trucks air horn but couldnt quite stretch her fingers far enough the bearded man climbed into his rig and pulled away oblivious to anns plight she searched the trucks interior for something to use as a weapon but the cabs interior even down to its glove box was stripped clean except for a map and laptop computer on the front seat ann lunged for the computer she reached with her free hand and grasped the computer flipping open its monitor and powering it on as it booted up she glanced out the window pablo stood at the register purchasing some items shed have very little time to send a plea for helpif the truck stop had wifi she held her breath as the computer screen slowly lit up after an eternity a bubble icon asked if she wanted to join the lexington diesel dine network yes she clicked the icon a few seconds later an internet search page opened her joy was shortlived when she glanced out the window to see pablo exiting the building her pulse raced as she considered what to do there would be no time to sign on to her email account or relay a message through the ncis website a desperate idea popped into her head she quickly typed in four letters and waited for a response when a new screen popped up she scrolled to the bottom and found a query link clicking on it she hurriedly typed a message and looked up pablo was just ten feet away her fingers flew over the keypad stopping to click send as the door latch clicked she slammed the monitor closed and tossed the computer onto the front seat as pablo opened the door her heart beat wildly and she felt her face turn flush as he climbed into the drivers seat he turned and looked at her quizzically as he swung his hands around ham and cheese or tuna he held up a pair of wrapped sandwiches tuna please she exhaled and reached for one of the sandwiches pablo pulled back onto the highway eating as he drove the break had relaxed him and he finally turned his head over his shoulder briefly and spoke to ann you are in love with me he said grinning what yes you must be in love with me why else do you keep turning up i didnt ask to go on this trip she said please let me go pablo let out a deep laugh you are too smart to let go and too pretty to kill ann felt instant revulsion but kept the conversation going is that the sea arrows motor were hauling perhaps why did you kill the men who helped you steal it they served their usefulness and they knew more than they needed to i believe that is enough inquiry for now he turned on the radio and turned up the volume after finding a local bluegrass station they crossed the hills of western kentucky listening to the upbeat strains of flatt and scruggs four hours later they pulled into paducah pablo parked at a gas station on the outskirts of town and made a phone call within minutes a rusty pickup appeared driven by a tattoocovered man who then escorted the hay truck to the riverfront a towboat and a barge loaded with shipping containers were moored at the weathered wooden dock pablo eased the truck alongside the darkened barge and stopped it was well after midnight and the facility was eerily quiet pablo unhitched the flatbed trailer and drove the truck to an adjacent lot by the time he returned the tattooed man had strung lifting cables around the trailer and was hoisting it onto the barge with a dockside crane pablo jumped aboard the barge and helped secure the trailer to the deck before returning to the cab for ann she feigned drowsiness as he freed her from the seat frame and recuffed her hands in front of her she noticed for the first time that the cuffs had a sensor device built into them pablo pulled her from the truck and led her to the dock the lights of paducah twinkled to her right along the bank as the ohio river slid past like a dark current of molasses pablo kept a tight grip on her arm as he led her toward the towboat the weathered boat was secured to the center stern of the barge ready to guide it down the river access to the towboat was by a thin gangplank that stretched over the water ann hesitated crossing until pablo gave her a gentle nudge she actually didnt fear crossing the thin gangplank but what lay ahead first chained to a truck next chained to a towboat then who knows what wherever she was taken it was when the handcuffs were removed that shed have the most to fear it was this fear that drove her to act she mentally braced herself and took a deep breath as pablo prodded her a second time pretending to stagger she took two steps onto the gangplank and compressed her knees springing forward she took a leaping step up the gangplank flexed giving her extra lift and she bounded easily over the side handrail pablo reached for her but could only graze a passing ankle as she stretched her arms before her ann plunged into the river trailing just a small splash and vanishing into the dark muddy water the adelaides auxiliary storage locker was a dim steamy oven befitting the devil pitt could smell decaying flesh mixed with sweat when the bolted door was flung open and he and giordino were shoved inside at gunpoint he had struggled to bear the weight of his wounded friend down to the main deck and tried not to collapse under him he noticed a canvas tarp in the locker and gently laid giordino on it as the door was slammed and locked behind them is there a medic among you pitt said he glanced toward the coast guard team he saw huddled nearby a young man stood up and slowly made his way to pitts side simpson isnt it pitt said yes sir i can help he knelt over giordino quickly noting the spreading pool of blood beneath his right leg has he been shot yes pitt ripped away a torn section of giordinos pants hes lost a lot of blood simpson located the bloodsoaked wound on giordinos outer thigh and applied pressure with his palm i need something for a bandage pitt removed his shirt and ripped off the sleeves tearing them into long strips someone passed over a bottle of water which the medic used to clean the wound he took one of the strips and folded it into a pad applying it to the wound he bound it with the remaining strips giordino opened his eyes and looked up where we headed to get some beer pitt said take a nap and ill wake you when its on ice giordino gave him a crooked grin then drifted off a few seconds later simpson pulled a section of tarp over him and motioned pitt aside hes lucky there were two wounds indicating the bullet went clean through most likely it missed the bone but it must have nicked his femoral artery hence all the blood he may go into shock with that much blood loss so well need to keep an eye on him hes a tough old goat pitt said he should be fine for now his biggest problem will be avoiding infection in this stink hole pitt saw in the dim light that simpson had a bruise on his cheekbone what happened to you got jumped in the corridor on my way to watch bugger hit me with a chain i was luckier than some of the guys pitt looked around the bay which was lit by a single flickering overhead lamp the coast guard team sat nearby while another group members of the adelaides real crew was sprinkled about the rear of the compartment two oblong shapes wrapped in canvas and positioned off to one side were responsible for the horrible odor the captain and another man simpson said killed in the assault before we came along pitt nodded then turned his attention to the coast guard team they all bore wounds and bruises plugrad sat among the men with his back to a bulkhead a vacant look in his eye hows plugrad they knocked the lieutenant upside the head pretty good simpson said hes got a concussion but otherwise appears okay pitt stepped across the bay to the other group they appeared weary but unhurt a broadshouldered man with a thick gray mustache rose and introduced himself frank livingston executive officer he said with a thick australian accent hows your comrade gunshot wound to the leg lost some blood but the medic thinks hell be okay sorry i couldnt help our chief bosun was the ships medic hes over there with the captain he pointed toward the canvascovered bodies howd they take the ship a fast freighter came alongside on the evening watch three nights ago pulled right alongside our beam scaring the dickens out of the helmsman when they didnt respond on the radio the captain went on deck with the chief bosun the vessel fired up some sort of radar device amidships that killed them both his mouth tightening into a grimace never seen anything like it almost as if they were cooked alive the freighter sent over an armed boarding party shortly after there wasnt much we could do weve been cooped up in here ever since im sorry we were late to the scene pitt said i guess they were tipped off to our arrival and came after you early livingstons tired eyes flared with vengeance who are they pitt shook his head theyre part of a ring we believe has hijacked a number of bulk carriers transporting rare earth elements were loaded with something called monazite livingston said guess they got what they came for any idea where were headed pitt looked around to make sure none of the other men were listening we think they usually transfer the cargo at sea then scuttle the ships at least two other carriers were sunk in these waters livingston nodded but not with the look of a man sentenced to die aboard a sinking ship tell me mr pitt how large were those other hijacked carriers not large they were older dry bulk carriers maybe ten thousand tons why do you ask the adelaide is rated at forty thousand tons i got a good look at the attacking freighter before being tossed in here shes a runt compared to us capable of carrying no more than half our cargo your entire cargo is monazite every last ounce no sir i dont think theyll scuttle the adelaide not just yet anyway what were carrying is just too valuable pitt glanced at the hurt and haggard men scattered around the fetid prison bay mr livingston i certainly hope you speak the truth it took only a few seconds for ann to panic striking the water cleanly she kicked hard with her hands outstretched in front of her driving deep into the ohio river the water was warmer than she expected easily in the seventies reaching a comfortable culmination point she arched her torso and tried to stroke with her hands but with her wrists bound by the cuffs she couldnt do it a momentary flash of terror struck telling her she was going to drown relax relax relax a voice repeated in her head with her heart pounding she forced herself to hold still and drift with the current for a few seconds it calmed her nerves and she began scooping the water with her bound hands in a doggie paddle that would carry her to the surface but in the inky black water she no longer knew which way was up the answer came quickly when her shoulder grazed the corroded underside of the barge she pushed herself away and drifted clear holding on a few more seconds before ascending slowly into the cool night air the current was swift and she found herself moving away from the barge and towboat she looked back and saw pablo running along the dock scanning the water spotting anns head bobbing in the river he pulled his glock out of its holster ann instantly took a deep breath and rolled beneath the surface she couldnt tell whether he fired at her but there was no sense in giving him a target she glided more easily beneath the surface this time holding her breath for nearly a minute while kicking and paddling with the current when she surfaced again she was more than a hundred yards from the bargeall but invisible in the darkness to anyone on the dock still pablo had disappeared from her view she turned her attention downriver searching for a place to go ashore and find help but the dock was on the outskirts of town and the nearside riverbank was dark and empty a sprinkling of lights glistened a short distance ahead on the opposite bank marking the small town of metropolis illinois feeling the lure of safety ann began kicking and paddling toward the lights she struggled for a few minutes fighting the downstream current then she realized her efforts to reach the town would be in vain the river was almost a mile across and the current would sweep her well past its lights before she could reach the other side the awkwardness of swimming with bound wrists increased her fatigue so she rolled over and rested by floating on her back looking into the sky she noticed a pair of red flashing lights in the distance turning herself over she studied them as they flashedairplane warning lights in their brief stabs of illumination she could see they were affixed to a pair of tall concrete smokestacks they could only be part of a riverfront power plant as she floated past the lights of metropolis she worked her way back toward the near shore the riverbank went black for a mile and ann began feeling cold and alone but she continued to track the blinking red lights and eventually drew closer a haze of light at the base of the stacks crystallized into a profusion of bright lights that engulfed the power plant the lights were set well back from shore but as ann passed a shrublined bank she spotted a thin inlet that had been cut from the river to the plant when she approached the mouth of the inlet she began kicking hard the ohios current tried to drag her past but she broke free of its grasp and entered the inlets calm waters the cut ran about a third of a mile toward the plant where the water supplied the coalfired steam boilers exhausted from her final struggle against the current ann made for the nearest bank she rested in the mud for several minutes then pulled herself off the bank and climbed up a berm that had been graded on top for vehicle access she shivered in her wet clothes as she hiked toward the power plant smelling the rich odor of burnt coal as she drew closer she counted several vehicles parked around the plant thankfully a sizable night shift was onsite headlights flickered to her left and she saw a white pickup truck move slowly from the parking lot an orange light flashing atop its cab ann quickened her pace and began waving her bound arms as soon as she thought the driver might spot her the truck sped up and turned onto the berm it bounced along the narrow track and stopped in front of ann with a swirl of dust she raised her cuffed hands and approached the open drivers window can you please help me her voice quivered when she saw pablo stick his head out the window brandishing a portable gps unit keyed to her handcuffs and the glock pistol no my love he said in a cruel voice it is you who can help me part iii panama run summer pitt looked up from a clipboard in her lap and gazed out the submersibles acrylic dome window with nothing to see but blackness it felt like being locked in a closet how about some exterior illumination she asked her twin brother seated at the pilots controls flipped on a row of toggle switches a battery of bright led lights popped on putting a glow into the coalblack water but there was still little to see aside from particles in the water rushing past the acrylic at least it gave summer a visual sense of their rate of descent still afraid of the dark her brother asked while summer had inherited the pearlescent skin and red hair of her mother dirk pitt jr resembled his father he had the same tall lean build the same dark hair even the same easy smile down here what you cant see can hurt you she said she checked the depth indicator on an overhead monitor coming up on the bottom in fifty meters dirk adjusted the ballast tanks to slow their descent easing the vessel to neutral buoyancy when the seafloor appeared to rise up beneath them at their depth of three hundred feet the seafloor was a walnutcolored desolation populated only by a few small fish and crustaceans the fault line should be on a bearing of zerosixfive degrees summer said dirk engaged the submersibles electronic thrusters and propelled them on the northeast heading through the yoke he could feel a strong bottom current sideswiping them the agulhas current is humming today like to take us to australia the powerful agulhas flowed down the east coast of africa near the southern tip of madagascar where dirk and summer were diving it converged with the east madagascar current and streams from the indian ocean to create an unpredictable swirl we likely drifted a considerable amount during our descent summer noted but if we hold to the heading well still cross the fault line she pressed her nose against the bubble and scanned the lightly undulating seabed passing beneath them after several minutes she spotted a slight but distinct ridge thats our uplift dirk ascended slightly and positioned the submersible in a hover ten feet above the ridge ready for video summer powered on a pair of external cameras mounted to the submersibles skids then checked the feed on a monitor cameras are rolling marking start she said take us down the line dirk thrust the submersible forward following the ridge in the seafloor they were working in concert with a numa research ship that had surveyed the area previously with a multibeam sonar system examining an active fault line off the madagascar coast in hope of better predicting how earthquakes create tsunamis the submersibles video would give the shipboard geologists a baseline reference for the area the submersible would then be sent back to bury small sensors that would precisely record seismic activity the project required an interdisciplinary mix of talents that appealed to both siblings with dirk educated in marine engineering and summer specializing in oceanography both twins had inherited their fathers love of the sea they had joined pitt at numa only a few years earlier but soon reveled in the opportunity to travel the globe to solve the seas mysteries their work was made all the better when the three of them could collaborate on a project as they had recently in cyprus where theyd discovered a trove of ancient artifacts related to jesus passing kilometer number eight of the subsurface ridge that will never end dirk said two hours into their trolling the constant bucking of the current was taking a toll and he could feel his arm muscles begin to tighten youre not getting bored already summer asked dirk stared at the unchanging brown bottom that scrolled beneath them itd be all right with me if someone imported a whale shark or a giant squid to the neighborhood they tracked the uplift for another hour before dirk became concerned about their battery reserves fighting the current has put an extra strain on the motors i suggest we think about breaking off the run soon summer checked their distance covered how about another six hundred meters that will put us at an even twelve thousand deal completing that last remaining stretch dirk pulled the submersible to a halt while summer turned off the video cameras he began purging the ballast tanks to ascend when summer motioned out the front bubble window is that a shipwreck beyond the effective range of the exterior lights dirk saw a faint object could be he released the ballast pump and thrust the submersible forward a towering black mass gradually emerged taking on the distinctive shape of a ships hull as they drew closer the rest of the vessel took form sitting upright on the bottom and appearing remarkably undisturbed maneuvering just a few feet off the seafloor they approached amidships inching close to the mystery vessel the red paint that covered the hull reflected clearly under the submersibles lights detailing every rivet and seam she looks like she just went under dirk said he drove the submersible up the side of the hull and above the deck rail there they spotted three large open hatches on the forward deck dirk piloted the submersible toward the bow skimming over cargo compartments filled with nothing but seawater they peered down the sharp prow detecting no damage around the bow they turned back and surveyed along the starboard rail to the rear superstructure where they ascended several levels to the bridge from just a few feet away they peeked through the intact windows at an empty control station looks like the helm was stripped of most of its electronics dirk said that makes a good argument for her being scuttled somebody call lloyds of london summer said ive never seen such a pristine shipwreck she must have sunk recently no more than a few months judging by the minimal sea growth why would somebody scuttle a perfectly good freighter hard to say its possible she was under tow headed for a refit and sank in poor weather he checked the status of their battery power its about time we head topside but lets see if we can get a ships name he guided the submersible around the superstructure to the stern and descended past the aft rail a bent flagpole hung forlornly over the rail its former colors long since vanished when they were twenty feet off the ship he turned the craft to face the freighters transom and adjusted their height so the lights would shine on the ships name well ill be he said in a low voice she was scuttled after all in front of them stood a blank wall of red bisected by a thick horizontal band of rust where the ships name and home port had once been posted but somebody had intentionally ground away the name and covering paint sending the freighter to the lonely depths in total anonymity the numa research ship alexandria was stationed four miles away when the submersible broke the surface and summer radioed for recovery as the submersible drifted with the current she and dirk passed the time studying the dusty brown shores of southern madagascar which seemed to rise and fall across the choppy sea the alexandria arrived promptly its turquoise hull like all the ships in the numa fleet sparkling under a sunny sky a brawny man with a thick mustache and even thicker texas accent directed the retrieval of the submersible onto the ships aft deck jack dahlgren opened the vessels rearmounted hatch and welcomed dirk and summer to the fresh air yall have a good swim we certainly did summer said holding up a portable hard drive we obtained excellent footage of the uplift and should be able to identify some prime insertion points for the ground sensors she climbed past him scurrying to locate the ships marine geologist so they could jointly review the seabed footage i take it that means an immediate prep for another dive dahlgren asked with a long face dirk patted him on the shoulder im afraid it does my friend dirk assisted dahlgren in removing several heavy sets of battery packs that powered the submersible swapping them with freshly charged replacements while they worked on the aft deck a large patrol boat appeared from shore as the boat loosely circled the alexandria two casually dressed occupants on its open bridge studied the research ship with a look of displeasure when the alexandria moved offsite the patrol boat ran back to shore i wonder what those boys are up to dahlgren said they didnt exactly look like government officials dirk gazed toward the receding boat and shoreline beyond i thought the coast around here was pretty well an empty desert a small freighter came cruising through while you were down it appeared headed to shore so there must be some sort of harbor nearby they finished swapping batteries and completed an extensive predive safety check before tracking down summer in one of the ships labs she had assembled a crate of tiny batterypowered ground sensors that would track tremors and movements in the fault line each was contained in a stainless steel canister that sprouted a bright orange metal marker flag weve surveyed in a perfect location summer said what we want to do next is go back and bury ten sensors five hundred meters apart along the same track she looked to dahlgren can you drop us back at the same starting point can a boll weevil find a mississippi cotton field you just go get yourself comfy in my submersible before i decide to put you over the side without it he stormed out of the lab heading for the bridge to confer with the captain whats he so touchy about summer asked i made the mistake of telling him about the wreck we discovered dirk said hes mad that we found it in his submersible without him she shook her head boys and their toys summer grabbed the sensors and carried them to a cage basket affixed to the front of the submersible once they were secured she climbed inside and joined dirk in reviewing the predive checklist dahlgren appeared a few minutes later and ducked his head inside the hatch good to go when yall are were launch ready dirk said have a couple of cold ones waiting when we get back sure but theyre liable to be empty cold ones anything else yes see what the records show in the way of southern madagascar shipwrecks in the past five years that i can do happy sowing dahlgren sealed the hatch and hoisted the submersible over the alexandrias stern he waited until a radio call from the bridge confirmed they were at the designated drop spot then lowered the sub once the grapple was freed dirk was given the okay to flood the ballast tanks and the yellow submersible slipped under the waves the bottom appeared a few minutes later and dirk guided the submersible on its earlier northeast heading this time they traveled less than fifty meters before crossing the familiar uplift kudos to jack summer said he played the currents almost perfectly shall we drop the first sensor dirk asked summer checked their position calculated from a dead reckoning program initiated at deployment actually we should move about thirty meters east to pick up our first track dirk made the adjustment he eased the submersible to a flat section of seabed adjacent to the uplift and powered off the thrusters to settle the whirling clouds of sediment they had stirred up summer took over from there activating a pair of articulated robotic arms she clawed a vertical pit into the seafloor with one arm then used the other to grasp a sensor from the basket she wedged the sensor into the pit and covered up the main body of the sensor leaving just the bright orange flag protruding from the seafloor that went well dirk said he powered up the thrusters and shot down the rift at top speed you in a hurry to get someplace summer asked i figured we might take another look at the wreck when were finished summer smiled shed had the same idea and made sure a backup video hard drive was aboard for them to film the wreck they proceeded along the fault planting the remaining nine sensors along the sevenmile route when the last sensor was secured dirk checked their position relative to the shipwreck he maneuvered the submersible a short distance until the mass appeared before them right where we left her ill get some video this time summer said activating the forward cameras dirk ascended the submersible as they approached the hulk heading immediately for the main deck he crossed to the opposite rail allowing summers cameras to film the width of the ships beam and its open holds which were missing their hatch covers he was on a mission of identification as he turned the submersible and its video cameras toward the high rear superstructure its design would offer another clue to the age of the ship and its builder creeping up the front face of the superstructure he zoomed over the bridge and hovered near the funnel which protruded from the aft side commercial ships often carried the company colors or logo there but this one was painted black funny theres no smudge marks summer said looks like it was freshly painted another attempt to conceal her identity take us in a little summer leaned forward peering closely at the funnels surface while dirk drew them in summer activated one of the robotic arms and flexed it toward the funnel making contact she dragged the claw across the surface leaving a footlong gouge please dont carve your initials dirk said i dont want a lloyds agent knocking on my door at two in the morning just checking whats underneath as the paint flakes swirled away with the current they could clearly see an ocher line beneath the scratch the funnel was originally gold or had a gold band she said thats one more nugget they filmed the wreck for another thirty minutes capturing its length deck configuration and any other details that could aid in its identification batteries are approaching reserve power summer said i think weve learned all we can dirk said besides jack wont be too happy if we surface after dark he purged the ballast tanks and they began a controlled ascent several minutes later they broke the surface amid a choppy sea driven by a gusting westerly the sun was already dipping beneath a bank of clouds on the horizon stabbing the fading sky with bolts of pink and orange as waves splashed over the submersibles acrylic canopy dirk saw a nearby boat approaching it was the same patrol boat he and dahlgren had seen earlier looks like someone was waiting for us the boat turned directly toward them while increasing speed might be a good time to call the alexandria to come fetch us i think i spotted them on the horizon summer strained her neck to peer over the rolling waves they still look to be a few miles off she reached for the transmission button on her radio then froze dirk what are they doing her brother was already tracking the patrol boat which approached at an uncomfortably high speed the steelhulled vessel was less than a hundred feet away it should have begun to slow or veer off but it didnt they mean to ram us summer shouted dirk had the thrusters engaged but with a top speed of only three knots the submersible couldnt outrun a sea turtle with no chance to elude the patrol boat and insufficient time to dive dirk reacted the only way he could he turned the submersible directly toward the oncoming vessel summer looked at him as if he were insane and braced for the collision dirk kept his eyes glued on the boat maneuvering toward its sharp bow as if on a death wish he waited until the craft was nearly upon them then turned the joystick hard over while reversing the starboard thrusters the submersible responded as if mired in quicksand and dirk feared he had reacted too late but after a brief hesitation it veered to starboard narrowly slipping past the boats charging prow as dirk hoped the patrol boats helmsman had locked on course and reacted too late to the lastsecond maneuver instead the boat struck the submersible with only a light blow dirk and summer heard a bang and felt their craft shudder as the contact crushed one of the rear thrusters the impact briefly disrupted the power supply shutting down the subs electrical systems as dirk frantically repowered the thrusters he glanced out the spherical window as the patrol craft tore by a man in green fatigues stood at the rail pointing an assault rifle at the sub but the gunman didnt shoot instead just offering a menacing grin summer fought off the urge to flash him an obscene gesture that was close she turned her attention to the radio can you get us submerged trying dirk had started flooding the ballast tanks even before the collision but had to reactivate the pumps after the power failed they had only a matter of seconds before the patrol boat would swing around for another pass still no power to the radio summer said resetting the breaker switches behind her seat when that failed she took a quick peek out the bubble the ballast tanks had resumed filling pulling the submersible almost beneath the waves shes already turned nearly upon us she said matteroffactly she jumped back into her seat and cinched the lap belt tight cmon get down dirk pressed the yoke all the way forward with half their thrusters disabled it did little to speed their descent they could hear the patrol boats charging enginesand then the boat was upon them the submersible had made it a few feet underwater but the boats pilot had drawn a careful bead its sharp prow skimmed over the submersible but its lower hull hit home the crunching impact produced an explosion of bubbles as the acrylic bubble cracked and the ballast tanks were ripped free the submersible bounced under the hull battered in a series of punishing blows until finally getting swept aside the mangled shell wavered a moment before tumbling into a lazy death spiral that carried it all the way to the seafloor the submersible moaned like an angry ghoul as it plunged through the pressured depths it struck the seabed with its nose kicking up a thick cloud of brown sediment the bottom current soon dispersed the plume revealing the submersibles hulk dirk felt like he had taken a ride in a washing machine with its ballast tanks crushed the submersible had flipped too many times to count as it sank a monitor screen had torn loose during the tumble and struck dirk in the head he gently touched the top of his forehead and rubbed the length of a nifty gash other than the cut and some assorted bruises he was unhurtand thankful to be alive the submersibles rear frame had taken the brunt of the collision with the patrol boat mangling the thrusters battery compartment and oxygen tanks despite numerous hairline cracks the cockpits acrylic bubble had somehow survived intact sparing the occupants a quick drowning a dozen tiny leaks were filling the cabin with icy water but the craft had survived the plunge still filled with air you okay dirk asked across the dark interior he reached for a penlight clipped to the console but it had broken free yeah summer said in a shaky voice i think so dirk released his harness and fell forward into a foot of cold water the craft had landed on its face creating an odd disorientation hissing erupted from several points around the submersible dirk couldnt tell if it was water spraying in through tiny fissures or the remnants of one of the oxygen tanks he climbed over the back of his seat and groped for a side storage panel where another light was kept wading through a cold black steadily flooding submersible would have led most people to panic but dirk felt an odd calmness some of his composure came from having trained for just such an emergency but there was also a personal component he had lost a woman he loved in a terrorist attack in jerusalem the year before and that had changed him since then joy had become a harder attitude to embrace and he had taken to viewing the world in a colder more cynical manner more than that death had become a companion he no longer feared well have to wait for the cabin to flood before we can pop the hatch he said matteroffactly the pony bottles should get us to the surface he located the storage compartment and retrieved a small flashlight he flicked on the beam and aimed it at his sister one look at summers face told him something was seriously wrong her eyes bulged in a look of pain and fear and her lips were set in a grimace she released her harness and tried to stand but could only hunch over at an awkward angle dirk aimed the beam toward her right leg which was pinned against the seat a small stain of blood marked her pant leg just above the ankle its no time to get attached to this place dirk said summer tried to move squeezing her eyes shut as she pulled at her leg but it was no use my foot is pinned she said tight dirk crawled over for a better look the collision had driven forward one of the oxygen tanks which in turn had mashed the lower floorboard a plate of reinforced steel had curled up catching summers ankle against the seats housing water had already risen past her calf when dirk reached down to examine the buckled plate can you pull forward she tried and shook her head no good he maneuvered past her ill try to move the housing with his back braced against the acrylic bubble he placed his feet against the housing and pressed with his legs because of the awkward angle he could apply only a fraction of his full strength the housing rocked slightly but nowhere near enough to free summers leg dirk tried a few other angles attempting to rock the housing but without success i just cant get enough leverage he said its okay summer spoke calmly trying to mask her own fear and not place undue pressure on her brother waters rising better get the dive tanks dirk saw the water was already up to summers waist the leaks had increased and the cabin was filling quicker he dropped his legs into the water which stabbed his skin with an icy bite and climbed past the seats to the rear of the submersible he reached for a rack next to the hatch that held emergency evacuation geartwo dive tanks fitted with regulators and masks he passed one tank down to summer and looped the other over his shoulder then he rummaged around a compact toolbox cursing that its wrenches and pliers were designed for small electrical repairs the largest tool was a ballpeen hammer which he grabbed along with a short hacksaw blade the blade summoned up the image of aron ralston the courageous mountain biker who cut off his own arm after becoming trapped under a boulder near moab amputating summers foot with the hacksaw blade might become a gruesome last measure to save her life any ideas summer asked when he climbed over with the tools ill try and wedge the seat frame apart so you can slip out he passed her the light and hoped she didnt notice the saw blade okay she replied shivering as the cold water swirled around her chest dirk slipped on his mask and regulator and ducked underwater jamming the hammer handle in the gap by summers ankle he could tell right away that it offered too little leverage still he pressed himself horizontal and jammed his weight against the handle the frame wavered but refused to bend or buckle further attempts yielded the same result to force the heavy plates apart he needed more force but there was nothing available in frustration he flipped the hammer around and banged on the frame creating a tiny dent when he surfaced he saw the water lapping at her chin she had her mask on as she handed him the flashlight with a disappointed look he turned the light toward the entry hatch at any moment it would become flooded as he swung the light around its beam played on an object beyond the exterior canopy he felt summer grip his arm and she tilted her head out of the water to speak go on without me there was no anger or panic in her voice just resignation she knew dirk had tried everything as twins they shared a bond unknown by most siblings they trusted each other implicitly she knew if the situation dictated he would readily give up his own life for hers she was thankful that at least he would survive dirk looked in her eyes and shook his head then cut it off she cried now she had seen the hacksaw blade all along dirk could only admire her bravery particularly as she pulled a bandanna from her jumpsuit pocket twisted it into a tourniquet and tied it around her lower calf dirk had to wait for her to stick her head above water before replying im not ready to play dr kildare just yet he said forcing a grin wait right here before she knew it he had opened the hatch and swum out of the submersible leaving her trapped and alone in the dark summer could not remember when she had felt so terrified trapped alone in the blackness of the ocean depths she felt her heart racing once the submersibles interior had flooded dirk had opened the hatch and swum away with the waterproof flashlight she shivered uncontrollably from the fear and the cold water as her fingers and ears turned numb but the worst was the near silence crouched on the overturned seat she could hear only the pounding of her heart and the sporadic sucking and gurgling of her breath through the regulator as her mind began inventorying her fears the act of breathing rose to the top of the list her air consumption at the current depth was much higher than near the surface the cylinder might provide her only a few minutes of air but what if it hadnt been filled to capacity a devilish voice in her head asked whether each breath from the tank would be her last she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to relax extending the time between inhalations and forcing a steady breathing rhythm when she felt her heartbeat slow she pried open her eyes but still found herself surrounded by a cloak of blackness never prone to claustrophobia she still couldnt help feeling like she was locked in a very small very dark closet she began to wonder if her brother had changed his mind and headed for the surfacethen she saw a dull glow outside the canopy the light grew brighter until she could make out the flashlights beam as it drew closer though it seemed he had been gone for hours it had been only a few minutes when dirk climbed through the hatch a second later she saw he was wielding a fivefoot steel pole with a brass ball affixed to one end the severed flagpole from the shipwreck the submersible had struck bottom alongside the wreck which dirk had recognized through the bubble dirk crawled forward and wedged the pole between the seat frame and the housing that clamped against summers foot grabbing the opposite end he pulled like an olympic oarsman the metal supporting the seat buckled immediately allowing summer to free her foot she gave dirk a hug then signaled ascend with an upraised thumb dirk shined the light at the open hatch and gave her a shove they had spent a dangerous amount of time at a depth close to three hundred feet and knew not to linger summer waited outside the submersible for him and they linked arms and began their ascent together they kicked in a slow measured pace using their rising exhaust bubbles as a speedometer ascending too quickly would be a surefire recipe for the bends and dirk made sure they lagged behind the fastrising bubbles it seemed to take forever summer was glad for the exertion which slightly warmed her frozen bones but her mind still wanted to play tricks on her telling her they werent actually ascending or that they were actually falling back to the depths it was the cold she told herself making her senses numb along with her extremities she clung to dirk who moved like a robot seemingly immune to the cold and dark at a depth of one hundred and fifty feet the waters noticeably lightened as the surface light began to penetrate the deep at onetwenty they passed through a thermocline and the water temperature warmed and at eighty feet dirk ran out of air he wasnt surprised because of his exerted swim to the wreck and back he knew his air would fail before summers drawing his hand across his throat to signal summer he jettisoned his tank and regulator she passed her regulator over and they began alternating breaths unconsciously kicking more quickly toward the surface dirk looked up and saw a faint ripple of silver far above their heads they were now close enough to reach the surface if summers air failed but now they had another problem exposure to the pressurized depths allows tiny nitrogen bubbles to form in the bodys tissue if not allowed to dissipate via a gentle reduction in pressure the gas bubbles can lodge in the body creating the agonizing and sometimes fatal malady of the bends dirk estimated they had spent close to fifteen minutes on the seafloor the navy dive tables called for multiple decompression stops but they had no such luxury they ascended to what dirk guessed was about twenty feet and then held their position their natural buoyancy and the swift current made it a challenge but he kept his eye on the surface and fought to keep them in place they milked the tank for another ten minutes before summer spat the regulator out of her mouth and pointed up they both shot to the surface exhaling as they swam their heads broke the surface amid a choppy sea dotted with whitecaps the sun had already vanished leaving the sky a darkening shade of pewter the combined effects would render them almost invisible to a passing ship even one that was searching for them yet that wasnt first on summers mind sucking in a deep breath summer turned to her brother a flagpole best i could do under the circumstances hows the foot the foots okay but i have a painful cramp in my ankle she shot him a concerned gaze i dont think we came anywhere close to covering our deco time dirk shook his head no we were well short do you feel any tingling anywhere im too numb to feel much of anything we might be sleeping in the alexandrias decompression chamber tonight he scanned the horizon our next problem they finally spotted the numa vessel far to the west the dark band of the madagascar shoreline was visible a bit closer to the north the alexandria is up current dirk said no way we can swim to her theyve probably swept by already and are backtracking with a sonar survey to locate the submersible well have drifted to australia by the time they get back this way then to shore it is dirk said are you up for the swim do i have a choice she eyed the coastline put her face in the water and started swimming they were both excellent swimmers in fit shape under normal circumstances the openwater swim to shore would have been little more than a tiring challenge but the mental strain of their escape from the submersible combined with their coldwater exposure turned it into a lifeordeath task fatigue struck both swimmers almost immediately summer couldnt believe how quickly her arms and legs felt like they had turned to lead the turbulent seas didnt help the waves frequently tossed them about and filled their mouths with salt water swimming toward the coastline meant they were working across the current each stroke to shore carried them a nearly equal distance to the east and that much farther from the alexandria the pair swam side by side stopping to rest every ten minutes while treading water dirk would fish the flashlight out of his pocket and waggle its beam at the research ship on their third rest the light slipped from his numb fingers dropping into the depths like a candle down a well by now the numa ship appeared even farther away just an occasional dancing light on the horizon dirk turned toward summer cmon less than a mile to go she willed her limbs forward but they had a mind of their own a deep pain began burning in her left leg then gradually vanished along with all feeling in the limb she began resting at shorter and shorter intervals and dirk could see she was beginning to fade pretend were in hawaii he said ill race you to waikiki okay was all she could manage even under the rapidly fading daylight dirk could see her eyes turning listless he grabbed her jumpsuit and swam with a sidestroke even as his own strength ebbed the cold seemed to reach down and chill his bones and his teeth joined summers in chattering nonstop he felt her body sag and he realized she could make no more headway through his exhausted mind he realized hypothermia was setting in they both had to escape the water and soon though his breath was nearly spent he kept a running dialogue with summer encouraging her asking endless questions to which he got no reply when she began to flounder he turned her on her back and towed her by the collar there would be no more stopping for him now he pressed on one painful stroke at a time he had nothing left in the tank and his muscles pleaded to cease but somehow he blocked out the agony and kept clawing through the water the surf line ahead gradually grew larger until he could hear the waves pounding against the land the sound inspired him to pull harder depleting the last of his reserves a wave washed over them and dirk came up sputtering summer coughed out inhaled water as they were propelled by a succeeding wave that broke on top of them dirk kept his grasp on summer as they tumbled through the water and were slammed against the bottom at last they had reached shore with the force of succeeding waves at his back dirk staggered up the sandy beach dragging summer behind him he pulled her past the tide line then collapsed to the sand how are you feeling he gasped cccold she whispered it was a positive sign that she could still speak but he had to get her dry the night air was still warm which would make all the difference when he found the strength to stand dirk hobbled to his feet and looked around they had landed on a barren stretch of the southern madagascan coastline within the uninhabited parklands of cape sainte marie the beach and inland area were dark he had no idea how far the nearest help was but it didnt matter he lacked the energy to search he glanced seaward but found only a black and empty ocean the coastline curved outward to the west obscuring the lights of the alexandria he turned back inland and hiked up the beach looking for shelter the sand underfoot turned to hard scrabble which led to some rocky hills and mounds nowhere was there anything resembling shelter he headed back toward summerand tripped over a protruding mound at the edge of the beach it extended about a dozen feet and had created a burrow on its leeward side the indentation would provide some protection from the sea breeze likely the best shelter dirk could find finding a ragged tassel of sea grass he ripped up as much as he could and spread it about the burrow for insulation he returned to summer carried her up the beach and placed her in the makeshift bed the sea grass helped dry her skin and he hiked down the beach to search for more there was little but he gathered what he could and returned to the shelter he sat on the mound and used the grass to dry summers skin before adding it to the bedding when he stood he knocked a lump of sand off the edge of the mound exposing a faded band of material buried within he thought nothing of it as he took off his own jumpsuit and stood in the ocean breeze shivering until his skin dried he then lay down beside summer as an additional wind barrier for her she was murmuring more and her body no longer felt icy with a warm evening at hand dirk grew confident that she was going to be all right the exertion caught up with him and his eyelids began to droop a crescent moon appeared from behind a cloud and illumined the beach in a silvery glow above his head dirk could see the buried object protruding from the mound more clearly it was washedout yellow in color marked with a string of faded black letters his tired mind formed a name which rang with a strange tone as he drifted to sleep barbarigo summer awoke to a scraping sound near her ear prying open her eyes she spotted a hulking object moving a few feet from her head dirk she cried nudging her sleeping brother beside her he awoke with a start sat up and smiled when he saw the object of summers fear it was a sunbaked radiated tortoise you thinking of having turtle soup for breakfast the ancient reptile looked down his grainybeaked snout at dirk as if indicating he wasnt amused turning his head down range he dug his claws into the sand and continued his lethargic journey across the beach summer grinned at her own fears as she watched the big tortoise move away how could somebody harm such a stately creature depends on how hungry you are dirk stood and viewed their surroundings in daylight the beach was flat and sandy surrounded by rocky limestone hills rising inland vegetation was sparse as the region seldom collected more than a few inches of rainfall a year summer sat upright do you see the alexandria as he looked offshore dirk saw only an empty blue sea sprinkled with whitecaps there was no sign of the numa ship or any other vessels i guess we drifted farther east than they suspect if we hike up the coast far enough maybe we can wave them down unknown to them jack dahlgren and two crewmen had scoured the coastline all night in a zodiac mounted with a searchlight the searchers had even zipped past the beach twice but hunkered down behind the mound dirk and summer had slept through their passes the sound of the ocean drowning out the zodiacs motor dirk he could tell by her voice that something was wrong what is it i cant move my left leg dirk turned pale he instantly guessed why shed gotten the bends after all the condition usually showed itself by pain in the joints or limbs but sometimes by paralysis and paralysis in the legs typically meant that a gas bubble had lodged in the spinal cord he rushed over and knelt beside her are you certain summer nodded ive got absolutely no feeling in my left leg but the right one feels fine she looked at him with dread hows the pain pretty light actually but ill need some help to get back to the ship they both knew that immediate treatment in a hyperbaric chamber was critical for a successful recovery summer was fortunate that the alexandria carried such a chamber likely the only one within hundreds of miles but it might as well be on the moon dirk thought if they couldnt get to the ship he glanced at a rocky rise that towered over the beach im going to take a quick hike up that hill id like to see where the ship is and figure out our options ill wait here summer said forcing a smile dirk quickly crossed the beach and scampered up the barren hill the rocky ground sliced into his stockinged feet and he regretted having kicked off his shoes when he swam out of the submersible the hill rose sharply and he soon obtained a commanding view of the neighboring coastline looking first to sea he quickly spotted the alexandria she was a small dot in the distance moored he guessed over the site of the sunken submersible dirk estimated he would have to hike five miles up the coast to reach a position where the crew might spot him gazing inland he observed a barren range of rolling hills part of the cape sainte marie special reserve the large national park created as a wildlife sanctuary had few resources save for a handful of hiking trails and campsites he shifted his gaze to the east and was surprised to spot a ship two or three miles distant rising from a tiny inlet a handful of buildings stood alongside the ship while a small dredge was moored nearby dirk thought of the patrol boat that had rammed their submersible but he scanned the inlet and saw no sign of it spotting no other signs of civilization he hurried back to the beach do you want the good news or the bad news he asked summer who sat probing the sand mound with a flat piece of driftwood im a sunny optimist give me the good the alexandria hasnt abandoned us unfortunately they still think were aboard the submersible as far as i can figure theyre moored over the site where we went down plan b says that i hike five or six miles down the beach and try to attract their attention from shore i missed plan a less than three miles east of here is an inlet complete with a small dock facility and a freighter and a patrol boat with a bent nose no patrol boat i can hike there in under an hour and call the alexandria well have you napping in the ships decompression chamber in no time plan a it is dirk placed a hand on her shoulder you sure youll be okay here yes as long as he doesnt get any ideas about sharing burrows she pointed to the old tortoise the big reptile had traveled less than twenty yards since they awoke lying on the beach tossing sand with his flippers hell never make it back here in time dirk turned and moved off down the beach the morning sun was already baking the sandy terrain so he followed the shoreline where the ocean breeze kept it cooler the growing heat and a dry throat made him crave a drink of water he knew he was dehydrated which only added to his lethargy but dirk put the thought out of his mind and focused on walking as quickly as his weak legs and shoeless feet permitted the narrow beach ended abruptly at a steep crag of limestone that jutted into the sea he had to turn inland until the rock face shrank and he could climb up a short incline the top of the rock was flat and it melded into a series of low hills that continued to the inlet two miles beyond the white superstructure of the docked freighter peeked like a mirage above a distant sandy ridge summers condition gripped dirks mind compelling him to hike fast it had been less than twelve hours since they had escaped the submersible so her chances for a full recovery were still goodif she could make it to the chamber soon his concern kept him moving until he reached a small rise forty minutes later just below was the small lagoon encircled by low hills that neatly concealed the ship and dock facility as he descended the western hill he could see it was a barebones complex there were just two permanent structures a small dormlike building rose near the inland side while a warehouse stood at the opposite end of the dock between them was a high metal awning that hed mistaken for a third building the awning stretched the length of the dock providing shade to several large mounds of granular sediment dirk first thought it was salt from some nearby flats then noticed it was gray in color the freighter a midsized bulk carrier sat opposite occupying every inch of the dock facing dirk couldnt make out the name but noticed its yellow funnel sported the image of a white flower a handful of men were moving one of the mineral piles onto the ship with front loaders and a conveyor belt the heavy equipment combined with a nearby generator filled the air with clamor no one noticed dirk as he climbed down the hill and approached the open warehouse inside he could see a mechanic overhauling a small motor dirk started to walk into the building then froze in his tracks out of the corner of his eye he had caught sight of another vessel in the lagoon with the freighter occupying the length of the dock the second craft had been forced to tie up on the freighters outboard side it had been obscured from view as he descended the hill but the lagoons swirling waters had shifted its mooring so its bow was now visibleincluding the freshly scraped gouge on its prow streaked with yellow paint the patrol boat inside the warehouse the mechanic looked up and saw dirk he gave him an odd look and let out a shout from the back of the warehouse a young man in green fatigues rushed out carrying an ak which he aimed at dirks chest a flood of words spewed from his mouth in a dialect that dirk didnt understand but the intent was clear dirk stared at the gunman in disbelief then opened his palms and slowly raised his arms into the air rather than contemplate her paralyzed leg summer focused her thoughts elsewhere she stared at the radiated tortoise plodding across the beach then gazed wistfully at the empty sea finally she considered the object buried in the mound she had slept against the material that dirk had exposed was thick and rubberized by daylight she could see that the mound was in a distinct oblong shape formed by the object buried within summer studied the material rubbing her hand across the faded letters that had been stenciled in black barbarigo it sounded italian which piqued her curiosity using her driftwood shovel she scraped away the sand above the word revealing a compressed roll of the rubber material she could tell it had once been inflated digging some more she saw that it was a rubber raft it was old but well preserved by the layers of beach sand built over it she dug down on the opposite side of the layered rubber and soon struck a hard flat object scooping away the sand she saw it was a hardwood bench presumably one of several in the large raft offering another hint of its age she continued digging and exposed another section of rubber the rafts flooring a small ribbon of blue material poked through the sand catching her eye using her hands she carefully brushed away the sand exposing more of the material it was round in shape and she saw it was a sailors cap tugging gently she freed it from the sand but then suddenly gasped dropping it from her fingers underneath the hat she had exposed the grinning skull of its owner the warehouse contained a small machine shop along with several workbenches stacked with carpenters stores banks of lube oil and diesel fuel lined one wall near a large humming generator a small forklift and two allterrain vehicles were parked near an open tool bin by the door the bay was dimly lit but warmed by the sounds of an african percussion band blaring from a cd player dirk absorbed all this as he was marched into the warehouse and ordered to stand against a corrugated tin wall the mechanic and the gunman conversed for a moment in what dirk guessed was malagasy then the mechanic ran to report the presence of the intruder the gunman stood next to the workbench with the disassembled motor rocking on his heels as he held his weapon on dirk he was young no more than seventeen his hair was worn long and he stood with a sulking hunch it was easy to see he had no formal military training grease stains covered his militarystyle fatigues and his fingers dirk guessed he was primarily employed as a mechanics assistant with secondary duty as a guard in a relaxed manner dirk brought an open hand to his mouth and tilted it up as if drinking water he asked in a raspy voice leau the gunman eyed dirk closely the numa marine engineer carried no visible weapons his hair was full of sand and his jumpsuit was caked with dust he wore no shoes only dirty frayed socks emerging from the desert in such a condition he seemed anything but a threat the gunman relaxed slightly and slowly turned to the workbench where a khaki daypack sat on a stool he pulled a canteen from the packs side pocket and tossed it to dirk dirk unscrewed the cap and gulped down several swallows of the water it was warm and somewhat foul but he would have gladly consumed a gallon of the stuff he smiled at the gunman then savored a few more gulps thank you he said and replaced the cap he took a cautious step forward and reached out with a long arm to return the canteen the gunman hesitated before stepping forward and extending his free hand dirk waited for the young mans fingers to come within a hair of his own then let the canteen slip the boy lunged forward but the canteen bobbled from his outstretched hand and fell to the floor he suddenly caught himself and rose up only to be struck by a left hook that tagged him on the cheek he staggered against the workbench but quickly pulled his weapon up dirk didnt give him the opportunity to shoot he dove into the guard pinning the assault rifle between their two bodies the gunman tried to spin and knock dirk clear but he didnt have the strength dirk ignored the weapon aimed inches from his face and clutched the young mans fatigues drawing him tight to keep the gun aimed clear while with his other hand he groped the top of the workbench feeling a hard metallic object he pulled it up and swung it against the gunmans skull it took three blows before he fell limp and slumped to the floor dirk looked in his hand and saw he was holding a piston and connecting rod from the disassembled engine definitely a knocking problem he muttered and tossed it onto the workbench he sprinted to one of the allterrain vehicles parked by the door each had a small mesh trailer attached for hauling parts and equipment but more importantly each had a key in the ignition he straddled one of the vehicles and turned the key the motor spun to life just as three men appeared at the doorway dirk reached over and ripped the ignition cable from the adjacent atv while twisting his own throttle the little vehicle lurched forward heading toward the open door ahead of him dirk saw that the original mechanic had returned accompanied by a dockhand and a man in fatigues brandishing a pistol dirk goosed the throttle and headed straight for them the mechanic jumped to dirks right while the other two ducked left around the corner of the building with the trailer bouncing wildly behind him dirk tore out of the warehouse and into the sunlight he whipped the handlebars left careening around the corner and after the two men the dockhand jumped clear at the last second but the man in fatigues hesitated the atvs flared fender creased him in the leg knocking him to the ground dirk had to swerve right to avoid a wall of fuel drums which sent the empty trailer bounding onto the prone man the man cried out as the trailers tires rolled over him leaving him caked in dust dirk had hoped to turn back and drive past the warehouse toward the beach but was thwarted when the dockhand emerged from the building with the assault rifle cursing himself for not taking the weapon he wheeled the atv sharply left and sped down the front of the dock he waited for a fusillade of lead but it never arrived he quickly saw why directly ahead a half dozen laborers manned the conveyor system the dockhand didnt want to fire into his compatriots just beyond dirk held his course to increase the distance from the armed dockhand but ultimately he had nowhere to go ahead the conveyor blocked the width of the dock while to his left sat towering mounds of gray ore he edged close to the dock as the workers at the conveyor began pointing and yelling barreling toward the heavy conveyor he seemed bent on suicide he wondered that himself but he had no other choice building speed down the quay he held steady until just a few yards from the conveyor as the workers ducked behind the ramp for cover dirk jammed the atv to his left the allterrain vehicles knobby offroad tires slid on the sandy dock as he threw it into the turn while holding the throttle to its stops all four wheels began to bite and the atv shot forward toward the mound of ore being loaded onto the ship dirk was nearly jolted off his seat when the front wheels met the base of the pile but the atv proved its mettle by blasting straight up the mound it shot past an idling frontend loader and climbed past the feeder end of the conveyor it was twenty feet up the side of the steep pile when its momentum began to waver and dirk eased the front wheels to his right he came dangerously close to flipping the vehicle but the trailer acted as an anchor and helped him to pivot the atv around one of the laborers ran yelling as dirk sped back down the hill angling past the far side of the conveyor a small avalanche of ore crashed to the dock after him and sent the remaining workers scrambling for cover as it slammed onto the dock at high speed the atv bounced high into the air before landing on all four wheels the trailer was less artistic breaking free of the atvs hitch and smacking into the freighter then dropping into the water dirk had to throw the atv into a hard left to avoid the same fate braking and skidding he barely clung to the wheel as the atv danced and slid one of the rear wheels struck a bollard which jolted the vehicle back on track and dirk accelerated hard down the dock ahead he could see the freedom of the open desert in a gap between the dock and the dormitory but as he sped ahead another atv appeared from around the buildings corner dirk slowed and waved as he passed the other rider who he realized was the smirking gunman in green fatigues from the patrol boat the gunman gave dirk an empty stare and then the light of recognition flipped on by then dirk had opened his throttle and was tearing past the building across the dock scores of men were running toward them shouting and pointing the gunman whipped his atv around and gave chase a sharp rocky cliff backed the lagoon forcing dirk to ascend a lesser hill that ran parallel to the dock shots rang out from below peppering the hillside around him he zigzagged up the hill generating a billow of dust that obscured his path ducking low he urged the atv on until cresting the rise and disappearing from view below as he turned and angled toward the beach he ventured a glance over his shoulder green fatigues was hot on his trail less than fifty yards away dirk squeezed harder on the throttle as the atv wallowed through a dry wash passing the other atv earlier he had seen a holster on the drivers belt once again he found himself weaponless against an armed man but at least he had the atv and he knew where he was going green fatigues indeed had a holster with a loaded pistol which he removed with one hand when the vehicles hit a stretch of sandy flats steering and accelerating with his right hand he used his left to fire a handful of potshots all of which missed by a wide margin over his shoulder dirk caught sight of the gun and threw his atv into a shallow serpentine course already kicking up a large cloud of dust it now sprayed wide walls of brown that offered sporadic cover but that maneuver also allowed the pursuer to draw closer until he was choking on dirks dust just twenty yards away dirk veered left along a flat rise above the beach briefly losing his companion in the haze when green fatigues broke free of the dust he had a clear view of dirk and fired two shots one of them hit home dirk heard a loud pop as one of the rear tires burst the ruptured tire thumped loudly and dirk muscled the handlebars to maintain control he was as good as finished green fatigues could speed ahead or alongside and finish him off with an easy shot weighing his options dirk prepared to swing the atv around and force a collision but ahead in the sand he saw footprints that angled sharply inland they were his own footprints from earlier in the day and they signaled a possible riposteone that just might give him a fighting chance the sandy surface gave way to dustcovered rock which rose in an undulating fashion the gradual inclination concealed the approaching precipice the one dirk had climbed that morning and the one dirk hoped to use to his advantage over the rocky surface the atvs trailing dust grew lighter forcing dirk into a dangerous maneuver rather than dodge his pursuer he angled ahead of him desperate to obscure his vision as dirk crossed his earlier footprints he eased off the throttle the lip of the precipice appeared a second later he hesitated drawing the gunman in close before downshifting and jamming on the brakes the atv wavered as its knobby tires skidded across the rock dirk swung his leg over the seat let go of the handlebars and leaped barely ten feet from the ledge dirks atv regained momentum and soared over the side green fatiguess hardcharging atv arrived a few seconds later too late he saw the abrupt dropoff he mashed on the brakes and flung the handlebars over with white knuckles but to no avail the atv skidded off the edge and plunged over the cliff green fatigues flying up and over it screaming as he fell dirk had missed the sight after jumping from his own atv he had pulled himself into a tuck before hitting the ground hard and rolling several times sliding feetfirst toward the cliff he clawed at the ground as his legs went over the ledge he stopped just short legs dangling midair with his head pounding he pulled his lower body back over the ledge and lay on his back recovering he felt scrapes and bruises but hed managed not to break any bones after a minute he rose to his feet and peered over the side forty feet below his atv stood on end its nose augured into the ground and its body telescoped a few yards away the other atv lay upside down its wheels still spinning dirk didnt see green fatigues at first then spotted a motionless leg protruding from beneath the vehicle dirk walked along the cliff moving gingerly until his limbs loosened glancing back toward the dock facility he saw some movement a small foot patrol heading his way just beyond at the mouth of the lagoon he saw the patrol boat heading to sea they were taking the theft of the atv rather seriously dirk thought he retraced his morning footsteps until he reached a shallow face in the ridge where he could slide down at the crash scene he found the inverted atv battered but mostly intact he dug his feet into the sand positioned a shoulder against its side and shoved rolling the vehicle back onto its wheels the mangled body of its rider lay embedded in the sand his back and head unnaturally twisted dirk pocketed the mans pistol and climbed onto the atv the seat and handlebars were bent and two fenders torn off but the drivetrain looked undamaged he hit the ignition button and heard the starter grind and grind gasoline had drained from the fuel line while the vehicle sat inverted and it took several tries before the engine caught dirk gunned it and the atv took off the exposed tires sending sand flying at the far end of the beach dirk pulled up alongside the small berm summer appeared from a large hole in the center and waved after pulling herself inside she had excavated nearly a third of the rubber raft he hopped off the idling atv and ran to her you all right fine except for my dead leg she noticed his bruised appearance and the even more battered atv i thought i heard a crash what happened i had a fallingout with an acquaintance he motioned his thumb over his shoulder the crowd at the port facility is the same bunch that rammed us i borrowed one of their atvs and they arent too happy about it summer saw the urgency in his eyes we need to go i think that would be a good idea he scooped her off the ground and carried her to the atv wait she said the barbarigos logbook dirk gave her a quizzical look thats a rubber raft buried in the sand its from a vessel called the barbarigo i found a book wrapped in oilskin under the bench she said pointing at the mound i cant read it because its written in italian but it looks like a logbook dirk stepped to the partially buried raft and reached in he froze when he saw a fully exposed skeleton which he had somehow missed seconds earlier the torso lay near a bench seat on which sat the oilskinwrapped logbook he snatched it climbed onto the atv behind summer and handed it to her you didnt mention its scribe was still hanging around theres at least two other bodies we need to have the ships archaeologist examine the site dirk reached around his sister and twisted the throttle perhaps another day leaving the bones and beach behind they rode up a rocky ridge that fingered into the sea from its peak they could view the opposite coastline curve before them in a broad expanse of sandy flats the turquoise hull of the alexandria bobbed in the swells several miles distant dirk focused his eyes on the ground driving down the rocky hill as fast as he dared aware of summers impaired ability to stay seated summer was the first to notice the vessel a small zodiac skimming parallel to the beach ahead when the atvs tires reached the flat sands dirk accelerated to top speed the zodiac was traveling away from them but he quickly closed the gap honking the atvs highpitched horn he caught the attention of jack dahlgren who was piloting the zodiac with a numa crewman the parties converged dirk driving his atv into the waves as dahlgren drew the zodiac near enjoying the local tourist sights in comfort ah see dahlgren said by way of greeting the texans relief at finding them alive was evident in his eyes more than we really cared to dirk said permission to come aboard dahlgren nodded and inched the zodiac alongside the atv summers lost feeling in her left leg dirk said we think shes bent dahlgren plucked summer still clutching the barbarigos logbook off the atv and set her in the inflatable boat everyone aboard alexandria will be anxious to hear what happened had us plenty worried when we found the sub downstairs without you in it guess youll have plenty of time in the chamber to fill us in he had to sit down and goose the motor to keep the zodiac from swamping under a wave as dahlgren pivoted back to the atv so dirk could jump aboard he noticed the shredded jumpsuit and multiple bruises if you dont mind me saying you look like you went square dancing with a rototiller if its any consolation i feel like it dirk said you dont want to park that atv on dry land no the owner was rather troublesome about me borrowing it i suggest we get to the alexandria as soon as possible dahlgren gunned the outboard motor and steered toward the research ship dirk gazed across the horizon spotting the patrol boat speeding in their direction a moment later a deep rumble drowned out the whine of the outboard and a shadow darted over the zodiac dirk looked up to see a lowflying c lumber over it was painted gray with the multicolored flag of south africa displayed on its tail dahlgren waved at the plane slowing the zodiac to be heard over its motor searchandrescue plane we dialed up out of pretoria about time they showed up i guess we better let them know youre safe he retrieved a handheld radio and informed the alexandria of dirk and summers appearance while they waited for the message to be relayed to the airplane dirk tapped dahlgrens shoulder and pointed to the approaching patrol boat call back and ask the plane if they would buzz those guys tell them we suspect theyre part of a local piracy ring i reckon the faa doesnt extend to these waters dahlgren said and relayed the message the c had already receded to a speck on the horizon then it turned and grew larger the pilot brought it down low barely fifty feet above the waves approaching the patrol craft off its stern it caught the crew by surprise several gunmen threw themselves to the deck as the roar of the four horsepower turboprop motors engulfed the patrol boat the plane flew past made a lazy turn and came back for a second run across the patrol boats beam this time a few of the braver crewmen waved their weapons but nobody fired a round undaunted the cs pilot made three more passes each one lower than the last the patrol boat accepted the message reluctantly veering off and motoring back to shore tracking it for good measure the c hung around at low altitude for almost an hour before dipping its wings and heading home dirk looked to dahlgren remind me to send a case of beer to the south african air force those boys dont mess around do they a few minutes later they pulled alongside the alexandria dirk and summer were surprised to see their mangled submersible on the stern deck as they were hoisted aboard we found her promptly with the sonar and were able to rig her for lifting with an rov dahlgren said we renewed our shore search when we didnt find you inside the siblings were greeted warmly as they boarded but summer sensed a nervousness even from dahlgren as she was helped onto a gurney the ships doctor rushed them to the decompression chamber which was already prepped with food and medical supplies dirk tried to duck out but the doctor ordered him in as a precaution before the hatch closed dahlgren poked his head inside to ensure they were comfortable might not be a good idea to linger around the area dirk said we were able to plant all the seismic sensors before our runin with the patrol boat we can deal with the thugs another time the captains already winding us up for a run to durban at flank speed dahlgrens face was taught and serious why durban i thought we were headed up to mozambique from here the doctor yelled from behind the chamber to seal the hatch bad news im afraid dahlgren said your dad and al have gone missing in the pacific before the words could sink in the heavy metal hatch closed and the chambers occupants were pressurized back into the depths pitt felt like he was in a chamber of his own only his was a chamber of horrors by the hour the dank prison he shared on the adelaide felt more and more claustrophobic a daily rise in the outside temperature had turned the bay into a stiflinghot oven making matters worse the heat intensified the foul odors generated by the confined men and two dead bodies pitt felt constant hunger but was thankful they were given plenty of drinking water periodically the hatch door would be thrown open and two armed men would toss in boxes of bread and other dried stores from the galley the prisoners valued the brief gusts of fresh air nearly as much as the food pitt and the swat team had tried formulating an escape plan but their options were nonexistent the storage bay had been stripped of any tools or equipment to force another exit the locked hatch they found was guarded around the clock multiple attempts at testing the handle or hinges were instantly met by a rapping from a gun barrel on the opposite side whenever the hatch was opened to deliver food and water at least two men stood ready with assault rifles noticing the stale rolls they had been given to eat had hardened to the consistency of granite giordino suggested using those to attack the guards pitts friend rebounded swiftly from his wound which somehow showed no signs of infection after sleeping nearly three straight days giordino had awoken with an irritable vigor and he quickly regained his strength despite the sparse diet while most of the men grew resigned to their captivity a few began losing control fights broke out among the crew of the adelaide while another man gave in to fits of hysterical yelling pitt felt an uneasy gratitude when he noticed a reduction in the ships engine revolutions signaling their arrival in protected waters pitt had counted the number of hours passed since he was thrown into confinement traveling at sixteen knots he calculated the adelaide could have covered almost four thousand miles placing them anywhere between alaska and peru but the warm temperatures suggested something equatorial if the ship had held its southeasterly heading pitt figured they could be somewhere off southern mexico or central america confirmation came soon after the ship had stopped and started several times accompanied by the sound of dock activity the ship got under way and sailed another three hours before stopping for good a short time later the prisoners were roused from their compartment the men stepped from the hot and humid storage bay to an equally hot and humid deck the ship was berthed at a dock stern first surrounded on three sides by dense jungle only a small patch of blue off the bow showed they had sailed from a larger body of water and backed into a narrow inlet barely large enough for the freighter to fit the brightness of early morning stung their eyes yet pitt noted the sun was nowhere in sight someone really likes their jungle around here giordino said pointing a finger skyward shading his eyes pitt saw a jungle canopy overhead it took him several seconds to realize it was a huge swath of camouflage netting that was strung over the entire dock complex maybe just privacy nuts pitt said he looked at the adelaide confirming his suspicions the ships name had been repainted labrador while the funnel and deck railing had been painted new colors the hijackers were well versed at theft and concealment on a grand scale the prisoners were herded to a gangway and marched off the ship where they were greeted by a line of armed men in fatigues several of them partnered with guard dogs the captives were left standing along the dock for several minutes which allowed time for pitt and giordino to study the facilities the dock operation was modest consisting of two small cranes and a conveyor system behind it were several large concrete pads dusted with gray sedimenttransfer stations for the raw ore and processed rare earth elements that were transferred in and out of the facility beyond the dock area several lowslung buildings poked through the foliage pitt suspected they were separationandextraction plants used to refine the stolen rare earth ores the puttputt of a small motor preceded the appearance of a golf cart bearing a muscular blond man wearing a fitted uniform with a holstered pistol on his hip a coiled bullwhip dangled from a belt hook on the opposite side pitt noticed the guards tense at his arrival looks like a lion tamer giordino whispered for a circus i want no part of pitt said the overseer johansson crossed the dock and spoke to gomez who had followed the prisoners off the ship the swede examined the freighter with a satisfied gleam shes carrying a full load of crushed monazite gomez said testing confirmed high concentrates of neodymium cerium and dysprosium excellent the extraction facilities have been waiting for new material we will engage the new prisoners in offloading the ore what about the ship she would make a nice addition to the fleet determine what reconfigurations are required to erase her identity and well discuss it with bolcke after shes unloaded johansson turned his back on gomez to examine the new captives he reviewed the men with a caustic eye paying particular attention to the swat team welcome to puertas del infierno he said the gates of hell you now belong to me he waved his arm across the dock toward the buildings beyond this is an orerefining center we take raw ore and process it into various minerals of high value you will be workers in the process if you work hard you will live if you do not complain you will live and if you do not attempt escape you will live he stared down the line of weakened men are there any questions a crewman from the adelaide one whod had a difficult time in captivity cleared his throat when will we be released he asked johansson approached the man and smiled at him then he casually pulled his sidearm and shot the man in the forehead a swarm of nearby jungle birds screeched at the sound as the man tumbled backward falling into the water dead the other assembled captives gaped in stunned silence johansson grinned are there any more questions met by barely a heartbeat he holstered his weapon good again i welcome you to puerta del infierno now lets get to work the deep throb of the towboats engine fell silent revealing the lesser sound of waves lapping against her hull awakened by the absent growl and vibration ann arose from her bunk and stretched her arms she rubbed her wrists where the handcuffs irritated her skin and stepped to a tiny porthole on the starboard bulkhead it was still dark scattered lights dotted the shore a mile or so across the river indicating they had docked on its eastern bank the river she was certain was the mississippi from their starting point in paducah there was only one way to go downriver taking the ohio to its confluence with the mississippi near cairo illinois the night before she had peered out to see the glowing lights of a large city wondering if they shined from memphis as she watched the silhouette of a large freighter pass upriver she guessed they were somewhere near new orleans she rinsed her face in a basin and again searched the cramped cabin for a potential weapon it was a hopeless exercise she had performed at least twenty times before but at least it kept her mind working she got only as far as an empty bureau when she heard the lock jiggle and the cabin door open pablo stood in the doorway a bemused look in his eyes and a baseball bat in his hands come along he said we are changing vessels he led her onto the towboats deck where he slipped the bat across her back wedging it into the crooks of her elbows there will be no swimming exhibition this time keeping one hand firmly grasping the bat he led her off the towboat the contortion made anns shoulders ache as they stepped onto a dimly lit dock pablo guided her past the barge where a mobile dock crane had hoisted the flatbed trailer from the deck stray wisps of hay fluttered through the air as pablo and ann followed the crane which crept down an embedded rail track toward a small freighter in the faint light she could make out the ships name on the transom salzburg though the dock was deserted save for the crane operator several armed men wearing fatigues lined the freighters rail please let me go ann said with exaggerated fear pablo laughed not before we make our delivery then perhaps you can win your freedom he added with a leer he marched her up the freighters forward gangway and across the deck a large rectangular dish mounted to a wheeled platform blocked their path next to it a crewman was checking cables at a control station mounted with power generators and computer displays as they passed the man looked up briefly locking eyes with ann she gave him a submissive look pleading with her eyes for help he smiled as they passed dont get cooked he said pablo pushed ann ahead guiding her to the superstructure at the stern and up two flights to the crews quarters her new cabin was slightly larger than the last but featured a similarly minuscule porthole i hope you are pleased with the accommodations pablo said removing the baseball bat from her arms perhaps later in the voyage we can spend some time together he stepped from the cabin and locked the door from the outside ann sat on the hard bunk and glared at the door despite her act with pablo most of her fears had been replaced by anger clearly the freighter was leaving the country taking both the sea arrows motor and its plans she would be trapped in the cabin for days or even weeks rather than lament she contemplated how it had all been pulled off her analytical mind went to work stewing over the thefts acquiring the sea arrows plans and motor had been all too easy for pablo he must have had inside help the involvement of the two men who had abducted her and then were killed indicated as much and what about her why had she been abducted she could draw only one conclusion that she must have been getting close to identifying the source she racked her brains reviewing the contractors and persons of interest she kept returning to tom cerny could the white house aide have been alerted to her inquiry she paced the small cabin noticing several cigarette burns on the corner desk the marks made her think of the crewman and his odd greeting dont get cooked she repeated the words nagged at her until suddenly their meaning struck like a bolt of lightning of course she said disgusted that it hadnt come to her sooner dont get cooked indeed a latenight commercial flight from durban via johannesburg proved the quickest way back to washington for dirk and summer they were blearyeyed when they staggered off the plane early the next morning at reagan national airport remarkably summer walked freely through the terminal showing stiffness from the flight but no lingering paralysis from her decompression sickness timely immersion in the alexandrias deco chamber had proved her salvation while the numa ship rushed from the tip of madagascar to durban summer and dirk had been pressurized to an equivalent depth of four hundred feet the paralysis in summers leg promptly disappeared the ships medical team slowly relieved the pressure in the chamber allowing the nitrogen bubbles in their tissues to dissipate when they were released from the chamber almost two days later summer found she could walk with only a faint lingering ache since flying could aggravate the symptoms the ships doctor insisted they not board an airplane for twentyfour hours fortunately their steaming time to durban occupied the full duration free of the chamber they had time to brief the others on their work in the submersible inspect its damage and book their flight home before racing to durbans king shaka international airport the moment the alexandria touched the dock after collecting their bags at reagan they took a cab across the tarmac to their fathers hangar letting themselves in they stored their bags and cleaned themselves up in the loft apartment you think dad would mind if we borrowed one of his cars to run to the office summer asked hes always given us a standing offer to drive what we like dirk said he pointed to a silverandburgundy roadster parked near a workbench he said in an email before he left for the pacific that he just got that packard running strong why dont we take it he checked to see that it had plenty of gas while summer opened a garage door sliding into the drivers seat he pulled the choke and adjusted the throttle lever mounted on the steering wheel and hit the starter button the big straighteight engine murmured to life letting it warm up for a moment he pulled the car outside and waited for summer to lock the hangar she jumped into the passenger seat with a travel bag in tow not noticing a white van parked across an adjacent field whats with the funky seats she asked the packard roadsters tight cockpit held two rigid seats summers passenger seat was permanently offset a few inches farther from the dash than dirks drivers seat more room for the driver to turn and shift at high speed dirk explained pointing to the floormounted gear lever ill gladly take the extra legroom built in the model packard chassis carried one of the factorys rarest bodies a sleek boattail speedster the trunk line tapered to an angular point giving the car a highly streamlined appearance sporting dual sidemounted spare tires the body gleamed with metallic pewter paint contrasted by burgundy fenders and a matching bodylength stripe narrow woodlite headlights on the prow combined with an angled windshield added to the sensation that the car was in motion even while parked dirk drove north onto the george washington parkway finding that the packard loped along easily with the highway traffic it was only a tenminute drive to the numa headquarters a tall glass structure that bordered the potomac dirk parked in the underground garage and they took an employee elevator to the top floor and rudi gunns office his secretary directed them to the computer resource center so they dropped down three flights to the hightech lair of hiram yaeger they found gunn and yaeger parked in front of a wallsized video screen examining satellite photos of an empty sea with bedraggled hair and circles under their eyes both looked as if they hadnt slept in days but the men perked up at the sight of pitts children glad to have you back gunn said you gave us quite a scare when your submersible went missing summer smiled us too i thought we were going to have to sedate rudi yaeger said your leg okay summer just fine i think the coach seat from johannesburg was more painful than the bends she eyed a collection of dirty coffee cups on the table before breaking the mood whats the latest on dad and al both men turned grim unfortunately theres not much to report gunn said he described pitts mission of protecting the ore carrier while yaeger dialed up a map of the eastern pacific they boarded the adelaide about a thousand miles southeast of hawaii yaeger said a navy frigate on exercise out of san diego was scheduled to meet them when they neared the coast and escort them to long beach the adelaide never appeared any sign of debris dirk asked no gunn said weve had searchandrescue craft from hawaii and the mainland overflying the area for days the navy has dispatched two vessels to the scene and the air force has even sent in some longrange reconnaissance drones theyve all come up empty dirk noted a white horizontal line beginning at the left edge of the screen that ended when it intersected a red line from hawaii is that the adelaides track her ais beacon provided her track to that point shortly after your dad and the swat team went aboard yaeger said after that the ais signal went dead so she sank summer asked her voice breaking not necessarily gunn said she could have simply disengaged the tracking system which would be an obvious move after a hijacking weve drawn a couple of big circles around her last reported position to see where she could have gone yaeger replaced the ocean map with a split screen of two satellite ocean photos at the bottom was overlaid a stock photo of a large green bulk carrier labeled adelaide were looking at coastal satellite photos to see if she might have popped up somewhere hiram has accessed every public and notsopublic source of satellite reconnaissance unfortunately the point of disappearance is smack in the middle of a large dead zone in satellite coverage so were jumping to the coastlines north south and central america for starters yaeger stifled a yawn should keep us busy till christmas how can we help summer asked weve got satellite images for most of the major west coast ports from the past four days ill divvy them up and see if anyone can spot a ship resembling the adelaide yaeger set up two laptops and downloaded the images everyone went to work scouring the photos for a large green cargo ship they worked all through the day studying image after image until their eyes burned yet hopes were raised as they pegged eleven ships from the sometimes fuzzy and obscured photos that appeared to fit the adelaides profile three in long beach two in manzanillo four to the panama canal and one each to san antonio chile and puerto caldera costa rica yaeger said i cant imagine any of the long beach vessels would be ours dirk said unless they ran to another port to offload first gunn looked at his watch its still early out west how about we break for dinner when we reconvene we can begin calling the port authorities at each location they should be able to confirm if the adelaide cleared their local facilities good thought dirk said standing and stretching ive run out of gas on a diet of airline food and coffee just a second summer said before we break i need a quick favor from hiram and then ill need your help in making a delivery she picked up her travel pack which clinked with the sound of bottles inside im pretty hungry can we grab a bite on the way where were headed she said i can positively guarantee there will be something good to eat the packard roared out of the parking garage and skirted past a white van at the edge of the outside lot before merging into the evening rushhour traffic dirk crossed into georgetown as an evening breeze tousled summers hair in the open car turning down a shady residential street filled with elegant homes dirk stopped in front of a former carriage house that ages ago had been transformed into a courtly freestanding residence they had barely rung the bell when the front door was thrown open by a gargantuan man sporting an overflowing gray beard st julien perlmutters eyes twinkled as he greeted dirk and summer and invited them inside i nearly ate without you he said you were expecting us dirk asked of course summer emailed me with the particulars of your madagascar mystery i insisted you both come by for dinner the instant you returned dont you two talk to each other summer smiled sheepishly at her brother then followed perlmutter through a bookinfested living room and into a formal dining area where an antique cherrywood table sat overloaded with food perlmutter was a marine historian one of the best on the planet but he had a second love as a gourmand his eyes lit up when summer opened her bag and offered him three bottles of wine from south africa a vergelegen chardonnay and a pair of red varietals from de toren he examined the labels with delight outstanding selections shall we he wasted no time in finding a corkscrew and pouring the chardonnay i am of course distressed to hear of your fathers absence may he be in safe port he said raising his glass while discussing pitts disappearance they dined on pork loin in chipotle sauce fingerling potatoes and baked asparagus fresh georgia peaches in a creamandbrandy sauce were devoured for dessert the hosts french cook and housekeeper had the night off so summer and dirk helped perlmutter clear the table and wash the dishes before sitting back down at the table the wine was delicious summer but dont toy with me perlmutter said you know what i really want to get my hands on i thought youd never ask she opened her travel bag and pulled out the carefully wrapped journal from the beached life raft the log of the barbarigo she said so thats what this is all about dirk said and here i thought you were just happy to see us perlmutter laughed with a roar that echoed through the house a longtime friend of their father he had readily taken to pitts twin children as a sort of kindly uncle my boy your company is welcome anytime he opened and poured another of summers bottles but a good nautical mystery is sweeter than wine perlmutter took the package and carefully unwrapped its oilskin covering the leatherbound journal showed signs of wear but was otherwise undamaged he gently opened the cover and read the title page written by hand in bold lettering viaggio di sommergibile barbarigo giugno capitano di corvetta umberto de julio perlmutter looked up at summer and smiled thats our submarine submarine dirk asked the raft on the beach summer said it contained the remains of crewmen from a world war two italian submarine the barbarigo a large boat of the marcello class perlmutter said she had an illustrious record in the atlantic early in the war sinking six vessels and downing an aircraft but she lost her teeth in when she was assigned to a project with the code name of aquila latin for eagle dirk said summer gave her brother a suspicious look astronomy he explained i remember it from a constellation near aquarius mule would have been a more befitting name perlmutter said the germans were concerned over their high loss of surface ships while trading war materials with japan so they convinced the italians to convert eight of their largest and somewhat outdated submarines to transport duty the interiors were gutted and most of their armaments removed so they could carry a maximum amount of cargo sounds like dangerous duty dirk said it was four of the vessels were sunk outright one was scuttled and the other three captured in asia before completing a roundtrip or at least thats what the history books say perlmutter began scanning the pages examining the dates so what happened to the barbarigo summer asked designated aquila five she departed bordeaux on june bound for singapore with a cargo of mercury steel and aluminum bars radio contact was lost a few days later and it was presumed she was sunk somewhere near the azores he skipped ahead to the last page my italian is deplorable but i read the last entry as november nearly five months later dirk said something doesnt figure i have the answer i hope right here summer pulled out a sheaf of printed pages i had hiram scan the logbook into his computer system he claimed it was childs play to translate it into english and gave me the output right before we left she began passing the pages around the table letting dirk and perlmutter devour them like a pair of hungry coyotes here we go dirk said it says here that they were spotted and attacked by two aircraft in the bay of biscayne shortly after leaving port but safely eluded them their radio mast was damaged which prevented them from communicating with central command via the journal they followed the barbarigos voyage around the cape of good hope and across the indian ocean the submarine offloaded its cargo in singapore and then was diverted to a small malaysian port near kuala lumpur on september we took on tons of oxidized ore called red death by the locals summer read a german scientist named steiner oversaw the loading and joined the crew for the return voyage the first officer later wrote that steiner stayed holed up in his cabin with a stack of physics books for the rest of the trip dirk said red death perlmutter said i wonder if it is something like edgar allan poes plague of the same name ill have to take a look at thatand this fellow steiner certainly a curious cargo the trio flipped through several weeks of entries describing the submarines return across the indian ocean on the ninth of november the handwriting turned hurried and the pages showed saltwater stains this is where they got into trouble while off the coast of south africa perlmutter said he read aloud a terse description of the barbarigo diving to avoid a nighttime air attack after eluding several bombing runs the crew believed they had escaped the attackonly to discover that the subs propeller had been disabled or blown off entirely dirk and summer sat silently as perlmutter read of the resulting tragedy with no propulsion the sub remained submerged for twelve hours fearing that additional aircraft had been called to the scene surfacing at midday they found themselves in an empty sea drifting to the southeast carried past the shipping lanes and without a longrange radio the officers feared they might drift to their deaths in the antarctica captain de julio ordered the crew to abandon ship and they took to the four life rafts stowed beneath the forward deck saluting their beloved vessel as they left her side in a mixup of orders the last officer off failed to prime the scuttle charges and sealed the main hatch rather than sinking before them the barbarigo drifted off toward the horizon perlmutter stopped reading and raised his eyebrows like a pair of drawbridges my word he said quietly that is most curious what happened to the other three boats summer asked the log entries become spottier at this point perlmutter said they attempted to reach south africa and were within sight of land when a storm struck the boats were dispersed in the rough seas and captain de julio said the men in his boat never again saw the other three during the ordeal they lost five men all their food and water and their sail and oars the raft was carried east drifting away from shore with the coastal current eventually the weather turned hot and dry with no fresh water they lost two more crewmen leaving only the captain the first officer and two engineers ravaged by thirst they eventually spotted land again and were able to paddle closer high winds and huge swells carried them ashore and tossed them onto the beach perlmutter said they found themselves in a hot desert desperate for water the last entry states the captain went off alone in search of water as the others were too weak to walk the journal ends god bless the barbarigo and her crew we can attest to the barrenness of the region summer said after a time what a tragedy that they nearly made it safely to south africa and ended up a thousand miles away in madagascar they fared slightly better than the crewmen in the other three boats dirk said perlmutter nodded though he appeared lost in thought he rose from his seat and padded into the living room then returned a few minutes later with an armful of books and an inquisitive look congratulations summer it would appear as if you have solved two enduring mysteries of the sea two she asked yes the fate of the barbarigo and the identity of the south atlantic wraith ill buy the former dirk said but whats this wraith perlmutter opened the first book and flipped through its pages from the logbook of the merchant ship manchester off the falkland islands february light seas winds out of the southwest three or four at the first officer reported an object off our starboard beam appeared at first to be a whale carcass but believe it is a manmade vessel he closed the book and opened another the freighter southern star april near santa cruz argentina unknown object possible sailing vessel spotted adrift two miles distant black hull small superstructure amidships appears abandoned perlmutter picked up a third book accounts of a south georgia whaling station in february of the whaler paulita arrived with a kill of three mature gray whales captain reports spotting a ghost ship low black hull small sail amidships drifting one hundred miles north crew called it the south atlantic wraith you think the barbarigo is this atlantic wraith summer asked its entirely possible for a period of twentytwo years there were sightings of a supposed ghost ship adrift in the south atlantic for one reason or another no one seemed to get a close view but the descriptions are all similar it seems to me that a bottledup submarine could drift about an empty sea for quite a while at those southerly latitudes the subs conning tower could easily ice over dirk said so from a distance it resembled a sail that might be confirmed in the last recorded sighting perlmutter opened the final book it was in an endurance sailor named leigh hunt was making a solo roundtheworld voyage when he saw something unusual ah here it is he said and began reading aloud the passage while approaching the magellan straits i encountered a horrific storm brutal even for these waters for thirty hours i battled twentyfoot seas and raging winds that tried with all their fury to drive me onto the rocks around cape horn it was in the midst of this duel that i caught glimpse of the south atlantic wraith i thought it a berg at first for it was encrusted in ice but i could see the dark sharp edges of steel beneath she washed by me quickly carried with the winds and waves toward a sure death on the shores of tierra del fuego wow summer said still afloat in but apparently not for long if hunts account is accurate perlmutter said is hunt still alive she asked perhaps we could talk to him im afraid he was lost at sea a few years ago but his family might still possess his logbooks dirk finished his glass of wine and looked at his sister well summer i guess you are still leaving us with two enduring mysteries to solve yes summer said finishing his thought where the barbarigo sank and what she was carrying dirk and summer left perlmutters house satiated with good food and wine and piqued by the barbarigos strange fate the dinner had been a welcome respite from their worries about their father which returned the minute they said their goodbyes we best get back and see if rudi and hiram have had any luck with the port authorities dirk said ive been thinking we should reexamine the possibility that the adelaide traveled west as they walked to the street they heard a car door shut and dirk noticed two men sitting in a white van a few spaces behind the packard dirk fired up the packard with the first press of the starter and flipped on the headlamps while the woodlites looked great by daylight their nighttime performance didnt match the rest of the car easing away from the curb he drove slowly down the street watching in the rearview mirror as the vans lights flicked on when they reached the end of the street dirk turned right and mashed down the accelerator speeding down a treelined street a few seconds later the van screeched around the same corner summer noticed dirks focus on the mirror and glanced over her shoulder i dont want to sound paranoid she said but that same van may have been parked in the numa lot when we left the building one better dirk said i think it was also parked next to dads hangar this morning he meandered through the wealthy georgetown neighborhood turning down o street and heading west the van followed his every move staying a dozen lengths behind who would be following us summer asked someone related to the people in madagascar i cant imagine it might be someone interested in dad maybe we should just ask them he slowed the car as they approached a cross street just beyond was a pillared and gated pedestrian entrance to georgetown university portable barricades were normally in place to prevent vehicles from entering the gateway but they had been removed for a delivery truck exiting the campus as the truck pulled clear dirk hit the gas and skirted around it through the open gate a security guard gaped as the antique packard zipped by a few seconds later he had to jump back as the white van barreled through in pursuit dirk followed the road across the grounds a short distance to a circular drive a statue of the universitys founder john carroll sat at its center facing the entrance gate footlights illumined the statue in a yellow haze lending a lifelike aura to the longdead bishop dirk wheeled the packard around the back of the statue and slowed doubleclutching and dropping into first gear he watched for the lights of the van as it hurried onto campus and turned onto the circular drive dirk turned off the packards woodlites and gunned the engine the old car leaped forward as he turned the wheel hard shifting into second while keeping the accelerator pinned to the floorboard while the van was slowing the roadster shot around the circle rather than exit back toward the gate dirk held the wheel tight curving around the loop the vans taillights appeared in front of them and dirk had to brake to avoid rearending it summer reached over and turned the woodlites back on signaling to the pursuers that the game was up the vans driver hesitated unsure what had happened until he recognized the pale yellow beams of the packard behind him not prepared for a confrontation he stomped on the gas the vans tires chirped as it shot forward turning off the circular drive he took the first road he could a straight lane that ran behind a stately structure called healy hall and into the center of campus go after him summer said i didnt get his plate number dirk shoved the packard into gear and took off a fast car in its day the packard was powered by a straighteight engine that boasted horsepower the van might have left the old car behind on an open highway but not in the tight confines of the college campus the van sped past the large stone building only a few students were about and those in the street quickly cleared way for the speeding van the lane abruptly turned left into a side building complex but it was blocked by a campus policeman in a patrol car who had stopped to chat with a student unable to turn the vans driver continued straight bounding up and onto a concrete walkway that bisected a grass courtyard a girl on a bicycle screamed as she narrowly missed getting flattened the packard followed a few yards behind inciting an eruption of flashing lights from the patrol car i think were out of danger and into trouble summer said noting the lights behind dirk tightened his grip on the wheel as the roadster bounded over the uneven surface he followed the van along the walkway until it dropped off a curb into the parking lot of a student dormitory just ahead two freshmen were smuggling a beer keg into the building when the van charged at them the students dove for safety as the van sped by just clipping the keg the aluminum keg skittered across the parking lot and bounced off a retaining wall a short distance behind dirk braked hard but couldnt avoid the keg the front bumper caught it first gouging a hole in the aluminum before the right fender knocked the keg aside the shaken beer exploded in a foamy fountain that doused the side of the carand summer inside dads not going to like that dirk said she wiped the suds from her face youre right he wont its light beer the van and the packard accelerated through the parking lot pushed faster by the pursuing patrol car the van skidded out of the parking lot and onto a cross street unable to decide which way to turn the driver went straight bouncing onto a sloping gravel road that stretched ahead the road dipped down a small hill and turned onto the universitys football field in the middle of a practice the mens lacrosse team was forced to scatter as the van bounded across the artificial turf seeing the old packard and the police in pursuit several players fired lacrosse balls at the van ringing its side with dents a few took aim at the packard until they were disarmed by a wave and smile from the beerdrenched summer the van opened a sizable gap on the packard as it sped off the opposite side of the field and passed through an open gate the driver turned left on the facing street following a sign that directed them toward the universitys exit on canal road cmon we can lose them the vans passenger said fifty yards behind dirk heard a similar appeal from summer dont lose them i still havent gotten the full plate number dirk turned onto the road in pursuit but had to slow for a trio of coeds crossing the street to a tennis court behind him the campus police had nearly caught up the road curved past another residence hall before descending a landscaped hill out of campus dirk saw the van accelerate sharply down the hill and he tried to keep pace at the bottom of the hill a stoplight marked the intersection with canal road a busy thoroughfare that fed into suburban maryland the light was green and dirk feared it would change before he drew close then it flashed to yellow and he knew the van would have to stop only it didnt with the vans passenger urging him on the driver floored the gas when the light turned yellow the van was still fifty feet from the intersection when the light turned red remarkably the stopped cross traffic hesitated perhaps detecting the bouncing rays of the vans headlights as it roared down the hill charging into the intersection at better than seventy miles an hour the van crossed the near lanes of traffic and attempted to turn left into the far lanes but its speed was far too great and the panicked driver slammed on the brakes sending the van into a skid it slid across the asphalt until its right front tire kissed the curb the tire burst but the van kept moving hopping the curb and plowing into a low retaining wall the front fender buckling as the rear wheels bounded into and over the curb the combined forces flipped the van onto its side atop the retaining wall it slid a few feet then tumbled over the wall splashing roof first into the roads namesake the chesapeake and ohio canal flowing just beyond dirk skidded the packard to a halt before the stoplight and raced across the street with summer running a step behind they reached the retaining wall and peered over the canal had swallowed most of the van leaving only a portion of its stillspinning tires protruding a dull glow brightened the murky water at one end where the vans headlights had yet to short out dirk slipped off his jacket and kicked off his shoes ill try and get them out he said see if you can get the campus police to help he jumped into the canal and swam to the van diving along the passenger door the glowing headlights turned the waters visibility from zero to next to nothing and he had to find the open window frame by touch the frame height was barely a foot high telling him the roof had collapsed at impact it didnt bode well for the occupants reaching inside the open window he felt a lifeless body strapped in the seat groping blindly he found the buckle release and freed the seat belt the body dropped loosely and he pulled on the victims shoulders dragging him through the narrow window dirk shot to the surface gasping for air as he pulled the head and torso free of the water a bright flashlight beam aimed by the campus policeman shined on the victim and dirk knew he had wasted his time the passengers head tilted at a grotesque angle his neck broken dirk pulled the body to the bank and called up to the policeman give me your light he passed dirk the light as he reached out to help pull the body ashore dirk swam to the vans other side and dove once more with the flashlight he could now see the driver was also dead his torso pinned between the crushed roof and the steering wheel unlike his partner he hadnt been wearing a seat belt though running short of breath dirk shined the light past the driver and into the rear compartment a row of electronic processing devices was mounted on a shelf sitting nearby was a large acrylic parabolic dish used for eavesdropping pushing off from the door he swam to the back of the van and checked its license plate before popping to the surface he stroked to the bank where summer helped him up the incline no luck with the other one no hes dead too ive got paramedics on the way the policeman said his inexperience with fatalities was betrayed by a pale face he regained his composure but spoke with a forced tone of authority who are those people and why were you chasing them i dont know who they are but they stole something from us they get your money or was it jewelry or electronics no dirk replied looking at the dead man it was our words it was after midnight when dirk and summer staggered back into the numa computer center gunn and yaeger were still examining images on the large viewing screen i didnt realize you were taking time for a sevencourse meal gunn said then he noticed their appearance dirks hair was disheveled and his clothes damp while summers outfit sported a large stain and she reeked of stale beer what on earth happened to you two summer related the series of events including a twohour interrogation by the district of columbia police any idea who would have tailed you yaeger asked none dirk said i suspect it may have something to do with dad could be gunn said especially if they saw you leave his hangar this morning from a distance there is a strong resemblance between the two of you summer handed yaeger a slip of paper heres the vans license number the police wouldnt tell us but maybe you can identify the owner with ease yaeger said howre things progressing with the adelaide dirk asked not well gunn said weve been in contact with every major port authority along the coast of north south and central america no one has a record of the adelaide making an appearance in the past week guess that leaves two options dirk said they either offloaded at a private facility or they headed in another direction he neglected to mention a third option that the ship had sunk weve been talking about those scenarios yaeger said and we dont believe they headed west first it doesnt make a lot of sense to hijack a ship out of australia in the eastern pacific if you plan to take the cargo someplace in the western pacific the second problem is fuel fully loaded the adelaide would be stretching it to make a double crossing of the pacific without refueling makes sense that only leaves about a thousand other places she could have ducked into along the coast gunn and yaeger nodded they were searching for a transparent needle in a very large haystack gunn described the details of their port searches and the latest surveillance images while yaeger grabbed the keyboard and began typing a few minutes later he called to the others got something on your van he said as a virginia department of motor vehicles registration form appeared on the screen the owner is securetek of tysons corner virginia yaeger brought up another site on his screen the state corporate commission describes their business as providing data encryption links for closed network computer systems they have eight employees and their primary customer is the us government doesnt sound like the type of security company that would be eavesdropping on people summer said unless dirk said their declared business is a front it doesnt appear to be yaeger said after some additional research they have a number of valid contracts with the army and navy for data line installations returning to the corporate commissions site he noted that securetek was a wholly owned subsidiary of habsburg industries its a privately held firm so information is rather limited but theyre based in panama and have interests in mining and shipping yaeger performed several searches but found only brief mention of the firm a shipping periodical displayed a photo of one of the firms bulk carriers the graz dockside in singapore dirk glanced at the photo and sat up in his chair hiram can you enlarge that photo yaeger nodded blowing up the image until it filled the entire screen what is it summer asked the logo on the funnel everyone peered at the image of a white flower centered on the ships squat gold funnel i think thats an edelweiss summer said in keeping with the ships austrian name i imagine i saw that same flower on the freighter docked in madagascar dirk said the computer room fell silent then gunn asked hiram can you determine what kind of mining this habsburg industries is actually involved in they operate a small gold mine in panama near the colombian border the firm also has an active brokerage business in specialty ores including samarium lanthanum and dysprosium rare earth elements summer asked gunn nodded rare earth elements habsburg industries suddenly looks very interesting id wager the operation in madagascar was stealing rare earth minerals dirk said the reason they attacked our submersible was because we were working around the spot where they sank a hijacked ore ship we found a pristine wreck in the area that had recently been sunk summer said there was no apparent damage and the ships name was intentionally obscured jack dahlgren did some digging and thinks it was a bulk carrier called the norseman dirk said she was lost in the indian ocean four months ago carrying bastnasite ore from malaysia in case you hadnt guessed bastnasite contains rare earth elements could the habsburg ship in madagascar have been hijacked too summer asked yaeger checked the panamanian ship registry habsburg owns four ships all dry bulk carriers named graz innsbruck linz and salzburg whats the austrian connection dirk asked the company is owned by edward bolcke a mining engineer originally from austria yaeger said i cant find mention of any of the four ships reported missing then that makes habsburg a likely suspect in the disappearance of the adelaide summer said the key gunn said will be their four ships yaeger flexed his fingers over the keyboard lets see what we can find summer found coffee for everyone while yaeger taxed his mainframes circuitry pursuing inquiries on the four ships and their recent whereabouts it took the better part of an hour before he could narrow their locations he displayed a map of the world on which a multitude of colored dots shone signifying the ships recent ports of call the blue lights represent the graz yaeger said she is currently believed to be in or about malaysia over the last three weeks she was seen in tianjin shanghai and hong kong so shes not in play gunn said the yellow lights represent the innsbruck she made a transit through the panama canal three weeks ago and was seen in cape town south africa eight days ago dollars to donuts thats the ship i saw in madagascar dirk said likely so that leaves the linz and salzburg the linz was reported in a jakarta dry dock ten days ago and is believed to still be there for repairs so the green lights are the salzburg summer asked yes she appeared in manila a month ago then in the panama canal making a northerly crossing four days ago homeland security port surveillance indicates she was docked in new orleans just yesterday yaeger drew a line on the map across the pacific from manila to panama then he inserted a red triangle at a spot in the eastern part of the ocean the red mark is our last known position of the adelaide about six days ago the track of the salzburg passed within two hundred miles of the adelaides mark wouldnt have needed much of a course deviation to cross paths dirk said the timing is about right gunn said the salzburg would have been in that area five or six days before reaching the canal which is when the adelaide went quiet yaeger returned to an earlier database panama canal authority records show she made the transit last friday entering the pacific locks at three in the afternoon i might be able to find archival video of her a few minutes later he projected a clip from one of the locks it showed in grainy blackandwhite footage a midsized freighter waiting for the lock to flood an edelweiss flower clearly showed on its funnel dirk looked at the image with a sense of hope look at her plimsoll mark shes riding high in the water her holds must be empty youre right gunn said if she hijacked the adelaide she didnt transfer the cargo aboard yaeger pulled up a profile of the salzburg the adelaide is a hundred feet longer theyd have to leave a large chunk of her cargo behind if they ransacked and sank her the rare earth ore she was carrying was too valuable for that gunn said no she must still be afloat im starting to believe she was taken to a place where her cargo could be offloaded but where summer asked you checked all the major ports she could easily slip into a private facility without our knowledge theres another possibility dirk said rising from his chair the wreck we ran across in madagascar the norseman she had had her identity scrubbed from the hull what if they did the same with the adelaide only they passed her off for another vessel yaeger and gunn both nodded and dirk began gathering up his things when he began moving toward the door summer called out to him where do you think youre going panama and youre coming with me panama sure if the salzburg is behind the adelaides disappearance then someone at habsburg industries has to know something about it maybe but we dont know anything about habsburg industries or even where theyre located thats true dirk replied shooting gunn and yaeger an expectant look but we will by the time we get there the bullwhip cracked and every man within earshot flinched fearing the lick of its knotted tip occasionally johansson would show compassion and simply snap it in the air for effect but most of the time he directed the whip to the bare skin of a forced laborer eliciting an agonized cry there were nearly seventy of them slaves culled from the hijacked ships carrying rare earth now they were the ones carrying the rare earth hauling the stolen ore to various extraction centers hidden in the jungle weakened by a regimen of hard labor and a subsistence diet the men were quickly reduced to haggard zombies the arriving captives from the adelaide were shocked at the sight of them in their ragged soiled clothes staring impassively at the new arrivals pitt and giordino took one look at the men and knew there would be no benefit in delaying an escape im not impressed by the longterm medical coverage offered here giordino muttered as they were divided into work teams to offload the adelaides cargo i agree pitt said i think we should look for employment elsewhere whats with the dog collars pitt had also seen that the laborers all wore tubular steel collars the men wearing them carefully heeded the edge of the dock not venturing beyond their immediate work area johansson cracked his whip and the adelaide captives were marched into a clearing a table was set up with a box containing the collars and one by one the men were fitted with the devices which were locked with a key giordinos bullsized neck barely accommodated his collar which clung tightly to his skin do we get a cattle brand too he asked of the armed man fitting the device his reply was a cold sneer when all the men had been fitted johansson paced in front of them in case you are wondering the neck bands you are wearing are a protective device they protect from escape he gave a malicious smile if you look to the dock you will see a pair of white lines on the ground pitt saw two parallel faded lines painted several feet apart the lines looped away from the dock and disappeared into the jungle the white lines encircle a fiveacre area encompassing the ore depot the millhouse and your living quarters it is your little island of life beneath the lines are electrified cables that will emit a fiftythousandvolt shock to your steel collars should you attempt to cross them in other words you will die would you like a demonstration the men stood silent not wishing to witness another sacrifice johansson laughed im glad that we understand each other now it is time to get to work gomezs crew from the ship deployed the dock conveyor to the adelaides first hold and began offloading the crushed monazite the ore was dumped onto a concrete pad inside the white lines where it quickly grew to a small mountain shovels and rubbertired ore carts were delivered by a weary group of captives and the new slaves went to work plugrad and his coast guard team were assigned as shovelers while pitt giordino and the others were given the less arduous task of pushing the loaded carts to the nearby millhouse and unloading them the equatorial heat and humidity quickly took a toll on the men wringing the strength out of them pitt and giordino worked as slowly as they could trying to conserve energy while sweat dripped down their faces but always they heard the sound of the bullwhip keeping the pace moving the loaded carts were difficult to push for giordino with his injured leg he moved unsteadily shoving his cart with short hops pitt was following close behind when johansson stepped out of the jungle his whip cracked a second later the leather tip striking giordino on the forearm despite the eruption of a red welt giordino reacted as if a gnat had landed on him turning to johansson with an ungracious smile why is your cart only half full the swede shouted as a pair of guards rushed to his side pitt could see the look in giordinos eyes and knew his friend was ready to pounce the two guards would make it a hopeless act pitt shoved his cart forward bumping into giordino as a signal to stay calm giordino turned to johansson and exposed the bloody bandage on his thigh playing on an injury johansson said fill the cart full next time or ill do the same to your other leg he turned to pitt and let his bullwhip fly that goes for you too the lash snapped against pitts leg like giordino he ignored the stinging pain and stared at johansson with malice giordino nudged him this time and the two men moved off with their carts while johansson turned his attention to the next group of laborers woe is me and my goldbricking ways giordino said under his breath ive got some ideas on what id like to do with that bullwhip pitt said you and me both brother they dumped their carts at the side of the millhouse and made their way back to the dock trying to survey the camps layout four long lowroofed buildings off the back of the millhouse contained the extraction and separation operations beyond them faintly visible through the brush a twostory building housed the living quarters for the guards and facility workers the captives housing was located on the opposite end of the millhouse it was an openwalled structure with a dining area at one end surrounded by a tenfoothigh wall capped with barbed wire hidden farther into the jungle and well beyond the white lines a small powergenerating station provided electricity for the compound the captives worked until dusk by which time they were ready to collapse as he returned his empty ore cart pitt heard a sharp cry from the dock one of plugrads men had tripped while storing a shovel and had fallen close to the white line a surge of high voltage had coursed through his body before he could roll clear he trembled as his heart pounded wildly but he survived the shock as a living warning to the others pitt and giordino shuffled into the camp mess area as it began to rain the palmcovered roof leaking everywhere they were given bread and watery soup which they took to a nearby table two emaciated men joined them names maguire and my friends brown one said in a kiwi accent he was a dustyhaired figure with a stringy beard formerly of the gretchen you just get off the labrador yes she was called the adelaide when we went aboard pitt introduced himself and giordino first time ive seen a hijacked ship here maguire said they usually steal the cargo at sea and scuttle the ship thats what they did to the gretchen right off tahiti zapped us with their microwave device and took control before we knew what hit us was it mounted on a big square dish pitt asked yes know what it is we think its an offshoot of an army crowdcontrol device called the active denial system or ads its bloody nasty whatever you call it how long have you been here giordino asked about two months youre the second crew ive seen come in our numbers have been down as the attrition rates a little high he said in a low voice just drink plenty of water and youll be okay at least they dont short us that he swabbed up the remains of his soup with a hard crust of bread pardon the ignorance pitt said but where exactly are we maguire laughed always the first question youre in the hot rainy wretched jungles of panama exactly where in panama i cant say maguire here has befriended one of the guards brown said they apparently take periodic leave by boat in colón so we must be near the atlantic side maguire nodded some of the boys think were in the canal zone but its hard to know for sure as we never get off our little fiveacre island of joy the boss comes and goes by helicopter so true civilization must be a bit farther away anybody ever make it out of here giordino asked seems like the prisoners heavily outnumber the guards both men shook their heads seen a few try brown said even if you get past the death stripes theyll come after you with the dogs he noted the welt on giordinos arm you get kissed by johnny the whip today something more than a peck giordino said hes a sick one no doubt about it best to steer clear of him whenever possible who ultimately does run this place pitt asked a guy named edward bolcke some sort of genius mining engineer hes got his own residence just up the way maguire pointed toward the dock he built this entire complex to extract and refine rare earth elements from what weve learned hes a major player in the world market and is particularly tight with the chinese one of the extraction workers claims a quarter of a billion dollars worth of rare earth elements are processed here a year much of it stolen giordino whistled makes for a tidy profit the extraction facilities pitt said thinking escape im guessing they must use a large amount of chemicals in the process some deadly i hope giordino said yes but its out of reach maguire said all the serious stuff is performed in the buildings beyond our access were just the grunts we load and offload the ships and run the millhouse you hoping to play with matches something on that order you might as well forget about it brown and i considered it for weeks but weve seen too many good men die in the attempt somebody will blow the whistle on this place one of these days we just need to hang on until it happens a string of lights above their heads flashed briefly lights out in five minutes maguire said you boys best find a place to bunk he led them to a large screened room filled with rattan sleeping mats pitt and giordino picked two and lay down as the room filled with men and the lights went out pitt ignored the discomfort of the steamy room and the hard mat as he lay in the darkness contemplating a way out of the death camp he drifted to sleep without an answer not knowing his opportunity would come much sooner than he thought the laborers froze when they heard the thumping whine of a helicopter landing johanssons whip immediately prompted the men back to work purging any hopes that an armed force had arrived to set them free instead it was bolcke himself arriving fresh from australia where he had set in motion the final stages for his takeover of the mount weld mining operation climbing out of the helicopter he bypassed a waiting golf cart and strode to the dock a pair of armed guards in tow a ragged group of laborers including pitt and giordino were transferring the adelaides final hold of ore when bolcke stepped onto the dock he glanced at the slaves with disdain briefly locking eyes with pitt in that instant pitt seemed to read into the austrians psyche he saw a joyless man one scrubbed clean of compassion ethics and even a soul bolcke coldly eyed the piled ore before examining the ship he waited briefly for gomez who was summoned from the ship and scurried down the gangplank the cargo was what we anticipated bolcke asked yes thirty thousand tons of crushed monazite ore thats the last of it there gomez pointed at the final mound any trouble with the acquisition the shipping line sent out an added security team we subdued them without issue someone was expecting an attack gomez nodded fortunately they arrived after we had already seized the ship a troubled look crossed bolckes face then we must dispose of the vessel after changing identities at sea we entered the canal without question gomez said i cant afford the risk i have an important transaction pending with the chinese wait three days and dispose of the ship theres a salvage yard in são paulo i can take her to theyll pay top dollar bolcke thought a moment no its not worth the risk strip whats valuable and dispose of her in the atlantic yes sir pitt lingered near the ore pile straining to overhear the conversation while his cart was filled he watched as bolcke turned his back on gomez and walked toward his residence and gomez returned to the ship the adelaides headed out in a few days he said to giordino i think we need to be aboard when they shove off fine by me i just dont want to go as a piece of toast he tapped his steel collar i have a theory about our dog collars pitt said he fell silent when johansson emerged from the bush cracking his whip pick up the pace he yelled youre falling behind the mill the laborers quickened their movements none making eye contact with him johansson paced the dock area until he spotted giordino pushing a fully loaded cart and limping the bullwhip snapped striking giordino in the back of the thigh you there get a move on giordino turned and gave him a look that could blister paint his knuckles turning white as he pushed giordino propelled the ore carrier ahead as if it were an empty grocery cart johansson smiled at the display of strength then wandered off to berate another group of laborers pitt followed giordino along the path to the millhouse it ran parallel to the twin white lines alongside the dock and pitt gradually eased the cart toward the nearest line when he approached within three feet he began feeling a tingling in the collar he took a quick step and pulled himself onto the cart for a moment as it rolled along the tingling immediately ceased he veered the cart back onto the path catching a brief shock as he pushed off with his foot when he caught up to giordino pitt was smiling after a brief lunch of cold fish stew the two men were led into the millhouse where they were assigned to feed the ball milla huge metal cylinder mounted horizontally on rotating gears crushed ore was fed into one end where it would collide with hardened steel balls housed inside as the cylinder rotated the balls pulverized the ore into a near powder which was filtered out the opposite end the mill rumbled like an overgrown washing machine loaded with marbles the raw ore that had been transferred from the dock was piled in large mounds along the open side of the building a short conveyor carried the ore to a raised platform built over the ball mill where it was manually fed into the device through a large funnel a guard ordered pitt onto the platform to feed the mill while giordino joined another man shoveling ore onto the conveyor the work was less strenuous than the hauling the ball mill took time to digest the ore which allowed frequent rests for the laborers during one of these intervals johansson made an appearance the overseer entered the far side of the building lingering at the back end of the ball mill where workers collected the powder in more carts and transferred them to the next staging area the mill guard stepped over and joined him in a brief discussion of the output a few minutes later johansson walked the length of the ball mill for once his hands were empty the rawhide lash coiled to his belt as he approached the feed piles he spotted giordino and the other worker seated on one of the mounds johanssons face flushed and his eyes bulged with rage on your feet he screamed why arent you working the ball mill is full up giordino said casually pointing to the spinning cylinder he remained seated while his companion jumped upright i said on your feet giordino tried rising but his injured leg lost its footing and he buckled to his knee johansson lunged forward catching giordino before he could recover grabbing a shovel wedged in the ore the swede swung it hard aiming for the bum leg the blade connected with a whack striking just above the wound on giordinos thigh he collapsed as blood began seeping from the reopened wound standing on the platform pitt had seen it coming but could not react in time his own shovel in hand he took a quick step across the platform and leaped off the edge he fell toward johansson but was too far away to land on him instead he swung the shovel in a chopping motion as he fell stretching his arms and aiming at johanssons head the shovel missed the overseers head but struck his left shoulder hard johansson winced and spun around as the shovel bounced away and pitt landed hard at his feet still gripping his own shovel johansson took a swipe at pitt trying to rise pitt was forced to fling himself backward and he caught a glancing blow on his side as he rolled toward the ball mill pursuing like a rabid animal johansson was above pitt instantly raising the shovel for a vertical blow to the head pitt rolled beneath the spinning gears of the ball mill as the shovel head smacked the ground beside him pitt reacted in turn grabbing the shovels wooden handle to prevent another blow johansson tried to jerk it away but his left arm was numb from the earlier blow and he didnt have the strength changing tack he pushed the handle down while diving onto pitt the big swede weighed seventyfive pounds more than pitt and landed like a rock the impact knocked the breath from pitts lungs johansson managed to wedge the shovel handle beneath pitts throat as he landed and applied his full strength to choke him pitt struggled to push the handle clear but he was pinned in an awkward position as the handle pressed tighter against his throat he noticed a large gear of the ball mills drive system whirring above his head pitt bucked and twisted trying to throw johansson against the gearor at least to break his grip on the shovel it was no use johansson didnt budge and he focused all of his energies on choking the life out of pitt a pounding sensation exploded in his head as pitt began gasping for air a wave of desperation fell over him and he let go of the handle with his right hand and reached up toward johanssons waist groping for his sidearm but johanssons pistol was holstered on his opposite hip instead pitt felt the coiled bullwhip hooked to his belt he grasped the whip pulling it free but he began to sag as spots blurred his vision then a loud whack filled his ears and the choking eased if only for a moment giordino had crawled within throwing range and was pelting johansson with clumps of ore a hard chunk driven by giordino with the velocity of a major league fastball struck johansson behind the ear the swede grunted and turned toward giordino ducking as another rock came flying by the distraction gave pitt time to catch a breath of air which cleared his vision seizing the moment he whipped up his free arm and looped the bullwhip around johanssons head johansson retaliated by releasing the shovel and throwing a right fist at pitts head pitt could do nothing to deflect the blow as he was reaching up with the handle of the whip as the blow struck his face he jammed a lanyard ring on the handle into the gear teeth spinning just above him the punch nearly knocked pitt out but he remained alert enough to see the coiled whip tighten around johanssons neck and jerk him upward as he flailed to break free the huge toothed wheel carried the swede up onto its rotating surface a hoarse scream passed from johanssons lips as he was dragged by the neck to the machines opposite side at its base the external gear engaged with the flywheel from the ball mills horsepower motor johansson fought to escape but was pulled into the rotating gears the meshing metal teeth chewing through the leather whip and then into the flesh of the overseers neck his screaming ended and the rotating gear spit a thin line of red across the room the machine bucked and slowed a moment then revved back up to speed beneath the gears a pool of blood spread across the floor from johanssons decapitated body pitt climbed to his feet the guard at the other end of the mill had finally taken notice and began running toward him you really gunked up the works this time giordino said grinning despite his pain thanks for the assist pitt moved quickly toward him you okay yeah but the legs leaking again you better take a solo run the guard was now yelling at pitt while attempting to draw his weapon pitt nodded at his friend ill be back he dove under the conveyor belt as a burst of gunfire echoed through the building giordino casually tossed some crushed ore across the floor when the guard rushed after pitt his eyes focused on his quarry the guard slipped on the ore and fell halfway to the floor pitt used the opportunity to spring from the opposite side of the conveyor and dash out the end of the building a late spray of gunfire followed him as he cut around the corner and ducked into some nearby foliage trapped on the fiveacre island he had no illusion about being able to remain concealed for long the gunfire had already attracted the attention of several nearby guards pitt needled his way through the brush using its cover to move well clear of the millhouse the pursuing guard exited the building too late to see him and was forced to sweep the area slowly as he called in support pitt angled through the bush until he reached the cart path then he sprinted toward the dock as fast as his weakened legs would carry him the path soon opened onto the dock and the remaining pile of ore plugrad and a few of his men were shoveling their way through the pile as he came off the path pitt held his breath knowing he had only one means of escape as he caught sight of the men he saw what he was looking for with renewed urgency he stepped up his pace pushing aside the thought that if his assumption was wrong he would soon be dead plugrad looked up from a shovelful of ore in his hands when pitt came charging down the path pointing past him i need one of those pitt yelled plugrad looked behind him and saw a trio of ore carts the men around him stepped out of the way as pitt approached without slowing he ran to a lightly filled cart and shoved it toward the dock the white lines plugrad said but pitt shook him off driving the cart forward with all the force he could muster on the dock a lone guard assigned to plugrads work detail had been on his radio and didnt react until he saw pitt thrusting the cart toward the electric lines he swung his ak toward pitt and fired a burst the poorly aimed shot chewed up the dust by pitts feet inciting him to push harder the carts front tires crossed the first white line and he began to feel a tingle in his neck the cart was now rolling freely as the pain began to amplify around his throat he leaped and dove inside he tumbled onto a small mound of ore as the carts rear tires crossed the line fifty thousand volts should have surged through his collar killing him instantly but the electrical charge had to find a path from the buried line to the collar the fat rubber tires of the ore cart failed to conduct the charge and the shocking sensation vanished from pitts neck fortunately for pitt the ground was level and the cart continued rolling crossing the second white line onto the dock another burst of gunfire sounded and pitt burrowed into the ore at the bottom of the cart a spray of holes punctured the sides just above his head as the guard took better aim pitt caught some shrapnel from an exploding chunk of ore but otherwise escaped injury the cart bounded across the dock then smashed into the raised lip at the waters edge pitt looked up to see the adelaide moored above him ejecting himself like a jackinthebox he dove out of the cart and over the side of the dock splashing into the water below caught by surprise the dock guard didnt fire until after pitt disappeared he ran to the edge and aimed his rifle at the concentric circles created by pitts splashand waited for him to surface pitt struck the water near the aft end of the adelaide which had been backed into the inlet he dove deep before turning and swimming hard toward the stern the murky water offered a few feet of visibility and he easily followed the hulls dark contour until it tapered back and a large bronze propeller appeared an expert diver pitt was comfortable in the water and could easily hold his breath for more than a minute he took a few more strokes past the ship and angled away from the dock though he was good for some additional strokes he stopped and eased toward the surface giving a sudden kick just before he broke for air his head burst from the water and he took an easy stroke toward the far shore before grabbing another fresh breath of air then pulled himself under he spun and kicked down as fast as he could swimming back toward the ship as a spray of bullets struck the water above him while pitt was in fact backtracking the guard had bought his feigned motion to shore and aimed his shots accordingly the gunman stopped firing long enough to yell to two approaching guards cover the far shore hes headed over there the two men ran to the head of the inlet scanning the water for pitt to surface but pitt had already returned to the adelaide and was swimming along her outboard hull it was a demanding swim down the length of the big ship which pitt conducted underwater surfacing quickly a few times for air when he reached the relative concealment of the bow he scanned both sides of the ship teams of guards with dogs were beating through the jungle on the far side of the inlet on the dock the guard who had fired at him was speaking with another gunman while pointing at the water pitt saw few safe places to hide and his position off the adelaide was too exposed for him to remain there long a short distance ahead of the freighter a small crew boat had been docked the boat was secured with a thick chain however which was locked to a dock cleat between the two vessels a rusty ladder led up to the dock that gave pitt an idea ducking underwater he swam to the base of the ladder in one breath pulling himself up a few rungs at a time he peered over the edge of the dockand saw the two guards running toward him he dropped down the ladder surprised hed been detected as he was about to dive underwater he hesitated at the sound of boots clanging on metal he looked up and saw the men race up the adelaides gangway and head to the stern theyd not seen him after all the dock was now empty and pitt made his move jumping up and sprinting across its width he eyed a storage shed near the crew boat and reconsidered escaping by water there would be tools inside the shed something he could use to free the boat but to get there without being seen hed have to loop his way through the brush he made it to the jungle fringe and cut across a small footpath following the path around a thick cedar tree pitt suddenly ran smack into another man rushing from the other direction the men bounced off each other and fell hard to the ground pitt reacted first he sprang to his feet then paused when he recognized the other man it was bolcke wearing pressed slacks and a polo shirt the austrian was slow to get up but wasted no time in ripping a handheld radio from his belt and pressing it to his lips johansson the escaped slave is near the northern dock pitt shook his head im afraid johnny the whip wont be making any more house calls bolcke stared at pitt as his radio call was met by a long silence another voice came on and spoke to bolcke in hurried spanish the austrian ignored it as he stared at pitt just stay where you are sorry pitt replied but ive decided to check out of your sadistic hotel he could hear voices coming from the dock and movement farther up the path which pitt now realized ran from bolckes residence youll be hunted down and shot no edward bolcke pitt said staring at the old miner with contempt i fully intend to come back for you he turned and dove into the jungle scrambling from view seconds before a contingent of guards appeared seeing bolcke they sprinted up to him you reported seeing the escaped slave one of them asked bolcke nodded and pointed at pitts trail then tossed his radio at the man have all available guards converge here right away he said i want that slave brought back to me within the hour dead twigs snapped and branches swayed as pitt bulled through the thick brush he didnt know how many men were on his trail and since he couldnt move both quickly and quietly he abandoned caution and simply advanced as fast as he could he kept to the strip of natural vegetation that was contained by the dock on one side and the road to bolckes residence on the other when the brush narrowed and a pair of white lines appeared to his left he knew he had to change course he wound his way to the edge of the road ducking under a fern and holding his breath as a golf cart with several guards careened by the instant it was out of view he bolted across the road and into the opposite thicket heading deep into its cover after only a few dozen yards he came to a stop beneath a rocky ledge the lake appeared in his path pitt now realized bolckes compound had been built on a narrow peninsula his only hope of escape was to travel the length of the peninsula without being detected and flee into the expanse of landscape that lay beyond breathing heavily he pressed forward slowing when one of the extraction facilities blocked his way as he crept to one end he saw a guard circling the building he threw himself to the ground and snaked his way around the end of the building then rose and sprinted into the jungle at the base of a small mahogany tree he sank to the ground and rested but his respite was ended by a sound that shocked him back onto the run it was the shrill bark of attack dogs making their way in his direction pitt had seen guards patrol with dobermans and once with a german shepherd but he had put them out of his mind now clear of the compound they would be his most dangerous challenge the volume of their barking told pitt they were no closer than the extraction facility giving him hope that he had a safe head start he could only trust that they didnt have a specific scent to follow but his wet footprints from the dock had given the dogs a faint starting point and they had picked up just enough scent to track him the handlers released two of the animals to pursue him on their own but they kept three others leashed carefully sweeping his trail to ensure it wasnt lost dragging himself off the ground pitt ran prickly leaves and sharp branches tore at his face and clothes as he threaded his way ahead the dogs constant barking pushed him forward pushing the aches from his mind the minimal diet he had endured the past few days quickly showed as his strength waned producing a weariness he shouldnt have felt so soon but pitts mental strength was a fortress and he willed himself forward ignoring the pain and fatigue willpower or not there would be no outrunning the pursuit dogs they were simply too fast their incessant barking grew louder reminding pitt of a locomotive approaching a train station he stopped and picked up a pointed stick then headed to an open bluff to his left where he would make his stand he barely had time to turn when two large dobermans running head to tail emerged from the brush and leaped at him pitt was too late in wielding his stick to spear the first dog instead he had to use it defensively ramming it across the dogs throat as its jaws tried to snap off one of his ears he tossed the animal aside only to have the second dog leap onto his turned shoulder from behind pitt ducked his head as a cascade of sharp teeth lunged for his neck pitt waited for his flesh to be shredded but felt only a weak bite against the top of his shoulderand then the dog fell limp flinging it off his shoulder he saw a lifeless look in its eye as it fell motionless but the first dog quickly regained its footing and sprang again for pitts jugular as it leaped pitt heard two soft thumps and saw a pair of red dots appear on the dogs chest the beasts open jaws went slack as pitt fended it aside with his stick and the dog joined its partner dead on the ground pitt knew the act was no divine intervention and he spun around to determine its source just over the rise he saw some movement in the grass and stepped closer to investigate a short thin man stood up from the brush and moved to meet him zhou xing was wearing jungle fatigues and combat boots with a bush hat pulled low over his face he carried an ak a wisp of smoke still curling from its silencer he gazed at pitt with a stony expression then stepped past him to one of the dogs quickly to the ravine he said in imperfect english he grabbed the doberman by its collar and dragged it over the rise on the other side the hill descended sharply falling into a narrow ravine a small creek trickled through the floor of the ravine surrounded by dense ferns zhou dragged the dog to the edge of the precipice and flung it over the carcass tumbled to the bottom where it was quickly swallowed up by the ferns after catching his breath pitt arrived with the second doberman and duplicated zhous disappearing act he then followed the chinese agent to a makeshift camp hidden in the side of the hill what are you doing here pitt asked still listening for the barks of the remaining dogs call it business zhou replied picking a laptop computer off a stump closing its screen and shoving it into a backpack but before the screen went dark pitt noticed the images displayed a checkerboard of video feeds showing sections of bolckes compound the agent had planted tiny wireless surveillance cameras around the facility to track activity and guard movements you must keep running zhou said he scrambled to clean up his makeshift camp rolling up his bed and stuffing its mosquito netting into his pack a second large backpack its flap open sat near pitts feet inside he could see several packets of electronic detonator caps next to clearwrapped packages of reddish claylike material pitt had been involved with enough underwater demolition projects to recognize it as a cache of semtex plastic explosives zhou tossed pitt a protein bar and a canteen from his pack before slipping it on he then scattered leaves around the compressed grass where he had slept the night before finally he hoisted the second pack looking warily at pitt when he noticed the flap was open go he said to pitt they are less than ten minutes behind when are you going to blow up the compound pitt asked zhou stared at pitt his face an empty slate the americans had always been considered an unspoken enemy but he found admiration for this man having observed the better part of his escape on his hidden video cameras though he had seen labor camps in china he was repulsed by bolckes hidden slave operation twentytwo hours from now he said and the captives zhou shrugged then casually aimed his assault rifle at pitt it is time to go you travel west as i am going east he pointed into the jungle do not follow me pitt looked past the expressionless face into zhous black eyes where a hidden intelligence and compassion were barely revealed thank you pitt said zhou nodded and turned disappearing into the bush yaeger was still parked in front of his mammoth video display when gunn popped by for an update in contrast to yaegers casual attire the numa deputy director was wearing a sport coat and tie whats up with the fine threads yaeger asked i got called over to a meeting with the vice president hell want to know the latest on the search for pitt and giordino yaeger shook his head searchandrescue ops continue to come up empty the navy has in fact informed us they will be calling off their search efforts at the end of the day anything more on the adelaide nothing concrete our formal requests to interpol and every coast guard organization between alaska and chile have produced nothing if shes afloat someone has to have seen her gunn said have dirk and summer arrived in panama they were rushing to catch a redeye to panama city he glanced at the video board whose numerous displays included a digital clock in the lower corner presuming they made their flight they should be landing about now gunn had followed yaegers gaze to the screen and noticed an email notice with pitts name on it mind if i ask what that is not at all in fact i was just going to ask if it made any sense to you its an email that was sent to the numa website a few days ago one of the girls in public relations forwarded it to me when she didnt know how to respond probably somebodys fouryearold playing on a keyboard he enlarged the email until its brief message was clearly displayed to pitt abduc wsearr haytk lexkyann looks like gibberish gunn said except for the last word must have been penned by someone named ann from lexington kentucky thats all i made out of it id stick to your fouryearold theory he patted yaeger on the shoulder give me a shout if anything new on the ship comes in will do give my regards to the admiral gunn took the metro to downtown washington exiting at the farragut west station and walking the three blocks to sandeckers office in the eisenhower building the vice president welcomed him to a meeting table built from old ship timbers where he introduced him to the darpa security director dan fowler and a female fbi division director named elizabeth meyers sandecker could see by gunns weary face that pitts disappearance weighed heavily on him whats the latest on pitt and giordino searchandrescue teams still havent found a thing the navys calling off their efforts today he looked at sandecker and waited for him to react he wasnt disappointed the vice presidents face turned red and he marched to his desk and buzzed his secretary martha get me the chief of naval operations on the line a few seconds later he was chewing out an admiral who had previously outranked him he slammed down the receiver and returned to the table the navys search has been extended three more days thank you mr vice president what about that ship you told me about sandecker asked the salzburg gunn said she was last reported in new orleans homeland securitys checking with the local port authority to see if shes still there whats the connection fowler asked mostly circumstantial gunn said the salzburg appears to have been in the vicinity of the adelaide when she disappeared with pitt aboard just one of the straws were grasping at in a mystery with few clues we know the feeling meyers said sorry gunn said rudi sandecker explained before pitt disappeared he was involved in the recovery of some highly classified plans related to a submarine project called sea arrow the sea arrow isnt that a concept for a highspeed attack sub there is nothing conceptual about it at least there wasnt until now im guessing gunn said that this relates to the recovery of that boat off san diego the cuttlefish exactly sandecker said only things have escalated into a fullblown national security disaster elizabeth why dont you fill him in the fbi woman cleared her throat i should caution you this is classified information four days ago an advanced propulsion motor built for the sea arrow was hijacked during transport from the navys research lab at chesapeake maryland is that why a recent homeland security alert was issued gunn asked it was meyers said our agency has been working around the clock examining every airport shipping terminal and truck stop in the country i cant begin to tell you the amount of resources assigned to the case and still no leads sandecker asked plenty that have been false or dead ends the best we have is a description of a latino male who purchased a derelict toyota which was later involved in the hijacking beyond that were still grasping for clues do you think its still in the country gunn asked wed like to think so meyers said uncertainty evident in her voice thats part of the reason youre here rudi sandecker said the fbis looking at all available resources and would like the numa fleet to help since your ships are often stationed in outoftheway places they want to be made aware of any unusual behavior that might be seen concerning domestic shipping weve made the same request to the navy coast guard and some of the major port operators meyers added absolutely gunn said ill pass the word immediately sandecker turned to fowler dan do you have anything to add no sir just that weve confirmed that ann went missing shortly before the hijacking we along with the fbi suspect that she was either killed or abducted by the same perpetrators ann bennett gunn asked she was abducted yes and we fear the worst meyers said shes been missing for five days now gunn nearly fell off his chair the garbled email yaeger had shown him clicked in his head anns alive he said and i know where she is or rather where she was a few days ago lexington kentucky shes still alive fowler asked yes it was a cryptic email we received at numa it must have been a warning or a plea for help we dont understand the full text but i think part of it indicates she was abducted with the sea arrow motor meyers stiffened in her chair ill get the local field office mobilized fowler looked blankly at the vice president why lexington kentucky perhaps a local airfield thats friendly to the thieves they could still be in transit meyers said perhaps they were on their way to the west coast or mexico looks like you have your work cut out for you elizabeth sandecker said all right lets get after it ill want an update same time tomorrow the vice presidents visitors rose to leave as they walked to the door meyers approached gunn id like to see that email as soon as possible of course gunn said but not he thought until he and yaeger had deciphered the full meaning of the message the cabin door burst open with a bang ann was sitting atop a corner writing desk peering out a small porthole at the sea rushing by she had spent most of the journey perched there aside from an early bout of seasickness after leaving the mississippi delta the trip had been a voyage of tedium her only excitement was the two meals a day brought by an ugly bald man who she presumed was the ships cook from her hours of staring out the starboard port she had determined they were sailing south guessing their speed was somewhere between fifteen and twenty knots she figured that put them roughly a thousand miles south of new orleans by the second day her southern geography wasnt that great but she figured they werent far off mexicos yucatán peninsula she hadnt seen pablo since coming aboard but had braced herself for his appearance when the door sprang open she knew it was him he plodded into the cabin and slammed the door behind him he appeared more relaxed than ann had seen him before and when he stepped closer she could tell why he reeked of cheap rum miss me he asked grinning like a shark ann retreated farther into her desktop corner pulling her knees beneath her chin where are we headed she replied hoping to redirect his thoughts somewhere hot and steamy colombia pablo cocked his head surprised that she knewor guessedhis nationality no but perhaps after we make our delivery the two of us can fly to bogotá for a long romantic weekend he moved closer to the edge of the desk when will the delivery occur always the questions he leaned over to plant a slobbery kiss on her face ann raised the soles of her feet to his chest and pushed with her legs to her surprise the big man stumbled backward falling onto her bunk ann shuddered would he kill her for refusing him but the alcohol had mellowed him and he rose from the bed laughing i knew you were a wildcat underneath he said i dont like being caged like one she held up her cuffed wrists why dont you take these off first both wild and smart he said no i think that will be the one thing i let you leave on he began unbuttoning his shirt staring at her with an unfocused leer she trembled in the corner still atop the desk and contemplated a break for the door sensing her thoughts pablo stepped over and blocked the way then began inching closer ann was about to scream when another sound blared through the cabin it was audio static emanating from a ceiling speaker wired to the shipboard intercom then a voice roared through the cabin as well as the rest of the ship señor pablo please report to the bridge señor pablo to the bridge pablo shook his head and gazed at the speaker with disgust fumbling to button his shirt he stared at ann with hungry eyes we shall resume our visit later he eased out of the cabin and locked the door behind him ann wilted in her corner tears of relief wetting her cheeks for the reprieve she feared was only temporary leaving her cabin pablo climbed to the bridge and approached the captain with irritation what is it an urgent call for you on the sat phone the captain motioned toward a waiting handset pablo shook off his alcoholic stupor and spoke into the receiver the conversation was onesided pablo remained quiet until ending the call by saying yes sir then he turned to the captain how far are we from the canal the captain adjusted the scale on a navigation screen just over six hundred miles pablo looked at the digital map and studied the nearby coastline we need to make an emergency trip into puerto cortés honduras to pick up some paint and cargo a delivery to the estate no a requirement on board but we have only a skeleton crew aboard the salzburg then ill need every mans full effort pablo said or skeletons they will become pitt honored zhous request and headed west through the jungle he thought about circling back and trying to locate the boat that zhou had most certainly arrived in but ultimately figured it would be well concealed as he pushed through the brush pitt wondered who the man was and why hed been sent to destroy bolckes operations not that pitt didnt harbor similar feelings but he presumed the motive had more to do with the trade in rare earth elements than for humanitarian reasons soon after they had parted the sun had dropped from the sky and the canopied jungle turned dark pitt stumbled through clouds of mosquitoes that appeared at dusk to feast on his exposed skin the going became treacherous as the dense world around him gradually faded to black he found himself walking into sharp branches or tripping over unseen logs but there was nothing he could do about it the dogs continued their pursuit slow and methodical pitt had hoped the trackers would follow zhous trail but they still tracked his scent pitt could tell by the sporadic barking that they were perhaps just a few hundred yards behind he stopped and listened every few minutes trying to gauge their position as the jungle enveloped him he lost any reference for finding direction the sound of the dogs became his only clue fearful of accidentally backtracking into the teeth of the searchers he kept a careful ear out for their barking the jungle came alive at night with a concert of strange hoots calls and cries pitt kept his sharp stick in one hand in case the cries came not from a bird or frog but from a jaguar or caiman the noises helped take pitts mind off his fatigue without zhous water and protein bar he might have collapsed but the minimal nourishment kept him going fatigue oozed from his bones making every step painful being unused to the hot steamy environment only added to his lethargy tempted to stop and lie down he thought of giordino and the other prisoners and his feet kept moving though his clothes had dried after his earlier swim now they were soaked from endless sweat he prayed for rain knowing it would help him elude the trackers but the normally reliable panamanian skies failed to cooperate offering nothing more than an occasional drizzle he slipped on a patch of mud then pulled himself onto a tree stump and rested the darkness also seemed to have slowed the trackers a distant barking told him he still held a comfortable lead but he soon spied a faint glow through the foliage from the searchers lights pitt dragged himself to his feet and pressed on into the gauntlet of unseen branches hour by hour the night wore on in a cycle of plodding tripping and stumbling through the jungle always the din of dogs overshadowed the jungles other sounds moving like a zombie pitt staggered through a grove of bamboothen took a step and felt only air he collapsed over the lip of a narrow ravine tumbling headfirst down a grassy hill and into a small stream he sat there for several minutes the cool water washing away the pain of his bruises and lacerations overhead a seam of twinkling stars provided a faint but welcome light the water would give him the chance to escape the pursuing dogs after refilling zhous canteen he shuffled down the center of the creek the water seldom came past his knees but it was deep enough to mask his tracks with the starlight he found the going easier even as he slipped and fell in the streambed he followed it for what felt like miles but was in fact only a few hundred yards reaching a low bank he hobbled up the streams opposite bank and entered a grove of kapok trees a low branch beckoned and he shimmied onto it and rested the jungle had quieted and he heard few noises except the stream he no longer detected the chase dogs giving him hope that he had finally given them the slip as he leaned against the trunk he realized the pursuit had been almost as taxing mentally as it was physically he was fighting the urge to sleep when he heard a rustling in the bushes across the stream he looked over his shoulder as a yellow glow bounced through the foliage he froze as the silhouette of a large dog materialized above the far stream bank sniffing the ground pitt cursed his bad luck following the streambed he had inadvertently reversed his track and traveled toward his pursuers the german shepherd gave no indication it saw or smelled pitt he held perfectly still in the tree not even breathing the yellow glow grew brighter until a gunman with a flashlight emerged from a thicket and called to the dog it turned to its trainer and began to follow but not before letting out a growl ten feet from pitt a roar erupted like a lion in an electric chair pitt nearly flew off the branch but caught himself as the gunmans flashlight scanned the tree the light found a furry blackandbrown creature perched a little above pitt it was a howler monkey and it let out a second raucous cry before hopping onto another branch and scurrying away from the light pitt sat frozen at the edge of the flashlights beam as the dog barked wildly the beam wavered then bounced back to capture pitt dead center pitt dropped from the branch and hustled through the grove of trees a second later a burst of gunfire chewed up the kapok trees now empty branch the jungle fell still as the echo from the gunfire receded then the landscape erupted in squawks and cries as a thousand animals fled the scene pitt headed the pack scrambling through the maze of foliage with his hands outstretched the first rays of dawn were creasing the sky aiding his run and run he did the german shepherd had been sent to follow but hesitated at crossing the stream giving pitt an extra head start but the shepherd found a narrow place to cross the stream and resumed pursuit its incessant barking allowed pitt to gauge the dogs steady approach although tired itself from the nightlong chase the shepherd kept coming pitt had little energy left for an extended sprint he knew he couldnt outrun the dog but if he could separate it from its handler he might have a chance the question was whether he had enough left in him to fight the dog the barking grew closer and pitt decided it was time to turn and fight he realized hed left his sharp stick by the tree when he fled as he scoured the ground for a new weapon he overlooked a low tree branch and ran facefirst into it the blow knocked him flat to the ground as he lay there dazed he heard the barking approach but he also heard a metallic clacking that seemed to vibrate through the earth on instinct alone he crawled forward past the tree and up a small mound the sound grew louder he fought his pain and peeked over the mound in the dim light he saw a trainnot twenty feet away he shook off the thought it was a mirage and staggered to his feet the train was real all right crawling through a narrow cut in the jungle pulling flatbed cars loaded with shipping container after shipping container pitt stumbled toward the tracks as the shepherd crested the mound and sighted him with a renewed fury the dog sprinted after pitt as he staggered on rubber legs for the train a halfloaded flatcar was passing by and pitt dove for it his torso hit the bed and he clawed forward as the dog attacked the german shepherd leaped and clamped its jaws onto his dangling right foot pitt rolled onto the flatbed as the dog hung from his foot in midair pulling zhous canteen from his neck he flung it at the dog the canteen struck its snout and the shepherd whimpered and let go but a moment after falling to the gravel beside the rails the shepherd regained its senses and chased after pitts flatbed for a quarter mile the dog ran alongside it snarling and leaping but unable to jump aboard then the train crossed a ravine over a narrow trestle and the dog was forced to give up pitt waved farewell to it as it barked and howled in frustration at the vanishing train crawling across the flatbed car pitt then curled up next to a rusty container closed his eyes and promptly fell asleep the slowmoving freight train jolted to a stop awakening its lone passenger stretched out on one of its flatbeds pitt pried open his eyes under a bright morning sun the panama railway train had reached its terminus at a rail yard in the port of balboa near the pacific entrance to the panama canal and just a few miles south of panama city balboa was the key transit point for shipping across the isthmus pitt jumped off the flatbed car and found himself surrounded by a steel jungle mountains of multicolored shipping containers were stacked in every direction he looked down a long line of rail cars to see a gantry crane positioned over the tracks and workers beginning to offload the ubiquitous containers standing near the end of the train pitt followed the tracks out of the rail yard figuring the odds were high that the local rail authorities would treat him as a vagrant exiting the yard he climbed a rusty chainlink fence and found himself in a neighborhood of aged warehouses a half block away he noticed a small building with a handful of cars parked out front it was a rundown bar that catered to the local dockhands a faded sign proclaimed it el gato negro complemented by a painting of a black cat with crossedout eyes pitt walked into the dim bar garnering stares from the few earlymorning customers already warming the barstools pitt approached the bartender then caught a glimpse of himself in a large mirror behind the bar the sight nearly frightened him it was the image of a tired emaciated man with a bruised and bloodied face wearing soiled shredded and equally bloodied clothes he looked like a man returned from the dead el teléfono pitt asked the bartender looked at pitt as if hed landed from mars then pointed to a corner next to the restroom pitt ambled over and was relieved to find a battered pay phone though all but extinct in america the venerable pay phone lived on around the world sometimes in the most unlikely of places reaching an englishspeaking operator who balked only momentarily at his request to make a collect call to washington dc pitt soon heard the line ringing rudi gunns voice jumped an octave after hearing pitt say hello you and al are safe not exactly pitt quickly explained the adelaides hijacking their arrival at the panama facility and his escape panama gunn said we had calls into the panama canal authority to look out for the adelaide they changed her name at sea probably had phony papers already prepared bolckes facility is somewhere in the middle of the canal zone so he probably has inside support at the locks did you say bolcke yes edward bolcke an old austrian mining engineer who runs the camp of horrors i was told hes a major player in the market for rare earth elements he was one of our few leads in your abduction gunn said he owns a ship called the salzburg that was sighted near the adelaide around the time of her disappearance probably the same ship that bumped off the tasmanian star before it made an appearance in chile and maybe the cuttlefish too apparently shes armed with some sort of microwave device that proves lethal bolcke may have an operation in madagascar as well gunn said ill get the ball rolling with the pentagon to go after al and the others it sounds like a joint military operation with panama security forces is in order listen rudi weve got a really narrow window pitt described his encounter with the chinese agent zhou and his plan to destroy the facility glancing at his doxa dive watch he said weve got less than five hours to get al and the others out of there before the fireworks go off thats a tall order call sandecker and pull out all the stops ill do what i can where are you now a bar called the black cat somewhere near the pacific rail terminus stay put ill have someone you know pick you up within the hour thanks rudi pitt felt the fatigue of his escape fade away replaced with a renewed energy for the task still at hand saving giordino and the others was all that mattered he walked back to the bar and the bartender waved him to an empty stool he slid onto the seat to find served up in front of him a full shot glass containing a clear liquor beside the glass was a pair of longhandled bolt cutters pitt put his hands to his neck and felt the steel collar he had forgotten it was still there he looked at the bartender who returned his gaze and nodded muchas gracias amigo pitt said reaching for the shot glass and firing back the contents a popular local spirit called seco herrerano it burned with the sweet taste of rum he set the glass down reached for the bolt cutters and smiled at the bartender who says a black cat brings bad luck are you sure were in the right place dirk shot his sister an annoyed look since they arent fond of posting street signs around here the answer would be no he swerved around a stalled truck filled with plantains and accelerated the rental car along the congested road since landing at tocumen international airport that morning they had been crisscrossing panama city first checking into their hotel then visiting the mineral brokerage headquarters of habsburg industries it was a tiny rented storefront office that was closed and appeared little used the owner of a bakery next door confirmed it was seldom open dirk and summer were beginning to think their trip to panama was wasted when they received a call from gunn that their father was alive and waiting at the edge of town they passed a sign welcoming them to the district of balboa and dirk knew they were on the right track he followed a pair of semitrucks that he assumed were headed to the port facility then turned down a dirt side road when the port entry gates appeared three blocks down the road summer spotted the sign with the black cat dirk barely had the car in park when summer leaped out and ran inside the bar ignoring its unsavory appearance she almost didnt recognize her father seated at the bar in ragged clothes eating an empanada he was equally shocked to see both his children dad lets get you to a hospital summer said pitt shook his head no time well need to coordinate with the panamanian military to rescue al and the others dirk looked at the assorted bar patrons who all stared at the outofplace americans dad how about we discuss this in the car fair enough pitt said he looked at the empty shot glass and plate of food do you have any local currency dirk opened his wallet im told our greenbacks are the preferred currency in panama pitt pulled a hundreddollar bill from his sons wallet and gave it to the bartender then shook hands with him that was two days worth of per diem dirk said as they walked out of the bar pitt gave him a wink put it on your expense report dirk studied a road map before they took off down the rutfilled road what has rudi arranged with the panamanians to get into bolckes facility pitt asked rudis pulling his hair out summer said he called us three times on the way over as you probably know panama has no standing army in the wake of manuel noriegas removal paramilitary groups within the panamanian public forces are willing to conduct a joint raid with a us team but only after they review the evidence and make adequate preparations for a tactical assault nobody expects a task force to be assembled within fortyeight hours dirk looked to his father you think al and the others may be at risk sooner pitt explained his encounter with zhou once those charges go off i expect bolckes forces to execute all the prisoners and hide their remains do we have any us forces that can go in solo dirk shook his head special ops forces out of the southern command are our best bet theyve been put on alert but are still ten hours away rudi said the only presence nearby hes been able to find is a navy ship out in the pacific headed for the canal after traveling just a short distance across balboa dirk drove up a hill to a large ornate building that overlooked the port district and the canal a sign on the manicured lawn proclaiming it the panama canal authority administration building the authority is responsible for security of the canal and the adjacent canal zone summer said rudi says they are our only hope for an immediate response inside the building pitts appearance drew stares from the staff and visitors a receptionist escorted them to the office of the director of canal security a poised man named madrid who wore a thin mustache he gave pitt second and third looks as he introduced himself i have been advised of the urgent nature of your visit your vice president is a very persuasive gentleman he said shocked to have received a personal call lives are at stake and time is short pitt said ill call our nurse and get you some fresh clothes while we talk madrid led them into his office which had an oversized map of the canal on one wall a man in fatigues was studying some aerial photographs at a table may i introduce commander alvarez he heads our field security operations and will be leading your rescue operation they joined him at the table where pitt described his abduction and the operation at bolckes hidden facility weve pulled the habsburgs company transit records and have found an odd pattern of canal crossings madrid said their ships enter at one end pitt said and dont exit the other until days later exactly correct they are delivering purchased or stolen raw ore at the facility and then shipping out the refined product madrid nodded with a pained look the passage of commercial ships through the canal is a tightly controlled operation they apparently have assistance from the pilots and perhaps our own locks personnel to make such transits without attracting attention theres a lot of money involved with their product pitt said they can afford substantial bribes mr pitt can you show us where the facility is located alvarez asked pitt walked to the map and tracked the panama canal railway line that ran near the canals eastern edge i can only guess that i caught the rail line somewhere in this area he pointed to a remote area off gatun lake about thirty miles from panama city the facility would be somewhere between the canal and the rail line alvarez rifled through a folder and pulled out a packet of color aerial photographs this would be the approximate region he examined each photo closely before passing it around the table the photos showed swaths of dense jungle that occasionally bordered gatun lake a few pictures showed the panama railway line cutting through the jungle but none gave any sign of bolckes facility they pored through forty photos as skepticism grew on madrids face wait a second summer said pass that last photo back dirk handed her the photograph and she lined it up against another on the table take a look at the jungle in these two pictures the four men craned their necks seeing a uniform blanket of green jungle flowing across both photos nobody said anything until pitt slid over a third photograph its the color he said it changes exactly summer pointed to one of the photos theres a linear seam here where the jungle color seems to turn a bit gray i see it madrid said its the artificial canopies over the facility pitt said theyve faded with age and no longer match the surrounding jungle alvarez pieced the images together with several contiguous photos until the composite showed a distinct peninsula that fingered into gatun lake he took a marker and highlighted the discolored areas revealing a large rectangle adjacent to a patchwork of smaller squares the large rectangle would cover the dock and inlet pitt said some artificial mangroves block the entrance and are pulled aside when a ship enters or leaves what are the other squares summer said the other buildings in the compound he took alvarezs marker and noted bolckes residence the millhouse the slave housing and the multiple extraction buildings he described the facilitys security forces to the extent he knew them leaving out no detail how many prisoners madrid asked eighty amazing madrid said a slave camp hiding right under our noses he turned to alvarez youve got it pinpointed yes sir its right here he located the peninsula on the large wall map and marked it with a pushpin clearly within our jurisdiction suggested entry short notice will dictate an approach from gatun lake we can bring up the coletta from miraflores as our command ship and run three of our patrol boats off her as assault craft he studied pitts markings on the photos if we can enter past the barricade well send one boat into the inlet and land the other two outside with those forces sweeping in once the facility is secure we can bring the coletta to the dock to evacuate the prisoners you best assemble the men and equipment at once madrid said well reconvene aboard the coletta in two hours and brief the assault team in transit yes sir alvarez stood and scurried out of the office you are welcome to join me on the coletta during the operation madrid said to pitt and his children well be there pitt replied i have an injured friend i was forced to leave behind i understand as to the matter of the salzburg i have heeded your vice presidents plea and ordered extra security at the gatun locks if the ship should appear for a canal transit we will be prepared to seize her pitt shrugged i suppose seizing bolckes ship might answer a few more questions summer could see her father didnt know the full picture dad didnt rudi tell you about your friend ann bennett pitt shook his head she went missing about a week agoabout the same time some sort of propulsion motor was stolen from a navy research lab truck rudi said there was a connection between the two the sea arrow pitt muttered rudi thinks ann was abducted with the motor he and hiram found a cryptic email she sent you over the numa website indicating she was in kentucky then shes still alive rudi thinks so they believe she was telling them the motor was hidden on a hay truck rudi speculated they were trying to avoid the eastern seaboard in their attempt to get it out of the country he believes they shipped it down the mississippi and hiram actually found video from the horace wilkinson bridge in baton rouge that shows a barge passing by with a hay truck aboard seems a bit tenuous pitt said less so when it was discovered that bolckes ship the salzburg was in new orleans at the same timeand departed a day later the salzburg pitt said so bolcke has been behind the sea arrow thefts from the beginning but what does he plan to do with it summer asked pitt thought back to his encounter with zhou and the response he gave when asked why he was there business pitt said he plans to sell it to the chinese perhaps as part of a deal related to their combined rare earth holdings he looked at summer how long ago did you say the salzburg left new orleans about four days recon showed it heading south at the mississippi delta dirk said why hasnt the coast guard or navy tracked her down and boarded her pitt asked they would have but for one thing dirk said the ship has vanished within clear sight of the canal authority administration building a rustcovered grain ship sat at anchor absorbing the gentle waves of the pacific named the santa rita she was flagged in guam though the government of guam would have been surprised to learn as much aside from never filing papers there the santa rita had never once carried an ounce of grain she was in fact an aging resource of chinas ministry of state security originally configured as a spy ship to monitor the taiwan strait she later carried missiles to iran in her grainhauling configuration retired to less clandestine duty she had been under contract to haul a shipment of mexican pharmaceuticals to shanghai when zhou took her over off costa rica the tired agent was resting on the bridge just a short time after returning from his nighttime foray into bolckes camp when his cell phone rang as he checked the number his stoic face registered a hint of surprise zhou he answered bluntly zhou this is edward bolcke i have to inform you we will be making a slight change in the rendezvous plans i was expecting the transfer to occur within the hour theres been a minor security delay but theres no cause for alarm the shipment is safe we will however need to postpone the rendezvous for another six hours zhou grew silent his explosives would detonate at bolckes compound in approximately four hours he had timed them to go off after he received the sea arrows motor and plans the entire transfer was now in jeopardy that is unacceptable zhou said calmly i have a strict timetable to adhere to my apologies but you can understand the sensitivities at play my vessel is nearing the gatun locks and will still require the complete canal passage if you wish you might consider entering the canal at your end if you head north through the miraflores locks we could make the transfer in miraflores lake that would reduce the time of our delivery by an hour or two i can make a call and move you up for immediate passage through the lock the last place zhou wanted to be was trapped in the middle of the panama canal but if that was the only opportunity to acquire the sea arrows secrets so be it with luck bolcke might not know his facility was a smoldering ruin when he passed over the technology very well zhou said make the transit arrangements and i will proceed to miraflores lake please expedite your vessel as we will be waiting hanging up he stared out the bridge window feeling like he was about to dance on the edge of a razor nearly forty ships were moored in limon bay congesting like a swarm of bees around a hive each awaited its turn to be funneled from the atlantic ocean into the panama canal a small containership arrived and cut past the long line of freighters tankers and other carriers to take its place at the front of the line the centuryold big ditch was handling more ships than ever but its capacity was soon to swell a major expansion was under way adding two new sets of locks capable of handling the worlds largest containerships while expensive to cross the panama canal shaved thousands of miles off the alternative of traveling around cape horn watching the containership sail past the captains waiting their turn in limon bay knew that jumping to the head of the line required paying a steep premium the containership slowed as a pilot boat drew alongside delivering a panama canal authority boarding officer and a canal pilot the ships captain escorted them to the bridge where he relinquished command to the pilot a requirement of all ships transiting the canal the boarding officer confirmed the ships tonnage and dimensions to determine the vessels fare manifest please he asked the captain the officer thumbed through the document noting a short list of equipment parts most of those containers empty he asked yes taking them to balboa the captain said i noticed you were riding high in the water he computed the fee with a steep kicker for moving up in line your account will be charged accordingly then he turned to the pilot the portobelo is cleared to proceed he left the bridge and reboarded the pilot boat which whisked him to the next ship waiting in line the pilot sailed the portobelo down a long channel to the gatun locks the canals atlantic entry point the locks consisted of a parallel set of three huge sequential chambers which enabled southbound vessels to be lifted eightyfive feet above sea level to begin crossing the isthmus the panama canal itself was built like a liquid wedding cake its highest point was at its center the large manmade reservoir of gatun lake the lake cascaded down three levels at either end due to a geographic quirk the canals fresh water flowed to the atlantic ocean in the north and to the pacific in the south the elevated lake allowed for gravity to fill and drain the locks raising or lowering ships depending on their direction of travel but the panama canal was an uneven wedding cake due to a separation between locks on the pacific side while the three chambers of the atlantics gatun were sequential the pacifics were far apart with a singlechamber lock called pedro miguel at the lake and a dualchamber lock called miraflores a mile beyond it took a typical ship about eight hours to complete the fiftymile journey from ocean to ocean the pilot inched the portobelo close to the first chamber at gatun stopping just short of its huge open doors which were called gates messenger lines attached to steel tow cables were hoisted aboard and secured their opposite ends attached to tiny locomotives called mules which ran along the locks edge under the pilots guidance the mules gently towed the freighter into the chamber and held it in place as the gates astern were closed once sealed additional water was released into the mammoth chamber until the ship had been raised nearly thirty feet armed guards not usually seen around the locks patrolled the area giving the ship a careful onceover when the water level matched the next chambers the front gates were opened and the ship was pulled forward by the mules the process was repeated twice more until the portobelo motored out of the last chamber and into gatun lakeeightyfive feet higher than when she started clearing the locks the pilot ordered the helm to increase speed helm belay that order the captain said all stop the pilots face turned red i command the vessel through the canal his demeanor softened when he detected another presence on the bridge he turned to find pablo approaching him pablo i thought this tub was eerily familiar to the old salzburg when did you boys get into the container business about thirtysix hours ago pablo said well be taking her from here sure sure the pilot spotted the bag in pablos hand that contained the usual cash bribe and a bottle of chivas regal theres an extra thousand for you pablo said handing him the bag no more mention of the salzburg whatever you say the monkeys on the dock were looking for you but i guess you fooled them see you on the next run the ships crew lowered a rubber boat and ran the pilot to shore where he could hop in a taxi to the nearest bar when the inflatable returned the disguised salzburg got under way you sure he can be trusted the captain asked pablo nodded well have completed the transfer before hes halfway through that bottle of scotch pablo allowed himself his own notion of relief since receiving the warning call from bolcke two days earlier he had feared every call on the radio and every passing ship but the rush transformation of the salzburg into the portobelo aided by a paint respray of the bridge and funnel and a large load of empty containers had fooled the canal authorities at the gatun locks that meant one thing they were home free the coletta screamed through the panama canal passing the speedrestricted commercial ships like they were standing still an italianbuilt patrol boat of some forty meters she sported a mm turreted cannon on her bow for muscle below deck thirty armed commandos were crammed into the wardroom receiving a final briefing from alvarez they were well trained having conducted numerous joint exercises with international forces in mock defense of the canal pitt tried to quell their obvious enthusiasm for the mission by detailing the strength of bolckes forces yet pitt felt his own impatience showered bandaged and wearing a fresh set of borrowed fatigues he was anxious to get into the facility and free giordino but a daylight raid was risky and everything hinged on his brief encounter with zhou pitt just hoped that his instincts were right alvarez handed him a holstered sig sauer p automatic you know how to use it pitt nodded we should arrive at the deployment zone in ten minutes ill be leading boat into the cove well secure the dock knock out the generator and release the prisoners boat will land on the peninsula and secure the residence hopefully with bolcke inside boat will follow as a reserve you can join boat but i must request that you act as an observer only ill help where i can good luck alvarez pitt looked for dirk and summer but didnt see them in the emptying wardroom he could hear the patrol boats motor slow and he followed the others onto the deck the coletta had followed the canals transit route around the eastern shore of barro colorado island a large nature preserve in the middle of gatun lake the canals narrow channel was marked with lights and signs to prevent ships from running aground in the nearby shallows the lightly drafted coletta had no such concerns as she raced across the path of an approaching containership she traveled east for a mile until she approached a narrow landmass covered with dense vegetation the coletta drifted under the hot sun as three inflatable assault craft were lowered over the side each loaded with ten commandos pitt sensed his boat had some extra passengers as he squeezed between two unarmed commandos with bush hats pulled low over their faces a little room for the old man he said dirk looked up from beneath his hat we wanted to be here to help id rather you both stayed on the boat pitt unhooked his holster and passed the sig sauer to dirk keep an eye on your sister no worries summer whispered beside him a commando had already engaged the outboard motor propelling the inflatable toward shore behind the first two assault craft the first boat veered left for the cove while the other two eased right toward a small protected bluff the boats had been in the water less than five minutes when their entire plan of attack fell apart a ring of moored buoys containing sensors and video cameras had detected their approach alarms sounded around the compound alerting bolckes security forces most deployed to the dock after securing the prisoners while another force took to the roof of bolckes residence boat with alvarez leading his team took the first hit maneuvering past a fake mangrove swamp they approached the dockonly to be met with a fusillade from shore alvarez and his men gamely fired back suppressing some of the gunfire until a battery of rocketpropelled grenades came blasting at them one landed in the boat skidding to the rear transom before detonating two men were killed instantly as the stern blew apart sending the rest of the men into the water boats and had a moments warning before gunfire erupted from the rooftop of bolckes concealed residence closest to the shore boat took the brunt of the fire incurring several casualties as they maneuvered and returned fire the pilot managed to run the boat ashore the commandos finding marginal protection behind a low rock berm but the team was effectively pinned down by the shooters on the roof run to the right pitt yelled to boat s pilot as the battle ignited in front of them he had foreseen boat s predicament and motioned for the pilot to sweep hard right and put ashore out of view of the residence the panicked pilot turned up the outboards throttle and jammed the rudder to the side they nearly made it unscathed as the team leader a burly man named jorge organized return fire but as the rooftop shooters focused on the third boat jorge was shot twice in the stomach pitt saw the scared look in the eyes of the other commandos none of whom had ever witnessed actual combat he immediately stepped forward we need to suppress the rooftop fire to get the men from boat off the beach follow me to the house when their hull touched bottom pitt leaped over the side and sprinted into the jungle inspired by his show of fearlessness the commandos tore after him ill stay here and look after jorge summer said to dirk as she rummaged for a medical kit go help dad dirk nodded thumbing off the safety of his pistol and leaping from the boat he quickly caught up with the others as they snaked their way through the jungle pitt stopped them at the fringe of a clearing that surrounded the house several gunmen were visible on the roof waiting for them to emerge from the brush pitt studied the residence noticing an exterior side stairwell that led to the roof he turned to a young man crouched next to him do you have any grenades only smoke grenades give me what you have after collecting four smoke grenades pitt lined the men in a picket on my signal spray the rooftop to give me cover when i get to the stairs ill lob the grenades onto the roof move in quickly and secure it pitt slithered to a position closer to the house and then yelled now the jungle exploded with gunfire targeting the rooftop guards pitt took off running as the guards ducked for cover but they regrouped quickly and returned fire sprinting to the house pitt saw the rooftop gunners were obscured by the residences front porch and he angled toward the entry he was nearing the porch steps when the front door burst open and two guards charged out in their wake followed bolcke like a running back behind his blockers the trio dashed down the first steps then froze at the sight of pitt a few feet away bolckes eyes flared in shock but there was no hesitation in his voice as he spoke over the background gunfire kill him bolckes guards swung their rifles toward pitt and readied to fire but pitt was a step ahead he popped the pin on one of the smoke grenades and tossed it on the steps the grenade skidded across the carved stone and stopped at bolckes feet the guards dropped their weapons grabbed bolcke and heaved him over the far balustrade one guard dove after him but the other hesitated hed heard the grenade hissing and noticed a first wisp of smoke spurting from it realizing it was not an explosive he kicked it off the steps and a gray cloud erupted over the lawn he turned back to pitt who stood exposed at the corner wall a few feet away the guard raised his rifle and took a bead on pitt but before he found the trigger two red splotches appeared on his chest and he staggered back on his heels the guard teetered then collapsed on the steps and rolled to the ground pitt saw his son kneeling on the lawn the sig sauer held outstretched in his hands dirk jumped up and ran to the side of the house as a salvo of bullets stitched the ground beside him thanks for the backup pitt said dirk smiled smoke is no match for lead pitt motioned toward the porch steps bolcke dirk took the lead as they crept across the porch but bolcke and the other guard had already vanished down a jungle path reversing course pitt led his son up the side stairwell halting a few feet from the top he heaved the remaining grenades onto the rooftop engulfing it in a thick cloud of smoke ground fire ceased as the boat commandos streamed out of the jungle and raced up the stairs a few seconds later the remaining boat commandos broke from the shore and joined the assault the combined forces quickly overran the guards sweeping the roof as the smoke cleared as the residence fell silent they could still hear sporadic gunfire from the dock area has anyone heard from alvarez pitt asked as the commandos reassembled on the roof ive had no response said the leader of boat we better move to the dock ill show you the way pitt said the commandos rushed back down the stairs a small contingent peeled off to secure the interior of the house while the rest followed pitt down the same path bolcke had taken when the commandos arrived at the dock a half dozen security guards were scattered about it firing into the water they had been joined by two armed crewmen on the bow of the adelaide firing from above the canal authority commandos opened fire catching several guards without cover and dropping them quickly the rest of the dock guards fell back retreating into the jungle for cover but the crewmen on the ship held their position and returned fire an extended firefight ensued until the bettertrained commandos picked off both men over the clatter of gunfire pitt had detected a revving motor he caught a quick glimpse of a small crew boat exiting the mouth of the inlet the whitehaired figure of bolcke visible next to the pilot pitt turned to the boat commander who was kneeling behind a rubber tree reloading his rifle bolcke has escaped in a small boat call madrid on the coletta and have them pick him up the commando nodded snapping a magazine into place he hit the transmit button on his radio and called the support boat aboard the coletta madrid had been using binoculars to watch a small containership approach when he received the call he turned to see bolckes crew boat surging out of the inlet and he brought his patrol boat to bear gunner prepare for a warning shot ahead of the approaching boat he said fire a man let loose a blast from the mm deck gun ripping a fountain of water ahead of the crew boat the fleeing boat reduced speed but held its course across the colettas bow focused on stopping bolckes boat madrid had ignored the containership which was approaching off his stern quarter gunner prepare for a burst into the motor fire the gunner took aim but before he could fire he fell to the deck and began flailing his arms as if attacked by a swarm of bees screaming he rolled to the rail and hurled himself over the side to find relief in the lakes waters inside the wheelhouse madrid suddenly found his skin inflamed with a searing pain he danced away from the helm unable to grip the controls screaming in pain he looked out the window to see the containership bearing down on him the ship plowed into the coletta at slow speed its lumbering mass easily crushing the patrol boats bow the smaller boat was kicked backward as its interior filled with water in seconds its stern rose and the boat plunged underwater bolcke watched the patrol boat disappear as his own boat tied up alongside the containership he sprinted up the ships accommodation ladder with his guard in tow crossed the deck and climbed to the bridge panting he staggered to the helm where pablo stood admiring the modified active denial system on the ships bow we seem to have made a timely arrival pablo said theyve attacked the facility bolcke said who has one of the prisoners he escaped yesterday they would have to be from the canal authority i thought that was their boat im sure johansson will take good care of them ashore no johansson was killed by the man who escaped can they know of the deal bolcke shook his head five hundred million will buy you plenty of new facilities pablo said the plans and motor are safe aboard bolcke eyed the changed appearance of the salzburg yes the chinese are waiting for us in miraflores lake pablo looked at him like a child awaiting a birthday present then i see no reason to delay our payment a minute longer he ordered the ship into the canals main channel and the salzburg was swiftly on its way the canal authority commandos fished out alvarez and the remnants of his team that had been scattered across the inlet or huddled among the dock pilings the operations leader looked like a drowned rat but he shook off the loss of half his team to take command of the combined forces he pointed to a wide trail off the far end of the dock that meandered into the jungle the prisoners are down there yes pitt said the trail leads to a millhouse the prison housing is just beyond alvarez split his men into two groups and set off down the trail with the lead force pitt and dirk following they moved cautiously fearing an ambush but the remaining guards were nowhere to be seen the trail widened as they approached the millhouse a highroofed open building alvarez sent three men to scout the side entrance but they never made it gunmen opened fire from every door and window in the structure bolckes remaining security forces a dozen strong had gathered in the millhouse to mount a final defense and counterassault their sudden barrage inflicted casualties on nearly half of alvarezs men alvarez himself was hit in the leg and pitt dragged him to cover the operations leader quickly called in his reserve force which had followed on the flank under a blanket of return fire he retrieved his wounded men to the cover of the jungle but the battle regressed into a stalemate alvarez radioed the coletta for assistance but heard only static in reply theres no response he said to pitt without additional support well have to pull back not without the prisoners pitt grabbed an assault rifle from a wounded commando who had fallen unconscious keep them occupied well try to get around to the housing complex he motioned to dirk the two men took off through the jungle skirting wide left around the millhouse pitt led them on a partial loop then cut back toward the tall structure peering from behind a gnarled cedar they eyed the end of the millhouse and the prisoners housing just beyond the housing stood in the center of a wide clearing fully exposed to the gunmen in the millhouse pitt could see several prisoners peering through the housings lone gate trying to watch the gun battle he noticed an ore cart parked on the grass midway between their position and the gate im going to make a run for that cart if i can get there undetected i should be able to make it to the gate dirk gauged the distance between them and the millhouse tough range to cover you from here ill go with you before pitt could protest dirk sprinted for the cart pitt followed on his heels though his weakened legs couldnt keep pace for long they were seen by a gunman on the second floor of the millhouse bullets tore into the ground alongside the ore cart as dirk ducked behind it a couple steps behind pitt had to dive for cover rolling hard into his son as the bullets struck close by dirk stuck out the sig sauer and fired twice but that only attracted more gunmen from the millhouse the cart clanked as it absorbed cross fire from several shooters not the stealth approach i hoped for pitt said they must have gunmen all over that building dirk peeked over the top of the cart fired another two shots and ducked back down theres a guy on the second floor with an rpg pitt stuck his assault rifle around the side of the cart and sprayed a short burst at an open window the bullets chewed up its frame and shattered the glass as he pulled his gun away pitt saw a guard emerge from the shadows with a bulbous green device on his shoulder he knew that a successful shot from the rpg would vaporize them both he swung his rifle atop the cart and was preparing to fire again when an explosion rang out like a thunderclap shooting ceased as all eyes watched a black cloud rise from beyond the prisoners housing complex pitt looked at his watch and grinned zhou had come through after all youre ten minutes late pitt muttered a second later the entire millhouse erupted in a fireball a half dozen additional explosions rang out leveling the separationandextraction buildings that were spread throughout the compound the entire jungle belched smoke and flames as bolckes hidden facility was methodically destroyed zhou had spared only the prisoners housing bolckes own residence and a staff hall where a dozen research workers were huddling during the fight chunks of the millhouse roof rained down around pitt and his son as they crowded behind the ore cart the blast unleashed the ball mill sending the giant cylinder tumbling out a side wall and rolling into the jungle most of the guards inside were killed instantly but a few were hurled out the windows and landed on the grass unscathed canal authority commandos cut them down on the spot pitt and his son moved quickly to the prisoners housing pitt shot the lock off with his rifle and kicked open the gate the crowd of captives inside surged forward boy are we glad to see you plugrad said pushing through to pat pitt on the shoulder maguire and the other men rushed up and shook his hand pitt worked his way through the crowd anxiously counting each man while searching for his friend reaching the last man standing pitt found himself a head short giordinos with an uneasy feeling pitt stepped through the mess and the living quarters both were empty turning back toward the gate he noticed a hammock strung between two grills in the open kitchen the still figure of giordino lay on it pitt moved closer staring at his friend with apprehension then a familiar snore gurgled from giordinos throat pitt grinned from ear to ear rise and shine big boy giordino cocked open a sleepy eye you got back pretty quick i knew youd miss me giordino yawned and sat up quite the fireworks show did you get bolcke no he slipped out when the fun started he handed giordino a nearby crutch that had been crudely carved from a stick of zebrawood how are you feeling like a contender for the national hopscotch championships giordino hopped up on one foot and planted the crutch under his arm his wounded leg was bandaged so thickly it resembled a tree stump pitt helped him hobble to the gate where the other captives were milling about afraid to leave a commando came running past the smoldering millhouse and approached pitt alvarez sent me are these all the captives yes every man is accounted for where did those explosions come from planted here ahead of time they really saved our bacon they sure did the man said alvarez says to get everyone to the dock he turned and started jogging back the way he came weve got a lot of wounded to attend to pitt began herding the captives out of the compound when giordino grabbed his arm and pointed to the sky someone leaving without us pitt looked up to see a wisp of black smoke rising from the dock areathe sooty exhaust from a large diesel engine its the adelaide pitt said with resolve their fight wasnt over yet al keep the men moving pitt shouted already on the run dirk come with me in the rush to free the captives alvarez had failed to send anyone aboard to secure the adelaide hiding on the bridge gomez had fired up the ships engines at the beginning of the assault after seeing bolcke escape and the subsequent explosions in the jungle he had no reason to linger pitt and dirk emerged from the jungle to find the adelaide still at the dock the stern mooring line had been released and pitt glimpsed gomez yank the line onto the deck then disappear into the ships superstructure ahead of the ship a crewman on the dock moved to release the bowline pitt and his son kept on running the forward gangway was still in place so they still had a chance to get aboard if not hold its bowline that possibility evaporated when the crewman slipped the line off its bollard then gazed toward the mouth of the inlet a small outboard motor could be heard over the drone of the adelaides warming engines as pitt and dirk hustled along the length of the big ship they saw the source it was summer piloting boat with her were four or five bedraggled men lying in the bottom of the boat the crewman on the dock watched a moment then kicked the bowline into the water as the boat neared the dock he calmly removed a holstered pistol and took aim at summer a rapid peal of gunshots rang out as a half dozen bullets tore into the crewmans back at least two shots had come from dirks sig sauer the rest from pitts assault rifle the crewman spun and squeezed off a stray shot at his attackers then collapsed dead a second later a screech and a loud crash filled the air shes under way dirk shouted gomez had engaged the engines and was pulling away from the dock the noise had come from the gangway which skidded off the edge of the dock and slammed against the hull dangling from its deck mountings summer drove the inflatable alongside the dock as the ship pulled away a containership came in and rammed the coletta she yelled to pitt and dirk she had sped over in the inflatable and fished out the survivors as the containership sailed away im pretty sure they picked up bolcke it might have been the salzburg a flood of thoughts filled pitts mind if summer was right the sea arrows plans and motor would be aboard and possibly ann as well the ship would have to be stopped before it could escape the canal he spoke quickly to his kids as he watched the moving adelaide dirk run down to the end of the dock summer keep the engine running im coming aboard he strapped the assault rifle over his back and dove off the dock he hit the water a few feet from the inflatable but stroked toward the ship he couldnt match speed with the fleeing vessel but he had a second target in mind the ships bowline dangling through its scupper and dragging through the water he snagged the thick line then slid along its length until he reached a heavy looped end a smaller messenger line was attached to it and he tossed that line to one of the men in the inflatable stay with the ship he yelled to summer grabbing the side of the inflatable as she wielded it around and chased after the vessel a weakened madrid leaned over the side and helped pitt aboard together they reeled in the heavy bowline pitt had his daughter push ahead of the ship dragging the line like an anchor on shore dirk had sprinted to the end of the dock where a final mooring bitt was mounted as the inflatable struggled closer gomez guessed what they were attempting and turned the adelaide as far across the inlet as he could dirk could see the ship pulling away and urged summer to hurry pitts and madrids arms ached from pulling the heavy line as summer buried the throttle and took a bead on her brother dirk got on his belly and leaned over the side of the dock as the inflatable pulled alongside and summer cut the motor pitt heaved the loop at the end of the line up and dirk grabbed it just as the line went taut muscling it with all his might he rolled the loop to his side barely slipping it over the end of the bitt get clear in case it snaps pitt yelled dirk got to his feet and sprinted down the dock as summer turned the inflatable around and followed suddenly the inflatable veered toward the adelaide and dirk quickly saw why summer brought the boat alongside the dangling gangway and pitt jumped up and grabbed it climbing hand over hand he pulled himself up and boarded the ship the bowline was pulled taut grabbing the ship by its nose and holding it in place with its propeller still churning the stern began swinging to starboard threatening to lodge the ship crossways in the inlet on the dock the mooring bitts mounts strained under the pressure fighting to hold the ship in place as the tugofwar played out summer brought the inflatable alongside a dock ladder where dirk helped madrid and the other injured men ashore when jorge the last man was transferred to the dock dirk jumped into the inflatable run me over ill back him up he shouted summer gunned the throttle and shot to the side of the adelaide allowing dirk to jump onto the dangling gangway be careful she shouted dirk nodded just get away from that line summer hurried back to the dock as a twang arose from the straining rope gomez had turned the rudder over and was applying full power against the line something had to give and finally it did the bowlines threaded loop snapped at the mooring bitt sending the line whipsawing toward the adelaide clinging to the gangway dirk ducked as the line slapped against the hull nearly taking his head off as the loose line began to fall over him he scrambled up the gangway and pulled himself onto the deck free of its leash the ship surged forward angling out of the narrow inlet dirk scanned the deck for his father but aside from the bodies of the two gunmen on the bow the ship appeared empty he eyed the bridge atop the rear superstructure and took off at a run across the long open deck he made it to a side door and was on the first steps of the companionway when gunfire erupted overhead repeated bursts of gunfire sounded for nearly half a minute as dirk raced up the stairs when he reached the fourth level the shooting fell silent and he proceeded cautiously from there up to the bridge deck he clutched the sig sauer at the ready as he crept onto the bridge hed taken only a few steps past the door when a warm muzzle was jammed into the back of his neck he froze in his tracks but the barrel was quickly removed i dont remember giving you permission to come aboard dirk turned his head to find it was his father holding the gun relief plastered on his face i wasnt aware you were the captain of this tub dirk said apparently i am now pitt pointed across the bridge there was nothing but carnage around them the bridge windows were shot out and the radar and navigation monitors shattered smoke from the decimated electronics filled the air with an acrid odor in the far corner lay the bloodied body of gomez gave him a chance but he refused to take it dirk nodded then glanced out the broken forward window of the pilotless ship the adelaide had nearly cleared the inlet but a wall of rocks and mangroves blocked its path therere rocks ahead he said jumping to the helm theyre not real pitt replied part of the fake scenery to disguise the inlet a few seconds later the ship charged into the decoys there was no jarring collision instead the adelaide sailed smoothly through out the side window dirk saw an overturned styrofoam rock gently float away clear of the inlet the adelaide charged into the open waters of gatun lake a large crane ship was crossing the canal to the north while a pair of tankers and a containership were headed around a bend to the south pitt stepped to the helm and dialed up the ships throttle controls to full not going back for the others dirk asked pitt gave a steely gaze toward the containership vanishing around the channel ahead no he said we have a ship to catch bolcke stood peering out the rear bridge window billows of black smoke from the site of his hidden facility painted the horizon it was destroyed he knew because of the escaped prisoner the one who had tossed the smoke grenade onto his front steps but pablo was right the money he would receive from selling the sea arrows technology would leave plenty for a new rare earth extraction facility he had already done work at a site on madagascar he could safely expand his operations there but he would lose precious months of trading activity at a critical time in the minerals market once he was safely in colombia he vowed he would have pablo hunt down the prisoner and bring him his head on a platter he faced forward as the salzburg entered a narrow stretch of gatun lake called gamboa reach how much farther to the lock pablo turned from the helm its about twelve miles to pedro miguel he noted the angst on bolckes face ive radioed ahead the locks transit chief is expecting our passage there will be no problems the bridge radio blared with the voice of a tanker pilot castigating another ship for passing it on the lake bolcke and pablo ignored the chatter as they eyed the sea arrows motor on the deck below covered on the flatbed truck and concealed by stacked containers two miles behind them the tankers pilot still spouted venom at the large bulk carrier that had cut in front of him the maximum speed in this section of the canal is eight knots jerk he radioed on the bridge of the adelaide pitt couldnt hear a word the man said since the ships radio had been destroyed in his gun battle with gomez he didnt even know his speed as the navigation instruments were also demolished but he had little doubt the ship was traveling well over eight knots empty of all cargo and most of her fuel the adelaide sailed light on her feet pitt coaxed every ounce of speed he could from the ship and soon had her approaching twenty knots she left the tanker and its angry pilot in her wake as pitt set his sights on the next vessel ahead it was a large dutch panamax tanker built to the original specs of the canals locks at nearly a thousand feet long the canal channel had narrowed even more as pitt caught up to the dutch ship and pulled up to its port flank to pass the adelaide had just edged alongside the tanker when a large blue containership appeared sailing in the opposite direction dirk gauged the distance needed to pass the tanker and shook his head no way we can get past her ahead of that containership he expected his father to slow the ship and duck back behind the tanker until there was room to pass instead pitt stood calmly at the helm he had no intention of slowing down dirk grinned at his father and shook his head those boys in that containership arent going to be happy the pilot of the oncoming ship had already noticed the adelaide in his lane and was making furious demands over the radio for the bulk carrier to back down but the increasingly frantic calls went unanswered as the vessels converged pitt continued to gain on the tanker but its monstrous length made passing it an interminable task ahead the tanker and containership had already passed bow to bow so there was no escape for anyone pitt had estimated the canal cut was wide enough for the three ships to pass side by side but he didnt know if it was deep enough for all three positioned in the middle where the channel would be deepest he didnt really care the tankers pilot did what he could to slow his vessel and steer it to the righthand side of the marked channel but because his ship had the deepest draft he refused to push it any closer to the bank that left the game of chicken in the hands of the containerships pilot pitt helped the cause by pulling tight alongside the tanker close enough that a man could jump from one vessel to the other but by all appearances a collision looked inevitable as the containership bore down from the other direction pitt and dirk braced for impact the approaching ship stacked to the sky with containers filled their vision as its bow cut toward them but the pilot wisely decided that grounding on the bank would be safer than a collision and he guided the ship aside to make way for pitt the ships passed within a few feet of each other as the containerships hull scraped bottom and its propeller churned through mud the pilot and deck officers hurled a mountain of insults as the bridges of the two ships passed pitt merely smiled and waved theyre going to want your pilots license for that dirk said think how mad theyll be pitt replied when they find out i dont have one the channel turned and narrowed ahead partially obscuring the outline of the salzburg aboard her bridge bolcke and pablo came alert at the latest burst of ire from the radio when the blue containership had passed the adelaide and the pilot saw the repainted name on her stern he made further threats over the radio labrador he said i will be filing a formal complaint with the canal authorities in colón bolcke stiffened at mention of the ships name labrador thats the name given to the hijacked vessel at our dock he grabbed a pair of binoculars and sprinted to the rear window there was no mistaking the large bulk carrier a mile behind them spurting past the dutch tanker it was the adelaide his face turned pale they are chasing after us he said to pablo pablo calmly surveyed the navigation screen we should be able to pass safely into the locks ahead if not he added his eyes turning cold well make them regret coming after us the two ships had entered the gaillard cut the canals most dangerous section nine miles long it sliced through the continental divide and had presented the most difficult challenge for the engineers who built the canal a herculean excavation effort gouged out a trench more than two hundred fifty feet deep in some places using manual labor and finicky steam shovels untold thousands lost their lives some due to accidents and mudslides but most from yellow fever and pneumonia the magnitude of the feat was obscured when the canal waters were released in flooding the deep cut a tranquil appearance belied its tricky currents that made the narrow passage a challenge to navigate pitt stormed into the cut ignoring a channel marker that indicated a speed limit of six knots for large vessels he occasionally felt the effects of the currents as the stern drifted one way or another but he refused to slow his pursuit he had a clear bead on the salzburg having closed to within a half mile though pablo had ordered the captain to increase speed it took precious time for the salzburg to increase its pace peering back at the faster adelaide he realized he would have to take the offensive when pitt noticed a few men congregating on the salzburgs forward deck he passed the helm to dirk just for the record dirk said ive never piloted a vessel this size before shes easier to handle than a duesenberg pitt said just keep her off the bank ill be right back as they drew closer to the salzburg dirk could see three men on her bow manipulating a tall object that looked like a large radar dish the men rolled the dish alongside some shipping containers on the portside rail and positioned it so it aimed rearwardat the adelaide pitt appeared on the bridge a moment later dirk did a double take at seeing his father dressed in the reflective silver coating of a level a hazardous materials protective suit whats with the buck rogers outfit we brought them along for protection when we came aboard pitt said bolckes ships are outfitted with a microwave device called ads thats used for crowd control only theirs is lethal they likely have one aboard the salzburg dirk pointed forward you mean that dish on their bow pitt saw the active denial system aimed directly at them and tossed dirk an extra suit quick get this on dirk was starting to slip on the hazmat suit when he felt a burning sensation on his back they must have it cranked up he said quickly zipping the suit up pitt felt the same sensation on his face and pulled on the matching hood with faceplate and stepped to the helm stay behind the bulkhead he said to dirk his voice muffled by the hood he jammed the helm control to starboard feeling a hot sensation on his chest and arms standing before the shattered bridge window he was in the devices direct line of fire the hazmat suit provided some protection but didnt block the full effect positioned on the salzburgs bow the system had to fire along the ships port side to strike the adelaide pitt could avoid the weapons beam by sailing to the far right of the channel and tucking in behind the leading ship within a few minutes he did exactly that bolcke watched as the adelaide suddenly altered course shes veering to the bank i think you got her the operator reports he had a clear strike on the bridge pablo said then they saw the adelaide straighten its heading the pursuer still maintained a slight speed advantage and continued to creep closer to the salzburgs stern i think they might try and ram us bolcke said pablo looked at the navigation monitor and saw they would soon be approaching the first set of locks at pedro miguel we need to dispose of them before we are in sight of the locks he had a few words with the captain then departed the bridge bolcke remained where he was glued to the rear window watching the pursuing vessel pitt maintained a safe buffer with the ship ahead he had hoped to pull alongside the salzburg and force her into the bank but the appearance of the ads on the port rail had nixed that plan he was contemplating his next move when the salzburg heeled over in front of him at pablos command the captain had turned the salzburg hard to port the ads operators immediately aimed the beam at the adelaides bridge pitt felt the familiar tingle on his skin but it was what he saw next to the weapon that made his hair stand on end it was pablo and another man at the rail shouldering rocketpropelled grenade launchers an instant later they fired the weapons off the bridge pitt yelled as the grenades flew toward them with no time to flee he dove to the floor kicking the rudder to port as he fell standing across the bridge dirk jumped into the side companionway the first grenade struck the steel face of the adelaides superstructure just beneath the bridge it fell to the deck and discharged harmlessly atop a hatch cover pablo had fired the second rpg and his aim was on the mark the grenade burst through the shattered window just above pitts head its high angle of entry sent it careening off the ceiling to the rear bulkhead where it detonated the entire structure shook from the explosion which incinerated the bridge in a fiery cloud of smoke and flame watching from the deck of the salzburg pablo smiled to himself no man could have survived the inferno two things saved pitts life first was the bounce of the grenade which ricocheted off the rear bulkhead and detonated in front of an engineering console the shrapnel blew up around and into the consolebut not through it lying on the other side pitt was spared the lethal spray of exploding steel fragments his second salvation was the hazmat suit it shielded him from the flash fire that accompanied the explosion and engulfed the bridge the blast rattled his senses and he struggled to breathe but he easily climbed to his feet once dirk returned and dragged him clear of the carnage are you okay dirk asked his ears ringing pitt barely heard the words yes thanks to buck rogers shaking off the effects of the blast he staggered to a nearby window we should be about on her he had to yell to hear himself the words barely cleared his lips when a bang arose from the bow pitt and dirk grabbed at the bulkhead as the ship shuddered to a halt kicking the rudder to port when he fell had turned the adelaide on an intercept course with the crossing salzburg caught in the narrow channel the salzburg had to hold to its attempted uturn and hope it could slip by the adelaide pitts action had ensured it couldnt bolcke looked on in disbelief as the adelaide its bridge a charred ruin turned toward them as if guided by an invisible hand the salzburg was halfway through her port turn when the adelaides prow struck her amidships accompanied by the screech of steel grinding against steel the charging bulk carrier cut nearly twenty feet into the salzburgs beam had the salzburg been fully loaded the pressure on her frame would have broken her in two still the collision buckled hull plates all along her sides allowing a rush of water to penetrate her interior on deck the stacked cargo containers scattered like falling blocks several tumbled into the canal after smashing through the starboard rail on the port rail side a pair of the empty containers fell onto the ads flattening the dish and crushing its two operators pablo watched as another container rolled onto its side pinning the leg of his fellow rpg launcher the man screamed for pablo to help but there was nothing he could do so he silently walked away both ships were mortally wounded but the salzburg was clearly in the worse condition the ship quickly listed to port sending more containers tumbling over the side she settled lower as the canal waters washed over her main deck she was sinking fast pablo raced to the bridge where bolcke stared at the damage like a zombie pablo ran past him to a locked cabinet which he kicked open inside was the plastic bin with heilands design plans for the sea arrow wheres the captain he asked we must get off the ship he went to check on the chief engineer theres no time to waste weve got to get to the crew boat follow me he picked up the bin and left the bridge bolcke following a step behind on reaching the main deck they rushed to the elevated starboard rail where bolckes crew boat dangled pablo threw the bin aboard then snapped at bolcke get in ill lower you to the water and jump in bolcke did as he was told pablo took the winch controls and had started lowering the boat when bolcke stopped him look out on the other ship at the base of the adelaides superstructure two figures appeared in silver hazmat suits one of them coated with black soot pablo saw that the other man brandished a gun i know how to delay them he dropped the crew boat hard to the water then tied off its bowline as bolcke released the winch cable pablo sprinted up to the accommodations level and unlocked anns cabin for once she was glad to see him while she wasnt sure what had happened she could tell the ship was sinking and feared being left to drown in her cabin lets go pablo grabbed the handcuffs between her wrists and led her down the corridor reaching the main deck she was shocked to see the towering hulk of the adelaide enmeshed in the salzburgs side the entanglement hadnt slowed the degree of the salzburgs list which was approaching a sharp angle pablo led ann down the sloping deck to the port rail sloshing through ankledeep water he stopped in front of a lone container that had slid to the side smashing partway through the side rail it stood out from the other containers and pablo made sure it stood out even more he fished for a key in his pocket and removed one of the handcuffs ann relaxed feigning submission as he pulled her close to the container taking a step she sprang her knee into pablo just missing his groin he fired back in the blink of an eye backhanding her head and sending her sprawling against the container he grabbed her cuffed wrist and pulled it to the deck where he latched the cuffs free end to a loop at the base of the container im sorry things didnt work out he said be sure and wave to your friends he turned and moved along the deck ducking when there was a loud plink on the container behind him he increased his pace and looked back to see a man at the rail of the adelaide firing a pistol at him pablo sidestepped down a row of containers and out of sight as two more shots followed dirk lowered the sig sauer with disgust as his father caught up with him at the rail they had shed the cumbersome hazmat suits which had left them both drenched in sweat theres a woman tied to that shipping container dirk said i took a shot at the guy who put her there but missed pitt spotted a woman with short blond hair lying at the base of a container thats ann any relief at finding ann alive was dispelled by observing the salzburgs precarious state the ship was sinking quickly the gash from the adelaide was taking her down by the beam and pitt could see that the ship would capsize before she went under lets see if we can get to her he took off running for the adelaides bow the whole section was mashed flat but still locked in the jagged grip of the salzburg the tangled beams of the sinking containership groaned as they tore against the adelaides bow pitt threaded his way through the shredded steel until he could drop onto the salzburgs deck he ran aft across the ship snaking around the scattered containers until reaching ann she looked at him in disbelief as he waded up to her what are you doing here he grinned at her i heard you were trying to take a cruise without me she was too frightened to smile can you free me he sloshed through the water to take a closer look she was seated on the deck with her hand pinned low water already swirled above her elbow then the container creaked and slid a few inches over the port rail dragging her with it its a handcuff pitt asked she nodded dirk approached and together they looked for something to free her with somewhere on the ship would be tools but they had no time to search the ship was already half underwater and so was the container its going to go over the side any minute dirk whispered i dont see how we can get her free of it pitt nodded and gazed up briefly at the adelaide youre right he said a glimmer in his eye i reckon well have to save them both the adelaide like the tasmanian star in chile was equipped with its own conveyor for loading and offloading cargo the adelaides system was mounted on its starboard beam right above where pitt stood climbing up the ore carriers shattered bow he raced to a control station next to the conveyor the collision hadnt damaged the ships auxiliary power and a generator below deck hummed when pitt tested the hydraulic controls the conveyor consisted of a sliding belt that could be moved alongside each hatch hopper cranes were fitted on the opposite side of the deck which would pull the ore from the hold and deposit it onto the conveyor pitt engaged the belt and moved it forward to the number hold he experimented with the controls until he figured out how to pivot the conveyor rotating it out from the salzburg he aimed it at anns container a separate vertical control allowed him to lower the far end of the belt which he dropped beneath the rail standing next to anns container dirk was signaling him closer when a deep bellow sounded from the depths of the salzburg containers everywhere shifted as the ship began to founder in a slow steady motion the portside deck dipped toward the canal while the starboard side rose sending the containers in a mad tumble into the water pitt jammed the end of the belt ahead and below as far as it would go and engaged it looking out all he could see was a mountain of containers spilling into the water at the stern he saw the captain and a handful of crewmen leap for their lives as the ship rotated equipment stores and remaining cargo tumbled and crashed with a sudden rush the ship broke free of the adelaide and capsized the inverted salzburg drifted for a minute or two then let out a gurgle and slipped beneath the waters of the canal the tip of the adelaides conveyor belt dropped below water level and pitt thought he had failed but the belt stammered and shook and a beige slab appeared beneath the surface a moment later a shipping container emerged riding unevenly up the belt pitt looked over the side to see ann and dirk clinging to its base their feet dangling over the waves as water sloshed off the belt it pulled the container up to the side rail where pitt powered the conveyor off nice catch dirk said though i wasnt expecting a dip in the bargain he dropped to the deck as ann touched her feet down beside him you okay pitt asked ann i thought my arm was going to leave its socket but yes im all right she shook the water from her hair hand me the gun pitt told his son dirk pulled the sig sauer from his waist and handed it to his father pitt shook it to clear the water and held the muzzle to anns handcuffs the shot split the chain that linked the cuffs and freed ann from the container would have tried that earlier but you were too far underwater when we found you but then i would have missed the ride ann smiled for the first time in days she got to her feet and looked into the canal where the salzburg had vanished the sea arrows motor was aboard theyre not going to get it now pitt said but they still have the plans she said i saw them in the boat with pablo pitt nodded he had seen bolcke and pablo flee in the boat while he tried to save ann theres only one place they can go having examined a map of the canal on the adelaides bridge he knew the next lock was only a short distance away dirk was already crossing the deck to an inflatable secured beneath a tarp in minutes he had it winched over the side and lowered into the water with pitt and ann aboard already drenched he dove over the side of the adelaide and swam to the side of the boat where he was helped aboard pitt started its small outboard and they were soon zipping up the canal the canal curved past gold hill a small bluff that marked the continental divide and its deepest area of excavation just beyond it the canal straightened and the pedro miguel locks appeared two miles away bolcke and pablo had already reached the lock and sailed into the north chamber whose gates had been opened in preparation for the salzburg pablo docked the boat against the center island which bisected the locks two chambers he assisted a pair of canal workers in attaching fore and aft mooring lines to the crew boat before he jumped off with bolcke still aboard the workers walked the boat to the far end of the chamber and tied it off forgoing the tiny locomotives used to maneuver larger vessels pablo strode toward the control house a multistory white structure in the middle of the island that managed the water flow for the chambers a gruff transit supervisor with a clipboard met pablo thats no fourhundredfoot bulk carrier we had an accident with the ship and need to make passage at once mr bolcke will pay triple your usual fee if you dont book it is that him in the boat pablo nodded havent seen him for a while he pulled a radio off his hip and called the control house a minute later the chambers massive gates began to close soon the waters in the chamber would drain out the bottom lowering the boat for the next section of the canal well have you out of here in ten minutes the supervisor said pablo glanced at the closing gates then hesitated a small inflatable boat was approaching at high speed with three people aboard there were two men and a woman with short blond hair ann bennett just one minute he pointed to the inflatable those three attacked and sank our ship treat them as terrorist suspects and detain them for at least an hour the man looked at the approaching boat they dont look like terrorists theres an extra ten thousand in it for you the supervisor beamed you know i might just be wrong about that he said give my regards to mr bolcke all he got in reply was pablos turned back as the colombian walked briskly to the waiting boat as the gates of the northern chamber closed to accommodate bolckes boat the southern chambers gates were opened to release a large freighter traveling in the other direction pitt slipped the inflatable around the wide freighter and motored into the chamber he angled toward the control house and pulled alongside the dock where the transit supervisor stood with two armed guards the water level in the opposite chamber had already dropped several feet obscuring his view of the crew boat dirk jumped onto the dock with the inflatables bowline in hand and held the boat close while ann stepped off dirk turned to the supervisor the crew boat with two men aboard he pointed to the boat in the other chamber you must stop its passage im afraid it is you who must be stopped the supervisor said guards arrest these people pitt had gazed past the control house and spotted pablo walking along the dock hearing the guards grab dirk and ann he goosed the outboards throttle dirk let the bowline slip and the small boat took off down the chamber it was five hundred feet from the control house to the forward gates and pablo was nearly to the end when he heard the inflatable approach he turned and was shocked to see pitt at the helm holding the sig sauer unarmed pablo looked back to the control house guards they were occupied holding ann and dirk and made no effort to chase pitt their paid loyalty would go only so far the crew boat was still a few yards ahead of pablo but pitt angled to cut him off on the dock pablo saw that a maintenance crew had been repairing a locomotive track and left behind a damaged rail he scooped up the raila slim forged steel rod about six feet longand stepped forward pitt motored past pablo and turned the inflatable toward the dock he didnt notice pablos makeshift weapon as he leaped from the boat and turned his gun on him pitts reflexes were dulled by fatigue and when pablo swung the rail he reacted too late he aimed and squeezed the trigger but the rail arrived first slamming into his outstretched hand the gun fired harmlessly into the sky before being knocked from pitts hand and splashing into the water pitt recoiled as pablo reversed his swing but he was still tagged in the ribs with a sharp whack that sent him reeling he managed to stay on his feet and backpedaled as pablo came after him again the rail cut the air with a whistling sound as pablo swung it like a scythe youve come a long way to die here not far enough pitt replied staggering backward to avoid the swinging rail pitt had almost reached the gates and the crew boat tied at the end of the dock the chamber was draining quickly and the crew boat had already dropped more than twenty feet he glanced at the boat but saw it was too far to jump sensing pitts vulnerability pablo closed in for the kill swinging the rail even harder pitt saw that the weight of the rail was beginning to slow pablos backswings and he decided to take the offensive he stepped back as pablo whipped the bar at him but rather than keep retreating he planted his feet and sprang forward pablo reacted by pulling the rail to his chest in defense as pitt barreled into him pitt managed to catch pablo slightly off balance and he staggered to the side pitt pressed the charge grabbing the rail alongside pablos hands and bulling into him as hard as he could pablo had no choice but to step back and try to regain his leverage but he had been turned sideways to the dock and when he tried to plant a foot behind him he found only air he tumbled backward off the edge of the dock taking pitt with him from the base of the control house dirk and ann had watched the battle while the guards held them at gunpoint dirk saw the two men fall into the chamber with a large splash and waited for them to surface as the water settled he began counting the secondsand felt a cold chill after more than a minute neither man had returned to the surface pablo took the brunt of the fall into the lock chamber landing on his back as pitt drove him into the water from the height of the dock it felt like he had hit a concrete pad the impact knocked the breath out of him while his back erupted in pain his body tensed shocked to inactivity pitt however stayed in control when he hit the water he kicked his legs hard driving his opponent deep with his diving experience he figured he could outlast pablo in the water and pressed on the rail to drive him as far down as possible focused on his attack pitt didnt notice the pull of the swirling water he was surprised though to quickly feel pressure in his ears and he waggled his jaw to clear them slowly recovering from the shock of impact pablos first instinct was to wrestle away the steel rail but pitt clung tight using it to press pablo deeper pablo finally came to his senses and realized he needed air he pushed himself away from the rail kicking to the side to escape pitt but a strange thing happened instead of ascending he was drawn deeper by an unseen force unnerved he reached back and grabbed the rail while kicking furiously on the opposite side of the rail pitt stopped kicking but another ache in his ears told him they were being sucked to the bottom the two men had fallen into the lock chamber directly over one of the drainage wells that dotted its floor when valves in the wells were opened the chambers water would drain through them into a lateral culvert which fed an even larger culvert built into the wall at over eighteen feet in diameter this huge pipe emptied into miraflores lake near the surface the swirling of the draining water was barely noticeable but at the bottom of the chamber it became an inescapable whirlpool like pablo pitt briefly let go of the rail and tried to kick to the surface but the suction of the water refused to release its grip pitt brushed against pablo in the turbulence and regripped the rail positioning himself parallel to the bottom the draw of the water accelerated pulling them forcefully to the wells fourfootwide mouth pablo fought the downforce but his legs and torso were sucked into the pipe the rail would have been swallowed also but at the last second pitt muscled it sideways it clanged atop the circular concrete well jerking both men to a halt neither realized how hard the water had been pulling them and both nearly lost their grip the impact threw pitt off balance and his legs were sucked into the well the rest of his body followed and he found himself hanging side by side with pablo clinging to the steel rail overhead as thousands of gallons of water rushed past them no longer concerned with battling each other each man fought for his life their descent had taken only half a minute but because of their exertions both men were out of air pablo had fought to maintain his breath since hitting the water and now he began to struggle his heart raced and his head ached the fear of drowning flooded his thoughts and he panicked hanging just inches away pitt could see pablos eyes bulge and his face shudder desperation took hold and pablo gave in to his instincts letting go of the rail he kicked and clawed trying to swim to the surface he had no chance instead he whisked past pitt disappearing into the depths of the well pablos surrender only served to give pitt more resolve he focused on maintaining his grip on the rail and tried not to think about the pounding in his brain or the overwhelming urge to inhale he knew the locks could be filled or drained quickly and the water level had already dropped by more than twenty feet since they had fallen into the chamber pitt told himself the draining would have to end soon as his fingers went numb he detected a deep rumble beneath him for a moment he felt the draining water pull even harder it was the valves inside the drainage wells turning to close then he heard a bang and the water ceased its deadly pull unbelieving at first pitt pulled on the rail and found himself ascending he let go and kicked hard exhaling long and slow his reserve of air as he rose it was still thirty feet to the surface but he reached it quickly gasping in the humid air that greeted him as he regained his senses he heard shouts from the dock high above and an engine revving nearby the lock gates had opened and bolcke was engaging the boat to leave the chamber two canal workers tossing down the mooring lines spotted pitt in the water and called to one of the guards bolcke spotted pitt too and gunned the engine ignoring the tossed lines the crew boat leaped forward toward the open gates spilling the stern line in the water pitt reacted at once swimming a few short strokes and grabbing the floating line it went taut yanking him through the water as the guard arrived and shouted at bolcke to stop bolcke ignored the request pushing down on the throttle pitt felt like his arms were being yanked out of their sockets but he hung on as the boat zipped ahead clearing the lock bolcke looked back and cursed at seeing pitt in tow leaving the boats controls he stepped to the stern line and released the secured end from its deck cleat the line bounded over the stern freeing the boat and bolcke from the relentless man who refused to let go rudi you better get down here right away okay hiram on my way gunn hung up the phone and bolted from his office rather than wait for an elevator he ran down a stairwell and emerged in the numa computer center seconds later yaeger sat in his command chair in front of the massive video screen it showed a freighter moving slowly into a narrow compartment what do you have gunn looked at the screen panama canal this is the pedro miguel locks viewed through one of the canal authoritys live video feeds ive been monitoring their cameras while waiting to hear from dirk and summer about the raid yes ive been waiting for their call check this out i recorded it just a few minutes ago yaeger keyed up earlier footage of the same view which showed a small boat come into one of the chambers a few minutes later an inflatable boat entered the parallel chamber and landed by the control house gunn stared at the figures who stepped out of the boat that looks like ann and dirk so that is ann yaeger said i wasnt sure what she looked like but i pegged dirk they watched the rest of the events unfold including pitts battle with pablo and his watery ride out of the lock the two could only stare in disbelief could that be bolcke in the boat yaeger asked yes gunn said he must still have the plans or pitt wouldnt be after him what do we do gunn shook his head with a dazed look sandecker he said finally we better call sandecker the line went slack in pitts hand after his short aquatic sled ride catching his breath he watched bolcke speed across the lake hed been pulled just a short distance into miraflores lake at the shoreline a few yards away was a landing with a moored boat pitt swam toward the boat and reached it in short order it was a small auxiliary tugboat used by the canal authority to supplement the operating tugs used to maneuver large ships pitt pulled himself aboard and quietly untied the mooring lines then made his way to the wheelhouse he started the engine and pulled away from shore oblivious to the standby crew who were busy assisting with the lock operations as he turned into the lake he pushed the tug to top speed as it passed a large object floating in the water it was the body of pablo crushed and mangled from his death ride through the drainage culverts the tug was no match for bolckes crew boat but it didnt have to be miraflores lake was small just over a mile long bolcke couldnt escape from view and if he wished to flee on the crew boat he would have to pass through another series of locks following a half mile behind pitt soon realized that wasnt bolckes plan the crew boat pulled alongside a large freighter idling on the lake and waited for its accommodation ladder to be lowered two armed men with asian features descended the ladder and pulled the boat alongside bolcke handed one of the men the bin containing the sea arrows plans then stepped off the boat approaching from its stern pitt saw that the blackhulled freighter was named the santa rita ported out of guam the men were halfway up the ladder when pitt barreled alongside in the tug spotting pitt in the wheelhouse bolcke stared at him as if he were a ghost he spoke quickly to the gunmen the man carrying the bin raced to the top of the ladder but the second gunman stopped and aimed his weapon he studied the tugboat with a cautious eye and fired a warning burst ahead of it then he swung the gun toward pitt in the wheelhouse pitt heeded the message turning away from the side of the freighter and motoring on ahead zhou approached the deck rail as bolcke climbed aboard welcome zhou said with faint emotion bolcke stood wildeyed catching his breath after climbing the steps my ship was rammed and sunk my facility attacked and destroyed we have lost the motor and my assistant pablo was killed but i escaped with the supercavitation plans they are worth more than the motor zhou stared at the austrian relieved that he was not a suspect in the destruction of his complex but the loss of the sea arrows motor was a failure even with receipt of the plans this changes our agreement of course but we can discuss it later we need to clear the miraflores locks at once zhou nodded we are next in line to make the transit who was that in the tugboat bolcke looked at the tugboat receding in the distance just a nuisance he cant stop us now the nuisance named pitt had plowed ahead of the santa rita searching for a way to stop the ship and recover the plans alone in the tugboat he had few options he studied the lake ahead seeing that at its far end the slim waterway split a southerly fork led to a narrow dam and spillway that controlled the water level of the lake to the north was the twin set of locks also named miraflores one of the chambers had just opened its gates releasing a large white cruise ship the locks he knew would be a dead end bolcke no doubt had the same paid influence at miraflores as he did at pedro miguel any plea to halt the freighters passage through the locks would result in pitt being arrested just like dirk and ann until the santa rita was safely at sea he had to find another way chugging along the shoreline he noted an old barge filled with mud that was moored near the dam he continued on circling in front of the locks and passing near the cruise ship which he noted had a familiar look he dropped back to confirm the name beneath her slightly damaged stern deck then smiled as a plan came to mind splendid he muttered to himself simply splendid captain you have a radio call from the canal tug off our port beam captain franco stepped across the cruise ships bridge and grabbed a handset from the deck officer this is sea splendour captain franco speaking good morning captain this is dirk pitt he stuck his head out of the tugs wheelhouse and waved toward the cruise ship my friend pitt the captain said it is a small world what are you doing here working for the canal authority not exactly theres a critical situation at hand and i need your help of course i owe my ship and my career to you what do you require he spoke for a few minutes then hung up the phone with a sullen look he stepped over to his assigned canal pilot who stood at the helm monitoring their track roberto the captain said with a forced smile you look hungry why dont you go down to the galley for a quick meal well call you to the bridge when we approach the locks at pedro miguel the grizzled pilot who was fighting a rum hangover perked up at the offer thank you captain the channel is wide through the lake so youll have no problems he departed the bridge the first officer looked at franco this is most unusual captain what are you doing franco stepped to the helm and stared out the window with a vacant gaze completing the career that should have ended in valparaiso he said quietly then ordered the ship to turn about pitt maneuvered the tug away from the cruise ship and drove hard toward the shoreline his target was the rusty barge used in the canals ongoing dredging operations nearly full of thick mud it rode low in the water awaiting a tow to be dumped in the pacific pitt pulled inshore of the barge tied the tug to its rail and sprinted across her deck walkway near the bow he found the barges mooring line a thick rope that he wrestled to free from a massive cleat dropping the line over the side pitt raced back to the tug and put it to work he turned parallel to the side of the barge and nudged the barge into deeper water it drifted close to the main channel so pitt backed away and took up a new position on its flat stern shoving the barge toward the locks a few hundred yards away the chinese ship santa rita had inched in front of the locks waiting for a gate to open glancing over his shoulder pitt saw the sea splendour sweep up behind him having used its bow thrusters to quickly turn around when pitt had first spotted the sea splendour the cruise ship he had saved in chile he thought he might use her to block the entrance to the locks but the santa rita was already positioned there leaving no room for the cruise ship to intrude his backup plan was much more audacious if not foolhardy if he couldnt block the santa rita from entering the locks then hed prevent her from leaving them from the confines of miraflores lake there was only one way to do that shoving the barge ahead he guided it toward the locks then veered south following the fork in the waterway rather than aiming for the locks the tug and barge were now headed for the adjacent dam pitt noticed the shadow of the massive cruise ship as it thundered alongside him sea splendour ready when you are the radio crackled roger sea splendour ill guide you in he eased the tug away from the barge and then directed the cruise ship into his place matching speed the cruise ship its high bow brushing against the barges stern maintained headway looking good splendour pitt said give it all youve got nudging against the barge the cruise ship briefly applied full power it was a short burst but enough to send the barge racing through the water pitt tried to keep pace in the tug watching the dam loom closer until it was barely a hundred yards away reverse engines pitt radioed thanks sea splendour ill take it from here good luck to you mr pitt franco said pressing the tug to full power he caught up to the barges stern as the cruise ship dug in to reverse course the loaded barge was like a runaway freight train with the tug simply maintaining its momentum pitt bumped its stern quarter keeping it aligned as it raced toward the middle of the concrete dam the barge closed quickly charging dead center into the spillway pitt braced himself for the impact which came harder than he anticipated the flat prow of the barge slammed into the spillway with a metallic thudand stopped cold the tug bounced off the barges stern and pitt went flying over the helm staggering back to the wheel he turned the tug away and considered his failed attempt to burst open a dam that had stood since he had succeeded in only wedging a barge into its centuryold spillway then a deep rumble sounded from below several feet beneath the waterline the barge had fractured the dam facing the fracture grew as the pressure of the lakes water forced its way into the fissure with a sudden buckle and roar a fiftyfoot section of the dam wall disintegrated leading the way for the collapse of the entire dam pitt looked in awe as the barge slid forward and disappeared over the edge crashing with an audible impact as it struck the waterway forty feet below the tug felt an immediate draw from the escaping water and pitt had to quickly steer clear to elude the suction the sea splendour had already backed well clear as captain franco hurried to take the cruise ship to the deepest part of the lake near pedro miguel pitt turned his attention to the santa rita the freighter was still stationed in front of the locks awaiting its passage to the pacific as pitt turned the tug away from the shattered dam he saw the gates of the north chamber slowly swing open hed done what he could he told himself now it was simply a matter of time and physics bolcke was the first to realize what pitt was attempting watching the barge tumble through the break in the dam he turned to zhou on the bridge of the santa rita hes trying to lower the water level to pin us in we need to enter the locks right away zhou said nothing he had no control over the gates and was surprised when a moment later they opened as if by command the chinese freighter crept forward entering the chamber as lines were affixed to the small locomotives on the dock a frequent traveler through the locks bolcke noted right away that something was askew the freighters main deck sat well below the topside of the dock that shouldnt have happened until the chamber was drained already the water level was several feet lower than normal he rushed to the ships radio and screamed into the transmitter transit central this is santa rita close the gates behind us at once i repeat close the gates behind us inside the miraflores locks control house bolckes call was readily ignored the staff was busy trying to determine what was happening at the spillway someone had seen the sea splendour and a tugboat in the area but nobody had noticed anything until the barge went over the side the locks security force was immediately mobilized and boats were sent to investigate both sides of the dam a blackandwhite speedboat intercepted pitt as he made his way to the locks before the security men could hail him pitt stopped the tug and shouted a small ship lost control and crashed through the dam there were many people aboard you need to look for survivors im going to the lock for more help the security leader bought pitts tale and ordered the speedboat to go investigate only later would he question the presence of pitt on a canal authority tugboat pitt pushed the tug ahead spotting a distant gray vessel waiting to enter the south chamber from the opposite end he headed for the north chamber following after the santa rita noticing that the narrow lake was draining faster than he expected a large inlet pipe which fed the lake water into the chambers was growing more and more visible above the surface pitt was thankful to find the gates to the santa ritas chamber still open and he eased the prow of the tugboat inside there it became even more evident how much water had receded the santa rita sat low in the chamber her main deck easily twenty feet below the dock but it wasnt quite enough the santa rita was on a pacificbound transit and would be lowered twentyseven feet before passing through the chamber the water level would have to drop well below that to prevent her from continuing on transit central to auxiliary tug please state your business a voice on the radio called pitt picked up the transmitter transit central this is security checking for possible damage to the north chamber gates it didnt take long for bolcke to intercede transit central that tug operator is an impostor he is responsible for the damage to the dam apprehend him at once pitt turned off the radio knowing his play was over all he could do now was to keep the tug blocking the gates opento the extent it wouldnt get him killed ahead a handful of armed men appeared on the deck of santa rita and took up positions along the side and stern rails beyond pitts field of vision a contingent of canal authority security men exited the control house and ran toward the tug a few hundred yards away the last vestiges of the miraflores dam gave way releasing an expanded flood downstream along the lakes shoreline the water had dramatically receded leaving muddy flats nearly to the dredged shipping channel the remaining waters draw became stronger and pitt felt the tug drift back when he eased off the throttle slipping out the gates momentarily he saw the outside culvert was now fully visible the level had dropped almost a dozen feet since pitt had entered the chamber and continued to drain out the open gates he saw the gates begin to close and he bulled into the chamber once more the lock operator no longer heeded the tugs safety and ordered the gates closed despite him pitt considered blocking the gates but realized the small tug would be crushed by the sixhundredton gates glancing again at the santa rita he realized it no longer mattered the ship showed a slight list to starboard where it leaned against the side of the chamber the water level in the chamber had dropped enough to set the santa rita on her keel pitt gunned the tugboat past the closing gates and motored alongside the santa rita bumping to a stop off its forward port deck gunmen appeared at once aiming their weapons at pitt as he lashed the tug to the ship with his hands raised he stepped to the rail and boarded the freighter one of the gunmen jabbed an ak against his throat and threatened him in mandarin pitt looked at him with a hard smile wheres your boss he didnt have to wait for a translator bolcke and zhou appeared a moment later having watched pitt pull alongside zhou looked at him with curiosity surprised to see him again after their jungle encounter bolcke on the other hand glared at pitt with unadulterated rage you have something i believe that belongs to my country pitt said are you insane bolcke shouted not at all the game is over bolcke youve lost give me the plans you are a fool we will be leaving the lock shortlyand sailing over your dead body youre not going anywhere pitt said your ship is grounded and theres no water in the culvert to refill this chamber in the control house the lock operator had come to the same conclusion the water level where the santa rita sat was now considerably lower than in the next chamber there was no way the exit gates would be opened with an uneven level on the opposite side they will simply release additional water from gatun lake and we shall be on our way bolcke said not with the plans kill him zhou bolcke turned to the agent kill him now zhou stood weighing his options i didnt expect you to be lending him a free ride pitt said to zhou i take it you havent told him who blew up his facility i guess you two have a few things to talk about a cloud of suspicion crossed bolckes face lies he said pure lies but his eyes revealed the desperate realization that his world was crashing down around him there was nothing left for him to do but silence the messenger he spun to a gunman beside him and ripped the ak from his hands aiming the weapon at pitt he was fumbling for the trigger when a shot rang out a crisp red circle appeared on bolckes temple and his ragefilled eyes rolled back in his head the austrian miner collapsed to the deck the automatic rifle clattering out of his hands pitt saw zhou with a chinese mm pistol held at arms length smoke rising from the barrel the man slowly wheeled until he held the gun pointed at pitts chest what if i do as bolcke asked and kill you here pitt caught a shadow out of the corner of his eye and gave the chinese agent a sly grin then you will join me in death a second later zhou sensed more than saw the movement overhead then he looked up and saw the chamber dock lined with a dozen armed men aiming m carbines at him and his crew they were navy sailors deployed from the destroyer spruance in the adjacent lock zhous face expressed no alarm this is liable to create an awkward incident between our two countries he said would it pitt asked armed chinese insurgents aboard a guamflagged ship apprehended while smuggling a murderous slave trader to safety yes i suppose you are right it would prove awkward to at least one of our countries zhou replied in a halting voice and if we return the plans then i should think we shake hands and all go on our merry way zhou looked into pitts green eyes studying the friendly foe who had somehow gained the upper hand he turned and spoke to one of his gunmen the man slowly lowered his weapon and walked to the bridge he returned a moment later with the sealed bin containing the sea arrows plans which he reluctantly handed to pitt taking the bin pitt walked to the side rail and stopped he returned to zhou and stuck out his hand zhou stared at pitt a moment before grasping his hand and shaking it vigorously thanks for saving my life pitt said twice zhou nodded i may come to regret the first instance he said with the faint hint of a smile pitt returned to the rail and climbed up a ladder on the side of the chamber carefully holding the bin when he reached the top he waved his thanks to the navy sailors across the dockand then was promptly arrested by the canal authority security force epilogue red death looks like weve got company boss seated in a lounge chair under an umbrella al giordino kicked open a cooler and tossed an empty beer bottle inside he closed the lid placed his bandaged leg atop the cooler for support and eyed the approaching speedboat he was dressed for a day at the beach in shorts and a hawaiian shirt although he was sitting on a barge in the middle of the panama canal i hope its not another representative from the canal authority pitt was kneeling on the deck nearby checking an assortment of dive equipment actually it looks to be our man from washington the speedboat pulled alongside and rudi gunn hopped aboard the barge with a travel bag hanging over his shoulder he wore khaki pants and an oxford shirt and was drenched in sweat greetings canal wreckers he said he embraced his old friends nobody told me this place would be more miserable than washington in august its not that bad giordino said fishing a cold beer out of the cooler for him the alligators are smaller here you didnt really have to fly down and check on us pitt said believe me im only too happy to get out of that town you created a public relations nightmare with the demolished dam and sunken ships all over the place gunn peered down the waterway at a large green ship that was aground on the canal bank a crew of workers milled about her mangled bow making repairs so she could be floated down the waterway is that the adelaide yes pitt said and were parked over the salzburg gunn shook his head the panamanians are crying bloody murder between fixing the dam raising the salzburg and compensating for lost traffic through the canal uncle sam is going to be writing the country a pretty large check its still a bargain considering what we almost lost i cant disagree sandeckers pleased as punch and the president is extremely grateful however for security reasons he cant divulge what was at stake hes taking lots of heat for what panama is calling reckless american adventurism giordino yanked another beer from the cooler and popped its cap reckless american adventurism ill drink to that of course gunn said the president will be much happier if we return the sea arrows motor i have my best team working on it as we speak pitt said gunn looked up the canal in the other direction eyeing a gray navy destroyer moored a short distance away the spruance pitt said our security escort and lift vessel if were fortunate pitt looked gunn in the eye it was a lucky thing you sent her into the locks when you did i probably wouldnt be here but for the armed detail they deployed hiram and i saw the events unfolding on the canals video system the spruance happened to be heading in for a canal transit so we accelerated her passage or vice president sandecker did i should say he looked over the side rail and saw air bubbles popping on the surface from the divers below how did the cruise ship make out the sea splendour her captain figured he was history but a funny thing happened the italian media made him out as a hero for his role in stopping bolcke and exposing the slave camp once the cruise line realized our government was footing the bill for all the damage they gave him a medal and a promotion the canal pilot aboard at the time didnt fare so well losing his job but i understand captain franco got him an assignment with the cruise line gunn smiled maybe he can get me a new job too the bubbles beneath him grew larger until the two divers appeared gunn recognized dirk and summer as they swam to a dive ladder and climbed aboard hi rudi dirk said come to dive with us the waters warm no thanks gunn looked askance at the turbid water any sign of the motor we found it sitting intact still strapped to the flatbed truck summer said it was somehow tossed clear of the other containers and the salzburg as well the flatbeds pretty mangled but i didnt see any damage to the motor itself dirk said the spruance should easily be able to hoist it up gunn let out a sigh thats great news numa wont have to pay for a new dam now he said giving pitt a sideways look not our area of expertise pitt replied with a laugh the canal authority did agree to let us supervise the removal of the salzburg from the ditch so it looks like well be enjoying the balmy local weather for some time gunn wiped his brow with a sleeve count me out but i would like to drag dirk and summer back with me to help report on the events that took place gunn reached for his travel bag that reminds me i have a package for you two that i was asked to deliver he rummaged in his bag and retrieved a thin box which he handed to summer she opened it and removed a lengthy handwritten letter clipped to a leatherbound journal as she skimmed the letter dirk eyed the box and noted the return address its from perlmutter what does st julien have to say he says were not going back to washington with rudi summer said looking at her father with persuasive eyes instead were to take a trip to tierra del fuego the mount vernon trail was a picture of tranquillity south of alexandria with only the muted whir of light highway traffic nearby intruding its peacefulness just a few earlymorning joggers and bikers were scattered along its riverfront route pushing to complete their daily workouts before the business day began dan fowler pushed himself to sprint the last few steps of his threemile run crossing an imaginary finish line before slowing to a walk he ambled to a nearby drinking fountain where he lapped up a stream of cool water good morning dan how was your run fowler choked whirling around as water dribbled down his chin his shock at hearing the familiar voice was evident as he turned to find ann bennett standing before him dressed in her usual business attire ann how are you he stammered just fine where have you been weve all been worried sick i had to take a little trip but you didnt tell anyone weve had the police searching for you is everything all right yes a personal matter came up rather unexpectedly fowler glanced around nervously spotting only a few joggers and a man repairing a flat tire on his bicycle are you alone i feared you were in danger im fine i just wanted to talk to you in private sure fowler eyed a grove of trees near the potomac river that offered some seclusion why dont we walk he gently guided her off the trail i had a lot of time to think about the case while i was away she said you probably arent aware of the latest developments fowler said testing her somebody hijacked one of the sea arrows propulsion motors on its way to groton yes i was aware of that are there any suspects no the fbi hit a wall on the case im not surprised tell me dan what do you know about the ads system ads isnt that some sort of crowdcontrol device that the army cooked up i really dont know much about it cooked up is right ann thought back to her first encounter with the device in new orleans didnt you tell me you were with the army research lab yes i did a short stint there why do you ask according to their personnel director you managed the security for the active denial system program in that capacity you would have had access to all its plans perhaps youd find it interesting to know that the army is not alone in possessing the technology as a matter of fact edward bolcke has a unit on one of his ships what are you driving at ann dan how long have you been on bolckes payroll they were almost to the trees fowler smiled at ann thats preposterous we both know that tom cerny at the white house is your likely turncoat ann you really shouldnt jump into the water if you dont know how to swim ann ignored the insult cerny was a good red herring i bought into him for a while until i reviewed his detailed security clearance despite your allusions he has had no involvement with any military technologies that have been compromised he also hasnt set foot in central america in over twenty years hes clean fowler said nothing as they reached the edge of the grove on the other hand ann said i just discovered that you were a founding partner of securetek the security subcontractor that was later sold to edward bolcke youre reaching now am i weve tracked financial payments that were wired from bolckes company to a bank account in your name here in washington this time she was bluffing but she was confident that further investigation would prove as much fowler kept walking guiding her deeper into the trees after a long pause he said suppose youre right now what youll be tried for espionage and spend the rest of your life in jail safely obscured from view fowler lunged at ann cuffing her around the neck and slamming her against a large red oak no fowler said i think it ends here ann stood frozen against the tree as fowler yanked a bandanna from his pocket and rolled it thin wrapping it around her throat he pulled on the ends to strangle her she pushed against him but he was too strong pinning her against the tree with his legs her head spun and she began to chokethen she heard a gruff voice from behind fowler let her go fowler turned to see two men dressed as joggers aiming glock pistols at his head the man he had seen fixing a bike came running up wielding an hk submachine gun fbi he shouted youre under arrest fowler slowly released his grip on ann letting the bandanna fall to the ground one of the fbi agents yanked him away as another cuffed his hands behind his back before he was dragged to a waiting car ann stepped close and looked him in the eye dan trust me on this one i do know how to swim the seas off tierra del fuego were living up to their latitudinal nickname of the furious fifties a strong westerly blew thick heaving waves that broke with a boisterous flourish rifling currents added to the fury shoving about the occasional stray iceberg that had drifted in from antarctica over the centuries these combined forces had carried many a ship to her grave in the frigid waters surrounding cape horn all that was missing was a good williwawthe sudden violent gusts that pounded the cape without warning a small trawler plowed gamely through the maelstrom giving its occupants a rollercoaster ride inside the wheelhouse summer grabbed hold of the chart table as the boat slid down a fifteenfoot wave you couldnt have found a bigger boat she asked with lament dirk smiled and shook his head the nautical offerings were slim on short notice in the nearby argentinean town of ushuaia he felt lucky to have chartered the trawler from ushuaia their trek down the beagle channel had been relatively calm but on reaching the open ocean the ride had changed dramatically thats isla nueva straight ahead said the captain a stocky man with white hair summer peered out the wheelhouse window at a hilly green island a mile ahead kind of scenic in a remote sort of way how big is it about eight miles across dirk said we should be able to scan the full perimeter in four or five hours she sure ended up a long way from home she was the barbarigo their impromptu search was guided by the package perlmutter had sent to them in panama inside they had found a logbook from the sailor leigh hunt recording his roundtheworld voyage intrigued by what summer had discovered on madagascar perlmutter had tracked down hunts family one of hunts children had located the logbook after an extended search in the attic of the familys home the log provided a detailed accounting of the sailors position when he sighted the south atlantic wraith summer picked up the log and reexamined hunts entries as they rolled through the waves he says he was sailing north of nueva and lennox islands when he saw the wraith drifting toward nueva that means it was likely drifting toward the islands west coast the trawler was approaching nuevas eastern shore which was faced with high dark cliffs waves pounded against the rocky shoreline spraying billows of white foam hope the coast is milder on the other side dirk said if she hit the rocks around here we wont find her on this trip dirk had the captain bring the trawler as close to shore as possible and they began a counterclockwise survey of the island their search was purely for any visible signs of the submarine had she run aground if that failed a sonar survey of the surrounding waters would follow with the arrival of a numa research vessel they had scanned dozens of satellite images sent by yaeger identifying a handful of coastal anomalies that could be the remains of the barbarigo the only way to find out was to inspect the sites regardless of the angry seas they reached the north side of the island passing towering rocks that could have crushed an approaching vessel two sites marked on the satellite photos proved to be rock formations that bore only faint resemblance to a submarine as they worked their way west the coastal terrain flattened revealing a mixed shoreline of coarse beaches and jagged boulders coming up on our third site dirk said comparing a satellite photo with the trawlers navigation screen summer held a pair of binoculars to her eyes struggling to hold focus as the deck rolled tell me when were directly offshore dirk plotted the boats progress sometime now summer studied the shoreline scanning a small gravel beach between two rocky outcroppings she caught sight of a smooth shape then was knocked against the bulkhead by a large wave take us in closer she searched for the object againand spotted a smooth rounded band tucked against the rocks somethings there though it doesnt look very big she passed the binoculars to her brother take a look yes its some kind of manmade object he lowered the binoculars and looked at his sister lets go see whats there the captain had to sail another mile down the coast before he found a small cove that afforded protection from the waves a small rubber boat was launched and dirk and summer paddled the short distance to land as they pulled the boat onto the beach a squall blew in dousing them with rain last time we were on an island dirk said i would have killed for this kind of storm they trudged up the coast in the downpour fighting the stiff offshore breeze that pelted their faces with stinging drops despite the dismal conditions summer noted the rugged beauty of this island at the tip of south america but the coastal terrain became monotonous in the pouring rain and after a half hour of hiking they became unsure about where they had spotted the anomaly standing at the waters edge studying the surrounding rocks summer finally spotted the object farther up the beach it was a rusty curved plate of steel about six feet long wedged firmly in the rocks ill go out on a limb dirk said it could be part of a submarine conning tower summer nodded and looked out to sea she probably struck those rocks and sank offshore or drifted out to sea again no dirk said his voice registering surprise i think that weve been looking in the wrong direction he tapped summers arm and pointed inland she saw only a narrow gravel beach beyond was a shrubcovered hollow at the base of a rocky knoll the beach was barren so she gazed at the hollowand her jaw dropped poking through the shrubs another fifty feet inland was the rest of the conning tower they scrambled across the beach and into the thicket where the entire hull of a submarine was concealed in the brush the vessel was threequarters buried but dirk could tell they had approached it from the stern where there once was a drive propeller he saw only a mangled shaft they hiked along the hull until they reached the exposed conning tower which rose like an abandoned castle summer pulled a blackandwhite photo from her pocket and compared it to the rusting steel hulk it was a perfect match she smiled at her brother its the barbarigo they climbed up the battered remnants of the conning tower where they could make out the imposing hulk of the entire boat through the underbrush how could it have landed way up here summer asked probably a rogue wave the area around cape horn is notorious for them it must have been a real monster to throw her this far inland summer gazed at the bow do you think her cargo is still aboard it was the sixtyfourthousanddollar questionand the reason they had rushed down to tierra del fuego for perlmutter had uncovered much more than just the sailors logbook he had pieced together the mystery of the barbarigos last voyage it all started with the german scientist oswald steiner who had boarded the sub in malaysia steiner perlmutter found was a highly regarded physicist known for his research in advanced electromagnetics pressed into military research by the nazis he dabbled in their atomic program before focusing on a secret project of his own a magnetic rail gun steiner advanced the theory that a projectile launched at extreme velocities could travel up to fifty miles allowing the germans to bombard the southeast coast of england from normandy for the system to work he needed the most powerful magnets in the world and those came from one source rare earths in there was little demand for any of the rare earth elements which were difficult to extract and refine germany and her conquests had few of the minerals but steiner found a lone source that could meet his needs a small garnet mine in malaysia under japanese control extracted samarskite as a byproduct the samarskite contained high concentrations of the rare earth samarium a key element in producing highperformance magnets traveling to malaysia steiner was stunned to discover a large stockpile of the mineral amassed over years from mining operations the local workers referred to it as red death due to its deep russet color but it was steiner who determined it was lightly radioactive which in time had produced illness in some of the miners thrilled with his discovery steiner requested transport of the samarskite back to germany an italian submarine called the tazzoli was assigned the task but was sunk in transit when the barbarigo arrived in singapore scheduled to pick up a supply of rubber and zinc steiner had her orders changed and stuffed her with samarskite accompanying the shipment home he died with the italian crew after they had to abandon the damaged sub dirk looked down the barbarigos forward deck at an exposed patch of steel near the bow he descended the conning tower and hiked across the forward deck which was covered with mud and rocks from the hill above summer followed him to an indented section near the bow kicking away the builtup soil he exposed the rusted deck he eventually uncovered a looped bar welded on horizontally it was a handgrip for the forward hatch cover summer joined in scraping away the overburden until they cleared the cover complete with its locking wheel latch think itll budge summer asked dirk gave the wheel latch a few firm kicks to break the seal give me a hand and well find out they both gripped the wheel and threw their weight against it after several tries the latch broke its decadeslong grip and spun freely dirk gave his sister a hopeful wink and heaved open the hatch a dank and musty odor rose from the opening there was little to see as the dark interior was filled almost to the ceiling with sediment sand mud or mineral they couldnt tell dirk reached inside and groped around until he grabbed a clump of the material he held it up for summer to see it was a rock dark yet shiny and lustrous in the gray light of the rain squall summer could make out a reddish tint is it red death dirk looked at the rock and grinned no i think it would be crimson gold six months later a throng of dignitaries and navy veterans nearly three thousand strong poured through the gates of the new london navy base under a cool and cloudy sky the visitors were guided to a dock where row upon row of folding chairs faced connecticuts thames river filling the view was the navys latest fast attack submarine the uss north dakota having completed her sea trials she was now awaiting the last formal act of commissioning before taking to the seas in service of her country pitt and loren threaded their way through the crowd to take their seats in the second row behind a herd of fleet admirals in fulldress uniform eyeing the navy brass pitt wondered if their prime seating was on account of his efforts to save the sea arrow or lorens clout on capitol hill when the chief of naval operations stopped by and fawned over his wife he decided it was the latter a short time later vice president sandecker arrived led by a blockade of pentagon officials a trademark stogie dangled from his lips as he was ushered to a seat near the podium spotting pitt and loren he slipped from his escorts and made his way to the couple youre looking ravishing as always loren he said despite the riffraff clinging to your arm loren laughed he still cleans up well good to see you again mr vice president where are summer and dirk i thought theyd be here loren raised her brow in curiosity theyre both in rome pitt said the italian government is holding a memorial for the barbarigos crewmen recovered in madagascar the kids were invited as guests of honor wed have been dead in the water if it werent for them sandecker said their discovery of the crews remains helped sway the italians to give us the rare earth elements carried in the submarine kept us from having a onetrick pony today he winked at pitt speaking of rare earth elements loren said i heard a rumor on the hill that the chinese are lifting their export ban theyve told us as much once the australians stepped in and took over edward bolckes mine at mount weld the chinese lost hope of monopolizing the market and our rebuilding efforts at mountain pass are well ahead of schedule fortunately the remnant materials we acquired from bolckes former operations in panama and madagascar have kept us humming an aide materialized at sandeckers side informing the vice president that the ceremony was about to start duty calls he bowed to loren and shook pitts hand before returning to his seat a moment later ann bennett worked her way down the aisle and took an empty seat next to loren hello she said warmly i wasnt sure i was going to make it did you just fly in loren asked yes dan fowlers sentencing was this morning and i didnt want to miss it ironic timing pitt said what did he get she gave a satisfied smile thirty years as the prosecutors hoped an admiral took to the podium and introduced the vice president who gave a rousing speech about protecting the seas from all forms of enemies a string of navy officials followed with the expected words of ceremony during the speeches ann leaned across loren and whispered to pitt is it in the water pitt nodded two nights ago under the downpour they were waiting for and ready for sea trials all systems look good im told i thought the north dakota already had her sea trials loren said yes thats right dear pitt said tightening his lips at the podium the north dakotas honorary sponsor was introduced and sang out the traditional commissioning first order man our ship and bring her to life the crew and officers of the north dakota stepped aboard the submarine to the cheers of the attending crowd pitts eyes looked beyond the vessel focused on a motorized barge surrounded by numerous redandwhite warning buoys where is she ann whispered by the barge on the other side loren noticed that some of the navy officials also seemed more interested in the barge than the newly minted north dakota whats with everybody she asked you all act like theres something more important going on here than the north dakotas launching and why is everyone staring at those buoys by the barge pitt smiled at his wife and squeezed her hand the sea doesnt always reveal all her mysteries he said even under the threat of a rusty butter knife
