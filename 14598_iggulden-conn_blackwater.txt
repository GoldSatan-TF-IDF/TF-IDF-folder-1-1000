conn iggulden blackwater chapter one i stood in the water and thought about drowning its strange how the sea is always calmer at night ive walked along brighton beach a hundred times on cold days and the waves are always there sliding over and over each other in the dark the water is smooth and black with just a hiss of noise as it vanishes into the pebbles you cant hear it in the day over gulls and cars and screaming children but at night the sea whispers calling you in the swell pulled at the cloth of my best black suit reaching upwards in the gentle rise and fall of unseen currents it felt intimate somehow as if i was being tugged down and made heavier even the icy brighton wind had grown easy on my skin or perhaps id just gone numb if i had it was a welcome numbness id spent too much time thinking and now there was just the final choice of walking into a deeper dark i heard the crunch of footsteps on the shingle but i didnt turn my head in dark clothes i knew i would be almost invisible to the dog walkers or late night revellers or whoever else had braved the cold id seen a few pale figures in the distance by the pier and heard high voices calling to each other they didnt touch me there was something wonderful about standing in the sea fully clothed id left the land behind me with all its noise and light and discarded chips in lumps of wet paper i tasted bitterness in my mouth but i was free of fear and guilt free of all of it when i heard his voice i thought it was a memory now how bad can it be to have you standing out there on a night like this he said my older brothers voice i could not help the spasm of nervousness that broke through my numb thoughts i had been there for hours i was ready to walk into the deep water until my clothes grew heavy and i could empty my lungs in a sudden rush of bright bubbles i was ready and his voice pulled me back just as securely as if he had cast a line that snagged on my jacket if you go in now youll drown us both he said ill have to follow you you know that and maybe just one will come out i replied my voice rough i heard him laugh and i couldnt turn to face him id feared him all my life and if i turned i knew id have to look him in the eyes i heard him chuckle softly maybe davey boy maybe it would be you i thought of a boy wed both known a lad with a cruel streak a mile wide his name had been robert penrith though even his mother called him bobby i can see her face at his funeral so white she looked as if she was made of paste id stood at the side of a damp hole in the ground watching the box being lowered in and i remember wondering if shed ever known how her son had terrorized us he liked humiliation more than pain did bobby his favourite was the simple thing of forcing you down to the ground with your legs right over your head so pressed that you could barely take a breath when he did it to me i remember his face reddening with mine until i could feel my pulse thumping in my ears even as young as i was i knew there was something wrong with the way he grew so hot and excited as a man the thought of being so helpless makes me want to scratch myself i think my brother killed him id never had the nerve to ask outright but our eyes had met as the coffin dropped down into the hole between us i hadnt known how to look away but before i could hed winked at me and id remembered all the secret cruelties of his life bobby penrith had drowned in a lake so far north of brighton it was like another world my brother had dared him across on a day when the water was so cold it turned the skin blue my brother had made it to the other side to where we waited in a shivering group he climbed out as if he was made of rubber flopping and staggering before leaning on a rock and vomiting steaming yellow liquid onto his bare feet i think i knew before anyone else though i stared past him with the others waiting for a glimpse of bobbys red scalp coming doggedly in it took divers to bring him back in the end beaching his body three hours later with the lake busier than the tourist season the police had interviewed us all and my brother had been in tears the divers had cursed with all the anger of men who fished for dead children on bitter days we felt their scorn like blows as we shivered in rough red blankets id listened while my brother told them nothing worth hearing he hadnt seen it happen he said the first he knew of the tragedy was when he reached the far bank alone i might have believed him if he hadnt seen bobby hurting me only the day before you never really know when a story starts do you bobby had decided i deserved a special punishment for breaking some rule of his id been crying when my brother came by and bobby let go neither of us was sure what he might do but there was a hard tightness to my brother that even lads like bobby found frightening just a glance at his dark eyes and a face that looked a little white over the bones and bobby had dropped me straight away the two of them had looked at each other and my brother had smiled a day later and bobby penrith was cold and blue on the side of derwentwater i didnt dare ask the question and it had settled inside me like a cold lump i felt guilty even for the freedom it brought me i could walk past bobbys house without the usual terror that he would see me and fall into step at my side the boy had an evil streak in him but he was not a match for my brother and only a fool would have tried to swim on a november day only a boy who had been frightened by an even bigger fish than he was in the utter darkness of the brighton shingle i began to shiver with the cold of course he noticed and i heard a note of amusement in his voice as he went on they say suicides dont feel pain did you ever hear that davey they cut and cut away at themselves but theyre so wrapped up in their own heads that the cowardly little shits barely feel a sting can you believe that it is a strange world i hadnt felt the cold before i thought it was numbness but now it seemed to hit me all at once as if the wind was tearing right through the skin my hidden feet were aching with a cold that gnawed up the bones of my legs i crossed my arms over my chest and i felt it all coming back to me i would have given anything for numbness then the alternative was terror and shame are you going to tell me why my brave little brother would be out standing in the sea on a cold night he went on the wind is freezing the arse off me i can only imagine what it must be like for you davey id have brought a coat if id known i felt tears on my cheeks and i wondered why they werent turning to ice with the cold that pierced me there are things i cant bear any more i said after a time i didnt want to talk about it i wanted that fine and simple mood id been in when he arrived when i was calm my bladder had filled without me noticing and now it made itself felt every part of me that had been ruled by my misery now seemed to have woken and be screaming for attention for warmth how long had i been standing there i have an enemy i said softly there was silence behind me and i didnt know if he had heard me or not how deep are you in he said and for an insane moment i thought he meant the water i cant handle it i said shaking my head i cant i cant stop it more tears came and at last i turned to face the man my brother had become his face was still stretched over his bones and his hair was a dark bristle over pale skin there were women who thought him handsome to the point of compulsion though he never stayed long with one it seemed to me that his cruelty was there for the world to see in that hard face and watchful eyes i was the only one who thought this the rest of the world saw what he wanted them to see he had brought a coat i noticed despite his words his hands were dug into the pockets let me help he said the moon gave enough light to see the rising shingle behind him a million tons of loose stone at his back should have made him insignificant should have reduced him yet he was solidly there as if hed been planted no doubts for the man my brother had become no conscience no guilt id always known he was lacking that extra little voice that torments the rest of us id always been afraid of it but when he offered i felt nothing but relief what can you do i said i can kill him davey like i did before i could not speak for a long slow breath i hadnt wanted to know my mind filled with images of bobby penrith flagging as he swam in freezing water my brother was a fine swimmer and it would not have taken much to hold him under to exhaust him just a flurry of splashing and then the smooth strokes towards the shore arriving as if exhausted perhaps he had been perhaps bobby had struggled and fought back with all the strength of desperation i looked into my brothers eyes and saw all of the years between us tell me he said chapter two denis tanter was not the sort of man to frighten you on first meeting in fact when i was placed at his table during a new years eve party i hardly noticed him at first he was short and compact like a featherweight boxer hed been one in his twenties i discovered later and he still had the posture and freckled skin that flushed easily he had a good grip and red hair which was just about all i took in before i was pulling crackers and trying to remember how id ended up sitting with strangers on a night meant for family i didnt see him as a threat and he really wasnt at that point not to me ive met a lot of men like him over the years and they usually dismiss me after the first brief clasp of hands im not one of the breed or something they rank me as harmless and move on i could leave more of an impression if i tried but i just cant make myself care about the little rituals of life especially between men maybe that has hurt me my wife carol was doing her usual social duty with the other wives sounding each other out on income children and education ive seen attractive women who can raise female hackles up to fifty yards but carol slips under the radar somehow she always dresses with a bit of class and shes one of those who seem to be able to match earrings with a bracelet so theres always a polished feel to her god save us from beautiful women they have too many advantages once or twice ive caught the end of one of her private smiles a glance or wink or some more subtle signal that says at least we understand to a complete stranger it works to disarm women but it also works on men i usually see it coming from the casual touching and standing a little too close to seeing them drive past me as i walk home theres nothing quite so depressing as peering into a car as it goes by in the rain there used to be arguments once when i still cared enough i struggled with a man on wet grass until he scrambled away leaving me with a broken nose its amazing how sticky blood is when its on your hands i wouldnt have chosen the marriage for myself not like that we used to scream at each other and twice she locked me out of the house maybe i should have left but i didnt some people just dont and i cant give you a better reason than that i loved her then i love her now i know shes scared of a thousand things of growing old of having children i tell myself she takes these men into our bed when she cant bear herself any longer and that sort of lie helps more than you might think these days i just dont ask her about the nights she spends away i dont let her come to bed until shes washed the scent off her and somehow we get by year after year i love her and i hate her and if you dont know how that works i really envy you when i was twentytwo i went with carol to a club in camden ive known her forever you know my brother was with us and he had a pretty thing named rachel on his arm a girl who danced every saturday at the club she wasnt paid for it but they had a raised stage there and no one objected to the sight of her moving as well as she did that club was almost completely dark and heavy with heat and music whenever you thought you could catch a breath a dry ice machine would kick in and the dance floor would fill with choking whiteness we got ourselves drunk on large bottles of newcastle brown ale and when the right tune came on we climbed onto that raised section to join her it was larger than i realized and there were people against the wall behind us as we stamped and cheered it was hotter than youd believe and i had my shirt off but i was slim enough and young enough not to give a damn what anybody thought some of that evening goes and comes in flashes but i do remember my brothers girlfriend whipping her hair round and round next to me so that it struck my chest and shoulders hard enough to sting i loved it a man came out of the shadows by the back wall and asked carol to dance he was short and slim and swayed slightly as he stood there i could see he was drunk and i didnt think he was a threat just as i missed denis tanter on that first night maybe thats my problem i just dont see these people coming carol shook her head in that sweetly apologetic way she has and pointed to her loving husband spoken for sorry you know how it is he stared where she pointed before shrugging and turning away that should have been it i didnt realize anything was happening until i was struck on the back of the head have you ever been knocked with very little force and had it hurt like you were on fire there are pressure points all over your body like little traitors to your selfesteem the way that drunk hit me was the exact opposite i felt it had been really hard but somehow it didnt hurt at all i looked around in confusion thinking i had been bumped by someone passing by the little bastard was standing directly behind me his eyes shining in the strobe lights it was carol who shouted over the noise of the music that hed tried to butt his head into mine he was completely blank with drink and as he grinned at me i suddenly couldnt bear it i shoved him in the chest with both hands and he fell flat at the feet of a dozen strangers i remember thinking that if he got up id have to jump down from the stage and lose myself in the crowd i dont fight people in clubs i refuse to be ashamed of the fact that i dont enjoy the rush of panic adrenalin the way others seem to my heart was beating so fast that i felt lightheaded and ill acid came into my mouth and i swallowed hard wincing carol came to stand at my shoulder and the pair of us looked down at him he still looked harmless as he lay sprawled and his grin never faltered even then even though hed gone for me already i didnt think he was dangerous my brother had managed to miss all the excitement with a trip to the bar by the time he returned carol and i had moved quietly to one side of the little stage with a solid wall to our backs ive said i didnt think he was a threat that little man but i didnt want to dance with my back to him either my brother didnt know anything about it of course he passed out the drinks and carried on dancing and whooping with the crowd god we were young then hed taken off his shirt as well even prouder of his wiry frame than i was of mine i saw my attacker coming out of the darkness my brother was dancing where i had been dancing and he was dressed almost exactly the same the man smashed a bottle over the base of his skull and the two of them hurtled off the stage to the dance floor parting the crowd as they fell i froze for a moment and im not proud of that it felt like the music had stopped but of course it hadnt carol screamed and then i moved jumping down and grabbing hold of two slippery bodies locked together my brother had been taken completely by surprise but as i heaved at them he was grunting and fighting like a madman i could see the whites of their eyes and bared teeth the pair of them were straining at each others flesh with desperate strength i couldnt break my brothers grip my hands slipped on the skin and to my horror i realized there was a hell of a lot of blood coming from somewhere there was broken glass everywhere and beer and blood on my hands i reached down again and at that moment the dry ice machine kicked in thick fog filled the dance floor and we all went blind i strained to take a breath terrified that i was going to be punched or cut while i couldnt see i still had a hold of slippery skin and somewhere below me they continued to gouge at each other in a frenzy causing as much pain and damage as possible i heard the bouncers coming at last and there were pointing hands and shouting people everywhere i felt strong arms pull me away god knows where carol had gone to at that point i didnt blame her for getting clear of it i blamed the evil little drunk that the bouncers threw out of a back entrance my brother was lifted to his feet looking like a wild man he was dazed and covered in trails of blood right down his bare chest the bouncers took him to their own bathroom somewhere in the back of the club and i went with him to wash the muck off my hands it really is amazing how blood can gum up your fingers even a small amount can go further than you think we were alone in that echoing bathroom and i felt like an actor behind the stage the music had continued right through what happened and we could still hear the thumping rhythms though they were far away all right i hadnt been involved but id been afraid and i was bloody i felt like id survived a battle away from the crowds and the danger my spirits rose quickly enough even when i saw the gash in his neck from the bottle it seeped sluggishly producing a dark heavy trail that would not be staunched he looked at it in the mirror and i saw how pale hed gone we should get you to hospital for stitches i told him he was still stunned and i didnt want him to ask why hed been attacked by a maniac for no reason i knew it should have been me and i felt enough relief and guilt to be lightheaded when he turned to me i could see he was raging i handed him a wad of toilet paper for his neck he could have killed me he said dabbing at the wound while he stared back at himself in the mirror where did he go hell be long gone by now i replied the bouncers threw him out he shrugged pulling on his shirt over the pad of tissues he swore as he saw his trousers had been gashed and that there was more blood staining the cloth he owes me he said i followed him out he should have gone home that man whatever his name was he shouldnt have been standing at a bus stop only fifty yards from the club that was his second mistake of the evening and sometimes just one can get you killed when he saw my brother stalking towards him he should have run he really should instead he just grinned the same soft grin like he didnt have a care in the world my brother hit him hard enough to put him down cutting his knuckles on the mans teeth then he kicked him as he lay there twice before he even curled up i should have stopped it then hell i should have stopped him leaving the club and just insisted on taking him to hospital i didnt though i wanted a little revenge as well i could have been killed that evening im not proud of it but there was a debt to be paid another kick to the head and it should have been over but two more muted thumps kept him down i couldnt see the mans face and i didnt want to i was slow holding my brother back but in the end when it was late i did i take comfort from that i am not him even when im full of anger and spite i am not he would have kicked that man to death maybe he did we left him there on the pavement and i did take my brother to hospital to be stitched and flirted with by a nurse i read the next days papers looking for news of a killing in camden near the underworld club there was nothing when we met denis carol still drew men in when she was hungry though shed learned a few things about keeping them at arms length as well for years i hadnt had to deal with one of her hangerson those peculiar males who would pretend to be a caring colleague or a friend while they waited for her to fall into bed with them it was usually enough to have a quiet word just to let them know i knew i didnt need help until we met denis tanter even then it might have been enough to turn a blind eye to a few afternoons in hotels until she had scratched her itch you think the first time is going to kill you but it just doesnt the night is the worst one of your life but when sleep does come it turns off your imagination you wake up the next day and shes there making breakfast and everything is all right again i could have lived with that i knew i could the problem with denis tanter was that he wanted carol all to himself chapter three do you know what gives one man power over other men youd think it would be money or some high position being a judge perhaps or a politician in all honesty when are you ever troubled by that kind of level ive never had the foreign minister turn up at my door and insist i move my car i think if he did i would probably call the police im not saying they dont have power of a kind of course they do too much of it maybe it just isnt the sort of thing that presses you down on a daily basis you dont have them come into your house and take your wallet if you see what i mean there is a lesser place though underneath the courts and security guards right down where it can really tear the spleen right out of you it doesnt take an army and it certainly doesnt take enormous amounts of money for just a few hundred pounds a week one man can hire another one to punch and kick and break maybe even to rape or rob if that was needed just one man to do whatever hes asked thats all it takes i can only imagine what it must be like to have one men like denis tanter spend a pleasant evening in a restaurant and by the time they get home someone they want to frighten has had his door kicked in and his fingers broken by a complete stranger you cant go to the police because you know theyll make it worse the second time you know that fear is usually enough most men arent able to stop one violent criminal holding them down and battering their head so hard on the kitchen tiles that they break most men care about a woman or a child something that grabs them and squeezes their chest in terror if theyre even mentioned you dont get fear like that from politicians or judges you know they have limits no matter what happens if you walk free out of court you dont expect the police to send men round to your house that night to give you a bit of justice id actually met deniss man michael at the new years eve party he wasnt enormous like those bouncers you see on club doorways denis had found himself a solid sixfoot boxer without a single moral to trouble his conscience i even chatted to michael that first evening and i think i should have had some sort of warning some instinct life would be a lot easier if we felt a shiver down the spine when we met a man who will be punching us unconscious a month later i realize now that he stopped me at the bar because denis was talking to carol just one man on the payroll makes that sort of thing easy just a quick word and the husband loses almost an hour in strained small talk with a complete stranger i even had a tray full of drinks but every time i started to go back michael dropped one of his hands onto my arm and made some comment or joke or asked me some inane question i remember he said he had put on a bit of weight over the winter but come spring when he was in season he would turn it back into muscle id never heard anyone describe themselves that way before it wasnt exactly politeness that kept me there it was a prickling fear that he was drunk and he was violent and i didnt want to offend him i stood it as long as i could and when he turned away at last to pick up his change from the barman i walked back to the table carol wasnt there and neither was denis its so easy now to understand what had happened but at the time i just didnt midnight was coming and i had the drinks in i sipped one pint to the dregs and then started on another when she was suddenly back at the table and denis was there too kissing his wife just as the countdown started you wouldnt think i could miss something like that knowing what i did but ive stopped that sort of paranoia it eats you alive especially if youre right every now and then you really cant watch them all the time it destroys your nerves your stomach and maybe your sanity carol did look a little flushed i remember i put it down to alcohol and excitement balloons came down from the ceiling and everybody joined hands with strangers and sang that scottish song where you only know one line and everyone repeats it over and over there was a man in a kilt there and i remember smiling when i saw him and turning to carol to see if shed noticed she smiled back at me and everything was all right the thing that really makes me bitter is that poor old denis didnt know the woman he was dealing with if hed gone hard at her like he did at his business acquaintances hed have had her skirt up after a meal or two the trouble with carol is that she looks the complete opposite if you can imagine a grace kelly with dark hair it isnt her at all but the attitude the long neck and pale skin thats the same shes the sort of woman you want to muss a little to see a tendril of hair come loose and a wicked gleam come into her eyes you know the type shes the sort of woman you want to gasp when you kiss her i worked hard at it when we were young together she was a little drunk that first time with me it wasnt the way id pictured it i could hardly see her in the dark room back at the student halls her thighs were long and white and they made a whispering sound as i ran my hand down them i remember that she cradled my head against her almost like holding a child i think one of us cried but we were drunk and young and it was a long time ago and two different people denis thought he had found the great love of his life of course carol sells houses to people with too much money the sort of people who surround themselves with goldframed pictures and match the colour to their bath taps denis wouldnt have looked out of place on her client list even if hed brought michael as a driver i heard his name when a girl from carols office left a message about taking mr tanter to another viewing i didnt recognize it at first but there was another one the following day i pressed the buttons on the phone and i heard the girls voice with him in the background making a wisecrack i think i probably knew then as i wiped the message carol hadnt heard it yet but i just wanted it off the phone memory as if i could wipe away my suspicions with a couple of quick clicks she hates me when i think something is going on she says i pretend to be normal and friendly but all the time there is a spite in my eyes that she cant bear she says it makes her want to get out of the house sometimes she does and comes back smelling of drink and too much perfume at two or three in the morning when shes drunk i pretend to be asleep if she sees im awake she talks like a gutter whore and its all i can do to lie there and pretend i cant hear every last word of it its just another one of the little games we play with each other i think it took denis about a week to ask her to come to a hotel with him it might have been sooner if hed known her of course but i think he probably felt like the luckiest man in the world as she dropped her skirt to her ankles and stepped out of it ive been on the receiving end of the best she has to offer and it caught me i mean im still here after some pretty vicious years so i can sort of appreciate what denis went through you know im not saying i understand the man he was a taker and i knew it from the first time i met him like my brother he was one of those people who use those around them for fun for sex for friendship sometimes they make a mistake and think theyve found something more important than it really is denis did that with carol the moment he woke up in the hotel and found out shed gone shed come home to me in the small hours and denis was not the sort to understand that kind of relationship hell i dont understand it and im in it she came home to me because she always comes home to me she doesnt stay till the morning not after theyve gone to sleep after all a hotel morning is just bad breath crumpled clothes and a full english breakfast with too much salt and burned coffee to be honest i dont really care why she trusts me enough to keep coming back maybe she even loves me as much as i love her that great love of hers didnt stop it happening again of course i dont know whether it was another hotel or maybe even his own house the difference from my point of view was that the second time she spent an evening away that week denis arranged for me to have a friendly visitor while he was bending carol over a bed somewhere plush i actually opened the door with a piece of buttered toast in my hand can you imagine anything more middle class and harmless i had a mouthful of bread and marmite as i recognized michael and i was in the middle of trying to say something when he took a step forward and shoved me onto my back i think he trod on one of my feet first but i didnt take much in as i smacked my head on the hall floor if it had been carpeted i might have been a little sharper for the next few minutes unfortunately it was block wood and one of the things that sold us the house when we first saw it it was the casual nature of it that was so insulting i think most of us have wondered how we would handle a burglar say if we confronted one i thoroughly enjoy politicians talking about reasonable force for those moments in life you can take it from me that terror makes a mockery of anything resembling reason i opened the door with some vague thought about a football match on the television a moment later i was halfstunned and blinded by the hall light directly above me i felt a hand grab my shirt collar and i found myself sliding along the wooden floor towards the kitchen i panicked and tried to get up but i wasnt wearing shoes and my socks slipped underneath me i couldnt do more than make kicking motions in a panic theres a small table and chair in the kitchen its too cramped really but carol insisted on being able to use the words breakfast room for when we sell the house on it is her business after all thats the sort of stupid thought that came into my head as michael dragged me up and dumped me on my own chair reasonable force id like to see one of them try it with michael resting his great fists on my kitchen table what do you want i said have you got whisky he said i nodded and out of habit i half rose to get it he pressed a hand on my shoulder holding me down with no trouble at all you just tell me where he said looking at the cupboards along the kitchen wall by the door there i told him he would turn and i would reach for one of the knives by the sink behind me instead of following my plan he reached out and belted me across the face giving it everything he had i think i must have blacked out for a while as i lost track of where he was and had to crane my head round looking for him he was pouring a little laphroaig into a glass and everything in the kitchen seemed brighter than usual like a film get out i mumbled at him feeling ill even as i spoke i felt the acid come back into my mouth its always been the way with me after some problem with a deteriorating valve stomach acid is powerful stuff i get a blast of it in the back of the throat when im frightened or angry and it burns and burns theres a name for the valve problem but the operation is brutal im not getting out davey you know that he said i hated him calling me that my brother and carol called me davey no one else no one else in my life had known me young enough i saw he was wearing black leather gloves to grip the whisky glass i shook my head to clear it and touched my lips gingerly trying to feel if they could honestly have swollen as far as they felt the whole side of my face belonged to someone else i could only look out of it at him i dont want to be doing this davey i want you to believe that michael said there was real regret in his eyes almost a fellow feeling i hoped to god he wasnt there to kill me doing what i said terrified the acid was pooling in my mouth by then more bitter than vinegar i wondered what would happen if i spat it into his eyes would it burn him the way it seemed to burn me giving you a little warning davey and drinking your whisky telling you to let her go he seemed almost apologetic as he said the last part let who go carol i said i wasnt thinking well with my own blood on the table in front of me it wouldnt stop dripping out of my nose and i could almost draw loops with it on the pine surface someone we both know thinks she may be afraid of leaving you davey i think you and i know thats not true youre not the type are you davey youre a sensible sort who wont make me have to do something more permanent arent you she wont leave me i said which may be one of the most idiotic things ever to come from my mouth i should have offered to drive her over to deniss house in my own car if michael would have gone the thought of his house changed the direction of my spinning thoughts what about his own wife i demanded i remember her what does she have to say about it michael shook his head as if saddened by all the worlds troubles shes left him davey it hasnt been good for a while and i think your wife was the last straw hes a free man davey and thats not good for you im sorry to say youre insane i told him you cant just tell a man to leave his wife where do you think she is at the moment davey what do you think shes doing michael demanded this isnt like the local vicars wife is it i wouldnt like to imagine what shes getting up to would you if i was you old son i would leave the bitch and say good riddance to her what do you want with a woman who takes off like that we may be doing you a little favour if you think about it in the long run you know my lack of shock seemed to surprise him and he frowned at me before refilling the glass and corking the bottle i saw his hand move but i had hardly begun to duck when the whisky splashed across my face it burned worse than the stomach acid inside and i yelped holding up both hands my eyes streamed with tears and i dont know if it was the fumes or rage at her for doing this to me for letting these people into our lives i couldnt think and when he hit me again i cried out for him to stop over and over sobbing you drank a bit too much davey and you fell down the steps outside catching your face on the ground something like that when she asks davey you know i wouldnt want you telling lies about strange men in your kitchen would i you wouldnt want to try and turn her against her new friend with a few whispers believe me if she hears i was here i will show you what i call a second visit understand itll be a lot worse davey he shook his head slowly as if imagining it dont make me come back i was shaking when he left i drank a little more of the whisky and by the time she came home the following morning i was still awake and i was drunk and i was raging i heard her cry out in shock when she saw the wreck michael had made of my face before i could say a word she was searching in the medicine cupboard for creams and plasters what happened she demanded as she sat down in front of me youve been drinking came before i could open my mouth did you fall i wondered if denis had fed her the line and i winced as my lips cracked i hesitated just long enough to wonder what would happen if michael was sent back to make the lesson stick i didnt have a plan then i just hadnt fully understood their world it was too far away from mine denis tanter i said softly watching her reaction she was in the middle of dabbing dried blood out of one of my nostrils and i watched her whole face tighten her eyes lost the warm care and tenderness she had been lavishing lost it all what do you mean she asked and suddenly i was afraid that the coldness was for me that she just didnt care any more he had his man come round while you were out last night you know to give the husband a little lesson while you were whoring with his boss he was warning me off carol making threats in our own house i heard a tremble in my voice and shut up before the drink brought me to tears she looked down at her hands and i could see they were shaking i couldnt find any sympathy for her thats what you brought into this house carol thats what you did to me last night shed gone very pale i saw as if id slapped her she still held a damp tissue tinged with red i saw her hand begin to move back to dab at my face and i did slap it away i didnt think i could bear it if she just went on like nothing had happened i wanted it all out she stood then and her tongue came out to touch the top of her upper lip she does that when shes really worked up and i welcomed it i stood as well to face her and suddenly the desire for a fight went out of me i couldnt bear the argument couldnt stand the words being said again it was just too much on top of the night id had id said them all a thousand times and won the arguments over and over and over i really didnt actually need to say them aloud to her face she knew them all just fix it carol i dont care what happens any more just sort it out she nodded her lips pressed tightly together so that all the blood and colour had gone out of them id never seen her so shaken and ridiculously i found it cheering so that i almost bounced up those stairs to bed before she had the shower running i was asleep chapter four of course seeing me sitting there with a bloody nose put carol in a difficult position the truth is a strange thing in case youve never been forced to contemplate its twists and turns it doesnt matter how bad something is if you dont admit whats going on if you dont say it aloud it can be forgotten it can be managed it can be ignored i remember the first time i heard someone joke about the elephant in the room they meant something that everyone tried to ignore but who could ignore an elephant you can take it from me that after a while you hang your clothes on the trunk like he was part of the furniture you can get used to anything and as long as you dont actually die all pain goes all pain goes think of that the next time you think you cant stand it think of me if you dont ask about bobby penrith its always an accident even if you know you just dont force the words out into the open youll appreciate that carol could hardly wake me up throw her arms around me and announce that her affair with denis tanter was at an end it was the thing we never mentioned any more after all the fact that she rested her head on my pillow was meant to be something i didnt question perhaps because i could feel a tooth wobble when i woke i just wasnt in a good mood it must have been twenty years since i last found myself wiggling a loose tooth with my tongue and it didnt improve my temper shed brought it into our kitchen the old rules were useless until denis tanter was out of our lives like it or not certain things had to be said no matter how much i hated to do it i washed myself carefully looking at the bruises in the long bathroom mirror i was not a sight to inspire confidence even though i felt angry i looked afraid worst of all was the fact that she didnt come back all through the afternoon i started thinking she had confronted denis and tempers had flared my imagination went a little peculiar for a while i rang her work because i had to ring someone and ask where she was though i hated doing it every time i could see their little sly grin on the other end i was the husband who couldnt find his wife have you ever noticed you can hear someone smile on a phone if you say the same words twice but smile the second time you can hear the difference when youre asking where your wife is you dont want to hear that change it starts the brain working fast enough to hurt carol had taken the afternoon off and there was something in the girls tone that enjoyed the fact that i didnt know i had to work to keep my voice level and steady as i put the phone back in its cradle gripping it hard enough to make my hand shake as i put it down it rang making me jump i could hear carol breathing fast and shallow i told denis tanter to leave us alone she said without even a hello hes gone what about you though i replied shoving the phone against my ear as if i could press her closer on the other end of the line i need a few days away davey work is all over me and i just need a break a chance to take a breath where will you go i asked knowing she wouldnt tell me it didnt matter what mattered was that denis bloody tanter had lost her and i was filled with a savage joy i could hear the weariness in her voice if she had been going to him she would have had that brittle excitement that marked the beginning of all her affairs to leave us alone shed said there were times when i did love her no matter what else i felt i pressed the phone so hard against the side of my head that it began to hurt i just need a few days away from here she said i waited for something more i wondered if she had packed a bag perhaps if id taken the time to look through the bathroom cabinet i might have known the phone call was coming dont go far i said gently sometimes i talked to her like you would to a nervous horse but she didnt seem to mind i wanted to say that i loved her to express the sudden warm feeling in my chest when i heard her voice for once i couldnt say the words easy as they are she never did and though i told myself it was there in every word and glance she threw me it still mattered id swallowed so much pride over the years that it washed back into my mouth and burned me perhaps i was full at last and that was why it brimmed over every time i was made to taste a little more defeat a little more shame for a moment i hoped she wouldnt come back in a second of phone silence i saw my life going on without the pain and drama eventually she would become a distant memory for someone i used to be a problem for someone else all pain goes remember even the memories you thought would kill you perhaps i would just get in my car and drive away before she came back and pretend to be a normal person for the rest of my life i might even be happy and live some sort of eerie existence where i didnt have a blood test every month in case she brought home some plague that would strip the flesh off me it would be a strange sort of life without fear and without hate and without my obsession with her i put the phone down without really listening to her say goodbye it took about ten minutes of sitting on my own to realize i needed to get out as well i didnt want to be the one who stayed and waited for her to come back i didnt want to be on my own and i certainly didnt want to be there if denis sent michael round a second time that was the thought that really got me moving she had taken the only suitcase but there was an old duffel bag in the cupboard over the immersion heater so i stuffed a few things in that adding a bar of soap and a halffull can of deodorant i didnt have the money to bother with a passport i was thinking of taking a train west perhaps to spend a few days in cornwall i found my good boots and shrugged myself into the coat moving quickly and controlling a swelling sense of panic i opened the door just as i became aware of a moving shadow behind the glass id been thinking about her and as the lock clicked i realized someone was standing there looking in theyd watched me pat pockets for keys and open the duffel over and over to shove some last item into the depths they seem to move at a different speed these people if someone tries to push his way into a house in a film the door is likely to slam in their face denis just walked in as if it was his own house though his expression showed what he thought of the place his shoulder knocked into me and then michael came in behind pressing his left hand against my chest and holding me against the wall without the slightest difficulty i might have struggled if theyd given me a little warning but it was just too quick and too casual as denis disappeared into the lounge michael shook his head almost apologetically i came to life then in a rush of fear adrenalin yanking at his fingers to break his grip the little scrap of garden and freedom was so near i couldnt bear to have the door close and be stuck inside with them michael pulled me back from the open doorway and shut it with his other arm nodding to himself as he heard the click the hall was darker with him blocking the light where is she denis demanded coming back from the kitchen i didnt reply for a moment the strangeness of having him in my house was just too much id seen him last at a new years eve party with balloons and a scotsman i remembered his face but to have him just stand there and talk like we knew each other was surreal ill call the police i said denis raised his eyebrows in something approaching surprise michael said you dont scare easy he said i cant see it myself i glanced sideways at michael but his face was blank no chat from him or demands to be given whisky in the great mans presence he was solid business a professional i still said nothing so denis gestured for me to be brought along i found myself being marched into my own kitchen once more i had a sick feeling that they were going to kill me for a moment i imagined carol coming back in a few days and im ashamed to say i took pleasure in the guilt she would feel the whisky bottle was still where i had left it and denis poured himself a glass of it taking a sip as he faced me if id planned ahead i realized i could have laced it with some poison like in an agatha christie book honestly though where would i have got hold of a decent poison hed have tasted weedkiller surely the trouble with that sort of thing is that you end up in prison for life no matter how things turned out i wasnt going to let that happen michael snapped his fingers in front of my nose pay attention and answer the question he snapped my mind had wandered again preferring vagueness to the actual reality of waiting to be murdered i dont know where shes gone i said some part of me had been listening and that was what denis had asked shes gone away i added i wanted to answer their questions i wanted the conversation to go on and on all day if they liked i didnt want to imagine what would happen when the talking stopped tell me david denis said pulling up the other chair and sitting down tell me why your wife cant bear to think of leaving you i blinked at him trying to look as if i was giving his question some serious thought only carol would find me and she might not be back for days i dont know she loves me i replied denis was not a pleasantlooking man to stare at his skin was flushed and his eyes were flat and cold his freckles stood out on the pale bony head and for an instant i could only see them like a web of dots on his face are you cruel to her david he said to me suddenly almost in a whisper i could feel him tense as he watched me he really wanted to know poor sod never understood her shes the only thing i value in the world i said leaning closer to him the truth of this was somehow clear and denis shifted uncomfortably i wondered what his own meat and veg wife had been like did he have redhaired little kids with bony faces and hard laughter carol was a force of nature compared to his sort of home i could almost sympathize with what hed been through you should walk away from this mess i told him as he stared she needs me so i stay anything else anyone else theyre just strangers i could see he was struggling with some internal argument he practically shook with irritation and he knocked back the glass of poisonfree whisky without seeming to taste it i heard the bottle clink on the glass as he refilled i didnt much like the prospect of him getting drunk in my kitchen denis turned round in his seat are you wearing gloves michael he asked i glanced up to see that michael was denis too had a pair and i had a sudden sense of dropping from a great height i dont think ive ever heard something more frightening than that casual question when denis turned back to me i had to hold my hands together on the table to stop them shaking i could make you vanish david no husband for her to come home to understand perhaps there would be room then for a man whos more than some weird little parasite you dont even work do you david you just sit here and spend the money she makes for you does that make you feel like a man david she would never trust you if i disappeared i said slowly she knows you sent michael the first time shell know it was you i liked the way this was going and began to warm to the theme shell hate you if you even bruise me mr tanter you should have that clear in your head i cant see a happy ending here unless you just leave he sat back and seemed to ponder this for a while i see what you mean mike he sits there as cool as you like with his arse out in the wind i saw michael smile behind deniss back i wasnt completely sure what the phrase meant either by the way if it meant vulnerable that was about right denis stood up and i felt a spike of sudden hope that he was going to take my advice he nodded to me you are a sick little man david youve turned a wonderful woman into a twisted fragile i dont know what she is you might be right about killing you or it might be the one thing she needs to really wash you off her skin you know what i mean just seeing you sitting there looking so smug makes me angry david i think you have a hold over her like those men who beat women and somehow they still come back i dont understand it however im not the sort to walk away from things i dont understand david i am a stubborn man he said it like it was something hed said a hundred times before like he was proud of it i could only stare blankly at him as he walked around michael and stood at the other end of the kitchen the room felt cramped with those two blocking the door ill stay to watch mike if you dont mind denis said how far do you want me to go michael asked his eyes on mine denis thought for a moment ill want to have another crack at this when she comes back so keep it all under his clothes all right teach him something break a couple of fingers but hide the rest i began to yell then though i knew the neighbours would all be at work there was no one to help me chapter five i managed to get myself to brighton general hospital to have my hand splinted i thought theyd ask me all sorts of difficult questions but they simply made me wait for six hours just to be told that the xrays showed two broken fingers the first thing id said to the nurse on reception was i have two broken fingers but i didnt mind they had given me painkillers and ive always liked the building it used to be a workhouse in victorian times and i like that sense of history anyway it was warm inside and there was a machine to get cups of orangecoloured tea after all the trouble id had getting there i made the most of it steering with one hand isnt a problem but changing gear and steering is a nightmare i think if anyone had been nice to me i might have asked for help or gone to the police perhaps the doctors were too busy to want more than a glance at someone with my kind of problems even the nurse who did the bandaging didnt ask how it had happened she was flustered and tired and she had a bright line of sweat where her hair met her forehead i found my gaze focusing on it while she worked on me it must be a strange thing to spend your day with people who have been really hurt they say policemen think everyone is a criminal i wonder if doctors think everyone is just a bag of skin and bones waiting to burst apart all over them i saw some blood on the linoleum floor while i was there though it was cleaned up so i stopped my mental letter to the local paper i think it was then that i thought of writing to my brother i was a bit woozy from the painkillers and i had a prescription for more there was a small leak of acid into my mouth but when i swallowed it back it stayed down to my relief i couldnt go home and i couldnt find my car keys i knew id driven to the hospital but the damn things had walked somewhere between the reception and the waiting room and the xray waiting room and the xray machine and the nurses station and all the other places theyd sent me i couldnt bear to get up and begin the search for them excuse me miss have you seen a set of car keys i was here just a minute ago over and over if they were lost i would walk home or call the rac and pretend to be a young woman on her own so theyd come quickly i was past caring about anything at the pharmacy on the ground floor i exchanged the prescription for a bottle of pills and bought paper stamps and envelopes from a little newsagent in the same patientfriendly grouping hospital is dull i saw a bald cancer kid and wondered how they get through the days time moves really slowly in there i couldnt send the first letter i wrote it was one of those you do to get everything clear in your head it was angry and i swore a lot if id sent that my brother might have had me committed to the mental wing back at brighton general there is a real difference between committing yourself and having someone else do it for you apart from the way you are treated the main thing is that you can walk out when you see the nurses violently restraining someone as they scream and spit blood if you are sectioned and sent there even for something as harmless as depression and a suicide watch you cant get out youre in the system and they lose all interest in how you feel or what you need i tore the letter into tiny shreds in case someone had the time to glue it back together in between emptying the bins of a hospital even though i knew it was stupid i still made sure the pieces ended up in two separate bins i kept the second try short it said i was having trouble with carol and i didnt know what to do if youd asked me then what i was hoping for i probably couldnt have told you i couldnt handle denis tanter and i couldnt see a way out thats when you ask for help you dont know what the help is going to be if you did you could probably do it on your own i put it in the hospital postbox and walked stiffly away from it without looking back it was done he would either come or he wouldnt two days later he left a message on the answering machine to say he was on the way nothing more just ten seconds of his voice while i sat and watched the machine hearing him brought back a lot of unpleasant memories i took my halfempty bottle of laphroaig to keep me warm put on my best black suit and wrote a letter to carol i left it on the kitchen table where she would see it if she came back after that i walked down to the beach and when it was dark i stood on the edge of the black sea looking out i finished the whisky and scooped up a little salt water to cut the taste of it it was as bitter as i was and it was around then that i stopped feeling the cold and walked into the water i dont know how long i stood there before he found me hed read the letter on the table i knew he would i told him all of it as we walked back along the dark streets of brighton the wind had picked up and i was shivering so he gave me his coat it smelled of cigars and his aftershave which wasnt one i knew it was a better coat than i have ever owned and i could feel its weight and softness like the first touches of guilt he hardly commented as we walked together asking just an occasional question about denis or michael my impressions of them i had to tell him more than i wanted to about carol or it would have seemed nonsense it came out in pieces and once he looked at me and shook his head in slow amazement and you want her back he said i hated him then i told him everything i could remember anything that might help him to understand the two men who had come into my life and pushed me to desperation i tried not to think that i was considering murder or at the least allowing murder in my name i wanted them out of my life and somewhere during the second beating in my kitchen i had stopped caring how it happened perhaps it was when my first finger was bent far enough to snap shame leads to rage in men did you know that if you want to see a whitehot tantrum try humiliating a man especially in public try making one afraid and then laughing about it i was too cold to take pleasure in the conversation with my brother but i could see that he did even without his coat he seemed too full of interest to feel the wind off the sea he moved his hands in sharp cutting gestures when he talked and he laughed at my description of michael making me repeat details so that he would know either of them on sight i hadnt realized how much planning would go into removing two men from the world my brother was my single extra card my one advantage that no one else knew about hed parked a mile from the house and walked no one had a clue where he was and no one would ever be able to connect him to anything that happened for a few days at least he was going to enjoy himself no guilt no conscience we sat at the kitchen table and he swore when i told him there wasnt anything left to drink in the house id thrown the empty bottle of laphroaig into the sea before he came a better splash in imagination than it actually was youve seen michael alone so theyre not joined at the hip he said thinking aloud it would be easier for me if i can catch each one by himself but if you make a mistake and get caught the other one will kill me or youd kill him little brother dont think i dont know you he said with a strange glint in his eye i remembered him kicking the limp head of the man outside the club in camden and i shuddered id try i promised him he nodded youd do it to save carol i know you would i didnt like him mentioning her i wanted to think about the problem not what would happen afterwards i didnt want her to know anything about it denis would just be found somewhere and his death put down to one of his unpleasant business partners no one would suspect me and no one would know my brother had even been in brighton i wanted it clean mind you the only way to get him somewhere we can prepare is to tell him carol wants to see him a pub car park at night say when he gets fed up waiting he comes out in the dark and i do something very violent for ten or fifteen seconds he seemed to be enjoying the prospect and i had to swallow hard to clear the burning trail that surged up under my tongue its too risky you cant predict when he comes out so there could be a family standing by his car or a group of drunks peeing in the gutter witnesses even if you managed to stop one of them the other one would shout or run wed never get away with it its madness to think you could all right davey dont get in a froth he said curtly cutting me off you might run down to the offlicence before it closes and buy me something stronger than orange squash i might get the ideas flowing then he smiled then so cold and selfassured that i wanted to throw up best to do it here anyway in this house he said looking around the kitchen well get them where we can control things hes a man who employs a thug and breaks fingers youll get away with a selfdefence plea and theyll never even know you had help are you wearing gloves i asked him suddenly he was thats more like it davey boy now youre thinking the front door clicked open and i jumped to my feet in fear my brother didnt move and when he saw who was standing there he just smiled his eyes half hooded with interest hello carol love he said did you bring anything to drink i saw her flicker a gaze to me and then back to him wondering what we had been discussing she looked rested and shed had her hair cut there was a new bag on her shoulder and she looked as beautiful as always new shoes too i noticed when my eyes dropped at last its always nice to see one of daveys family she said coolly her eyes making a complete lie of it i could feel the dislike between them and i wondered if theyd fight if i left to get whisky i realized there would be at least one witness to the fact that my brother was in brighton and my stomach churned why couldnt she have spent a few more days discovering her inner child or whatever the hell it was she got up to on these trips id better get to bed she said staging a yawn ill see you tomorrow my brother didnt look up and when shed gone i realized she hadnt even asked about my splinted hand she hadnt seen it i was half certain shed expected a welcome and instead there we were looking well looking like a couple of conspirators planning a murder my brother leaned forward and spoke in what was barely a murmur having her here is going to be a problem he said then he grinned however this isnt a bank robbery and i dont need to spend ages planning it just make sure shes well clear when we get your two friends into this kitchen one more time shell tell the police you were here i said just as quietly i couldnt meet his eyes but it had to be considered the police wouldnt be looking at a lone man defending himself against two vicious career thugs they would be looking for a lone mans brother mysteriously vanished from brighton the very day after a double murder when i did look up he was frowning turning it over and over in his mind after a while of me watching him he said why dont you go and get that bloody whisky while im thinking i went chapter six i came sharply out of sleep jerked from a dream by some noise she made as she dressed my first view was of her standing in bra and knickers pulling on her skirt shed been asleep by the time i had come up the night before or at least pretending to be she saw me move in the dressingtable mirror and we looked at each other for a long moment i saw her eyes drift down to my splinted hand large and white on the duvet a tshirt covered the other bruises i tore two fingernails off changing a tyre i said watching her wince you should see what it looks like no thanks davey i have to get going it was half an hour earlier than she usually left and i couldnt help my glance at the alarm clock she had the grace to look away as i did straightening the collar of her blouse in the mirror i guessed she wanted to be out of the house before my brother was up sometimes i can read her too easily hes only visiting for a day or two i said she nodded her mouth a tight line and pale without her lipstick with a few more brisk movements she finished her routine and left the room leaving just a faint touch of perfume on the air i liked to watch the change from sleepy tangles to smart estate agent all polished and shining my brother had come up with the lie for the broken fingers if id told her about denis coming back she might have gone to the police or worse called the man himself from her office she still might call him of course but i believed denis when he told me she had ended it or at least i believed his anger and hurt funny that i wouldnt have believed her it was a small risk though and we knew we would have to act quickly even as she closed the front door behind her i heard my brother turn the shower on it was going to be today by the time she came home from work our little problem would be handled i pulled on a dressing gown when i heard the shower squeak to a stop it was an odd moment to come out onto the landing and see him there i think the last time id seen him with a towel around his waist was when we were kids he looked a lot stronger i noticed he wasnt carrying any fat and he looked as if he kept himself very fit it is easier for men with high levels of testosterone you know they enjoy exercise more than other men right up to the heart attack that kills them i folded my arms across the front of my dressing gown and nodded to him we had planned everything but i could feel my heart pounding at an insane speed are you ready little brother no second thoughts he asked me amusement in his voice he didnt seem nervous at all no second thoughts i said we moved fast after that it was just possible that denis might hear carol had come back to work for all we knew he walked by the office every morning or paid the secretary to pass on any news of her it was probably just nerves but it didnt hurt to move things along as quickly as possible the way my brother worked things out we had one chance to get this right even with carol knowing he was in brighton it would still work he assured me hed been to court over bobby penrith and got away with it he would again i sat in the kitchen with the phone on the table in front of me just looking at it and going over what wed planned in my head it was all very well to work out the details in my imagination but when i picked up that phone and dialled it would really begin after that it would be like stepping off a cliff it just doesnt matter if you change your mind halfway through try it on me first my brother demanded it was the first sign of nervousness id seen from him i shook my head going over what wed planned to say it would bring denis running i knew it would i saw him pour a glass of the whisky id bought the night before i jerked back as his hand moved but most of it still caught me in the face i cried out in anger remembering michael doing just the same what the hell are you doing i said holding one eye closed against the sting now youre ready to make the call he said laughing at my expression you were just a little too relaxed before go on do it i glanced at the scrap of paper beside the phone with the number of denis tanter on it one call to directory enquiries had given me the last thing i needed i punched in the numbers and took a deep breath wt limited it was a womans voice not one i knew a secretary maybe i kept calm this was the number id been given get denis tanter on the line i said slurring slightly the whisky fumes helped a little strangely enough who is this she asked i felt acid flood into my mouth and i grimaced at the taste of it just you go and get him tell him to come and clear up his messes all right tell him i heard the changeover going on and i was ready for it when the new voice came who is this michael that was all id wanted you bastard i sneered at him shes dead and its because of denis bloody tanter isnt it you go to hell you i trailed off snuffling drunkenly as if i were weeping or pressing a hand against my face give the man a chance to respond davey whos dead not carol davey is that you perfect i could hear the fear in his voice it was just the beginning of what he had coming pills i spat the word at the phone leaving a trail of whisky and spittle on it you pushed and you pushed didnt you michael you and denis you pushed us and now carols dead i swear im my brother took the phone from me and pressed the button that ended the call his face was a study in quiet awe that was just right davey boy that should bring them running he said i nodded at him wiping roughly at my mouth wed better get ready he muttered dropping the phone back into its cradle with a clatter hed brought a bag in from the car and i watched as he removed an eighteeninch length of iron bar that i couldnt help but pick up it fitted the hand very well indeed i took a swing with it and imagined it cracking into a skull to my surprise the bag went on to reveal a number of other pieces of pipe and various other tools for afterwards he said it explains why you had a weapon to hand in a kitchen doesnt it with a grim smile he opened the cupboard under the sink and showed me how hed unscrewed the plastic tubing theyll probably never ask but i thought what the hell if they do all theyll find is a little plumbing job i was in the middle of it when i had to go out and look for a place that sells another piece the same as the one i cracked so artfully while im away you have a visit from two men who have threatened you before i looked at him and i swear he was calmer than i was in just a few minutes denis tanter was going to come charging into my house for the third time i pulled a carton of milk out of the fridge and drank from it to quiet my stomach my brother reached into his jacket and showed me a viciouslooking knife they come armed with this its sold in any hardware shop in the country not surprisingly you panic and swing at them with a bit of pipe you call the police and before they arrive i come back we handle their questions together you think it will work i asked him he shrugged i dont think it will even go to court two against one selfdefence will see you clear of it davey no problem at all you just trust me and well see it through all right i looked him in the eyes and for a moment i could feel tears come i nodded turning away knowing he had seen now concentrate davey they should be here any minute you have the easy bit you just sit down in the kitchen like we planned it have a drink if you have to just look miserable as i sat down my brother went to the front door and left it on the latch remind me to break the lock in afterwards he said as he came back to the kitchen and stood behind the door he hefted the metal bar in his hand and i couldnt look at him outside we heard a car engine roaring closer being driven too fast it screeched to a halt i took a deep breath chapter seven denis tanter came into my home at in the morning i looked up at the wall clock so i know he hit the front door so hard that i think he would have smashed the lock right off if wed locked it it hammered back against the wall and then bounced off his shoulder as he bulled his way in id read him right i was pleased to see id told my brother he wasnt the type to send michael in first not if his blood was up it didnt seem to worry my brother but i wanted denis in first he was the dangerous one not his man id known that from the beginning he hadnt the faintest idea what was going on i could see that from the moment he caught sight of me in the kitchen i was looking pathetic with tear trails down my face and an expression of stunned fear it wasnt hard to fake when you know someone is going to die in the next few minutes and it could very well be you where is she he roared at me he was flushed with high emotion and for an awful moment i thought he was going to go charging upstairs to search the bedrooms for her i shook my head and gestured vaguely across the kitchen he scowled at me and i saw his fists rise as he stepped inside the door michael was a shadow in the hall behind him but i could only watch denis as my brother struck god he was fast youve never seen anything like it it wasnt a crunch it sounded like a bag of flour bursting a sort of soft thump staring straight at denis i swear i saw the end of the bar sink into his head before it came back the anger the light everything that called itself denis tanter went out in an instant my brother hit him again as he began to fall and then once more i couldnt help remembering the way hed kicked and kicked at the man in camden and i knew there was at least one other body in his wake there are moments in our lives when the lies we tell ourselves just fall away this was one of them for me my brother ignored michael as the man stood stunned in the doorway his mouth open in horror instead my older brother looked at me and grinned he didnt seem to care that michael was there i watched in sick fascination as my brother nudged denis with his foot the body twitched and i thought i might lose my breakfast dead or a vegetable no doubt about it he said and i swear he chuckled id rarely seen him happier perhaps you can see now why ive always been frightened of him it wasnt so much what he did but what he was capable of michael began to move and i was pleased i couldnt see my brothers expression when he turned back to finish the job there are sharks in the world and like bobby penrith before him michael just wasnt prepared to meet a bigger one in my kitchen on that day i saw him reach into his jacket for some sort of weapon my brother didnt trouble to stop him he just smacked the bar against the side of michaels head breaking something inside michael dropped almost as fast as denis had as the signals from his brain to his legs were interrupted i came to my feet in a sort of trance feeling only pity for michael he was a hired man after all but id sat and watched him twist my fingers right round and i didnt call out to save him even if i could have the man denis had hired to cause a little fear in those he dealt with had always struck me as large not fast but strong it was surprising to see how my brother loomed over him as he hit him again fear shrinks you somehow and courage swells you up larger than you really are ive noticed that before id found my own bit of pipe in the plumbers bag my brother had brought with him i dont think he heard me coming but even if he did he didnt expect me to smash it down on him with all the strength of years of fear and hatred id seen him break a skull just a few moments before and im pleased to say that i did it just as neatly as he did i killed my brother as he hit michael for a second time so that the two blows sounded almost together he fell sideways sprawling over the broken bodies he didnt move and i almost left it at that but hed seemed to think two hits were needed to be sure i held my breath and brought the pipe down again onto his crown with all the force i could it was already soft and i felt it give his eyes were open and i dont think he could still feel anything the first one had been pretty hard there was some blood dripping but it wasnt too bad most of it was on them and spattered across the kitchen it looked just as hed said it would like a violent scene of a fight i stood looking at them for a while i cant say how long my stomach betrayed me of course so i wasted a few minutes vomiting into the sink and wondering if i should get rid of it or leave it as a reasonable reaction to such horror i left it in the end the police would come asking eventually and i knew they could be persistent my brother was right about one thing though the selfdefence works even better with him dead i had an idea that i might even end up as a hero when my stomach had stopped going into spasm i sat down at the kitchen table and poured a last toast to the three of them i raised my glass to my brother heres to growing up old son you should never have slept with her i told him that was just a little too much for me still its all forgotten now i found myself chuckling and it was an effort to stop i wondered if he even knew id found out that carol had thrown it at me in one of our fights he wasnt the sort to feel guilt ive no doubt that it was just a thrill for him to find a beautiful woman willing to waste an afternoon no matter who she was married to it was strange to see the way they acted around each other after i knew whatever memory theyd made had gone a bit sour i could see that perhaps shed refused a second round or hed refused her it didnt matter to me much not any more it was strange to see the bodies in my own kitchen id seen it in my imagination enough times but to have actually reached the point was like time standing still and more than a little bit frightening reality is like that ive found id worked out most of the details while i was standing in the freezing sea waiting for my brother to read the note id left for carol and come and get me i remember worrying that he might have had an accident or a flat tyre and all my effort would have been wasted i knew seeing me there would get him on my side i was always his blind spot his little brother i dont think he cared about another living soul im not ashamed to say there were tears in my eyes for a while looking at him brothers are close id hardly needed to persuade him after he found me standing in a foot of dark water trying hard to imagine what it must be like to commit suicide really it couldnt have gone better it really couldnt my debts were all paid and i sort of hoped bobby penrith knew they had been the police would accept my story if i left enough shocked blanks in it it was simple enough after all id let him guide me where i wanted to go just two brothers fixing a pipe in a kitchen and being attacked by a violent pair of criminals i wondered if i should explain about carol to the police no i didnt want them knowing i had any kind of motive i thought they would believe denis was obsessed with her without knowing hed tried her out a few times as well it worked very nicely i walked outside the front door pulling it shut behind me the neighbours were at work as always so there wouldnt be any witnesses the police could interrogate it took a couple of thumps with my shoulder to break the lock no doubt it would be another bruise to show the police when i told them how denis tanter had tortured me perfect i remembered to put my pipe in michaels hand while i was scattering the contents of the plumbers bag over the kitchen floor i found a knife in his other pocket the one hed been reaching for when my brother knocked him down after a bit of thought i let him hold it in his other hand taking care with my own prints there were a lot of things to remember there would be blood spatter on my clothes but i thought that would be fine i could see it would be suspicious if there wasnt in such a small space with three men beaten to death i was pleased with how clearly i was thinking when i sat down at last i had the phone in my hand to call them id done everything i could and i thought yes davey you will get away with this i said the words aloud even while they all just lay there and bled that was one surprise no matter what youve heard the sheer volume of blood is a shock it just doesnt seem possible to have that much in you its not true that dead men dont bleed either these ones did for a while at least the kitchen was covered in the stuff and i still cant believe just how sticky it is when it gets on you different shades of red as well i had thought i could handle denis tanter just as ive dealt with a few other men over the years when i realized i couldnt i thought i would let my brother handle him it was just an idle thought at first of how nice it would be if both of the bastards killed each other i hadnt really thought about afterwards though if there had ever been a place to think about afterwards it was that kitchen with its pool of blood and a smell i never want to get near again its not often you have an opportunity like that you see yes i could beat the court case if it even went to court the crown prosecution service has to decide theres a case they can win and my plea of selfdefence against those boys was going to be a beauty i could walk away but then there was carol did i really want to walk away with her i couldnt help but think that if she had been in the middle of this mess when denis and michael arrived perhaps she too would be lying there and i would be free really free as opposed to the shadow of it id been enjoying for a few brief moments it was clearly a day for new beginnings instead of the police i rang her and told her i was going to take all her sleeping pills in one go i put the phone down in the middle of a sentence then removed its battery i wasnt worried id work out the details before she got home
