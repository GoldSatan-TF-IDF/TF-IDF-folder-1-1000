marion lennox a millionaire for molly a book in the australians series chapter one of all the times for lionel to escape the reception area at bayside property was crowded and it was very very noisy mollys cleaning team had declared an owners wolfhounds were dangerous and they wouldnt go near her properties sophia one of mollys most valued landladies was noisily furious that anyone could criticise her dogs jackson baird was closeted with mollys boss and now lionels gone molly said in a voice that caused an instant hush she was staring at her empty box in horror angela did you and angela had i just showed guy mollys fellow realtor stared down at the empty box and her face reflected mollys dismay i swear thats all i did guy dropped in for coffee and he didnt believe you had a frog in your desk but you put the top back on right angela caught her breath thinking it through and becoming more appalled by the minute i was just showing him when jackson baird walked in well it was jackson baird enough said jackson baird the guy just had to enter the room and half the women present would forget their own names what was it about the man oh sure he was goodlooking he was tall superbly fit and deeply tanned and his face youd expect arrogance with jacksons stature and reputation but the mans face was almost labradorpuppyish it was a takemehomeandloveme sort of face with laughing grey eyes and a wonderful white smile takemehomeandloveme molly read the society pages enough to know that women did just that with inherited millions from australias copper mines and a fierce business acumen of his own the man had a reputation almost as vast as the number of zeros in his bank account so this morning hed arrived and the whole office had stopped dead molly had just returned from inspecting sophias property and even that voluble lady had been silenced as jackson and his lawyer were ushered through thats jackson baird sophia had breathed as the entourage swept past into trevors inner sanctum ive never seen him in the flesh is he a client of yours the elderly landlady had clearly been immensely impressed if he was a client itd do the place an enormous amount of good molly had thought and wondered which of their properties jackson could possibly be interested in they had some lovely bayside properties for sale but surely none palatial enough to suit a man of his wealth jackson made me forget your frog angela admitted well you have to admit hes gorgeous sure hes gorgeous molly acknowledged and then more frantically but wheres my frog he must be here somewhere angela dropped to her knees her fair curls merging with mollys dark ones as they met under the desk they were both in their late twenties and they were both extremely attractive but there the resemblance ended angela treated the world as if it was there to give her a good time whereas molly knew it would do no such thing i mean where can he have gone plenty of places trevor farrs real estate agency was a small firm and its owner mollys cousin was a muddler the place was crammed with files almost to the ceiling somewhere among them was one green frog sam will kill me molly wailed well find him i should never have brought him to work you hardly had a choice angela retorted no she hadnt had a choice molly and sam travelled on the same trainher eightyearold nephew to cove park elementary and molly to bayside property their journey had almost been complete this morning before shed realised why sams school bag was bulging and shed been horrified you cant take lionel to school i can sams bespectacled face creased into defiance he misses me at home but the other kids molly sighed she knew only too well the social structure of the school hadnt she been in to see the headmaster only last week sams being bullied shed told him and the man had spread his hands we do our best he told her most kids in sams position would keep their heads down and stay out of trouble but even though sams about half the size of most thirdgraders he matches it with the best of them im afraid some of the children retaliate rather brutally but of course youre right the kid has pluck and well see what we can do which wasnt much as molly had thought when sam had come home with yet another set of bruises he laid himself open to pain and if he took his frog to school there were kids there whod delight in taking his pet from him who knew what would happen after that its too late to take him home now sam told her his chin jutting forward in the samagainsttheworld look she knew only too well it had been too late so shed brought sams frog to work mollys job was very new her cousin had been reluctant to take her on in the first place shed had an appointment with sophia at ten and was in no position to arrive late so shed arrived with lionels cardboard box under her arm and this was the result samll never forgive me both girls were scrambling under the desk oblivious to those above excuse me sophias tones from above the desk declared she was clearly not amused do i understand youre looking for a frog its sams frog mollys voice was almost a sob she pushed her dark curls out of her face and started hauling the filing case from the wall help us i refuse to wait because of a frog and as for helping angela reacted then molly was hauling furniture as if her life depended on it but angela rose and put her hands on her hips in the weeks molly had worked for the agency she and angela had become fast friends and angela would defend her friend to the death do you know who sam is she demanded of course i dont girl why should i do you remember that awful accident about six months back angela demanded a truck came off the overpass and there were people in the car below the adults were killed outright but there was a little boy trapped for hours the womans jaw dropped in horrified memory was that sam yes and hes mollys nephew oh no and now weve lost his frog there was deathly silence the three cleaners and sophia all let the enormity of this sink in and then cleaners landlady molly and angelaeverybody started searching unaware of the drama being played out in his outer office trevor farr was growing more flustered by the minute at first hed been delighted he hadnt been able to believe his luck hannah copeland had telephoned this morning and her call had stunned him ive heard jackson baird is thinking of buying a property on the coast there arent many people id consider selling birraginbil to but jackson may be one of them my father used to deal with your grandfather i believeso you may contact mr baird on my behalf and if hes interested then ill sell that is if you want the commission if he wanted the commission birraginbil such a sale would set him up for life trevor had thought dazed and hed made a phone call to jacksons lawyer at once he still hardly believed it but now here was jackson baird in person dressed for business in an italian suit that screamed expensive his eagle eyes cool and calculating and waiting with polite patience for details the only trouble was trevor didnt yet have details so he did the best he could with what he had and tried to buy time the property is on the coast two hundred miles south of sydney he told jackson and his lawyer its friday today im otherwise engaged at the weekend but would it be convenient if we drove down together on monday i would have thought youd at least have photographs jacksons lawyer seemed deeply displeased like trevor roger francis had been caught on the hop and the lawyer had reason to be unhappy hed had a property in the blue mountains lined up for jacksons inspection one where hed pocket the sizeable commission himself and a bit more on the side unfortunately his secretary had taken the call about the copeland place when he was out and the girl had taken it on herself to ring jackson stupid woman now the lawyer was in a foul temper and trevors delaying tactics didnt help phone us when you have the details the lawyer snapped if id known you had so little information we would never have come this far youre wasting mr bairds valuable time and then he paused he stared down at the plush carpet in time to see a small green object it jumped it was a small green tree frognature personifiedand the lawyer knew exactly what to do with nature trying to edge its way into civilisation he lifted his foot do you think he could have jumped into trevors office when they opened the door molly was staring in despair at the frogless back of the filing cabinet where else could he be i suppose he might have angela said doubtfully sitting back on her heels i meaneveryone was staring at jackson of course idiots ill look molly rose trevor will kill you if you interrupt molly he has jackson baird in his office i dont care if he has the queen of sheba in there im going to look molly put her nose against the glass pane in trevors door and what she saw made her move faster than shed ever moved in her life and jackson one minute he was sitting between an irate lawyer and a confused realtor trying to get some sense out of the pair of them the next there was a flash of green against the beige carpet his lawyers polished brogue raised to strikeand a mopheaded miniskirted young woman launched herself through the door and down at the carpet in what he could only describe as a rugby tackle his lawyers foot fell but there was no longer a frog underneathinstead there was a pair of hands grasping and cradling and protecting one small green frog as rogers foot stamped down ow molly what the did you get him he stomped on him he stomped on sams frog oh you brute sophia cincotta breathing fire was first into the room after molly and she took one look at what was happening and raised her handbag she swiped at roger francis murderer angela came next gazing down in horror molly was lying fulllength on the carpet clutching lionel as if her life depended on it mollyyour hand your hands bleeding hes broken her fingers sophias handbag swiped again and the lawyer retreated fast to the other side of trevors desk is lionel okay angela demanded hes squashed sophia retorted bearing down on the hapless lawyer of course hes not okay didnt you see this brute step on him i thought those things were protected one of the cleaners volunteered itll be a toad stupid someone else retorted youre supposed to kill them not on my carpet trevors voice rose in bewilderment is this a frog a frog molly is this your doing of course its my doing molly managed peering between her bleeding fingers and its not a cane toad oh heck his leg looks his leg looks broken your fingers look broken angela retorted kneeling beside her and casting a murderous glance up at roger francis its him whos the toad of all the unprofessional roger was practically spluttering as he backed away from the handbagwielding sophia mr baird i suggest we look for a property elsewhere trevor collected himself at that and moved between molly and jackson he could see thousands of dollars worth of commission going up in smoke here mr baird i cant tell you how sorry i am this is normally the most efficient of offices he glared down at molly my father persuaded me to employ my cousin because he felt sorry for her but if shes going to offend major clients he tried for bluster a weak man attempting importance molly get up you can collect your severance pay and leave but molly wasnt listening she was still staring between her fingers lionels leg was indeed hanging at an odd angle it must be broken she thought of the impossibility of mending broken legs on frogs what on earth was she going to tell sam molly get out this time trevors desperation broke through you mean my frogs going to die and now ive been given the sack she managed her voice a distressed whisper oh great how would they manage now if youre going to upset mr baird she deserves to be sacked the lawyer hissed from the other side of the desk and sophias handbag was raised again just a moment jackson baird rose and raised one hand his voice was a soft and lazy drawl but it had the capacity to halt everyone in their tracks it was a voice of one born to command he rose from where hed been sitting and knelt by molly gently moving angela out of the way immaculately dressed in his superbly fitted business suit his nightblack hair just casual enough for effect his presence took over the room what is hea tree frog he asked molly gently and molly wiped angry tears away with the back of her free hand she sniffed and nodded yes and mr francis heremy lawyerhas injured it i dont like insects roger muttered hes not an insect molly started but jackson was still in control once again his voice cut through it does seem hard that miss farr should injure her hand see her pet hurt and lose her job all on the one day carefully he opened mollys hand and took the frog into his own then he stood solidly big immaculately groomedwith a tiny green tree frog cradled in his palm a swipe of black hair flicked over his eyes and he brushed it back the man needed a haircutor maybe he didnt there werent many women whod complain about how jackson baird looked and he looked amazing now the tiny green frog gazing upward with froglike incomprehension accentuated the sheer size and raw strength of the man and yet he was all gentleness as his fingers carefully examined the tiny creature trevor stared down at the frog in disgust his expression squeamish wildlife had never been his strong point of all the ridiculous give it to me mr baird and ill find a brick but jackson was concentrating entirely on the frog you know it looks a simple break and there doesnt appear to be any more damage i think we can fix this molly took a deep breath and then another she sat up pulled her skirt down over her tights until she was almost respectable and gazed up at jackson in disbelief youre kidding he looked down at her and then looked again she really was extraordinary jackson thought taking her in for the first time she had pale almost translucent skin a mop of glossy dark curls that clung around her face huge brown eyes frog concentrate on the frog baird he reminded himself really he told her we cant put it in a cast thatd be something ever the clown angela interrupted from behind now that lionel looked as if he might live mollys fellow realtor was appreciating the humour of the situation we could make him crutches like tiny tim carries in the muppet christmas carol shut up angela molly glowered as she struggled to her feet and she hardly noticed as jacksons free hand came out to steady her this was serious you were saying mr baird im sure he can be fixed two heads were now bent over one tiny green tree frog and had no thoughts of anything else we need to splint it jackson told her crutches angela chortled i wont be content with anything less then her laughter died molly youre dripping blood on the carpet its nothing molly shoved her fist into her skirt but jacksons hand came out and grasped hers he held it up the skin had split over the knuckles and it was sluggishly bleeding his face darkened damn you roger i was stamping on the frog i didnt expect the stupid girl to it needs attention it does not molly snatched her hand away and shoved it behind her back before he could see it further its only grazed if lionel can really be fixed lionel my frog she told him and he nodded with all the gravity in the world of course lionel i see and yes he can really be fixed molly looked up at jackson as if he might be trying to trick her how do you know there was a dam on our property when i was a kid he told her taking in the look of strain around her eyes and puzzling a little over it i spent my holidays raising tadpoles and escaping his parents anything you need to know about frogs ask me it can heal it can heal she took a deep breath and some of the tension eased then ill take him to the vet i can splint it here if youll let me but i cant fix your hand ill take her to the hospital to fix that angela said putting in her two bobs worth again and moving to hug her friend if you fix the frog then ill fix molly angela trevors voice was an angry whisper but angela directed him one of her very nicest smiles mr baird likes mollys frog she said demurely and wed hate to upset mr baird now wouldnt we at the look on her cousins face molly almost choked oh for heavens sake she took a deep breath and moved out of the protective circle of angelas arm thank you all very much but ill take my frog to the vet and my hand just needs a sticking plaster thats all so i can take care of everything myself and it doesnt matter if i leave she looked at her cousin and sighed the man really was an idiot maybe it would be better if she walked away after all im sacked anyway you cant be sacked jackson growled and once again there was the stillness that his voice seemed to engender he turned to trevor his finger lazily stroking lionels green back as he spoke his eyes fixed mollys cousin impaling him like an insect on a pin i came here to find out about a property the information i have is tantalising but its scarcely detailed i need more and i need to see it you say youre busy over the weekend trevor was totally flummoxed yes but ive an option on another property until monday so id like to come to a decision before then and i leave the country on tuesday seeing the place for the first time on monday hardly leaves time for negotiation trevor thought this through and backtracked fast negotiationa wonderful word it meant the man was a serious buyer of course ill just have to reschedule i dont believe ill bother you jackson told him his voice cool and direct i dont need you to show me the place one of your employees will do just as well you still have time for another tour of the blue mountain property his lawyer interrupted and was shot a look of dislike for his pains thanks but im more interested in the copeland place now seeing as miss farr has just suffered an injury and a shock what better way to help her recover than to take her away for the weekend mr farr i assume you werent serious about sacking an employee for something so minor as bringing a frog to work no trevor thought it through and for trevor thinking was a chore yes but but jackson was no longer listening miss farr i would very much appreciate it if you could escort me to the property mr farr if your employee was to make such a sale i feel sure youd be in a position to offer her her job back trevor gasped but he wasnt completely stupid once again he could see a fortune in commission flying out of the window and he grabbed at it with both hands maybe not but ive just remembered i can come after all i dont wish to bother you jacksons eyes were chilling he turned to his lawyer or mr francis for that matter if the copeland place is the farm im thinking of then frogs are the least of the temptations for mr franciss ruthless shoe so i believe miss farr and i will dispense with the middle men miss farr can you escort me to the copeland property at the weekend molly took a deep breath she stared wildly aroundat trevorat the lawyerand then at the tiny green frog sitting pathetically in jackson bairds big hand jacksons eyes were gentlekind evenand she had no choice obnoxious cousin or not she needed this job and jackson was offering her a way to keep it itll be my pleasure she told him and she couldnt believe that shed done it there was no disputing who was in charge ineffectual at the best of times trevor was completely overruled jackson was in organisational mode and he hadnt been declared australias businessman of the year for nothing the man exuded power ill meet you at mascot airport tomorrow at nine he told her and she blinked umwere flying ill charter a helicopter oh of course youll have a section thirtytwo prepared a section thirtytwo it would be a miracle if their lawyer could finalise the title and bill of sale by tonight molly thought but jackson baird was expecting expertise to match his of course she told him the house is set up so we can stay i believe theres a skeleton staff trevor was fighting to stay in charge of a situation he had no control over mrs copeland did say theyd welcome you but i jackson wasnt in the mood for buts then thats fine im not happy about molly going trevor blurted out and jackson raised a mobile eyebrow isnt she competent shes extremely competent angela shot at him and received a look of approval from the millionaire for her pains maybe youre worried about the propriety of the situation jacksons smile eased all before him i should have thought of that miss farr if youre concerned about the propriety of escorting me to an unknown farm for the weekend i suggest you bring a chaperon but no middle men no cousin an aunt perhaps especially if shes another froglover he was laughing at her molly thought but she was too stunned to react a chaperon where on earth would she find one of those overnight but jackson had moved on thats all then mascot airport nine tomorrow with or without a chaperon his eyes glinted suddenly with wicked laughter is that enough to take your mind off your sore hand and your frog he thought it was molly thought numbly he thought he just had to say jump and shed put everything else aside and purr with pleasurable anticipation and maybe normally she would but there was still lionel sam had trusted her with his frog how was she going to tell him what had happened fine she said tonelessly and his brows furrowed youre still worried about your frog of course you know frogs do die damn the man he was still laughing you said you can fix him i did and i can he turned to angela will you take your friend to have her hand attended to now but molly wasnt moving after lionel is fixed you know his eyes were still puzzled i hate to seem callous but he is just a frog just fix him she said wearily her hand was starting to throb and the shock of the last halfhour had taken its toll sure lionel was just a frog but to sam he was everything lionel had produced the first flicker of an outside interest shed seen in the child since his parents death and that was so important just fix him she said again and jacksons dark eyes probed hers with something akin to confusion what he saw in her face didnt help at all but he had a job to do okay miss farr ill concede that your frog is important he put out a hand and touched her cheek a fleeting gesture of reassurance nothing more but so are you if you wont go and get your hand seen to straight away then ill do it for you and then ill fix your frog my frog first your hand first he said in a voice that brooked no argument lionels not dripping blood on the carpet so sit and be cared for now it was the strangest sensation sit and be cared for how long had it been since shed done just that since her sisters accident the caring had all been on her side and the sensation of cares being lifted from her shoulders was almost overwhelming its not deep ignoring her protests he was probing the abrasion on her knuckles approving what he saw im sure it doesnt need stitches hed sent angela down to the nearby dispensary and shed come back with his requirementslint antiseptic bandages and a soft reedthen stayed on to watch as did the rest of their audience the cleaners had departed as had sophia cincotta but trevor and jacksons lawyer were going nowhere both of them for different reasons were bristling with disapproval but molly was oblivious she sat while this big man with the gentle eyes and the even gentler fingers knelt before her and probed and cleaned and carefully dressed her hand it was unnerving to say the least it was heck she didnt know what it was this man had a reputation a mile long where women were concerned and she was starting to see how hed acquired it he just had to touch her and there okay he looked up at her and smiled and she felt her heart do a crazy shift beneath her ribcage oh for heavens sake yes thank you now now your frog he was still smiling at her and it was a killer smile angela handed over lionels box where hed been placed for safekeeping she looked at her friend strangely as she did so it wasnt like molly to be this flustered interesting but molly was still oblivious to anyone but jackson he had her mesmerised he placed lionel into her good hand and proceeded to do exactly what hed promised whittling a tiny splint adjusting the leg so it was straight against the reed and then tying it carefully in place its as if he knows youre helping him molly said awed and jackson cast her another curious glance yes how long does he need to wear it maybe a couple of weeks youll see the leg heal over i cant thank you enough my lawyer did the damage he lifted lionels box and seemed to approve of what he saw sam had lined the box with plastic and soggy plant litter for the frogs bed this is a great little recuperation unit he lowered lionel in and closed the box all done fantastic and now you youve had a shock would you like mr francis and i to drop you home but enough was enough the man was starting to seriously unnerve her and she had a business relationship to maintain thank you but ill be fine shed like you to take her angela volunteered but got a glower from molly molly took a deep breath and took hold of the situation somehow ill see you at nine tomorrow she told him he paused and looked down at her still with that trace of confusion in his eyes with a chaperon there was only one answer to that certainly with a chaperon he smiled at that and once again his hand came out and touched her cheek very wise okay miss farr ill see you tomorrow at nine take care of your hand and your frog and with that he was gone leaving everyone in the office staring after him molly can i come please can i come youll need help and i can help you i wont even cramp your style jackson was no sooner out of the door than angelas clutch on her arm intensified id make a great chaperon thanks but ill find my own chaperon molly managed a smile albeit a weak one i need to go with you trevor told her this is my real estate firm it might be but it didnt seem like it the family firm had been handed down to this the third trevor farr and under his expert guidance it showed every sign of heading for bankruptcy trevors father had spoken to molly at her sisters funeral and persuaded her to give the place a try if you need a job in the city then id be grateful if you could join the family firm work under trevor for a while as you get used to the city you can learn the city trade from himand he can certainly learn things from you youre the best until then shed worked selling farms from her base on the south coast selling city property was a very different thing shed discovered and her cousin was proving to be a millstone around her neck weak and ineffectual hed resented her competence from the start i can cope on my own she told him now she gave him a sympathetic smile i have a strong feeling that mr baird doesnt want you or mr francis involved and if his preferences mean a sale how much did you say mrs copeland has on the place trevor swallowed three million molly practically gaped three million whew dont mess it up i wont do you have someone respectable to take as a chaperon trevor might be a dope but he wasnt completely heartless or he knew hed have his father to answer to if anything went wrong the mans got a reputation a mile long angelas not suitable angelas definitely not suitable she agreed managing a twinkle at her friend you have someone in mind i do trevor paused baffled at her lack of communication i suppose its all right then i suppose it is your hands not too sore to keep working youd better get moving if you want a section thirtytwo prepared ill do it now she flexed her fingers and winced but trevor was the only other person here capable of sorting the paperwork for such a property and help from trevor was the last thing shed get right she said lets get on with selling mr baird a farm chapter two thank heaven lionel wasnt dead sam was stoic as molly had known he would be hed been stoic for six months now hed taken every bit of dreadful news on the chin now his face was pinched but blank and when molly tried to hug him he held back as always i shouldnt have kept him in the first place he said miserably no but then there was a no pets rule in their highrise apartment so sam had had nothing theyd found the frog while theyd been crossing a busy sydney street it had been raining there had been traffic everywhere and lionel had been sitting right in the middle of the road he was a suicidal frog if ever there was one and when sam had pocketed him molly hadnt protested where hed been the frog would have been doomed may he not be doomed now she thought looking at the intricate arrangement of ponds sam had rigged up on the bathroom floor ill have to clean all this up when he dies the little boy put his hands in his pockets and tucked his chin into his chest molly knew there were tears waiting to get out theyd wait a while molly cried sam didnt he wont die mr baird said so i guess frogs dont live very long anyway darn it was so unfair if molly had her way frogs would live for ever but she had to be truthful i guess they dont she agreed and laid a hand tentatively on his arm but as always he pulled away he was such an isolated child it was as if losing his parents had made him afraid to trust and why should he trust molly thought bitterly she couldnt even keep a frog safe weve been asked to go to a farm for the weekend she said trying to divert him well take lionel it can be a convalescent farm a farm yes i dont like farms have you ever been to one no then i dont like them i want to stay here sure and lie on his bed and stare at the ceiling as he did in every spare minute sam mr baird has invited both of us he doesnt want me im very sure he does i dont want to go youre going molly said with more determination than she felt were both going and well enjoy it very much a weekend with jackson baird could she enjoy it there was a dangerous part of her mind that was telling her she could enjoy it very much indeed cara jackson how nice cara might be on the other side of the atlantic but her pleasure was tangible to what do i owe the pleasure i think i might have found a property that could suit both our needs really really its been used as a horse stud in the past its in a magnificent location and it sounds wonderful do you want to get on a plane and come and see it silence then darling im so busy when was she not jackson grinned you mean youll leave it to me thats the one and if i buy it and you dont like it then youll just have to buy me another one oh right cara darling i really cant come theres something well theres something happening thats taking all my attention and i darent say anything about it yet in case it evaporates in the mist but i trust you he grinned again another scheme his halfsister always had schemes but he trusted her implicitly as he knew she trusted him millions wouldnt he told her but youre one in a million and dont you know it yeah and i love you too a chuckle and the line went dead leaving jackson staring down at the receiver was this really a good idea okay i give up youre not going to ask me are you sorry her friend stood on the doorstep late that night and molly blinked angela was wearing a slinky shimmery dress her beads reached her waist and her hair was done up in some kind of fantastic arrangement of peacock feathers now she spun around for inspection im off to a roaring twenties party guy is turning thirty poor lamb so were having a last gasp at celebrating the twenties for him do you like my outfit i love it you know you could come and you know i cant it was impossible molly thought social life was impossible until sarah died molly had been running her estate agency on the coast shed been one of the most successful realtors in the business going from strength to strength her love life too had been exceedingly satisfactory michael was the local solicitor and everyone had said they made the perfect couple their combined life plans hadnt included sam though put him in a boarding school michael had decreed when sarah died but molly hadnt nor had she torn sam away from his home in inner sydney though she was now starting to question the wisdom of moving here the city property market was hard to break into her cousin was a toad sams school was less than satisfactory and she couldnt afford to change him to a better one sam was miserable and she was so darned lonely herself but leaving sam with babysitters wouldnt solve anything he woke with nightmares and she had to be there after all she was all he had hey cheer up angela told her watching her face youre about to spend the weekend with australias most eligible bachelor she was but the crazy thing was that she didnt want to go like sam molly still felt like closing all doors since sarahs death the world had become a dangerous place the newspapers hurled bad news at her television shows seemed dark and threateningand if it was like this for her how much more so for a small boy whod lost everything is the frog okay angela asked he seems great thanks to jackson if it wasnt for jackson lionel wouldnt be injured but angela was determined to state his case it was jacksons lawyer who did the damage jackson himself was kind the mans dangerous he has a reputation to put casanova to shame lucky you angela sighed theatrically my guy is boring boring is safe now that angela tottered into mollys living room on ridiculously high heels and fell onto a settee is why im here to stop you being boring to get back to my original question youre not going to ask me are you to do what to be your chaperon no you intend to take sam right right angela took a deep breath well ive decided to forgive you for not taking me though why i should i dont know because with me there you wouldnt get a lookin id sweep the man off his feet in two seconds flat but you have guy your fiancé remember angela grinned thats right i have guy and as nobility is my middle name oh please dont interrupt me when im being noble ive decided to offer my services as babysitter for sam and for lionel there she beamed how nobles that very noble molly winced her hand hurt she was dead tired and she had mountains of paperwork to plough through before bedtime and what her friend was suggesting was impossible angela thanks for the offer but you know i cant leave sam hell be fine with me hell be stoic hes always stoic and it breaks my heart angelas face softened so share the care i love the kid too you know i know you do angelas heart was huge but angie theres only a chink of room for loving anyone left in him and that chinks for me and thats only because i look like his mother and where does that leave you right here with him where i want to be so what are you doing now im going to bed it was a lie she needed to ring hannah copeland for the property details read everything she could find on the place and sort out the section thirtytwo but if she told angela that shed drop everything and help its only nine oclock im injured not very injured come to our party and leave sam i dont have any choice in this angie so let it be angela glared at her friend its so unfair lifes not fair it should be you sure you wont change your mind about going alone leave sam with me for just this once im sure then ill be here on sunday night and i want a blowbyblow description leaving out nothing you and trevor both hes already demanded a sunday night debriefing he would angela hesitated you know her face changed and molly knew what she was about to say it would achieve nothing angela dont dont what try to solve the problems of the world molly gave her friend a push towards the door go on back to guy well at least tell me what youre wearing tomorrow angela demanded as she was propelled into the foyer boring business black suit white shirt that stopped angela in her tracks youre never wearing boring for jackson baird no im wearing boring for me this is the opportunity of a lifetime to get myself seduced i dont think so molly theres seduced and theres seduced boy if jackson baird wanted to put his boots under my bed angela chuckled and honestly moll she turned and faced her friend when i saw you both looking down at that little frog molly grinned at the picture that conjured up romantic wasnt it it was angela said firmly you looked like you could be the future mrs jackson baird oh yeah in your dreams well why not hes single youre single hes rich thats a recipe for marital bliss if ever i heard one angie go only if you promise you wont wear your business suit maybe i should wear jeans no what would you suggest something short and slinky she chuckled again and looked down at her very slinky dress complete with slit almost to her thigh something like this sure complete with ostrich feathers to show a man over a farm and to care for an eightyearold and to marry a millionaire angela added or a billionaire think big girl im thinking goodnight her friend managed and pushed her out through the door before she could say another word jackson wasnt sure who hed expected as mollys chaperon in fact if hed thought about it at allwhich he hadnthe would have said that he didnt expect her to bring anyonebut the bespectacled child at her side was a shock as was molly she looked stunning he thought watching her approach over the tarmac there was no other word to describe her she was about five feet four and neatly packaged with a handspan waist and a halo of dark curls that bounced about her shoulders yesterday shed worn a business suit today she was wearing jeans and a soft white shirt that buttoned to the throat it should have made her look prim but instead it just made her look inviting she looked fresh as a daisy and as she got within speaking distance and smiled up at him it took a whole five seconds before he could answer good morning she was still smiling but somehow he forced himself to ignore her lovely smile and tackle the issue at hand which was speaking it should be easy but it wasnt good morning he managed unknown to jackson molly was doing her own double take yesterday in his dark business suit jackson had seemed very much an urbane man of the worldhandsome but completely out of her league dressed today in soft moleskin pants and a shortsleeved shirt his throat and arms bare he looked well he might be having trouble keeping to the business at hand but so was she at least she could concentrate on sam mr baird this is my nephew sam sam this is mr baird so she wasnt a single mum jackson thought but if not why bring a child it wasnt the sort of thing any woman hed ever dated had done before but then this was business he reminded himself business not a date sams brought lionel along with us molly motioned to the box under sams arm we hope you dont mind but we thought a convalescent farm was just what lionel needed right the frog he took a grip and held out a hand to sam they were standing on the helicopter pad and any minute now the machine would roar into life drowning out all conversation until they wore headsets im pleased to meet you sam sam looked gravely up at him as they shook hands his eyes huge behind his glasses are you the man who trod on my frog i told you he wasnt molly said gently mr baird is the man who bandaged lionel molly says he might die anyway i didnt say that molly sighed i just said frogs dont live very long she cast a despairing glance at jackson i expect he will die sam said sadly clasping his box as if there were only a few short frogbeats left to his beloved lionel everything dies jacksons gaze flew to mollys and molly gave an inward shrug there was nothing like getting to the hub of things fast sams parents were killed in a car accident six months ago she told him if shed had her way she would have warned jackson but it was impossible now her eyes didnt leave his searching for the right response since then hes had a pessimistic outlook on life jackson nodded gravely and to her relief his response was curt and to the point i can understand that im sorry about your family sam move on mollys eyes warned him and she led the way i told sam that lionel might live for ages yet i had a pet frog when i was eight jackson said thoughtfully rising to the occasion with aplomb he lived for two years and then he escaped to find a lady frog maybe lionel will do the same sam stared at him disbelief patent silence let the helicopter start molly thought this silence was desperate but jackson and sam were eyeing each other like two opponents circling in a boxing ring then jackson seemed to come to a decision his fast brain had worked overtime and now he stooped so his eyes were at sams level man to man sam ill tell you something else you might like to know his gaze met the little boys and held molly was totally excluded he was focused only on sam when i was ten years old my mother died he told him i thought the end of the world had come and like you i expected everything else to die i expected it and expected it it made me desperately frightened but you know what no one else died until i was twentyeight years old ancient in fact silence while sam thought this through then he said twentyeights the same age as molly jacksons deep eyes flashed up to molly and there was the trace of laughter behind his serious gaze there you go then i told you ancient my grandpa died when i was twentyeight but for the time between being ten and being twentyeight not a sausage died not even a frog really really he grinned so maybe youll be that lucky maybe i wont but maybe you will sam considered ive only got molly left and lionel they both look healthy to me yeah youre keeping them well fed lionel looks good and plump to me and so does molly hey that was molly but she was far from minding for the first time sam let himself relax the corners of his mouth twitched into a quickly suppressed smile thats silly good feeding is important jackson told him seriously you can never overlook it that and plenty of exercise i hope you dont let molly watch too much tv sam was grinning now and the tension had disappeared like magic she watches yucky programmes with love and stuff very unhealthy id put a stop to that at once jackson grinned with the wide white smile that made molly know exactly why the women of the world fell in love with him oh for heavens sake the way he was treating sam she was halfway to falling in love with him herself she felt like hugging the man he rose and held out his hand again to sam you want to come in my helicopter sam considered and the whole world seemed to hold its breath then as if coming to a major decision sam put out his hand and placed it in jacksons yes please he said molly smiled and smiled and jackson looked at her smile and thought suddenly its going to be a great weekend he hadnt expected efficiency from the time hed walked into trevor farrs office jackson had suspected if he wanted to find anything about hannah copelands property hed have to do it himself but mollys preparation stunned him as soon as they were in the air she handed over titles building plans profit and loss statements staff lists how did you do this we do the same for all our clients now why dont i believe that she threw him a wry grin in truth this was the sort of property deal she loveda farm with broad acres shed had to work until three this morning but the presentation he had was first rate just like old times stop casting aspersions and read she ordered so he did but more and more he was aware of molly and sam in the seat opposite woman and child against the worldthat was how they seemed and their presence touched him as he hadnt been touched in a long time they she was a business acquaintance he told himself and sam was nothing to do with him at all the copeland place was stunning the pilot took them on a wide sweep of the property the farm started where the mainland formed a narrow strip and then broadened out to a vast spit reaching into the sea the whole spits the copeland place molly told him through the headsets and he smiled and held up her printed plans he already knew but no plans or photographs could do justice to this place the sea lapped around the spit in sparkling sapphire glory the beach was a wide ribbon of golden sand and the hills and plains dotted with placidly grazing cattle looked lush and wonderful from the helicopter they saw streams trickling through hilly bushland towards the sea there were waterfalls and tiny islands as they came in to land a mob of kangaroos bolted for cover and jackson thoughtthis is paradise paradise or not he had to be businesslike he told himself this was a future for him and for cara he didnt make decisions with his heart he made them with his head it lookswell kept he said and his words sounded lame even to him he looked back to find molly and sam both gazing at him in surprise didnt you see the waterfall sam demanded it looks ace dont you think it looks ace ace he agreed and molly grinned i wont have to be a saleswoman if sams here she gazed out as the helicopter blades whirled to a halt in fact i dont think i have to be a saleswoman at all if you have the money then this place will sell itself her eyes danced teasing and if you dont have the money i can arrange a very appealing finance package im sure you can he said it dryly but he was impressed for all that shed done her homework theres no other property like this on the market anywhere else in australia she told him i dont know what you want this place for she let the question hang but she wasnt enlightened so she let it slide but whatever it is i think youll find birraginbil will provide it birraginbil you know that birraginbil is the name of the property she grinned now ask me why i havent put that in big letters at the top of your presentation he looked at her considering she looked supremely selfassured he thought and it hit him suddenly that she was doing something she loved despite the appalling trevor the woman before him was an astute professional he grinned back at her joining the game so tell me what it means place of leeches she chuckled at the look on his face and the matching look on sams dont tell me youre scared of a few ittybitty leeches she foraged in her handbag look she held out a small canister be prepared is what they taught us in property sales school salt if theres leeches here im ready for them wow he was growing more and more impressed she was some saleswoman are there really leeches sams voice was tremulous and molly hugged him close yes but only in the lowlying swamp the estuaries around the beach are clear and the deeper dams by the homestead are great for swimming and for frogs jackson asked and molly raised her eyebrows she smiled grateful for his bringing sam into the equation ill bet for frogs can we show lionel sam was immediately interested yep she turned away from jackson and he was aware of a sense of he wasnt sure pique jealousy surely not he thought hed brought the frog into the conversation to make sam smile but now knew that hed done it so molly would smile it was a strange way of getting a womans attentionbut womens attention was something jackson didnt usually have to work at and now molly had turned away molly was only giving him the business side of her while the personal side was directed purely at sam which was fair enough sam needed her and jackson didnt so why the sense of pique well ask the farm manager to take mr baird on a sightseeing tour while he does that well find out where the frogs live she told sam and the irrational sensations jackson was feeling only deepened he tried to make it rational after all molly was a realtor surely it was her job to show the client around hed work on it he decided and suddenly it seemed almost as important as seeing the farm seeing the farm with molly chapter three the arrangement was that the helicopter would collect them the following day and no sooner had it lifted from the pad and roared off into the sun than an elderly couple appeared at the sight of jackson molly and sam their faces almost split with delight a family the elderly lady breathed and she gripped her partners hand see gregor what did i tell you a family were not a family molly spoke swiftly and jackson felt an irrational pang of disappointment misconception or not it had felt goodfor a moment which was irrational wasnt it but of course molly was right if he was seriously interested in this property then he had to get off on the right foot from the start miss farrs acting as realtor for miss copeland he told them im jackson baird the potential buyer he smiled at sam half hidden behind molly and this is sam mollys nephew he and his pet frog lionel have come along for the ride the elderly woman took a deep breath and made a recovery then family or not were very pleased to meet you she told them im doreen gray miss copelands housekeeper and this is my husband gregor come on in ill make us a cup of tea and we can get to know each other and that set the tone for the weekend doreen and gregor had no concept of formality jackson molly and sam were treated as very special guests indeed they might have been family for the welcome they received you dont see many people molly ventured over her third scone and she knew straight away that shed hit the nail on the head no dear we dont doreen told her time was when the copelands used to have every important family in australia staying here we have nineteen bedrooms would you believe and we filled them all but mr and mrs copeland passed away almost thirty years back and miss copeland never was one for socialising she moved to sydney ten years ago and the place has been almost abandoned is it run down jacksons brows creased but doreens face stiffened and she offered him another scone as if to saydoes this look like the product of a farm let go it most certainly isnt miss copeland would never stand for that we run over three thousand head of cattle at mustering we have over a dozen men and once a month i have a girl in from town to do the house from stem to stern if you wanted to fill those bedrooms tomorrow youd find nothing amiss im sure i wouldnt jackson looked appreciatively about him the kitchen was just as farm kitchens ought to bebig and warm and welcoming with a vast firestove that stretched almost from wall to wall it gleamed with cleanlinessno mean feat he guessed when the house was well over a century old cara would like this kitchen no she wouldnt he gave a rueful inward grimace what was he thinking of cara wouldnt step foot in a kitchen unless she was dragged but shed love the rest of the place the house was fabulous vast bluestone walls were ringed by a wide veranda that ran the full perimeter of the house every room seemed to have french windows the curtains wafting outwards in the breeze looked fresh and new and the whole place had instant appeal he looked across the table and found mollys eyes on him assessing and he guessed she was right in business mode its great isnt it you know youre the first person weve shown it to i know that you wont be the last she turned to mrs gray and smiled i hope you bake scones every time i bring prospective buyers down here these are delicious it was a tactful way of saying jackson was first in a queue and there were others whod be interested if he wasnt he smiled acknowledging she had a point but refusing to be hurried but i have first option right i believe you have first option until monday very generous we aim to please she smiled across the table at him and he found himself staring she was charming intelligent organised beautiful he found himself looking down at the ring finger on her bandaged left handjust in caseand felt a ridiculous twinge of pleasure when he discovered it was bare and then he had to jolt himself back to hear what she was saying mr jackson would like to see over the farm she told gregor can you show him around oh my dear the elderly farmers face fell is there a problem i cant do it gregor said heavily my legs wont take me i didnt mean walk molly told him i assume theres a vehicle the jeeps in for a service if wed known you were coming but miss copeland only rang last night to tell us you were on your way theres the farm bike doreen said but it only holds one then theres the horses but gregors hip cant take it it nearly killed them molly saw to admit that they were getting old and needed help gregors face was anguished i can go by myself jackson said gently reacting to the old mans distress miss farr he cast molly a sideways look and decided on informality mollys given me excellent maps and if you have a horse then i can ride but you could fall off doreen was practically wringing her hands theres rabbit holes and heaven knows what else youll want to see everything and the only way to see it properly is by horse but you cant go alone her husband added he turned to molly and she could see what an effort it cost him to ask unless you ride miss i ride she said briefly and received another look of astonishment from jackson one surprise after another city realtors it seemed were not expected to ride she hesitated sam was right beside her pressing close his insecurity was almost tangible but sam cant well look after sam doreen beamed at this easy solution to the problem it would be our pleasure then she addressed sam adult to adult im making a pavlova for supper she told him have you ever made one sam hesitated no i would you like to learn i need help to pick the strawberries for the top and were handrearing a calf gregor added seeing where doreen was headed and putting in his two bobs worth she needs bottlefeeding seems to me youre just the sort of lad whod be able to do that and did you say you have a frog in that box doreen asked after weve done our jobs gregor and i will walk you to where there are a thousand frogs and tadpoles to match it was too much sam gave a shy nod and the tension in the room eased like magic molly let her breath out in a rush darn everywhere she looked there were conflicting demands but these two lovely old people had given her time off wonderful can you really ride jackson demanded or do you mean you can sit on a riding school hack the toad try me she retorted and turned to gregor excluding jackson nicely he deserved to be excluded according to my livestock lists you have some fine horses theyll be frisky gregor warned they havent been ridden since muster the friskier the better she told him i cant wait and the thing was settled itll take you the best part of the day to get around doreen added ill put together a picnic for your saddlebags you have a lovely day for it she beamed there thats settled you have a lovely ride and see the property and sam will have fun with us isnt that lovely what was her story jackson watched as molly helped catch and saddle the horses and by the time they were mounted he knew she hadnt spoken lightly when shed said she could ride she looked as if shed been born in the saddle her roan mare was skittish as be damned but she held her as steadily as jackson held his bay then as gregor let them go and the mare skittered sideways she turned a laughing face towards him they wont settle until theyve had a gallop and the home paddocks are safest race you to the far gate before he knew what she was about she was off the mare galloping like the wind and molly riding her with an attitude that spoke of sheer joy at being alive or more of release it was quite a sight it took jackson about ten valuable seconds before he recovered himself enough to turn his attention to his own horseby which time she had an unassailable lead and shed paused and was waiting when he reached her at the far end of the paddock what kept you she demanded i thought businesswomen always let their clients win he complained and received another of her lovely throaty chuckles whoops but im on a sure thing here if the rest of this property is as good as this then itll sell itself she had a point the more he saw the more he liked but he wasnt just assessing the property youre not a bad horseman she was saying and it drew a grin gee thanks he told her dryly if i didnt just know that flattery was good for business didnt i tell you this wasnt business the property will sell itself with no need for idle compliments to get a buyer in the mood so you did his mood was lightening by the minute she was making him feel free of the restrictions he usually surrounded himself with those restrictions were his by choice he told himself his life his work cara they were all his choice but it didnt hurt to take a break where did you learn to ride he asked as they turned their now amenable mounts towards the hills on the back of a dairy cow that had his eyebrows hiking upwards youre kidding nope my parents ran a small country newsagency i was jealous of all the kids who had farms so when they saddled up their horses i made do with strawberry strawberry was our house cow his lips twitched dont tell me you rode her to school well no i couldnt ride her when dad was looking it put her off her milk id imagine it would he was feeling more and more dazed a sudden vision of molly on a dairy cow crossed his mind and he blinked it away it had the power to unsettle him completely but she was unaware this next bits the murky bit she told him motioning to a tract of swamp land id guess this is where the leeches are you want to stop and look closer if so ill go over to the next hill and wait whatscared of a few leeches yes she said firmly despite my salt canister but off you go tread where no man has trod before after all isnt that your reputation is it he demanded startled and to his surprise she took him seriously her gaze raking him from head to toe assessing it was a strange kind of glance and it unnerved him they say youre ruthless in business youll stop at nothing her tone was uncommitted youre a businesswoman yourself her unspoken criticism rankled so i am but you have limits his tone was probing as i imagine you have like leeches as you say she grinned and the sudden unexplained tension eased a bit does that mean youre not hiking through the swamp like a true hero i can see everything i need to see from up here he said with what he hoped was dignity and her chuckle unnerved him all over again the swamp was the worst of the whole place the rest was sheer magic they skirted the swamp and made their way to the sea here the paddocks butted the dunes and the lush pasture was cropped by sleek wellfed cattle they looked the most contented cattle jackson had ever seen and he thought well why not id be pretty happy if this was my lot they drifted down onto the sand without speaking a kind of contented silence had built between them jackson headed his horse wherever the urge took him and molly was content to follow down on the sand he headed for the shallows and then letting that same urge do as it willed urged his horse into a gallop molly followed they rode side by side the waves splashing up over their feet and the salt spray misting their faces when they finally drew to a halt molly was flushed and laughing and bright with happiness that was wonderful you never learned to do that on a cow i did get a horse she admitted eventually so what in heavens name are you doing in the city i work in the city your whole attitude screams farm girl gee thanks i thought id hidden the hayseeds well we had a farm ourselves he told her when i was a kid my mother owned a holding north of perth and i spent every moment i could there and you dont spend years of your life on a farm without learning a city slicker from a from a hayseed her eyes danced honestly she was gorgeous he had a sudden almost irresistible temptation to lean over take her face in his hands and whoa where was this headed business back to business baird now from a hayseed he agreed weakly and her sudden thoughtful expression had him wondering was she feeling what he was feeling how much a woman of the world was she would it hurt to hell business wed get a view of the whole place from the cliffs he managed motioning sideways and if she could tell his thoughts were disordered she didnt let on and itd be a great spot for lunch so it would she said equitably okay macduff lead the way but the tension didnt ease he didnt react like this to women he thought as he finished off the last of doreens sandwiches molly had abandoned him on the picnic rug shed moved a little way away aiming to give him space to admire the view which was spectacular he should be concentrating on it entirely instead of being so darned conscious of her that he couldnt think straight damn he was never like this with women he didnt have to be thered always been a woman by his side ever since his first date aged about fifteen his combination of money and looks and power proved a powerful magnet that few could resist and after the last disaster play it light he told himself and then he thought well maybe a swift liaison wouldnt do any harm molly wasnt exactly a teenager the laughter glinting in the back of her eyes told him she was very aware of his attributes and was sizing him up she was no fool she wouldnt get the wrong impression as had whoa theres wine here he called to her hauling his thoughts back to practicalities she was a whole twenty feet away perched on the branch of a lowgrowing gum below them were the cattle pastures and the slowmoving river drifting out to the sea the sun was on her face and her eyes held a strange tranquil expression how to describe it it was as if she was hungry he thought but not hungry for food hungry for life it was as if she was soaking in every minute of this as if itd have to last a lifetime i dont need wine she told him hardly changing expression i dont need anything her expression intrigued him why do you work in the city he asked curiously when its obvious your love is here sams home is in the city you moved there when sams parents died wouldnt you the question took him aback would he he didnt know he thought as the privileged child of wealthy parents hed never been asked to make the sort of sacrifice molly was making any kind of sacrifice for that matter kids are adaptable he told her thinking things through i assume you were living in the country at the time of the accident couldnt sam have moved there with you i tried she said briefly it was a disaster should she tell him the whole sad story of michael no way shed let herself love a rat and it had taken a tragedy to show that to her she could no longer live in the same small town as michael it was hard enough to know he was in the same country sams parents lived in a plush city apartment and he goes to an inner city school she told him he needed continuity so i moved as simple as that but arent you did you note the carrying capacity of those pastures she demanded switching track with a definite purpose its amazing ive never read such figures for nondairy country and thats without putting added nutrients on the pasturessomething that hasnt been done for years if you were to invest in superphosphate ill invest in superphosphate her eyes narrowed you mean youll buy he corrected himself if i buy ill invest in superphosphate its a great buy silence somewhere a kookaburra started up its raucous chortle ringing through the bushland from where they were settled they could hear the faint crashing of waves on the beach below and the breeze was a gentle whisper through the gums overhead the place was indeed magic this place will sell in two minutes in the open market theres not a lot of buyers with the cash needed to buy a place like this i know at least five she said promptly you want me to name them you decide against this place and ill be on the phone to them in minutes they dont know its on the market or theyd be beating a path to our door he gave a rueful grin you do a very pressured sales pitch she smiled thats my job selling farms her smile died yes but you now sell city properties he was still probing still searching for what lay beneath do you enjoy that of course i do theres no of course about it youre a country girl born and bred even i can see that well how about you she asked trying again to change direction you spent a lot of your childhood on a farm why are you thinking of buying this place are you returning to your roots you could say that from all i hear you spend most of your time overseas until now so youre thinking of settling down here the idea she decided appealed to her this place and this man seemed to suit each other he sat with his back against a rock the sun on his face as he gazed out over the pastures to the sea beyond he looked at peace like a man coming home a man who belonged maybe he said at last still she probed are you thinking of getting married his face stilled why do you suggest that i dont know she shrugged it was none of her business after all i guess when a man thinks of settling and mrs gray would like a family here there is that she smiled as the inexplicable note of tension eased i hope youd oblige after all it is extremely important to keep the hired help happy by having a family he assumed an expression of horror no way not even for the grays maybe ill borrow sam from time to time she thought that through and approved hed like that so despite you staying in the city sams not happy drat they were talking about her life again and she shouldnt do it he was a client she knew better than to mix business with pleasure they stayed absolutely apart but it was so tempting to talk of sam she was so worried about him and jackson was looking at her with calm grey eyes that said he was really interested he really cared no she sighed hes not happy i guess i cant expect thathis parents have only been dead six months but her voice trailed off and she bit her lip he couldnt really care only it seemed he did how did he come by the bruises on his face he takes on the world can you explain unwise or not the temptation to unload her worries was irresistible jacksons shoulders were so broadmaybe it wouldnt hurt to burden him a little hes so darned little she told him hes the smallest kid in his class but he wont take a back seat he stands up for himself no matter what if a bigger kid pushes in front of him sam will shove back regardless of the consequencesand he always comes off second best the schools not great but i cant afford to move him jackson thought that through theres money problems my sister and her husband didnt believe in insurance and they lived life in the fast lane there were debts i see and he did more than she knew he could guess by the set look of her chin just what sort of obligations shed shouldered hes some responsibility as you say there was silence again but this time it was different there was no tension it was almost as if they knew what the other was thinking he seemeda friend molly thought inconsequentially it seemed she was being offered friendship in an unlikely placebut it was friendship regardless shed heard the note of caring in his voice and it made her blink back tears drat the man he had the capacity to get under her skin and why because he was big and handsome and gentle and and a millionaireeven a billionaire as such he was right out of her league even as a friend men like jackson werent friends if they were anything at all then they were trouble she bit her lip and stooped to pack their picnic things its time we were getting on theres still plenty to see so there is but his gaze was on her face and his eyes were thoughtful so help me she demanded letting a note of irritation enter her voice it wont all fit in my saddlebag and youre not my servant his tone was faintly teasing and molly flushed no mr baird im not your servant she snapped and kept on packing but still he didnt help he stood looking down at her stooped figure and there was a very odd expression playing beneath the thoughtfulness of his features she was some lady the thought hit him out of nowhere and he didnt have a clue what to do with it chapter four they rode for three hours and they hardly talked there was no need the property did indeed sell itself molly decided as they moved from one paddock to another each seemed better than before this was a tiny paradise cut off from the outside world the more she saw the more three million seemed very cheap but it wasnt for her to say hannah copeland had named her price and it was up to jackson to say yes or no if he said no then shed contact hannah and advise her to increase her asking price the next time she showed anyone what are you thinking jackson demanded and molly discovered that hed been watching her were her thoughts transparent she hoped not youre thinking of upping the price he said bluntly and she had to smile umyes you think three million is cheap it is and you know it is he gazed around him and had to agree yep so if i ask you to pay more id tell you to take a cold shower thats blunt she grinned but you agree its a bargain id imagine there are strings attached are there there may well be if youre really interested ill contact miss copeland this evening and ask what she has in mind it may well be taking on doreen and gregor she thought that through and figured it was a distinct possibility the elderly couple had been here for most of their lives and to move them on would be cruel would that be a problem family retainers are the devil id imagine theyd be loyal they should be put out to pasture and you know it she looked across at him still considering would you be the one to put them out to pasture suddenly his answer was absurdly important she knew what his answer should behis reputation was as a ruthless businessman after allbut in the short time shed known him shed seen the kindness of the man and it was desperately important that he still display it he was still watching her face and it seemed the man could still read her thoughts just because i splinted a frogs leg dont think im a soft touch you were nice to sam as well okay i was nice to sam he conceded neither of those things cost me money and if they hadwould you still have done them it depends entirely on how much any more than tuppencehalfpenny and id have consulted my accountant she gave a chuckle and turned her face to the sun she hadnt felt this good for years she thought orsince sarah died jackson had given her this day and for that she had to be grateful you will keep doreen and gregor on your payroll i havent agreed to buy the place yet she gave him a cheeky grin neither you have and i mightnt yeah right she knew she had the man seriously hooked things were looking very good very good indeed but she didnt press the point instead she headed her horse down towards the river if we follow the river well end up home she told him no no well end up swimming he told her it looks fabulous it looks wet chicken i didnt bring a costume she told him and respectable realtors dont strip to their bras and panties and go swimming with clients its absolutely not done what a pity it is a pity another grin but dont let me stop you from stripping be my guest i promise i wont produce a camera or if i do itll be a very small one you know i wouldnt be the least bit surprised if youre carrying one along with your leech repellent he said bitterly she laughed her lovely chuckle rang out free and joyous and he sat still in his saddle and stared at her then as she moved off he had to make an almost visible effort to follow what on earth was happening to him he didnt have a clue but in the end she did swim in the end she didnt have a choice molly reached the river before jackson and by the time he reached her she was staring across the slowmoving current her laughter completely disappeared whats wrong his gaze followed hers and found what she was looking at oh upriver a couple of small logs had fallen over a cut in the bank and twigs and leaf matter had piled high theyd seen the debris as theyd ridden and it didnt take a genius to figure out what had happened next a tiny kangaroo barely half grown had hopped out onto the debris thinking it a firm foothold it wasnt the debris around the joey told its own story the whole mat had given way and the baby kangaroo was now drifting helplessly towards the sea on the far bank a fullgrown roo was following her offsprings progress in obvious terror she was leaping along the bank and then gazing back to the bushland knowing she shouldnt venture far from cover but compelled to follow her baby back in the shadows were the remaining mob sleeping out the heat of the day and oblivious to the drama being played out nearby and it was drama the joey would be out to sea in no timeor washed away and drowned jackson turned to molly and found her off her horse and tugging at her boots what the hell are you doing i can reach him youll be swept out to sea not me im a country girlremember born and bred by the sea i can swim like a fish he was down from his horse grasping her arms to restrain her dont be stupid its only a roo only a roo the words hung between them she gave an angry wrench but he held her still molly no i can do it only a roo yeah like it was only a frog i cant let it drown and how do you propose grabbing it youll be cut to pieces he looked at her face and saw implacability with an inward groan he turned to assess the river maybe she was right maybe the thing was possible the water looked clear enough apart from the tumble of debris around the roo there seemed little enough to trap and hold and the clear running water appeared sandbottomed and friendly ill go in he told her you cant why not he was hauling the saddle from his horse well need the saddlecloth to hold the joey help me you she took a deep breath and steadied sanity prevailing if you drown trevor will kill me millionaire killed by baby kangaroo i dont think so i dont intend to drown they glared at each other so well go in together molly snapped dont be ridiculous he had the blanket free now and was concentrating on hauling off his boots whos ridiculous one in all in and mollys shoes were kicked aside and she entered the water before he did jackson didnt follow not straight away he paused and waited it never paid to jump in at the deep end hadnt he learned that over and over in his business life and what was needed here was a bit of calmheaded logic molly seemed to know what she was doing and watching her he was reassured shed dived in downstream and was fighting the current to reach midstream before the joey reached her he watched for a whole three secondsenough to see her move with strokes that were strong and sure enough to see that she was safe okay then molly was fine now for one roo he tied the saddlecloth around his hips strode swiftly downstream and dived in after the pair of them molly was a good swimmer but jackson was better where she cut diagonally through the current jackson simply stroked straight across the joey was still floating towards them his two small ears and his huge eyes almost all they could see above the surface the debris he was floating on was breaking apart and his platform was sinking by the minute jackson reached midriver first and trod water as he waited molly was slightly upstream but coming fast as she reached him he held out a hand and graspedstrong sure and determined molly had enough time to register the strength of his hold and ten seconds later the joey cannoned into the wall theyd created with their linked arms the kangaroo might only be half grown but with his underwater platform of branches he seemed to weigh a ton and the little creature was terrifiedas much of these two strange humans as he was of the river he backed away his platform wobbled steadied wobbled again let him not jump combined jackson and molly formed a trap they were linked by joined hands and the joey was locked between them their arms making a triangle with the roos platform in the apex but they were all being swept inexorably towards the river mouth and at the river mouthrocks get back to shore jackson gasped at molly you cant do this i can ill do it you go back he tried to disengage their hands to leave her free but she was having none of it no lets both try molly you dont have the right remember sam great here she was risking life and limb and he was reminding her of her responsibilities as if she needed reminding she wasnt risking anything she thought angrily she could do this were wasting effort she gasped just swim their hands stayed linked his hold was sure and strong and she wasnt relinquishing it for the world the joey was between them the little creatures eyes on a level with theirs his terror was palpable and still he backed away the roo wouldnt stay on the platform while they guided him ashore hed jump any minute ill get behind him jackson gasped stay where you are there was one branch larger than the rest that formed the joeys foothold molly grasped it lightly trying not to pressure it any further underwater she didnt want the joey washed off then she tried to keep the joeys attention on her watch me she gasped figuring what jackson intended before she was told she bobbed up and down and kept on talking as the joey backed a little more she was trying to keep the joeys eyes fixed on her and then jackson was behind him he trod water for a moment steadied and raised the sodden blanket before the joey could react he dropped the rug and in one swift movement he had the joey trussed like a christmas parcel the razortipped paws slashed but the cloth was made of thick felt jackson swore steadied swore again and floated on his back the wrapped joey writhed furiously on his chest but finally was still i cant do anything with him here jackson gasped it was all he could do to hold on can you tow me it was some questionbut she could molly released the platform of twigs to let it rush on towards the sea and then fought to get behind jackson she cupped her hands under his chin lay back then kicked out and started to tow jackson kicked in unison and slowly they moved towards the bank it took all their strengthmore than all their strengthto move the joey towards the shore and afterwards jackson never could figure out how they had he surely couldnt have done it on his own mollys strength was amazing he could kick but nothing more and that alone wasnt enough to battle the current but somehow she found the strength to tow not just herself but him and the kangaroo with him the river broadened at the mouth and jagged rocks formed the riverbed here the breakers crashed in from the open sea and anything pushed further would be dashed against the rocks but the current lessened slightlyalmost imperceptiblyjust before the rocks man and woman kicked fiercely in unison and they reached the shore just as the first of the rocks came into view even then they didnt have the joey safe as they staggered to their feet in shallow water they were confronted by a sandy cliff reaching five or six feet up from the riverbed there was nothing to hold now what jackson managed a rueful grin at the predicament they were facing he was lifting the bundle high out of the water but already the roo was starting to struggle free you go up and ill push molly told him youre kidding nope i have a better idea he rewrapped the roo until he was sure those claws couldnt come free and handed the whole thing to molly he hauled himself in against the cliff and cupped his hands so she could use them as a step up you go she looked at jackson and looked at the cliff i cant of course you can girl he said equitably after all theres no choiceso what choice do you have somehow their crazy scheme worked somehow molly was propelled upwards to land in a laughing sodden heap on the grassy verge then she reached down to grab jacksons hand as he hauled himself up he came in a rush and almost landed on top of hera soggy ball of roo man and woman and they were safe weve done it molly gasped as jackson untied their bundle of baby roo yes theyd done the thing jackson looked down at her and his mouth twisted in a rueful smile she was battered and soggy and exhausted she was limp with relief and hed never seen anything more beautiful hes gorgeous molly murmured as the blanket fell away from the sodden joey the baby roo did look gorgeous kind of but then so did the girl with a huge effort jackson managed a response yeah right gorgeous but stupid the joey was shaking its head in disbelief theyd landed on the opposite bank from where theyd startedon the same bank as the joeys motherand already the mother roo was peering towards them trying to see what was happening stupid what a thing to say im a pragmatist he retorted someone has to be if i wasnt a pragmatist youd have tried to rescue the joey without a rug and youd be bleeding to death right now she managed a grin albeit a shaky one then im glad youre a pragmatist but im also oh jackson hes going to jump mmm her eyes narrowed are you okay suddenly he was okay more than okay he felt great theyd struggled against the odds and theyd won and it was as far from the everyday whitecollar wheeling and dealing as hed been for years his eyes met mollys and they were full of laughter and of triumph oh well done well done us jackson there was no need for more he heard the warning in her voice and turned to see the mother roo thundering down from along the bank the roo had seen her baby and was now taking steps to get him back give him a push away molly urged halflaughing halfserious these roos were big bull kangaroos were dangerous enough but to stand between a roo and her joey im trying jackson grabbed the blanket and lifted it awayand then retreated fast freedom the joey gave one more unbelieving shake of his head he reared on wobbly legsand then took off for his mother as if molly and jackson were the cause of all his problems rather than his saviours well will you look at that but jackson was grinning with a smile that almost split his face the joey had reached his mother the roo nosed him all over and then the joey dived straight down deep into his mothers pouch the roo took off before the joeys legs had disappeared and gave the strange humans not so much as a backward glance as they headed for the safety of the mob thats gratitude for you im grateful molly said before she could stop herselfbecause she was she couldnt have saved the joey herself maybe it had been dangerous to try but thered been too much death in her life over the last few months if she could stop just one death you know you cant save the world he was watching her face and guessing what she was thinking she flushed i can try molly and then before he even knew what he intended he reached for her why he hardly knew but she was so alone kneeling on the sandy bank watching the roo with worried eyes that still reflected her fear of unnecessary death she was sodden and bruised and shaken and there was suddenly no choice but to take her in his arms to hold her hard against him so her breasts moulded to his chest to comfort no this was more than comfort this was need he could feel her heart beating against his and it felt right he kissed the top of her head and when she raised her face to him in mute enquiry it was entirely natural that his hold became tighter it felt right that his mouth should lower onto hers he kissed her of course he kissed her and what a kiss she tasted of saltof the sea she tasted of of what he didnt know all he knew was that this was a kiss such as hed never experienced hed kissed so many soft pliant lipsticked mouths that pursed into perfectly formed kisses and claimed him as their right but there was no cool expertise here their first touch fell awry as if she hadnt expected itwasnt wanting itdidnt know what to do with it when she received it but she didnt pull away her response was almost wondering as if she didnt understand that she was being kissed didnt understand why and she wanted nothing from it but the touch she needed comfort she needed reassurance that here was life in the face of death that shed tried and shed won and here was the man who had helped her achieve it and he was solid and strong and male and wonderful she asked for nothing more her hands came up to take his face in her palms and her lips parted under his welcoming the kiss deepening glorying in the triumph of the momentof the triumph of himof the triumph of life itself the sun was warm on their seasoaked bodies with every moment they were recovering soon theyd surface to sanity but until then they took each other in a desperate hunger that had nothing to do with the courting rituals each was accustomed to here was a man and a woman and the sun and the sand and the world around them was a mere backdrop to their need and when finally they pulled apartas pull apart they must though neither wanted itthere was no confusion between them only a deep assurance that it had been right the right place the right time the right man for the right woman there was laughter in mollys eyesnot the carefully rehearsed confusion hed come to expect from the women who saw his money coming before he did there was no false coyness here she was laughing at him and she was reaching up to touch his hair youre wearing a crown of seaweed king neptune ditto for you he lifted a strand from her shoulder and tossed it aside hell we must look like shipwreck victims she was still laughing glorying in the moment but for what better reason oh jackson wasnt that marvellous marvellous he agreed and he couldnt agree more her eyes were dancing with joy want to do it again i suspect our kangaroo wont be that stupid was i talking about the roo but she chuckled letting him off the hook okay i was talking about the roo shed pulled right back from him and was hauling up the leg of her jeans and i definitely dont want to do that again i hit my leg on a stump as i came up the bank look at the size of this bruise damn it was as if the kiss had never happened despite himself jackson couldnt help feeling a little piqued after all he had kissed the girl he wasnt accustomed to kissing a woman and having no reaction at all especially when the kiss had felt so perfect it was because it was the result of triumph he told himself nothing more it was the emotion of the moment molly would know as well as he did that the kiss could mean nothingthat theyd move back to business from this point on so keep it light he told himself despite the fact that he quite suddenlyquite desperatelywanted to reach for her again wanted to take her in his arms again i have matching bruises he told her and only he knew what an effort it was to keep his voice light can i see that brought a laugh nope theyre in places a good realtor shouldnt look uncharted territory eh something like that they were grinning at each other like fools and then the tension sprang back and he didnt know what the hell to do with it because he couldnt kiss her againcould he no he couldnt not without starting something he couldnt stop because having a light flirtation with molly farr no the thing was impossible and he didnt know why it would be like starting a wild fire he thought he wouldnt know how to put it out or even if hed want to what was he thinking of of course hed want to put it out had he learned nothing over the last few months hadnt he and cara made a pact no relationship with anyone they could fall in love withthat was the deal he shook his head as if dispelling a dream then managed a smile at molly as he hauled himself to his feet he held out a hand to help her to hers she looked at the hand for a long moment then placed hers in his it was as if she was coming to some sort of decision her hand in his felt warm and strong and sureandright yeah pigs might fly he told himself harshly right hardly wrong and wrong and wrong wed best get back to the house he managed and she smiled up at him as if she was unaware of the tumult of emotions running through his head he looked across the river concentrating on anything but molly and found something there to concentrate on oh hell your horse is gone you mustnt have tethered it then we go back fast shell head to the homestead unbridled and start a panic and that would never do i wont scare sam she said bluntly and started walking back along the bank to where the river narrowed and it would be quicker to swim across he fell in by her side his pique increasing by the minute he wasnt accustomed to being treated as this woman was treating him but youll jump into the river to save a kangaroo and risk drowning yourself into the bargain how does that equate with not scaring sam she stopped then and turned back to him responding to the note of anger in his voice with bewilderment i was never in danger if i couldnt have saved the roo i would have swum back and if the current had been too strong you know very well the river broadens at the mouth the water becomes shallower and the current less strong if id been in danger of going past the point of no return i could have swum back before i reached the rocks damn molly you could have died i couldnt dont make me out to be some sort of heroine isnt that what you are still there was anger in his voice and he couldnt figure it out himself doing rugby tackles to save a frog leaping into the breach to save a drowning roo taking on an orphan dont do this there was no mistaking her matching anger it was blazing from her brown eyes slashing at him with fury i took in sam for me me sure sam needs me but i need him too i lost my sister and my brotherinlaw and my way of life i dont have anyone but sam i took sam in for meif you want to cast anyone as a heroine then go find yourself a storybook damsel but dont pick on me im not it i and dont think ill fall trembling into your arms like good heroines should she threw at him before he could recover i never thought that she forestalled him so why did you kiss me hey it wasnt just me you kissed me back her hands were on her hips her curls were sodden and awry there was still a streak of seaweed in her hairand again he thought hed never seen anything so beautiful i might have kissed you but i didnt mean it she snapped i was cold you were trembling so were you that made his eyebrows rise me tremble yes her grin surfaced anger receding you were definitely trembling so there mr hero baird heroes shake too the woman was incorrigible i did not shake you did and i couldnt have you dying of shock itd do me all sorts of damage worried youll lose a valuable client certainly i am ive told you trevor would kill me if i brought you back dead so thats the only reason i kissed back yeah right there was nothing else to say they slithered down the riverbank into the water and struck out for the opposite shore side by side there was still this intimacy between them it was unbelievably intimate to swim with her matching stroke for stroke it was sort oftwo becoming one which was crazy then they gained the point where one horse still stayed tethered they reached for their boots and he looked doubtfully down at them at last a topic of conversation that wasnt fraught with tension my socks are squelchy im taking mine off she sat on the riverbank and proceeded to do just that then swivelled to find him watching her with a very odd expression on his face what havent you seen bare feet before he had of course he had and why the sight of a sodden molly hauling off even more sodden socks had his insides turning handsprings he didnt know all he knew was that it did unimaginably erotic he murmured and she gave one of her lovely low chuckles thats me mata hari has nothing on me dance of the seven veils be damned this is the saga of two soggy socks she raised her eyebrows at him youre not joining me in a striptease i hardly think so he sat and hauled his boots over his socks regardless and she looked at him in astonishment theres modesty and theres modesty and then theres plain stupidity you know i wont faint if i see bare toes no but my boots will feel like the very devil on bare skin you dont have to walk your horse is still heremines bolted you can ride mine she grinned again what a hero thank you very much but no not me why ever not and have you tell trevor i made a client walk not on your life i know what my jobs worth i wont tell trevor anything of the kind of course youll ride of course i wont then well both walk thats ridiculous ridiculous or not thats the way it is chapter five so half an hour later gregor came out of the yard to find a sodden molly and jackson trudging up to the house their one horse walking easily between them the frown on gregors old face lightened the mare had indeed come home and the sight of her had shaken him badly he hadnt told doreenhe hadnt wanted to worry herbut hed been about to get on the farm bike regardless of his bad hip and go and find out what the damage was however there was apparently no damage at all they were walking easily the girl was laughing even the horse looked undamaged but why werent they riding him did we scare you molly called and his trouble receded even further there was no problem behind that light lovely laughter no miss well yes you did a bit i didnt like to see the mare come home without you i thought you must have come off over a bump no such thing i didnt tether her right we stopped to rescue a joey that had fallen in the river jackson added but his eyes were on molly she had him fascinated she still looked crazy soaking and tumbled and sanded like the coating on a rissole cara would die if she was seen like this he thought suddenly cara and every other woman who moved in his circles but molly seemed not to even notice sam wasnt worried she asked and the old man shook his head i didnt tell him no use spreading trouble before you need to very wise the roo tried to cross the river on a bunch of leaf litter that wasnt the least bit stable hell i know where thatll have happened gregor nodded its happened before i lost a calf that way once things wedge in that bend in the river he grimaced it ought to be checked every day his face set as if expecting a blow molly knew what he was thinking if jackson bought the place gregor would hardly have recommended himself as a future farm manager but he didnt try to absolve himself from responsibility he braced himself and confessed all i didnt do the rounds this morning and i should have youre the only fulltime man on the place jackson asked slowly and molly watched gregors face fall even further here we go she thought jacksons going to suggest retirement yes gregor took the bays rein and molly saw his shoulders go back into brace position waiting for the inevitable it didnt come according to the title theres two smaller houses on the property jackson was still frowning i assume you and doreen have one yes the caretakers cottage and the other its empty but its liveable oh yes sir gregor told him its a nice little place overlooking the bay to the south of the river time was when the farm manager lived there this place has a farm manager jackson said briefly you but it needs more a place of this size cant prosper with casual labour it needs permanents what you need is a solid young man you could gradually train to take over as you ease back or a couple what would you say to doing some training you mean training them and then leaving i dont mean anything of the sort jackson said curtly if i buy ill need all the expertise i can get and losing the people who know most about the place would be stupid thered be work here for you and doreen for as long as you want and even in retirement id want you to stay on as advisers it was as if the sun had come out do you mean it gregor sounded incredulous i havent bought the place yet jackson warned him but yes if i do buy then i mean it the mans breath came out in a rush as he heaved a great sigh of relief then its up to me and doreen to see you buy he said simply you go inside and see what doreens been cooking maybe thatll push you into making the right choice the sun had come out for molly as well it was as if it had been some sort of testand jackson had passed with flying colours if jackson needed more persuasion doreen had just the means to persuade pavlova swiss roll pikelets fresh from the oven gem scones molly stopped at the kitchen door and blinked in astonishment as she took in the lavish spread come and see what weve made sam beamed from the business side of a mixing bowl of truly gigantic proportionsa bowl that had been well and truly licked mrs grays the worlds bestest cook i can see that she is molly said and looked sideways at jackson if ever there was a sales pitch that would work this was it it had been ages since lunch the swim had sharpened their appetite and the smells were just fantastic jackson said and he grinned at doreen and then at sam did you help make all of this he was seeming nicer and nicer molly thought happily and had to catch herself she was moving too fast here and in the wrong direction this man was a client nothing more i rolled up the swiss roll sam said importantly and i dropped the batter for the pikelets into the pan all by myself then he paused in his bowllicking and stared at the pair of them noting their discreditable appearance for the first time have you been swimming yes molly said swiftly with a warning glance at jackson sams face fell without me you dont like swimming shed tried him once before and it had been a disaster but i might sam said cautiously with mr baird so sam was being sucked into this mans charismatic presence as well well it was dangerous territory for sam as well as molly mr baird has business to keep him occupied sam mr baird sam turned pleading eyes to jackson swimming could hardly be any fun without him his eyes said and who could resist an appeal like that jackson grinned and capitulated tugging mollys heartstrings even further from their rightful position of course ill take you swimming he told him but not until ive done justice to whats in front of me he sat and hauled over the plate of gem scones i havent had a gem scone since i was six mrs gray youre a gem yourself get on with you the woman said beaming and for some inexplicable reason molly suddenly felt like weeping she didnt feel like a realtor here she felt like an angel of fate putting this farm together with the man who was meant to call it home and putting jackson alongsidealongside sam and her the thought made her catch her breath in sudden panic jackson looked up from his gem scone and his eyes met mollys and held weve found a friend for lionel sam announced unaware of the emotional currents running deep between man and woman molly tried to move her gaze but couldnt it was like a magnetic pull a vast magnetic pull forfor lionel the words had to be dragged out my frog sam said with patience and molly nodded of course she knew that it was just that she was being temporarily distracted she thought wildly jackson was munching his gem scone as he watched her his shirt was undone down to the fourth button there was dark hair wisping on his chest his grey eyes were deep and fathomless and faintly questioningas if he didnt know what was going on eitherand the sight of him lionel right lionel concentrate on the frog youve found a friend for lionel she lifted a slice of swiss roll to hide her confusion took a bite and promptly choked jackson grinned rose and came around to thump her on the backwhich did exactly nothing for her equilibrium the rat it was as if he knew how much he was unsettling her mr gray took me down to the dam at the back of the house sam told her his smallboy patience tested to the limit by these stupid adults mr gray says lionels a green tree frog or a litlitoria something and hes a boy and we searched and searched and we found a girl frog a girl green tree frog mr gray says we should keep the lady frog until lionels better so he wont be lonely and then we should bring them both back here so they can have tadpoles and live happily ever after thats all at once molly was close to tears again this man this place the whole damned package thats wonderful but but what somehow she made herself think it through and found a flaw i dont think youll be coming here again she said gently and watched a mulish expression settle on her nephews face of course i will mr and mrs gray are my friends and mr baird will buy the farm and hes my friend too sam i tell you what jackson said watching the interplay between woman and child with interest dispassionate interest he told himself but he was starting to wonder if he knew what the word dispassionate meant if you dont come back what if i make a special trip to release mr and mrs frog mollys jaw dropped about a foot youd make a special tripto release two frogs her voice was about an octave too high theyre special frogs jackson said equitably and didnt you know the frog population is endangered worldwide any small mite i can do to help their numbers rise you know you stand in real danger of losing your reputation she retorted and his eyes quizzed hers with mocking laughter whatas a womaniser she frowned him down on that one i mean as a ruthless businessman he was still laughing so i can keep being a womaniser you can keep being whatever you want she pushed herself to her feet there were undercurrents here that she didnt understand in the least and she was almost being swept out of her depth those laughing eyes were dangerous womaniser yes and yes and yes she had to preserve her dignityand sanityat all costs im taking a bath she told him he rose as well and grinned me too heck she was feeling so darn crowded she didnt know what to think i dare say there are two bathrooms there are four doreen said promptly and molly managed a smile there you go then she managed to smile sweetly at him businesswoman dismissing client nicely and i dare say you need to spend some time with gregor and the farm books before dinner he did damnably he did i thought you might like to take a barbecue to the beach for dinner doreen volunteered being as its such a lovely evening im sure mr baird will be far too busy too busy for a barbecue on the beach jackson interrupted and shook his head his eyes glinting a challenge at her never shall we meet here again in he glanced at his watch in two hours miss farr it was as if he was asking her for a date his eyes were challenging gently mocking and it took all her selfcontrol to keep a straight face fine you dont sound excited im excited she said through clenched teeth im so excited i can hardly speak very good he reached out and touched her cheek with his fingera feather toucha tease and no moreand it had no business to pack the electric charge that it did you stay excited then miss farr until dinner yeah right what else was she supposed to do time out that was what this was molly thought as she lay neckdeep in bath suds sam had no intention of being dislodged from the kitchenhed decided the elderly grays were the nearest thing to heaven that a small boy could imagine and they in turn thought sam was the cats pyjamas for sam and the grays it had been love at first sight molly thought reflectively she wiped a soap bubble off her nose and thought what about her love at first sight hardly what was she thinking of shed only known the man for two days oh for heavens sakeshe wasnt in love she wasnt sure he was dropdead gorgeous and he certainly seemed to be turning on the charmturning it up to full throttlebut the man was an international jetsetter and hed been seen with more gorgeous women than she could count but he was kind and people could change just because hed dated some of the worlds most glamorous women it didnt mean that he had to marry someone like that hold on just a second she told herself abruptly where was she going here marry she was living in a soap bubble she told herself and grinned held her nose and sank right under the water and dont come up til youve seen sense she told herselfonly to emerge spluttering thirty seconds later knowing that she wasnt seeing sense at all this might be a soap bubble she was indulging in but it was a very nice soap bubble youre being stupid hes dangerous she warned herself he could be fun and heaven knows you need a bit of fun after sarahs death and michaels treachery lifes been too bleak lately the more daring part of her argued and if he breaks your heart questioned the cautious part he can only break your heart if you give it to him for the breaking and youre not a fool enjoy this molly farr and then move on hmm itd be walking a very fine line she thought to let herself enjoy his company and relax and have fun then walk away at the end heartwhole and fancyfree but she must the man was a client yes and its back to business from now on she muttered one kiss does not a relationship make but one kiss did make for interestand she was definitely interested and jackson he sat with gregor and went through the farm figures but only half his mind was on what he was doingwhich was very unusual for him usually where business was concerned his mind was like a steel trap letting nothing escape now the figures looked good he thought very good he knew he could do what he wanted with this farm but if gregor had wanted to pull the wool over his eyes then maybe hed have let it happen because half his mind was on molly half well maybe more than half why and that was the major question he didnt know sure she was attractive sure she had a gorgeous chucklebut hed been with some of the most beautiful women in the world and beside them molly didnt rate or didnt she she certainly had something and when hed kissed her that something had nearly blown him apart but hed been blown apart before almost and he had no intention of letting it happen again he told himself determinedly he had the life he wantedand he had no room in that life for a frogloving realtor and her kid theyd need things he had no intentionno capabilityof giving mr gray mr baird sam stood in the doorway his frog box clutched to his stomach and both men looked around yes said gregor and smiledan old man smile that made sam relax a bit and edge into the room he talked to gregor but his eyes slid sideways to jackson if mr baird buys the farm will he keep the frogs here safe of course i will jackson said nettled and sam cast him a doubtful look as if there was no of course about it mrs gray says the prettiest place on the farm is the frog dambut she said the last people mrs copeland thought about selling the farm to wanted to make the dam a whole lot bigger they had surveyors and everything and miss copeland got so angry she decided not to sell mrs gray said she was so relieved that she cried he fixed jackson with a look but that was five years ago now so me and mrs gray want to know so hannah had thought about selling the place before had she jackson thought trying to make sense of this a gap of five years between tries though meant she was hardly rushing her sale and enlarging the dam that made sense too the house dam was small and if there was a hot summer then water would have to be pumped from the lower levels thatd be expensive but hed been thrown a challenge and sam was still watching do you think miss copeland wouldnt want me to buy the farm if i want to enlarge the dam mrs gray says the frogs would die she said the bulldozer would take out all the reeds and without the reeds they couldnt breed they were measuring each other upjackson and samwith gregor a spectator at the side do you think i should buy the farm jackson asked and sam considered yes mrs gray thinks youd be good but were both worried about the frogs so so make us a promise about the frogs and buy the farm and he made a decision figures or not sense or not okay he said i will he says hes going to buy the farm molly was still nosedeep in bath suds but sam wasnt waiting this news was too important and he burst into the bathroom almost shouting hes going to save the frogs and live here for ever and ever did he say that molly sat up and grabbed her towel the bath suds were making her decent but only just luckily sam had no concept of her as a womanhe thought of her only as his aunty molly he didnt even notice that apart from suds she was stark naked yes are you sure he definitely promised sam was standing in the doorway still clutching his frog box and now he raised his voice to call someone in the distance to mollys horror it was jackson mr baird come and tell aunty molly that youre buying the farm no sam no molly gasped and tried to tell him to close the doorbut it was too late jackson must have been walking down the passage as sam had called now he appeared above sam so man and child were framed in the bathroom door both gazing at her with very different levels of interest jacksons gaze found her under the soap suds and his grey eyes glinted with wicked laughter but his voice when he finally spoke was deadpan miss farr i believe id like to formally let it be known that id like to buy the farm he said molly took a deep breath and took a firmer grasp on her towel it was covering the important bitsjustwhich left her free to concentrate on what had to be the major issue here a sale you mean it why wouldnt i mean it you agree to the asking price she wasnt letting a bit of false modesty get in the way of a sale and jacksons laughter deepened yes you want to stand up and shake on it in your dreams she glared at him you realise i dont have miss copelands conditions yet neither do i and of course its dependent on those but i gather there are frogs she looked uncertainly at jackson and then at sam do you know what hes talking about she demanded of her nephew i know miss copeland cares about frogs sam told her and mr baird says hell save the frogs oh for heavens sake she was trying to keep a grip on the situation and they were discussing frogs she was trying to sound businesslike which for a girl who was depending on soap suds was rather tricky right but lets assume there are to be other stipulations i need to find out she chanced another uncertain look at jackson she was very much at a disadvantage hererealtor in bathtub realtor stark naked but if she was out of control jackson was very much in controland enjoying himself hugely so what are you waiting for he was cordiality itself he folded his arms and leaned against the doorjamb his eyes gleaming sitting round in bathtubs when you could be wrapping up a sale go away go away his eyebrows hit his hairline you want me to tell trevor that when i asked to sign a contract you told me to go away i dont have the contract in the bathroom with me she was fighting for her dignity for all she was worth you sure you dont have it hidden on your person that was a bit much the man had no shame itd be pretty soggy if it was she retorted and he grinnedand kept right on grinning he put a hand on sams shoulder they stood man and boy laughing down at her and mollys insides twisted as they hadnt been twisted for a long long time sam was leaning back into the man behind him and the little boy seemed to be relishing the hand on his shoulderthe intimacy of his aunt in the bath and this man taking a proprietary role this man was exactly what sam needed molly thought and then she thought this man is exactly what i need you know those suds are disappearing jackson said kindly you must have been using soap bath foam always disappears when you use soap molly gave a squeak of indignation and clutched at her towel as if her life depended on it she could use another six inches of towelling here badly sam take mr baird out and close the door after you were comfortable here sam said he grinned and his aunt moaned sam dont you dare turn into another machiavellian male before my eyes i depend on you thats why were staying jackson grinned because you depend on us i dont depend on you you hear that sam and thats about a man shes hoping to make a sale to get out molly was caught between laughter and exasperation and something else jackson was engendering a feeling she hadnt known she was capable of the way he held sam the way he laughed down at her get out she said again and her eyes locked on his and held a message passed between them a message no it was more than that it was a forging of a link molly thought faintly and that link she didnt fully understand but it was a link for all that strong and warm and get out she said again but this time it was more than that get outand she wasnt just talking about leaving the bathroom this man was starting to alarm her starting ha and jackson he stood staring down at her for a long minute and very gradually the laughter died from his eyes finally he nodded and it was as if hed come to a decision right he said we know when were not wanted and he turned and walked back down the passage without a backward glance by the time shed dressed and dried her hair she almost had herself under control almost molly was badly flustered and it showed she blew dry her hair and didnt concentrate so she had to do it againit was that or wear an unruly mop for dinner even when she wet and reblew it her curls still flew everywhere no matter it didnt matter did it no she dressed in jeans and a clean shirt then changed her mind and donned a skirtthen went back to jeans by the time she finished she was thoroughly disconcerted and sam was asking questions why is it taking you so long dont you know mr baird is waiting it was exactly because mr baird was waiting that she was taking so long molly thought she gave her curls a last despairing brush and headed for the kitchen sam skipping by her side because yes mr baird was waiting to her dismay doreen and gregor had no intention of joining them for their barbecue gregor hates sand doreen told them casting an affectionate glance at her husband youd think after forty years of living at the beach hed grow accustomed to it ill never get accustomed to sand gregor said morosely foul stuff gets everywhere you even find it between your toes dont you like sand between your toes sam asked his eyes falling to gregors severely laced boots the vision of gregors old toes was somehow fascinating and repelling all at once dont tell me you do gregor demanded well theres no accounting for taste but thats why doreens packed you a hamper of everything you might fancy to eat on sand while i eat my dinner at the kitchen table like a gentleman and that was that they were it seemed dining on the beach alone just molly and jackson and sam great thought molly andhelp but the setting itself was magic at any other time molly would have loved it the sun was sinking over the mountains the surf was rolling in long low swells onto the wide ribbon of beach and the sand was still warm from the heat of the day gregor had been down before them and had lit a fire main course is a nice piece of beef ive buried in the coals and theres spuds down there as well he told them just dig when you get hungry or eat the rest of their food they could certainly do that the appetisers alone would have satisfied even the hungriest of diners doreen had done them proud they unpacked onto the picnic rug and discovered prawns on ice and scallops and oysters in their shells there were tiny sausage rolls still warm delicate sandwiches asparagus chicken and avocado smoked salmon and the sweets and this after morning tea lunch and afternoon tea the grays must think we starve in our other lives molly said awed and jackson grinned and reached for a prawn whos complaining sausage roll sam lemonade champagne miss farr theres four different types of wine molly was practically dumbfounded how did they do this mrs gray rang up some people while you were out today sam told her they delivered stuff they certainly must have youll have to push me home in a wheelbarrow if i wrap myself round this lot she shook her head as jackson offered her wine ill have lemonade please youre not scared things might get out of control he asked gently teasing and she flushed no but im careful because of my reputation i hardly think youll try a spot of seduction with sam here molly snapped and she got what she asked for whats seduction asked sam making ladies kiss you when they should know better she told him her response was out before she could stop herself and there was a crack of laughter from jackson that means your aunty molly would really really like to kiss me but she thinks shes too respectable is that why she changed three times before she decided what to wear tonight sam asked interested in this weird adult behaviour and molly was torn between embarrassment and laughter suddenly laughter won well why not it was either laugh or blush to the roots of her hair and jackson had the upper hand already hand me a sausage roll she told sam im missing out on valuable eating time talking about stupid things like kissing i thought girls liked kissing sam was looking from jackson to molly and back again trying to figure things out for himself you mean you dont want to kiss each other what kiss mr baird why on earth would i want to kiss mr baird sam thought that one through and found it a reasonable question well i wouldnt want to but some people might kissings dangerous youve read your fairy stories jackson could turn into a frog or a prince not a prince molly said decisively millionaires dont turn into princes they always turn into frogs its in the rules but we like frogs a frog called jackson i dont think so and besides itd be a toad thanks very much jackson said drily youre welcome molly gave him her sweetest smile now sam i suggest we shut up and eat otherwise we might go hungry what with all this and afternoon tea was so puny molly agreed mournfully im starving to my socks sam gave up the kissing issue as a bad job and giggled a cheerful small boy sound that added to the impression of magic that was all around them hed laughed so little since his parents died and here he was wolfing down sausage rolls and spreading his toes in the sandand leaning back against jackson for heavens sake almost as if he belonged there me too he said cheerfully munching his fourth sausage roll and giving a direct lie to his statement mr baird are you starving to your socks deeper jackson said with aplomb im starving to my toenails chapter six it was a magic meal a magic night they ate their fill and then took sam down for a paddle in the shallows the child had spent very little time at the beach in his life despite jacksons reassuring presence he was still wary of the water so jackson and molly held him between them and did onetwothreejumps over the waves until they were all exhausted and wet why didnt we wear our bathers molly demanded as they paused for breath look at us sam youre wet up to your neck speaking of swimmingsam how do you feel about having a shot at real swimming tomorrow jackson asked him adult to adult id be pleased to show you how molly held her breath as sam perused jacksons face but what he saw there seemed to reassure him that would be good that would be good understatement of the year molly let her breath out in a rush and felt like singing or dancing or or she knew what she let out a war whoop of triumph and did a pirouette in the shallows spinning round and round and round while jackson and sam looked on as if shed lost her marbles you know she doesnt look like any businesswoman ive ever met jackson told sam gravely and sam nodded shes not really a businesswoman shes just my aunty molly and that felt good too molly thought my aunty molly it was a claim of ownership and sam had never made that before either she whooped across to him seized him in her arms and spun him round with her until they were both dizzy and sank laughing in the shallows then they looked up to find jackson with a very strange expression on his face one molly couldnt read at all what she said crossly and he caught himself and managed a grin nothing i was just thinking dont tell me you were thinking how unsuitable i am to sell you a farm not at all he said and his grin deepened what i was really thinking was that if we tried i bet we could make the worlds biggest sandcastle how about making a frogright here on the beach a frog sam was sitting on his aunts knee while the waves washed over him flushed and happy and game how do you make a frog out of sand watch and help ive been involved in several great construction companies in my time how about if i declare us the molly sam jackson construction company ltd and we start building forthwith and they did an hour later there was a frog four feet wide and almost as high sitting up on his haunches regarding them all with froglike eyes made of shells and the blandest of seaweedy smiles he looks like he wants to eat us all for breakfast molly said sitting back and admiring her handiwork oh jackson hes wonderful it wasnt just the frog that was wonderful she thought dazed with happiness it was the whole night sam was by her side and she sank back on the sand and let him fall into the crook of her arm the little boy was close to sleep he was happier on this night than hed been since the night his parents had been killed and he was smiling up at them through closing eyes as the day drifted lazily into dreamtime whatll we call him he murmured and molly hugged him closer how about lionel two she suggested and jackson laughed great here we have the beginning of a frog dynasty called lionel and mr baird it was all sam could do to speak his lids were closing regardless but there was still urgency you will teach me to swim tomorrow i will teach you to swim tomorrow jackson told him and stooped to place a hand on the little boys face gently he closed his eyes now go to sleep young man your aunt and i will clean up here and then carry you up to your bed but sam was no longer listening sam was asleep already it was just plain magic and there was no disputing it in scotland they called this the gloaming molly said softly watching the sleeping child beside her she was sleepy herselfwarm and tired and happy as she hadnt been warm and tired and happy for years the gloaming jackson paused from packing to look a question its the magic time between the ending of the days work and the time for rest she told him its when the world pauses for breath and waits it doesnt know what its waiting for but anything can happen in the gloaming its full of promise for tomorrow and tomorrow after that she was talking nonsense she thought her eyes resting on the sleeping sam he was curled against her on the rug his dark lashes fluttering down under his too heavy glasses and his hand clutching a fistful of seashells she loved this little boy so much the gloamingthis magic time of daywas a time of healing for sam and for herself definitely for herself she looked up and found jackson watching her and the expression in his eyes took her breath away wed best get back to the house she murmured but the expression on his face made molly falter he was looking at her as if he couldnt believe what he was seeing but finally he found his voice he knelt and his hand came out to touch sams hair poor little tyke its so damned unfairthat hes lost so much his sympathy touched her as nothing else could it is she managed a smile but hes had a wonderful daythanks to you and thanks to you hes safe now his time of desperate sadness is past hell move on how do you know i watched him tonight he was letting go trusting placing bets on the world again and finding it not too bad a place after all i hope so im sure of it and as if propelled by forces out of his control he put out a hand and traced her cheekbone from her eyelids to the corner of her chin where a tiny dimple peeped she didnt move she sat still as stone willing it to happen it was the gloaming the magic time what happened now wouldnt be taken forward what happened now was for now molly she looked wonderingly into his face her eyes a question mmm he didnt know what to say and when he found something it was inadequate far too inadequate youre beautiful she grinned well i guess thats quite a compliment coming from you whats that supposed to mean i mean youve been photographed with some of the worlds loveliest women youre just as lovely yes she managed to keep smiling but heaven knew it was hard somehow she forced a joke gregor wouldnt agree theres sand between my toes mr baird sand he chuckled but he didnt move he stayed kneeling before her taking in the sight of her her smile the way the child nestled in beside her hell he wanted to be part of this he thought suddenly molly was faced with such a burden he could help do you need anything he asked and molly frowned what do you mean i mean he hesitated maybe it was the wrong thing to say but it needed to be said i mean financially a flicker of anger built from within this was such a wondrous timehow dared he spoil it by talking about money she shook her head aware that the magic was fading no thank you very much but youve helped enough youve given us today and youre giving sam tomorrow she hesitated you do intend to keep your promise to teach him to swim ill keep my promise well there you go she smiled thats enough so thank you but after that youll let me help youre going overseas she reminded him youre not much help there but financially i could help again the anger was he obtuse i told you i dont need money well what do you need the man was totally insensitive what did she need what a questionwhen more and more she was starting to think what she needed was kneeling right in front of her but he couldnt know that he couldnt see how vulnerable she really was i need friends she muttered and then she softened i cant be more specific than that but thats what i do needand sam needs friends too people wholl be there for us she gave him a rueful smile not people who jet around the world and are only in australia one month in twelve if that friends he could do friends even if it was only for a month then maybe i could see you again when im in the country sam would like that she met his eyes and her expression was a challenge but we wont count on it you promised sam youd take him swimming and its importantmore important than you knowthat you keep that promise and you said youd bring his frogs back here and thats important too but apart from thatplease dont make promises you cant keep mr baird jackson he growled and she nodded okay jackson but please leave you alone is that what youre asking i dont know but suddenly she did know this man had the capacity to tilt her world and the last six months had seen her world tilted quite enough so there was only one way to answer him yes they stared at each other for a long long minute she wasnt just asking for sam jackson thought she was asking for herself dont offer what you cant follow though with dont play with us dont break our hearts damn and she was looking at him as if he had the capacity to do just that it unmanned him it made him want to make all sorts of rash promises promises she knew already that he couldnt keep but still she watched him the sun had slipped below the horizon and the moon wasnt yet up the soft rosecoloured hues of the horizon were playing over the beach shifting the colour of the sand reflecting in the enormity of mollys eyes she was so beautiful he couldnt help himself just once he thought and he leant and took her face in his hands and kissed her well why not the child was deeply asleep on the rug beside them there was noone but this man and this woman and what harm was there in a kiss none but if the kiss was a seal on a promise and that was what it felt like it was a promise half made and now met headon two halves of a whole meeting and merging and becoming their rightful one this was their second kiss the first had been a kiss of triumphof warmth and laughter and joy this took it further this was no light kiss between a man and a woman with common cause for joy this was a kiss that took one man and joined him to one woman for ever for the heat that flooded through them was unimagineda heat that neither had experienced before it felt so right so much a part of them because it was what both had been searching for for life but neither had known until this moment the kiss deepened and deepened again they were kneeling on the sand the sleeping child beside them the waves were washing in and out unnoticed but forming a glorious backdrop for their passion the moon was just above the horizon setting its silver ribbon of light across the surfaimed just at them as a blessing his hands held her close exploring her body feeling the softness and the yielding wonder of her his mouth tasted her savoured her gloried in her and for molly after that first moment of shock as his mouth met hers she knew that this was where she wanted to be for the rest of her life that whatever this man asked of her she was prepared to give because in a sense shed given already shed given her heart he was so large and so male the feel of his fingers in her hair sent heat surging right through her body she gloried in him her tongue tasted him needed him took him and when his hands slipped down the soft cotton of her bra and caressed the soft curves of her breasts it was as much as she could do not to groan with pleasure dear heaven oh love her fingers moved to slip inside his shirt so she could feel the nakedness of his chest feel his nipples feel the muscles across his chest and the way his whole body was taut with desire taut with desire for her oh love this couldnt last she knew it couldnt jackson baird was right out of her league but for now he was kissing her and she wanted nothing more all she wanted was that this wonder flooding through them both should be allowed to run its own sweet courseto take them where it willed within the kiss itself neither could break the moment mollys face was in jacksons hands again and her sweetness was threatening to engulf him her joy her love of life her laughterdamn even her efficiency all of her all of her was in this kiss and hed never felt anything so wonderful in his life her body was pliant in his hands her sweetness was in his heart she was a world away from anyone hed ever met she was molly he wanted her so badly he felt his body stiffen with desire and gave an almost audible groan some things werent possible not here not now even if hed brought precautions there was the child to consider as if on cue sam stirred between them and sighed in his sleep not much but enough it was enough to break the linkto let reality glimmer in and with reality came confusion they were left staring at each other in the waxing moonlight neither knowing where to take this neither understanding what had happened only knowing that it had happened and life itself had somehow been transformed the silence lasted into the stillness as the moon rose over the clouds and burst forth in all its glory the glimmer of silver became a shaft of glorious shimmering wonderthey were on a knifeedge and it could go either way but in the end sense won of course sense won when had it not imim sorry jackson murmured into the stillness and he somehow broke away to stand apart from her it had needed only that for molly to haul herself togetherto banish the confusion she was feeling and replace the sensation with anger sorry you hardly seduced me she muttered and pulled backwards gathering sam into her arms as though the sleeping child was a shield it was one kissand i kissed you right back one kiss does not a relationship make her tone said and jackson took a deep breath and thought shes right there were so many other factors at play here this was not sensible it was not even possible his future was mapped out sensible and settled just him and his halfsister against the world give me sam he stooped and lifted the child from her using the movement to pull himself together then he stood cradling the little boy to him and looking down at molly as she hauled their picnic stuff together she wasnt looking at him maybe she couldnt time to go home he said softly and she shoved the last things in the picnic hamper and rose she was angry but it was impossible for him to tell if she was angry with him or with herself yes she said briefly its time to go home its been a wonderful night apart from the past few moments she muttered and they were just plain stupid just plain stupid jackson lay awake into the night and thought about those words just plain stupid she was right he thought it was stupid because they were worlds apart why the question hammered him in the dark why was it so impossible because she didnt understand understand what understand him hell he should have had more sense than to ever let a relationship get this far he told himself savagely in the dark unbidden a vision of his parents came into his mindhis parents as he remembered them best hed been about four at the time and it was the same sort of ugliness that had dogged him all through his childhood thered never been any doubt that his parents loved each other but theyd seemed intent on destroying each other from the time he could first remember so their relationship had been a series of tumultuous merges theyd come together with mutual need and their love would hold them for maybe a day maybe not even for that long then the tempers would flare again with jackson caught in the middle hed been used as a tool a weapon you love me most dont you jackson his mother would demand of him and his father would grasp his hand and try and drag him away the boy wants to be with me the boy hadnt wanted to be anywhere and the boy whod become a man was just the same if that was love he wanted no part of it you dont recover from that sort of damage jackson thought bleakly how could he ever admit to himself that he could love like that it wasnt a wonderful emotion you could sink into it left you exposed to pain and then more pain after that and then thered been diane and that had hurt still more so now he was solitary and he liked it that way his father had walked out for the final time when he was ten years old and his mother had punished him the bestor the worstway she could think of shed had an affair that had resulted in caraand when that hadnt been enough for her shed driven herself furiously into a tree because of love love could go take a hike he told himself into the night hed take care of cara and no one else he wanted no emotional dependence ever mr baird is nice sam murmured sleepily to molly as she tucked him into bed his arms came up to claim her for a goodnight kiss such a gesture was unusual to say the least and molly sat down on the bed and hugged him back yes sam he is nice he kissed you so sam hadnt been soundly asleep there was no sense in denying it he did and sam was off and running do you think he might like us enough to marry you hey she laughed but her laugh was decidedly hollow weve only known the man since yesterday but he is nice hes very nice but the mans a millionaire sam the likes of him dont look at the likes of us why not hell marry someone of his own class thats silly he was drifting into sleep but refusing to be shifted from his lovely fantasy and whats class its like the case of cinderella and the prince she told him rumpling his hair and removing his glasses to lay them on the bedside table the way i see it it would have been pretty uncomfortable to be cinderella why because shed have had to say thank you for the rest of her life and she wouldnt have liked it maybe cinderella could have got a job like lots of married ladies do like you he giggled cinderella could have sold palaces for a living she grinned at the image oh sure and shed sell glass slippers on the side youre letting your commercial ventures run away with you kiddo she kissed him soundly nowsleep young man but what about you and mr baird you know theres about as much chance of me kissing your frog lionel and having him turn into a handsome prince as there is of me kissing jackson baird and having him propose marriage sam liked that he chuckled sleepily and turned towards his frog box lionel might like it if you kissed him and after mr gray went to all that trouble to find a mrs lionel for him molly rose and grinned mrs lionel might have something to say to any frogkissing i might like to do youre funny no the smile died from her eyes as she stooped to tuck his covers closer just sensible someone has to be miss copeland after a sleepless night molly rose early to catch the elderly lady at home from what she knew of old ladies shed be more likely to find her alert at breakfast than at midnight and frankly she hadnt had herself enough in control to phone last night she was right in her guesswork hannah copeland answered on the first ring and sounded wide awake yes dear i was hoping youd call molly had talked to her briefly on friday night so the elderly landowner knew what to expect does he like my farm he wants to buy oh i am pleased thats very nice dear is three million too much its a very reasonable price to be honest you could ask more if you were willing to subdivide no dear i do not want to subdivide its just the place is really worth much more are you sure you want to sell to the right buyeryes i am and you think jackson baird is the right buyer there was a pause on the other end of the line as if the lady was considering how much it was wise to tell finally she decided to be frank my mother was a friend of jackson bairds grandmother she told her she was so worried about jackson has he turned out well dear molly blinked iyes i guess you could say hes turned out very well hes not married umno i didnt expect he would be after those awful parents she paused as molly waited but my mother and his grandmother worried so much about him and i know theyd approve of me doing this miss copeland i dont think jackson baird needs any favours molly said bluntly the mans extremely wealthy she hesitated but the silence on the end of the line told her to move on so she did you did say on friday that if he was interested there were a couple of stipulations youd make yes the grays being one of them you guessed her pleasure sounded down the line of course id never want gregor or doreen to have to move im sure jackson will agree to that and i trust you you have a lovely voice mrs gray says you have a little boy doreen rang you yesterday you dont mind that i brought sam of course i dont mind dear the place needs children id rather hoped that despite his parents example mr baird might have a wife himself do you think hes the marrying kind whew molly shook her head at that one i can hardly ask him she said frankly dont tell me you want to make that a condition of sale no but she sounded wistful im no matchmaker but i do want my farm to go to someone wholl love it as i have there was a pause then id like to meet jackson in person im sure we can arrange that and i want to meet you will you bring him to lunch with me on monday i think my boss no you molly thought that through fine if that was what it took to get a sale ill check with jackson now can i bring the contract to lunch bring whatever you want the old ladys smile sounded down the phone but dont book anything else for the afternoon i like long lunches molly had a very long shower and when she met jackson over the breakfast table she was formality itself good morning how did you sleep hed decided on formality as well but now it was pushed on him he didnt like it very much two could play at this game fine thank you and you like a top she lied wheres sam he ate at dawn with mr gray she told him it seems they had an assignation the frog croaking just before sunrise is truly wonderful gregors told him that there are ten different species to be listened to fantastic it is fantastic she was prattling like a fool and serving herself far too much from the feast filling the kitchen table ive rung miss copeland my you have been busy its my job to be busy of course dont you want to hear what she had to say she poured a glass of orange juice so fast she spilled it oh for heavens sake she was acting like a schoolgirl i do want to hear what she has to say he sank courteously into a chair and waited for her to recover she says shell sellas long as you keep doreen and gregor on and you meet her for lunch on monday and you turn out to be a nice person a nice person he raised a quizzical eyebrow she didnt elaborate she shrugged it seems money itself isnt the aim of the exercise i have a feeling if she doesnt like youor even if she doesnt like methen shell pull out of the sale so its up to the pair of us to define nice she already had she was staring at her plateat anything rather than him but he was looking straight at her considering you know it is underpriced thats hardly the line of an eager buyer she concentrated again on her orange juiceconcentrated really really hard she didnt want this man to be nice she thought she wanted the ruthless businessman shed heard of ruthless she could cope with for some reason nice made her want to weep then sam yelled from outside the window and stomped in to find them molly was almost glad of the interruption we counted eleven different frog calls mr gray says hes hard pushed to tell the difference but hes got a recording thatll tell us in the library he says its time for breakfast and then we can go swimming can we go swimming mr baird jacksons eyes met mollys and he smiledshe was way out of her depth all over again and she stayed out of her depth all day and it was some daya day full of jackson she watched him swim with her small nephew she watched him patiently take sam step by step through the early stages of swimming as if he had all the time in the world and this was the most important thing he could do with his time she watched him laugh with triumph as sam conquered floating and she watched his eyes swing up the beach to find her the message they held was pure unadulterated delight he could as well have been a child himself where was the ruthless businessman now she watched him towel sam dry and tow the sleepy little boy back to the farmhouse and she watched him devour another of doreens enormous meals and compliment her then share a joke with gregor and and twist each and every one of them round his little finger she thought the mans charm had them all in thrall there was a side to jackson that she hadnt seen she thought desperately there must be he hadnt gained his fearsome reputation for nothing so beware but her heart wasnt being the least fearful her heart wasnt being the least bit sensible her heart was falling head over heels in love with jackson baird chapter seven francis mr baird roger francis answered on the first ring and his tension was palpable whats the decision no decision yet the property is just what ive been looking for but im required to meet the owner it seems the old ladys only selling if she approves of me and if she approves of the selling agent shes set up a lunch for us both tomorrow and if things dont go well then ill be back looking at the blue mountain property again and it may well happen as i said she seems just as interested in her saleswoman as she is in me she sounds a real eccentricbut then at her age and with her degree of wealth i guess its her prerogative sure but roger didnt sound sure he sounded tense as hell well it was late on sunday night jackson thought maybe hed interrupted something important but the man was on his payroll he was paid to be on call at all hours and he hardly ever earned his keep and there was something jackson wanted him to do you want me to check the titles umno then what i want you to check the saleswoman pardon molly farr jackson hesitated knowing he was stepping over the line of reasonable business practice but he guessed she was in financial trouble and he wanted to know how badly i want a bit of background briefing he told him in a hurry molly michael molly love what on earth was he on about molly had barely walked in the door before the phone had started to ring and when shed recognised her exfiancés voice shed come close to dropping the receiver i cant believe im hearing this what did you call me molly we need to talk somethings come up there was only one answer to that talk to whoever you like just dont talk to me slam cara jackson love i wasnt expecting another call so soon cara i need to tell you about this property its fantastic if we can get it then i think its just what weve been looking for thats marvellous she hesitated is anything wrong what should be wrong i dont know you sound sort of absent i am in australia that must be it are you willing to come and see itbefore i sign on the dotted line another hesitation darling i am busy and australias so far he let his irritation show through at that well im busy too but this is for long term cara if you cant put in a bit of effort okay okay ill make time if its important it is roger its michael mmm its not going to work she wont have a bar of me chapter eight michaels odd phone call from out of the blue had done little to settle her mood it was strange molly thought until friday shed thought of michael a dozen times a day shed been desperate for him to explain the unexplainable now it was as if he had simply ceased to exist and it wasnt michael who was doing the unsettling jackson had seen them into a taxi at the airport until tomorrow hed told her and hed placed a finger on her lips as a farewell gesture sleep well the pressure of his touch had stayed with her as shed slammed the phone down on michael it had been with her as shed put sam to bed it was with her still and when her doorbell pealed she drifted towards it as if she was almost floating this night seemed so magical anything could happen but it wasnt jackson of course it wasnt jackson angela was on her doorstep as shed promised she would bean angela with crimson spots burning on her cheeks her eyes bright with laughter and mock indignation will you look at this she demanded the minute molly opened the door she stalked inside and held up a newspaper oh and i had such wonderful plans i what molly stood back to let her friend stalk past angela it seemed was in the mood for stalking the mans not what he seems he got all my hopes up here i was planning weddings and honeymoons and limousines and mansionsand look the mans spoken for molly thought that through but she was confused um guys spoken for it seemed crazy as if angela glowered and then managed a rueful smile not that it wouldnt be a very good thing if guy found another that man you know what he wore to his roaring twenties party a dinner suit a dinner suit i ask you when i went to so much trouble and the man wouldnt even wear white shoes and now this now what angela was waving her newspaper like a flag and molly couldnt see a thing if youre not planning yours whose wedding were you planning yours of course with jackson baird angela moaned and now he has some woman called cara silence she shouldnt mind molly thought abstractedly and in a way she didnt she felt disassociated adrift as if she was someone else as if this conversation had nothing to do with her can i see she said at last and angela cast her an odd glance angelas face was still flushed with mock indignation but it was fading and she was starting to watch molly carefully her friends reaction wasnt what shed expected this was meant to be a jokebut there was no laughter here this was suddenly serious page three and molly read rumour has it that jackson baird is spending the weekend assessing one of new south wales foremost pastoral properties with the intention of purchasing it as his base in australia baird known until now for inhabiting expensive penthouses is in the market for a rural property to share with cara lyons international model and renowned horsewoman more news as it comes to hand watch this space the fink angela said but her fire had died she was watching molly very cautiously indeed theres no reason why hes a fink the man has a perfect right to share his property with whoever he likes but not to tell us its hardly in the sales contract its none of our business no but angelas eyes narrowed you lookdifferent did you get close to the man uhyes angelas bubble of laughter had disappeared completely did he kiss you molly fumbled with the buttons of her bathrobe he might have then at angelas indignant gasp she managed a smile well why not id imagine hes kissed thousands of women and a little thing like another woman shouldnt stand in his way i guess not but it hurt it hurt far more than she thought possible youre nuts im a businesswoman molly managed for heavens sake i dont know what youre carrying on about anything between us is out of the question yet still he kissed you angela took a deep breath molly id just die to be kissed by a hunk like that im almost sure you wouldnt and im sure i would the firmness of angelas tone was startling and molly steadied okay she had problems but there was more to this than met the eye and concentrating on angela meant that she could stop concentrating on jackson she steered her friend into a lounge chair problems with guy huh nothing that a little affair with jackson baird couldnt sort out angela said bitterlyand then almost longingly did you kiss him back its none of your business but wouldnt it be wonderful she sighed again and decided to change tack you made the sale i made the sale does trevor know i rang him before we left birraginbil hell be over the moon but angela was clearly not thinking about trevors commission are you seeing him again who trevor you know very well who i mean tomorrow for lunch oh moll with the property owner and according to this maybe even with someone called cara molly looked at caras photograph under the newsprint and thought wow and then how could i ever compete with someone like this she couldnt it was as simple as that but angela was still on track oh a sigh of disappointment but then well thats something you can work on it from there and hes leaving for the states on tuesdaythats the day after tomorrow so work fast will you cut it out but you kissed him i dont think even marriage vows will stop jackson kissing women molly snapped the mans seriously seriously seriously gorgeous there shed said it she plonked herself down on the chair opposite angela and spread her hands in a plea help she said help help im in trouble trouble angela said cautiously what sort of trouble ive been stupid like like i think ive fallen head over heels in love she told her friend bluntly she had to tell someone or shed go mad or maybe she was mad anyway i know im nuts im stark staring nuts she said and i have as much chance of attracting the man as flying but there it is oh molly and hes not even sensible like your guy is hes way out of my league hes you know sensible is not all that terrific angela interrupted flatly i think unsensible has a whole heap going for it not when hes committed to someone else we dont know how committed theyre buying a farm together there is that got any ideas im thinking angela shook her head in bewilderment what with your playboy jackson and my boring guy im thinking so hard im threatening to burst why dont they teach us this stuff in property sales school how to avoid accountants and ensnare rich clients ensnare rich clients with no strings attached its not possible we could try she cast molly a helpless glance you could try tomorrow yeah right so tomorrow i see him and i know full well hes committed to another woman you think i should sweep him off his feet he cant be all that committed if hes kissing you but angela didnt sound convinced attached enough to be buying a farm for them to share and dont forget im not exactly footloose and fancyfree myself im encumbered with one small boy yet youre in love there was only one answer to that yes im in love boy youre in deeper trouble than i am or just as much angela glared down at her diamond and suddenly tugged it from her finger put it on the coffee table and regarded it with loathing there theres two of us in trouble now talk about sisterhood but if youre unhappy then im unhappy guys the most boring man on earth and im not putting that ring back on til he does something outrageous like what likelike kissing me like he really means it like wearing braces that dont match his tie like not tying his shoelaces with the knots his grandmother taught him or wearing black shoes with brown trousers or not putting every penny he earns into sensible investments or trading in his boring car for a honeymoon in the bahamas i dont know anything unless its predictable its not going to happen molly told her and they sat and stared at each other in increasing misery what we need here is something for really desperate people angela said at last coming to a decision because someone had to she rose and tossed her keys onto the sideboard im off to the supermarket and im walking because just thinking about what im going to buy will put me over the legal alcohol limit what are you going to buy irish cream tia maria ice cream and an industrial sized packet of tim tams her friend told her that should fix all the men in our lives properly molly opened one eye and shut it again firmly mistake she thought big mistake on a scale of one to ten it fell off the counter molly it was sam he was bending over her lifting an eyelid are you in there no she groaned and he chuckled yes you are angela was asleep in the lounge room she told me she wasnt in there either but she is really and you havent washed your dishes theres empty ice cream tubs which i dont think is fair because i didnt eat any but you havent finished all the tim tams so i ate seven for breakfast he burped a very satisfactory small boy burp and grinned and now were going to be late oh help molly lifted one eyelid a fraction of an inch and checked the time and yelped late shed be lucky to be on time for the afternoon shift and sam should be at school what sort of a responsible guardian was she anyway but this was the first time hed been late in the six months shed been taking care of him maybe it wasnt a hanging offence she groaned and eyed her nephew with caution sam do you suppose you could work really really hard and still be a brain surgeon if i declare this morning a holiday sam considered his grin growing broader where had this grin come from molly thought shaken out of her bleariness by its intensity on friday it had been as if his face would crack if he smiled now the grins were coming fast and furious why is it a holiday he asked and molly sought for inspiration its national frog day she said promptly and his lovely giggle filled her room you are silly yeah and im also risking being sacked though i have just made the worlds biggest sale she sat up and rubbed her eyes sorry pet have you been awake for long mr baird woke me up mr baird the doorbell went and i opened it he told her hes here and hes brought a froghouse in bits we have to build it its in the lounge room angela was there but when i said come in to mr baird she went yikes and shes now in my bedroom in my bed with the bedcovers drawn up over her head do you think mr baird will give me another swimming lesson i doubt it the temptation to join angela was almost overwhelming umis mr baird still here of course he is with his present the froghouse legs are in bits on the lounge room floor and ive been helping him read the instructions we want to know where to put it cos mr baird says hes blowed if hes moving it after its assembled so he said id better wake you up hangover or not he peered closely at his dishevelled aunt thats what he said have you got a hangover no yes molly was staring at her nephew as if hed grown horns hes out there now yes tell him to go away tell him yourself the voice was deep and growly and wonderfully familiarand it made molly jump a foot she swivelled to find jackson standing in the doorway and by his unholy grin she knew he was enjoying himself very much indeed but why youd want to i dont know what are you doing here thats not a nice way to greet a guest especially a guest whos brought a gift what gift i told you hes brought us a froghouse sam explained as if she was being deliberately obtuse its the hugest fishpond but were not filling it all with water its set up so theres ponds and a waterfall and rocks for them to lie on but we cant get the legs together guy says the book of instructions reads like were building the taj mahal guy what on earth was angelas fiancé doing here hi guy said over jacksons shoulder and mollys jaw dropped somewhere round her waist guy thats me the man managed a smile but only just does angela know youre here she was practically squeaking yes but shes locked the bedroom door he told her and he sounded bewildered she was mad at me because i wouldnt wear white shoes white shoes for heavens sake then when i started talking about our wedding and said we needed to have my sisters as bridesmaids and maybe it was time we found a nice house in the suburbs she started burbling about elopements and purple warehouses and i couldnt make head nor tail of it she walked out on me ive been looking for her all weekend and sam says shes here but she wont talk to me molly why is her engagement ring on the coffee table rather than on her finger it was too much for molly i dont know go away the lot of you she was clutching her sheet and thinking her bathrobe was too far away to reach we had a big night then did we jackson asked he was leaning against the doorjamb his arms crossed over his chest in a pose that was starting to seem dangerously familiar he sounded full of commiseration but his wide smile was filled with laughter you especially she flashed at him get out of my bedroom now she doesnt want us jacksons big hand dropped to sams shoulder in a gesture so familiar it had mollys heart doing backflips sam boy were being rejected at least she hasnt taken your ring off guy told him as lugubrious as a bloodhound on a bad day and jackson nodded there is that i guess i should be grateful for small mercies molly where do you want us to put your froghouse i dont want a froghouse molly practically yelled molly sam said shocked of course you want a froghouse jackson told her you cant keep using the bathroom floor someones going to step on one or his eyes glinted with laughter they might hop down the toilet have you thought of that oh for heavens sake itd be an environmental nightmare if they reached the sewerage system if only hed stop laughing she gritted her teeth in fact she gritted every bone in her body and refused to respond to that gorgeous wicked laughter go away or ill scream why will you scream sam asked interested and molly almost groaned how on earth was she going to get out of this one but jackson relented laughing he took sams handand there went mollys insides again in their familiar lurchand drew him out of the room he propelled guy with him we men will be out in the living room when youre up to receiving visitors he told her still laughing meanwhile samunless youd like to see your aunty molly have an apoplexy which i admit is a very interesting prospect but maybe risky for all concernedwed better vamoose vamoose leave your aunty molly to recover angie no answer angela molly had hauled on a wrap and pulled a comb through her curlsshe was now almost respectablebut she wanted support if she was to go into that living room supper last night had been angelas idea so angela could help her face the consequences angie the two bedrooms were off a central passage leading to the living room as she tried angelas door molly was acutely aware of the silence and she just knew everyone was listening she twiddled the doorknob and found it locked come on out i refuse to face this lot by myself nothing ill fix you angela was sleepingsleepinghain sams room and the door had a child lock on it that was it could be locked but in an emergency molly could slip a nail file or a pair of scissors into the tiny slot and and the door opened first go but inside there was no angela there was only an empty bed and a wide open window with drapes blowing outward with a sinking heart molly peered outin time to see her friend hiking off down the street as fast as her legs could carry her she was wearing her miniskirt of the night before buttoning her blouse as she went and carrying her stilettos under one arm dont do this to me she yelled to angies retreating back but just then a taxi pulled up and angela clambered in with the speed of light there was a wave of a frantic hand and the taxi headed out of sight her friend had left her without a backward glance oh angela you fink and then she turned and faced the living room door help sink or swim there was no choice she went to face the music alone it was far easier to concentrate on guy than it was to even think about jackson jackson and sam were surrounded by construction plans but guy was standing by the coffee table staring down at the ring as if it meant the end of the world as he knew it hell he lifted the ring and stared down at it then peered down the passage is angie still there molly shook her head shes gone guy sighed his big shoulders slumping he might be a very boring accountant molly thought but right at this minute she felt sorry for him he stood in his blue pinstripe suit with matching waistcoat looking the very epitome of a successful accountantand he looked as if hed lost the world maybe you should go after her she suggested she wont let me into her apartment i was practically sure she was home but she hasnt been answering her door all weekend molly thought that through and nodded but an idea was forming you know guy you may well have an advantage she motioned to the keys on the sideboard those are angies keys guy stared her keys theyre her car keys and her apartment keys she left here with nothing she managed a smile so shes in trouble her handbags also still here and shes caught a taxi she wont have the money to pay and she wont be able to get into her apartment guy if you were intent on doing a spot of rescuing nows the time to do it guy thought this through his accountants mind adding it all up but it didnt compute behind him jackson had ceased reading plans and was watching waiting i dont understand she smiled at him guy do you need to understand to be a hero silence finally he lifted the engagement ring and squared his shouldersthen glanced to the construction site if you can do without me well manage without you jackson said magnanimously he cast molly a curious look no keys and no money angies needs sound a lot more dire than ours and guy molly said gently and he paused hand on the doorknob yes if you want my advice youd think about the desirability of elopement youd cut back on bridesmaids youd buy yourself a pair of white shoes and youd stop on the way and buy out a florist he thought that through you mean buy her a bunch of flowers the man was thick as sams frogs no guy i do not mean a bunch what angela needs is a statement you need to buy a carload of flowers or a truckload for that matter what why she sighed guy shes left her jacket here and its cold shell be sitting on the landing feeling bereft and sorry for herself what was she doing molly thought this had to be one of the most magnanimous gestures of her adult life angie had done the dirty on her she didnt deserve help like this nevertheless what she needs is a hero on a white charger she told him or her wonderful guy loaded with so many flowers that shes blanketed with them it seems a bit excessive he said cautiously and molly almost brained him with a leg of the froghouse fine then be boring see where that gets you you really think that would work i really think so he sighed and spread his hands ill do it great oh and guy yes try to let her think that it was all your ideaand if anyone in this room ever tells her it wasnt then ill personally nail them to the floor by their toenails umright she grinned and flipped the door open for him go for it kid james bond to the rescue oh and mr bond jackson pushed himself to his feet and grinned at guy and then at sam young sam here is in his school uniform he addressed sam whod been fiddling with the aluminium legs does wearing your uniform signify you should be in school sam i ought to be sam told him truthfully but it doesnt matter if im late cos i promised molly i can still be a brain surgeon and molly said its national frog day not many men could take that on board as quickly as jackson but he did it without a blink national frog day an eyebrow quirked upward very original but sam brain surgery takes real application and you cant start too young do you have everything ready for school yes sam admitted reluctantly but we havent finished the froghouse ill finish the froghouse guy how do you feel about giving sam a ride to school on your way to rescue your damsel but you know he said gently molly has given you the means to do the rescuing you do owe her and guy relented boring or not he really was a very nice man he sighed sure of course i can thats fine sam if its okay with you thats great jackson beamed at this very satisfactory outcome for all concerned and swung the door wide off you go then children drive carefully off to learn to be a brain surgeon and rescue maidens in distress what better way to face the world which left guy and sam disappearing hopefully out through the door and jackson firmly closing the door behind them and turning to face molly chapter nine silence the silence went on and on let the floor open up and swallow me molly pleaded to someone who obviously wasnt listening how can i be stuck alone with him thank you for the froghouse she managed at last but theres no need for you to stay on the contrary theres every need were going out for lunch and we havent finished building i can put it together myself she swallowed and fought for some dignity thank you for giving it to sam im sure hell appreciate it and you wont yes she snapped abandoning dignity forthwith youre putting it in front of the television great i like watching a tank of frogs instead of television i knew you would he grinned you look that sort of girl you have no idea of what sort of girl i am now thats where youre wrong he told her his voice growing serious because ive got it figured i dont want to hear but he was brooking no interruption talking almost to himself youre the sort of girl whod drop everything when her nephews orphaneddrop the life you lovecome to a city that you hate put up with your nerdy cousin and put your life on hold for my nephew she snapped and a great guardian i make i dont think i slept in today i drank too much last night and i didnt even get sam to school on time social welfare would have a fieldday so how many times have you drunk too much since sam was orphaned just last night then stop the selfblame anyone could see you had an excuse last night it doesnt take an einstein to figure out what happened angela arrived having broken off her engagement you were keeping her company his mouth quirked in laughter berating men in general he looked at her his eyes searching and seeing maybe more than she wanted him to and now angela bolts leaving you to face the music yet you do your best to repair her relationship her mans off to buy the city out of flowers she let herself get distracted do you think he will if he doesnt hes a fool youve handed him his salvation on a platterand considering the fact that angela did the dirty on you id call it a very generous salvation at that he grinned and motioned to the sideboard pity about the keys the keys mollys gaze swung to the sideboard where he was pointing oh for heavens sake guy had left the keys behind you saw you let him go lets just say i didnt think angela should be let off scotfree silence again molly tried a glower but it didnt come off he was smiling at her and his smile was enough to unwoman her completely it made her want to melt melting was hardly appropriate its stupid she said inconsequentially to no one in particular its not angela im mad at youre the one whos the rat im a rat those mobile eyebrows rose how can i be a rat im buying a farm from you and i saved your job and i brought you a froghouse she took a deep breath searching for the words and in the end only three would do you kissed me there the thing was said it hung between them a bald statement of fact with nowhere to go i kissed you his smile faded he eyed her warily and molly thoughtnot for the first timea scanty bathwrap with moonbeams all over it was hardly the most dignified covering for the discussion she was having no matter she forged on with resolution yes does kissing you make me a rat there was only one answer to that when youre committed to another woman it does he thought that through the newspaper he thought hell shed seen it should he deny it his gut instinct was to do just that but then hadnt he and cara agreed never to be in danger of love so maybe it was safer to let molly think he was involved elsewhere then hed be protected from just what was threatening you mean cara who else do you think i mean how many significant women do you have silence then you think i was being unfaithful here we go molly thought this mans morals were about as divorced from hers as they could possibly be he had no idea that hed done anything remotely questionable in his eyes molly was a woman therefore she was available to be kissed it was as simple as that we hardly forged a relationship he said and she nodded expecting little else no then whats the big deal nothing she was glaring at him with every ounce of glare in her possession so why are you mad lets just say i feel sorry for cara and leave it at that more silence it stretched on and on then are you intending to come to lunch in that with a polite motion to her bathrobe and molly glared some more no then may i suggest you get yourself dressed while i finish the froghouse i dont want to come to lunch with me i can see that his tone was polite now businesslike and aloof nothing more but theres no choicefor both of us so id suggest you come down off your high horse haul yourself back into business mode and come out to lunch now and without another word he turned his attention back to construction leaving molly to react as she would after all it had nothing to do with him only it did molly left him alone thumping back to her bedroom and slamming the door behind her left to his own devices jackson manoeuvred the froghouse legs into position and started tightening screws it was a fiddly job and required concentration and concentration was what he didnt have had he started a relationship by kissing molly the question didnt arise he thought or it hadnt until now so what had happened very little he told himself molly was a beautiful and desirable woman theyd shared a wonderful day it had seemed right at the time so hed kissed her as simple as that only it wasnt damn it was how she made him feel hed never felt this way before he thought suddenly hed kissed many women but he hadnt known he could feel like this like what as if she needed defending and he wanted to be the one who did the defending as if he wanted to share in watching these crazy frogs jump around their tankas long as molly was by his side to share in the watching as if he wanted to kiss her again that was the nub of the matter but since diane relationships were off the cards except for cara and the relationship he had with his halfsister was of course completely different she of all people understood why hed vowed never to fall in love with anyone againbut cara was in switzerland now living her own life she wouldnt appreciate him interfering in her affairsplaying the protective brother but if someone touched molly the thought brought him up with a jolt if he thought anyone was likely to lay a finger on molly hurt her no not just hurt her it wasnt only a feeling of protectiveness that was consuming him it was the thought of anyone elseany manlooking at her with desire because she was whew where were his thoughts taking him the stupid froghouse leg wouldnt fit and he swore get this tank up get this lunch over and get out of here he told himself harshly you need to clear your head and being around this woman you want to be around this woman the other half of him argued you dont he was so confused all he knew was that he made a very bad liar he couldnt even lie to himself and molly she was dressing herself in the most severe outfit she owned black black and more black and no makeup not a scrap what was she doing she dressed and then stared into the mirror for a very long time anyone would think you were scared of jackson baird she told her reflection and stared for a while longer finally she gave a little nod and the corners of her mouth twitched into a grimace anyone would be exactly right there was the small matter of completing the froghouse but theyd run out of time i think i must need a different sort of screwdriver jackson confessed these plans look like theyre written in swahili then he checked out mollys black trousers black jacket and black shoes and his frown deepened in disapproval plus i was hoping for someone to help me lift it into place but the only thing you look like lifting is a coffin his eyes raked her from head to toe disapproval growing by the minute ive seen pallbearers look more cheerful than you she hmmphed at that im dressed for business and the fact that i need a lift to get this tank on its legs your four legs arent together yet she pointed out plus i need time to think about where to put it it cant stay in front of the television what about in front of the bar will that be a problem she managed a sortof smile her head was aching from the night before she was confused and tired and the last thing she wanted to be thinking about was the bar or its contents only if angela breaks up with another fiancé she said ruefully and he smiled in sympathy not a big drinker then miss farr the bars hardly been touched since my brotherinlaws death she told him and then wished she hadnt as his eyes warmed with still more sympathy the last thing she needed from this man was sympathy she didnt need anything from him at all but he was still in sympathy mode you havent thought of ripping the bar out of changing the apartment so its more yours and sams rather than sams parents she thought that through but didnt understand the froghouse is doing that no he considered but he knew he was right sams belongings may well have arrived when his parents were alive he let his gaze drift around the place taking it in all the photos here are of his parents and of sams life before their death all the personal stuff theres not a lot of molly farr in this place at all its sams home its your home too sam needs memories of his parents she bit her lip heaven knows theyll fade soon enough its natural that they should he said gently he crossed to a shelf where a row of trophies stood golf trophies and netball trophies and sailing trophies and junior chess tournament certificates theres a whole familys achievements herebut where are yours i dont count you do count he frowned for sam you count very much when you were a kid what were you winning not much cowriding competitions that brought a reluctant chuckle i wouldnt think so then what nothing she met his gaze and held it but still his eyes probed were going to be late for lunch no we have time what i didnt there must be something some memory of childhood that means a lot to you something you achieved she sighed and let herself think about it i guessknots knots whatever hed been expecting it wasnt that i talked my way into joining the boy scouts she told him my first merit certificate was in knots and i caught the bug her voice tailed off surely he couldnt be interested but it seemed he was he was fascinated a junior molly as a boy scout the idea was fascinating he could see her now so then what happened you dont want to know try me she hesitated and then shrugged why not it was ridiculous but the man was a client she told herself so she should treat him as a client it was her job to keep him happy up to a point just a minute then and a moment later she was scrambling around the back of her wardrobe her personal stuff was shoved behind suitcases abandoned to neglectas shed abandoned her old life if he was really interested frame after frame was stacked neatly in the dark she lifted the top three and carried them out here were her knots every knot she knew was represented in these frames shed tied them with care with love and with increasing skill here were farm knots shipping knots plainly functional knots and fancy decorative ones every conceivable way to join two pieces of rope was displayed in these frames they were labelled with names and often had a tiny history written underneath shed started her frames when she was nine years old and the last knot had been tied two weeks before her sister died they were part of the molly that was she carried them out and handed them over to jackson in silenceand why it felt as if she was handing over a piece of herself she didnt know he took them from her and stared down at them for a long long time his eyes took in the care the love and the knowledge these are fantastic he told her and she flushed yes but theyre part of a past life theyre part of you and sam should see that he lifted the top one and set it up carefully behind the netball trophies they should be hung you should have a feature wall of them she shook her head i dont want to make sams life different sams life is different not any more than i can help he stood looking down at her for a moment and then the corners of his mouth twitched into a smile that was almost selfmocking youre quite a woman that was a good one yeah and youre quite a man but now we need to go to lunch so we do he said slowly but the way he was speaking made her think it wasnt just lunch he was thinking of so we do hannah copeland was a bright little sparrow of a woman she was knotted with age and arthritis but her eyes were still alive with intelligence she met them in one of sydneys most exclusive restaurants and proceeded to treat the placeand the staffas if she owned it were in my usual alcove she told them i come here every monday regardless its my personal contribution to improving the worlds economy very generous molly said and she chuckled thats what i think dear she peered up at jackson and you youre as wealthy as croesus what do you do to contribute to the worlds fast lane buy expensive farms he said and her lined face lit with laughter very good her keen eyes narrowed but i dont believe in sleeping money will you keep my farm running as it should be run you dont just want it as a tax dodge i hope itd be a very expensive tax dodge jackson told her helping her into her seat with care you never know these days she settled herself down and surveyed her guest with complacency isnt this nice then she peered more closely at molly and at her dour outfit youre not in mourning are you dear shes in business jackson said dryly and you dont mix business with pleasure never molly told them she lifted the menu looked at the prices and gulped she was way out of her league here andmixing business with pleasure did that mean she couldnt savour this extraordinary selection did you have a nice time at my farm hannah asked and molly smiled that at least was easy yes thank you doreen tells me the three of you got on like a house on fire you and jackson and the little boy theres no relationship molly told her hastily i only met jackson on friday but you like each other we like each other jackson said and molly stifled a protest okay for the durationand for the salethey liked each other there was a lull while they ordered molly thought of what she was eating in terms of how many normal meals she could buy and was silently having kittensbut she didnt let on hannah was still concentrating on jackson when the entrees arrived which was just as well it let molly concentrate on food she intended to savour every gorgeous mouthful then youre engaged hannah demanded of jackson and he frowned while molly forgot all about concentrating on food where did you hear that i read my papers dear tell me about your cara the frown stayed shes not my cara so youre not engaged no he said flatly and molly dropped her knife youre kidding she managed im not kidding he told her and smiledand she dropped her knife all over again i thought cara and i are happy as we are he told hannah and hannah blinked and then speared a prawn as if it was an enemy i dont approve of that kind of relationship she said i like marriages in my world marriages seldom last long promises last she snapped if you mean them have you made this cara any promises he concentrated on his food for a little it was well worth concentrating on molly thought their prawns were coated in some sort of tempura batter tasting vaguely of coconut and served with a dipping sauce of chilli and lime the prawns tasted as if theyd been out of the sea all of two minutes but still jackson had all her attention i think my relationships are my business he said eventually i want my farm to go to good hands i understand that i dont need to sell i understand that too whoops thought molly there goes trevors commission if he was here hed have a heart attack miss copeland she said carefully feeling as if she was treading through minefields you did say that there were only two conditions did i say that another prawn was speared and the old lady popped it into her mouth and glared at the two of them then ive changed my mind im not signing this afternoon can i ask why not jackson was courtesy itself he obviously didnt have to face trevor molly thought uh oh but hannah was concentrating on the pair whod own her farm i want to meet this cara its me whos buying the farm jackson said bluntly not cara but shell be living there hannah told him no yes eventually and the papers say its cara whos interested in horses my horses my horses are included in the sale and i want to know whos buying them fair enough jackson nodded but itll be three weeks before im back in the country again and youll bring this cara with you if i can find out the old lady snapped these modern arrangements she snorted she looked at molly and her gimlet eyes bored right through her are you engaged or married umno and you dont have one of these fancy arrangements no but you do have your nephew doreen told me about him a moments silence while she considered then youll be needing a man then the boy needs a father molly gave a faint smile i think we can manage without her smile deepened men are impossible they are at that but hannah didnt smile and her eyes didnt leave mollys i never married didnt see the point never met anyone who could make my heart slam against a brick wall you ever met anyone like that ino liar hannah said without rancour i can read it in your face you let everything out with a face like that really really some man has treated you like dirt am i right hey im not even buying your farm molly told her so mind my own business the old lady grinned you get as old as i am without a family to concern you and the worlds your business you have a good heart girl she looked more closely at molly this man here hasnt been messing with it has he no molly practically yelled a hush had chosen just that moment to fall over the restaurant and her no echoed out over the other diners heads turned she blushed do you think we can get back to business no hannah told her cheerfully this lunch isnt about business its all about getting to know you getting to know jackson molly corrected her and hannah sighed and smiled maybe i havent made my mind up yet are you getting cold feet with the main course over hannah took herself to the powder room leaving molly and jackson together to her surprise jackson had decided to be cheerful about the inquisition hed answered hannahs questions about his background and more and more molly found he was turning the tables on the old lady hannah had ended up talking about herself and her love of her farm shone through im not getting cold feet he told her the more i hear about the farm the more i want it you know id be surprised if hannah lets go entirely doreen and gregor may not be the only elderly retainers youre left with you think hannah will visit if you make her welcome silence while he thought about it was he thinking hed hate itor that cara would hate it molly didnt know his face was impassive a shiver ran through her he saw it and was instantly concerned cold no she shrugged nothing a ghost walked over my grave somethings worrying you no but his concern made her want to shiver all over again she did feel cold forlorn bereft which was utterly ridiculous hadnt she sworn off all men for ever so why did this man have the power to unnerve her molly he held out a hand across the table to her and she stared down at it it was a gesture of comfortnothing more she should reach out to take it she couldnt she sat and stared at the hand his eyes met hers and held but there was a message there that neither wanted to read or neither was brave enough to read slowly he withdrew his hand and very carefully she tucked both her hands safely under the table thank you but no she said and he hardly knew what she was refusing or did he hell he was in deep water here and he hadnt even realised hed been sliding right out of his depth the tension was broken by a yell molly the yell came from the far side of the restaurant molly swung around to find hannah returning to their tableand angela waving furiously from the restaurant entrance half the restaurant had swivelled to see angela was still wearing her miniskirt from this morning and her crazy stilettos but shed added guys pinstripe jacket for warmth her blonde curls were still tousled from sleep she was waving wildly across at her friend and she looked like someone whod come straight from a welfare sale dear heaven this was never ever going to be a professional sale molly thought despairingly and closed her eyesjust for a millisecondjust to find enough courage to open them again when she did jackson and hannah were staring in openmouthed astonishment at the vision weaving her way through the tables angela was talking full throttle before she reached them molly youll never guess whats happened dont tell me your wardrobes been eaten by silverfish and youve lost every hairbrush you own molly groaned angela for heavens sake wheres guy angela was hardly listening oh heck ive left him behind she searched backwards and found who she was looking for another cheery wave across the restaurant guy theyre over here apart from his jacket guy thankfully was staidly dressed but it was a different guy from the guy theyd seen two hours ago his beam was wide enough to split his face as he came up behind angela great i knew wed find them here ive heard on the grapevine miss copeland almost singlehandedly keeps this restaurant afloat youre so clever as he arrived at the table angela gave him a hug and guy hugged her right back molly could only stare this time last week guy would have been mortified to see angela looking like this this guy seemed not even to notice we came to fetch angelas keys guy said and molly blinked but at least she knew what was wanted you left the keys on the sideboard at mollys place jackson said blandly and guy groaned you didnt think to bring them with you to lunch jacksons blandness cracked just a little and there was a trace of laughter on his voice weerwe didnt think youd come after us he swallowed his laughter miss copeland may i introduce angela and guy angela is another realtor who works with molly and guy is her he hesitated her fiancé angela finished for him proudly and beamed and beamed she thrust out her ring finger and the diamond sparkled in all its glory i wasnt for a while but now i am again and this time its for ever guy might have forgotten the keys but he didnt forget my ring molly cast a sideways glance at hannah and found her beaming to match angela at last the old lady approved a proper relationship you dont want to buy my farm do you dears for three million guy grinned and held his love tight sorry no chance you know realtors wear the strangest clothes hannah said perusing angela from head to toe and wrinkling her already wrinkled nose one dresses for a funeral and the other dresses for for passion angela said promptly and giggled again and then she explained guy arrived with a bus she told molly a whole bus she hugged her beloved who was turning a delicate shade of gratified pink there was a florist just near the school where he dropped sam he said there wasnt room in his car for all his flowers and there were kids lining up for a school excursion so he made a practically obscene donation to their literacy programmeplus he shouted them all ice cream coneson condition that they detoured past my place he gave every kid on the bus a bunch of roses and they came up the fire stairs to deliver them good grief mollys eyes flew to guy whose pink was turning fast to crimson wow the man had improvised on her suggestion and then some she hadnt known he had it in him i was standing on the landing with a really angry taxi driver because id left my handbag at your place and all these kids filed up and handed me their roses one after another then guy got down on bended knee and asked me to marry himand the kids were watching and cheering what was a girl to do howhow special molly said and angela beamed some more it is she turned to hannah moving right on so youre miss copeland she held out her hand in greeting how do you do are you trying to shake some sense into these two sense hannah sounded totally bemused these two are made for each other angela declared but hes engaged to this other woman angela molly was on her feet enraged youre way out of line hes not engaged hannah said and molly thought please let the ground open up under me please let this be a nightmare hes not angela was brought up short she focused on jackson you mean the woman in the newspaper is not your fiancée he gave a wry smilebut he was watching molly what had angela said these two are made for each other umno thank heaven for that angela said bluntly marry molly angela oh for heavens sake jackson was halflaughing halfexasperated but molly was no such thing she was just plain appalled but hannah was listening intently do you think he should yes angie said promptly and hugged her guy close she should be as happy as i am hes never going to marry her if she wears funeral clothes hannah said and molly took a deep breath excuse me she was ignored she doesnt usually wear black angela explained she usually looks gorgeous only her sister and brotherinlaw were killed and she has to look after her little nephewwhos a real sweetie but she feels totally responsible she and her fiancé were saving for a house but when molly said she had to look after sam the creep told her the wedding was off and he had the whole deposit in his namewhich is why the first rule of buying a house is dont trust anybodyand dont ask me why molly trusted the creep but there it is and now hes got her money and she has nothing and then she took her first breath for about three minutes and it was a long one along comes jackson jackson hannah repeated faintly and angela pounced shes nutty about him angela declared and molly felt herself sliding under the table she held onto the edge and managed to stay upright but it was a near thing and he kissed her shes nutty about him jackson turned to stare at mollys blenched white face put that on the backburner his brain told him concentrate on practicalities how many people know that i kissed you he demanded and hannah chortled and answered for her the entire restaurant at least it wasnt an understatement the whole restaurant had hushed to a deathly silence and angela had the floor anyway its true angela flushed slightly and sounded defensive but still she continued molly came home after the weekend lit up like a christmas candle and its the nicest thing thats happened to her since the loathsome michael and now theres this stupid newspaper article her eyes narrowed on jackson but youre not engaged no and i dont believe the paper did say i was engaged then this cara is none of your business jackson closed his eyes for a brief respite and then he rose with resolution things were getting entirely out of hand and he wanted time to think i need to go miss copeland if youre not prepared to sell me the property oh i am hannahs eyes were alight with laughter but not just yet i dont like being messed with he wasnt looking at molly as he said it neither do i dear their eyes locked and molly thought shes as astute at business dealings as he is then what youre coming back from overseas in three weeks yes then ill sign in three weeks she told him down at the farm after ive met this cara i that or nothing she told him you do want to buy the property dont you he did they could all see it part of him wanted to walk away from this dealwalk away from these crazy lady realtors and from emotions he didnt know how to handle the other part knew he was getting a nevertoberepeated bargain the farm was indeed wonderful common sense won yes he snapped but ill deal through my lawyer and no one else hannah nodded but you and cara will be there in person in three weeksand ill deal through miss farr and no one else im not going back to the farm molly wailed and the attention of the entire group swivelled to her the attention of the entire restaurant swivelled to her of course youre going hannah told her and theres the little matter of releasing sams frog angela added what better reason to make another trip that was enough to sidetrack guy if no one else youre building a taj mahal of a froghouse and youre going to let the frog go guy was incredulous they wont breed in captivity molly was distracted past the point where anything was making sense she was grasping at straws and breedings important hannah approved mating relationships the whole gamut of of frog life jackson was standing gazing at the lot of them i see he shook his head enough im off me too molly said and picked up her handbag and headed for the door youll both be at the farm on saturday three weeks from now hannah demanded after he and molly paused there was a long silence if she didnt go she wouldnt have a job molly thought and jackson thought if he didnt go he wouldnt have the farm he so badly wanted yes said molly fine said jackson excellent hannah told them both and now i suggest we all settle down and have sweets the lemon tart here has to be eaten to be believed i believe ive had enough jackson retorted his eyes swung to angela tarts and all and he walked out through the door as if he was being shot from a cannon chapter ten it was nine oclock in the evening and molly hadnt yet recovered from the disastrous business lunch sam was asleep but under protest how can we have such a great froghouse and not finish it hed demanded our frogs are only here for three more weeks the way its going we wont finish until its time for them to leave yes we will molly told him staring in dismay at the instructions for frame assembly maybe they could just fill it up without putting it on legs she thought maybe she could get angela and guy to stop thinking about each other for long enough to come over maybe she could figure it out herself ha none of those solutions was remotely possible ill ring the aquarium she told him as she tucked him in theyll send someone over though itd cost her money she could ill afford mr baird said hed fix it yeah well let me tell you something have you noticed how goodlooking mr baird is umno trust me hes goodlooking and its time you took on board some sage advice young man never trust the goodlooking ones he thought that over and frowned girls too yes girls too but mostly men she thought mostly men i really thought that hed come sam said sleepily into his pillow im sad that hes so goodlooking he breaks promises and so am i molly thought back in the living room and staring at various construction bits really really sad and if i wasnt a girl with responsibilities id go find myself another tub of tia maria ice cream she stared down at sams frogs who stared back at her from their toosmall box with expressions of mutual lack of interest okay okay im useless as a builder but i make a great realtor when i go to bed ill let you guys free in the bathroom then she thought back to something jackson had said and an appalling possibility presented itself only you have to promise to leave the toilet alone even i dont think lifes that bad this statement didnt cheer the frogs up at all well why should it it certainly didnt cheer her up bed the doorbell rang and she jumped a foot itll be trevor coming to haul me over the coals she told herself hed been appalled that she hadnt finished lunch with a signed contract she swung open the door with a sigh ive come to fix your froghouse jackson told her and walked straight in to say she was shocked would be an understatement you what ive come to fix your froghouse like i promised she thought about that while he set his toolbox on the floor and rolled up the sleeves of his sweaterand somehow she made her voice work you knowwhat went on at lunchtimei sort of figured that might negate any promises i didnt promise you he told her brusquely i promised sam and ive got the right gear now he set a mansized toolbox on the floor and molly stared down stunned and impressed hey nice outfit he told her and she forgot about the toolbox and flushed scarlet she was wearing rosepink jogging pants and sweatshirt both of which had seen better days youre kidding beats the funeral clothes she glared and decided to concentrate on the toolbox it seemed safer do you know how to use that stuff sure i do but there was something about the way he said it that defied belief her lips twitched despite her shock why dont i believe that hey whats this she demanded picking up an implement of not so obvious destruction he looked superior thats a router his tone was of such confidence that she didnt believe a word what does it do it routs of course he grinned anything you want routed im your man yeah right drat the man how could he unnerve her so completely and then make her want to laugh she swallowed a giggle and tried to be serious thats the biggest set of tools ive ever seen i knew youd be impressed he told her thats why i bought it you bought a set of toolsjust for tonight theres lots to do tonight he was looking lovely she thought just lovely in his faded old jeans and a soft cashmere sweater that looked lived in and loved he didnt look like a millionaire businessman tonight he could be anyone she thought anyones boyfriend anyones lover he wasnt he was jackson baird client with his arrangement with an unknown cara and shed better remember it the froghouse shouldnt take too long she managed not with these tools but then we need to hang your frames my frames your knots he concentrated on his tools fitting a fiercelooking blade into a screwdriver handle im not going back to the states until i see your knots on the wall ive decided youve been a doormat for long enough she stared im not a doormat yes you are you sit back and let things happen to you for instance have you tried suing this michael character for the money you put into your home michaels a lawyer she told him stiffly he could beat me hands down in a legal fight and id have legal costs and he wouldnt thats what hes counting on what if i lend you my roger francis he should be nasty enough to take on any michael i dont like you dont like roger francis he grinned neither do i but the mans clever ill be willing to bet he could take on any michael you like and expect to win so the offers there why are you doing this she asked and he shook his head beats me give me a hand with these legs but the question still hung and it hung all that night they worked side by side erecting the froghouse and then filling it with water and standing it in all its glory against the bar it meant you couldnt lean against the counter but molly didnt do a lot of barleaning anyway and it was the most sensible place to put it then she watched as jackson gently released two little frogs into their new home drat the man he still had the ability to make a lump form in her throat he stood in his lovely casual clothes with the two tiny frogs nestled in the palm of his hand and he handled them with the care he might well use if they were diamonds more so jackson was a frog prince she thought inconsequentially with those two little creatures in his hand he seemed transformed himself from ruthless businessman into someone someone she could love with all her heart and with all her soul she bit her lip and jackson looked up and saw the expression on her face what nothing the frogs wouldnt jump off his hand neither would she if she was a frog she thought and then thought whoa she was being ridiculous with his spare fingers jackson was tickling the frogs smooth backs she watched as his index finger stroked each body in turn and her own body shivered the whole scene was unimaginably crazily erotic oh for heavens sake she should take a cold shower she cast jackson an angry look which he fielded as if he hadnt seen it then she reached in and moved the frogs from his palm to a midpool rock their fingers touched in the process they stood side by side staring down at the tank um you can go now molly said finally not until the knots are up still he was watching the frogs they sat side by side gazing over their new home of waterfalls and ponds and lush green foliage and molly could almost swear they were grinning theyre set for life molly gave jackson a halfhearted smile wherever she looked there were problems she thought and another problem had just raised its ugly head youve spent all this money and now guys right its silly when they go itll be empty and sam will miss them he finished for her ive been meaning to talk to you about that you have i have he grinned theres a brochure in the side of my toolbox labelled frog rescue society did you know that homeless frogs can be farmed out to foster parents until they can be released hed taken her breath away youre kidding no the foster parents can be anyone as long as theyre prepared to do a little study practise their mosquitocatching and prove theyll be good carers you mean sam and i could be foster parents you have the froghouse for it now he told her i dont see why it cant be of use hed taken her breath away sam would love it i know he said and tried to look modest and she fell in love with him all over again but she had to stay businesslike all she wanted to do was take his face in hers and kiss him to bits and make him want her she couldnt he was leaving he had another woman to love called cara you found all that out for sam she said in a choking voice and his modest look gave way to abashment yes just call me mr wonderful and then he relented actually the guy in the aquarium place told me about the rescue society he gave me the pamphlet so caring for frogs could be an ongoing experience it was just what sam needed molly thought a cause hed take it on board and hed love it thank you it was lame and she knew it but she didnt trust herself to say anything else there was a drawnout silence he was watching her she should say something else but all she could think was this man is leaving tomorrow and ill see him once more in my life and thats it it and thennothing somehow she had to sound normal sane uninvolved even wed better do these frames right he said but he was still looking at her you dont have to she said stiffly but he didnt say anything more he just crossed to the toolbox and found hooks and hammer and headed for the far wall there was nothing else to be said between them was there an hour later she had a display wall of all her knots every conceivable knot and it looked wonderful whats that one for jackson asked pointing to an obscure knot under his thumb the slingstone hitch anchoring lobster pots she told him automatically you can tie it at either the bight or the end you pull the ends and the turns in the standing section are dropped into the loops right he said faintly what knowledge just like my routing not like your routing at all she said severely and he grinned fine he laid down his hammer and surveyed the wall with satisfaction more than fine now the place isnt a relic of the past its moving into the future youll be able to discuss the slingstone hitch with anyone who comes along regardless of whether theyre for tying it at the bight or at the end his smile widened holding her touching her without touching you and sam should be right now with your frogs and your knots iyes he was right of course she should have done this before this made it home almost home was where the heart was but where was her heart now would you like some coffee before you leave he was looking at her strangely and she wanted him to stop it or did she no thank you whats times your flight tomorrow she was sounding like an inane fool but at least she was sounding it was hard to make her voice work at all early oh i should go then yes they were so close so close she could reach out and touch him reach out and take him and then what a onenight stand more of jackson being unfaithful to the unknown cara she wasnt a onenight stand sort of girl she thought numbly and she looked up to find jacksons eyes searching hers she knew he was thinking exactly what she was thinking wanting what she was wanting molly dont one more word and shed fall blindly into his arms he wasnt asking anything of her he wasnt but he just had to stand there and he was asking without words go he looked at her for a long long moment and then finally he nodded as if a decision had been made but it hadnt been easy maybe its just as well yes she snapped taut to breaking point after all there is cara there is so you shouldnt even be here now or doesnt cara mind you spending evenings with other women another moment passed then he caught himself reached into a shirt pocket and produced a card this is where you can find roger francis he told her and his voice had switched suddenly back into formality business hes expecting your call by the time i come back id hope youll have instigated legal proceedings against your michael hes not my michael well against your money he smiled and then put a finger under her chin dragging her gaze up to meet his im sorry molly sorry she took a deep breath sorry for what i think you know he shrugged and gave a derisory laugh it was directed straight at himself sorry that i have nothing more to give and he bent and kissed herhard on the moutha swift demanding kiss that asked no questions and required no response it was a kiss goodbye and then he was gone striding along the corridor and out of sight gone chapter eleven molly yes sigh what is it angela there was a long pause as angela absorbed the inflection in mollys voice then youre really mad at me right lets just say relations are strained because i was honest with jackson oh come on moll give me a break did i do real damage was the guy going to fall for you if i hadnt stuffed it up no of course he wasnt there you go then but telling the man we were made for each other was unfair i thought he should see things as they really are thanks angie i do have some pride my mum says pride and love dont go together no me and millionaires dont go together honestly angie i could have crawled under the table you havent heard from him of course i havent heard from him it would have been nice it would have beenridiculous cara jackson lovely where are you darling new york where im supposed to be i thought youd be here as well i meant to be she hesitated but ive met this man silence someone special jackson asked cautiously it seems like it she gave a slightly embarrassed laugh now youre not to laugh i know ive always sworn off men after our mothers tragic examplewell i was never interested but raoul is so different raoul hes french darling and hes just lovely hes everything our mother and your father wasnt heoh i cant explain its just everything i sort of planned has flown out the window jackson sat down heavily on the desk chair to say he was stunned was an understatement his halfsister in love thats great he managed can i meet him im aching for you to meet him oh jackson hes so special she was lit up he thought she wasin love i just wish i just wish that dreadful diane cara dont yes but i only had our appalling parents to get over its been so much worse for you she said bluntly the parents were enough like you i thought i could never marryi never wanted to go down that road but then along comes raoul and sweeps you off your feet well yes she gave an embarrassed laugh hes as different from any man ive ever met as he can be jackson do you think you can possibly learn to forget diane no just because our mother and your father theres also diane i trusted her and she was out for your money cara sighed you were just lucky you discovered in time that the child wasnt yours but you were so young jackson there are some really nice people in the world i hadnt realised just because we havent met them until now there were jackson thought there was molly but how the hell could he trust after what had happened to him it was asking far too much i guess this means youre not interested in settling in australia he asked pushing his thoughts firmly back to business well no it made sense to have a base when we didnt have anyone but jackson raoul has an apartment in paris and a property in the north of france i dont think i need a halfbrother i didnt mean that ill always want my brother but youll want your raoul more yes and i hope jackson i so hope you can find someone jackson im so happy he could feel her smile coming down the line sowill you still buy the farm he thought it through there was still the farm there was only the farm yes if i can its a great idea raoul and i intend to have children so we can come and visit and hey you can always leave it to your nieces and nephews in your will after all you can hardly leave your fortune to a lost dogs home how about a lost frogs home he thought inconsequentially and then he didnt know what to think at all molly maybe maybe he could molly are you okay hi angie sure it was just you were so distant in the office today every time there werent any clients you seemed to be out of the office it seemed like you were avoiding me yeah she was avoiding everyone is sam okay yes hes fine have you heard from jackson she let out her breath in anger for heavens sake angie will you get off your soapbox why would i have heard from jackson it had been a week an interminable week the man is buying a property from you hes dealing through his lawyer hes only coming back to sign youre seeing his lawyer the frogsquashing roger oh great how cosy angie dont so im worrying about you i have a right to worry about you stay away from francis the mans offered to help me get some money back from michael courtesy of jackson silence then so the lawyers doing you a favour i dont believe it jacksons paying him molly said quietly but this is michael were talking of does jacksons lawyer think he can get blood out of stone its unlikely molly admitted at first i didnt want anything to do with it but mr francis has convinced me that michael has something to say yeah like sorry sorry sorry dont trust him until you see the colour of his money she considered come to that dont trust roger francis either i dont trust either of them then why do this i need the money for sam you really think you might get it back i dont know whats going on molly confessed im as bewildered as you are but its sams future were speaking of at the moment i cant even afford to move him to a decent school so i can listen but you wont trust no i promise and youre accepting jacksons help in this yes it seems sensible well at least thats something angie conceded the man owes you heaps how do you figure that out he broke your heart michael broke my heart no michael broke your pride and your bank balance but not your heart you didnt look like this after you broke off with michael angie said like what like pause for thought then like a hearth without a fire that brought a reluctant chuckle oh very poetic i read it somewhere angie admitted but its apt molly you must do something i am doing something im working im caring for sam im dealing with jacksons lawyer to see if i can get some money back from michael i mean about jackson you already laid my heart on a plate for him i dont know what else can be done angie had an answer for that get on a plane and go find him oh come on even you know thats a really stupid idea yeah well angie retreated baffled desperate times call for desperate measures he who dares wins in for a penny in for a pound good grief where do you find this stuff i dont know her friend gave a theatrical sigh but the two of youit all seemed so gorgeous yeah me and a millionaire and now its me and a frog that produced a reluctant chuckle have you tried kissing lionel oh right now if you dont mind go back to guy angie i do not need this francis jacksons voice was clipped and incisive the only way to deal with his lawyer was clipped and incisive he thought maybe he should find someone else to represent him in australiabut at least roger francis was good at what he did mr baird how can i help you i was wondering whether youve been in contact yet with molly farr about the money shes owed i have that in hand you do i think it may work out very well the lawyer sounded sleek and selfsatisfied but then he always sounded sleek and selfsatisfied i found her exfiancé was having all sorts of conscience pangs about what hes done in fact hes preparing to fold his country legal practice and move to sydney why will that help molly hes interested in a reconciliation youre kidding jackson sounded stunned hes finding that hes tired of country practice hed like a base in sydney to start afresh and if he reconciled with miss farr then hed kill two birds with one stone molly would never buy it it might be in miss farrs longterm interests to do just that after all the man is a wellqualified lawyer with the potential to earn a great deal more than she could you mean youre advising her to reconcile forfor money im advising her to do what she thinks best but the prospect of getting money out of the man by legal means is slim married to him no it is sensible no silence then a cautious what would you like me to tell miss farr jackson was silenced nothing he conceded at last its none of my business another silence then do what you think best and jackson slammed down the phone hard molly michael i have nothing to say to you no dont hang up we need to talk what on earth would we have to talk about about us theres no us there might be hell molly ive been a fool criminal more like it anything you need to say to me can be said through roger francis but thats just it he suggested we meet he did yes so i thought we could do lunch tomorrow molly im paying no strings attached just come and listen to what i have to say give me one reason why i should and he had the answer pat because sam needs a family oh right honestly molly roger francis has spelled out just how much trouble youre in financially and im feeling dreadful about it i never meant well i never thought it through and i didnt realise just how damnably id miss you so i thought hey it was you who put me in trouble financially so i should help you out and in the meantime in the meantime what just come to lunch hear me out fine then one lunch and thats it molly stated finally mr baird im ringing to let you know everythings running smoothly the contract is ready for you to sign next week miss copeland will be at the farm next saturday as will miss farr and miss farr has the contract in hand thats fine francis and will sam be there sam mollys little nephew sam if shes coming id like her to bring him as well oh right roger sounded taken aback but amenable you want me to tell her shes welcome to bring her nephew yes i want you to tell her shes welcome to bring her nephew maybe she could bring her partner as well her partner i believe things are going remarkably well between miss farr and her exfiancé i saw him yesterday and hes very pleased i suspect theres no need for legal action down that road at all jackson thought that through and he didnt like it the man cheated her hes more than willing to reimburse her the lawyer said stiffly i did think that your main aim was to get miss farr out of financial trouble yes then i believe ive succeeded her ex is a sharpasnails lawyer and hell make a killing in the city all he needs is a base and a trustworthy background shell provide that its a sure thing shed be a fool not to accept and he hesitated i believe theres a degree of fondness still there your intercession on her behalf may well have given the three of them the chance to form a family fine just great so why did he suddenly feel ill was there something else no sir ill see you next week then down at the farm i wish i could say i was looking forward to it jackson replied bitterly cara jackson cara this love thing mmm cara if your raoul was engaged to be married to another womanif you thought that engagement might be a disasterwould you just walk away jackson what would you do cara were not talking about diane here i hope no were not talking about diane then who are we talking about someone called molly is she special so special i wont stand in her wayif shes engaged to someone else and thats what she wants are you sure shes engaged to someone else maybe but youll find out yes he thought it through ill find out and then i guess its up to her oh jackson dont get your hopes up he said bleakly because i havent angela molly yeah its me and im sorry its so late heck its one in the morning moll whats wrong i think you need to come around and i think you need to bring some more of that ice cream and tim tams a truckload of tim tams umany particular reason yes because i dont know what the heck is going on and i dont know what on earth im going to do chapter twelve the farm looked even more splendid than it had three weeks ago jacksons helicopter circled the boundaries to allow him to check every inch of his prospective purchase before landing it really was the loveliest place on earth all he had to do was talk hannah around sign a contract and it was his but why was he buying it because its paradise he thought but that wasnt a good enough reason not now could he use it i will he told himself i can work from here with telecommuting and teleconferencing i can spend most of my time here yeah with mr and mrs grayand a thousand frogs and maybe with molly and that was the crux of the deal he thought that was the halfformed desire he just needed to see hell he should have more sense isolation was what he did best he told himself over and over had he learned nothing nannies and boarding school and distant parents were tools for survival if he hadnt distanced himself from emotionfrom any emotionhe would have gone under as a kid his parents love had come close to suffocating him and he hadnt been able to escape then hed made that one huge mistake hed fallen for diane hed been young and hed been foolishand hed let himself love or hed thought he loved then she was pregnant great hed said and hed meant it a family for the first time in his life hed conceded such a thing was possible and the feelings hed had for the unborn child had threatened to overwhelm him but a week before the wedding thered been a note from someone warning him that he wasnt the father say a name the note had said and see how diane reacts he shouldnt have done it he should have trusted but have you heard of hed askedand all hell had broken loose stunned hed watched as the woman hed thought he loved turned into a raging virago how dared he question her how dared he imply the baby wasnt his but he hadnt implied any such thing all hed said was the name the next morning she was gone it had been a lying cheating con devised to steal money from a wealthy adolescent and that with the history of his parents failed relationship had left him determinedly single for ever cara was the only person he trusted the farm was to have been a place where they could base themselves when life got tough now the farm would be only his and the thought made him feel unbearably alone which was stupid after all hed constructed his life so hed be happy alone it had taken him thirtythree years to get this farhe didnt intend to regret it now but if molly was here waiting molly would be with michael roger francis had phoned just before jackson left new york and told him theyd be arriving separately roger was driving himself miss copeland was being driven by her chauffeur and molly and sam and michael were coming together great hell hed helped orchestrate her reconciliation with michael he thought savagely he should be pleased he was pleased he forced himself to decide sam would have a secure base a secure family but with a man whod been prepared to rob molly blind it was none of his business hadnt he learned anything from the past he looked out of the chopper and saw the eager faces of doreen and gregor waiting to greet him they were his future no one else with a sigh he summoned up a matching smile this was a great buy he should get on with it michael the road to birraginbils to the north you should have turned off back there are we going to birraginbil of course we are look in the glove compartment sweetheart i have a surprise for you a surprise an engagement ring and plans for a wedding things werent going to plan hannah copeland was receiving in state seated formally in the vast front parlour and her displeasure was obvious the moment jackson walked in so youre alone she snapped what have you done with your fiancée young man i thought i told you he said quietly crossing to shake her hand caras not my fiancée where was molly yes but shes someone you have an arrangement with i did have an arrangement with her he said honestly and watched her face her displeasure grew you mean you havent now no can i ask why not i think thats my business she rose matriarchal in her annoyance then im not prepared to sell you my property the arrangement was that id meet your intended i dont have an intended he spread his hands theres only me where the hell was molly he managed a smile and decided honesty was the best policy here his precious privacy could take a back seat hannah cara is my halfsister he told her she and i had arranged to share your farm but shes fallen in love with a frenchman so im alone i love this place and im prepared to look after it as youd want it looked after but i cant give more than that i cant claim relationships that wont happen the old lady stared at him in bewilderment and jackson thought she could decide either way but then roger francis appeared at the door what is it clearly hannah had no time for the smart lawyer and she was seriously displeased have you heard anything from miss farr wheres molly for the first time jackson voiced his thought his brows clipped together the agreement was that shed be here well before him hell if she didnt even come im sorry roger francis spread his hands in helpless anger of all the inept mr baird i cant tell you how sorry i am i should never have let you look at this property in the first place what is it your realtor has taken off for her honeymoontaking your contract and your titles with her silence the silence went on for so long that it became jarring miss copeland stared her displeasure at both of them and roger francis coughed and stole a glance out of the window avoided looking at jackson as well he might jacksons face was stony and remotelike chiselled granite what happened he asked at last and roger spoke again too fast she rang from the airport a couple of hours ago i tried to catch you before you left sydney but your mobile must have been switched off so now i have to tell you the phone call was from your miss farr she sounded giggly and apologetic and altogether too foolish for words it seems this michael arrived last night with tickets to hayman island for himself molly and the boy and plans for their marriage he wouldnt take no for an answer and as she said its not often you get an offer like that so they left so they left they were on the nine oclock flight from sydney theyd almost passed in transit jackson thought and he felt sick why because of the farm no he knew damned well that the farm didnt come into it at all and what of the contracts hannah demanded but her eyes were on jacksons face she wasnt interested in contractsor farmseither there were undercurrents here that shed have to be obtuse not to understand roger francis spread his hands i have no idea what shes done with them neither has her boss i phoned him just now he was playing golf with no idea of what had happened and the news hit him as hard as its hit me it seems she just dropped everything and went more silence thats that then hannahs voice was bleak and final no contracts no partner no miss farr it seems i cant sell you my farm even if i want to mr baird maybe when we get back to sydney we can i dont think we can jackson raked his fingers through his thick black hair and closed his eyes his voice was as bleak as midwinter hell im sorry roger said and jackson opened his eyes again and focused on his lawyer you say you spoke to her yes and she sounded happy yes sir exceedingly happy damn he swore i should have but you didnt it was hannah looking at him with open curiosity and seeing where his mind was headed how about a fast trip to hayman island id never make it in time and if she loves the man but what if she loves you she suggested gentlyand waited i dont know he groaned and then he caught himself after all hed been trained since birth to receive blows to receive hurt he knew how to handle it withdrawal it was the only way im sorry for wasting your time miss copeland he told her and his voice was now strictly formal back to business the shield had been put up again and it wasnt about to be lightly put aside but it seems the faults not entirely mine youve obviously chosen an extremely unreliable realtor to represent you you can say that again that was roger francis he eyed his employer sideways if you want a place thats just for yourself then the blue mountain property is far superior he said smoothly you know it appealed enormously before you heard about this place its only an hours drive from sydney i spoke to the owners only yesterday and your options still valid i bet it is id be happy to show it to you again we could take the chopper right now i could organise someone to fetch my car enough jackson spread his hands and stepped back enough i need time to think i have the blue mountain brochure in my briefcase roger said smoothly shall i tell the helicopter pilot youd like to leave no yes and then he paused there was the sound of a vehicle approaching from the main track it was being driven far too fast and by the sound of the engine the car had seen far too many days to be travelling at this speed all eyes were drawn to the french windows as a battered and dusty sedan drew to a halt in a screech of brakes and a cloud of dust out tumbled molly closely followed by angela and guy and sam are we too late has he gone molly burst into the room with her arms full of documents then as she saw jackson she stopped dead he took one step towards her she dropped the documents from nerveless fingers they scattered over the floor and in less than a second she was being held in his armsas if shed never be released again after that there was chaos angela and guy and sam were all crowding into the door behind molly sam was clutching his frog box as if his life depended on it but his attentionall attentionwas on molly who was sobbing her heart out on jacksons shoulder what the it was all jackson had to say i never thought hed do it molly was talking through tears into the soft linen of his shirt and he had to stoop to hear i thought he was just playing games so i figured id go along with it to see what he was up to i didnt think itd get serious and then he got really nasty and tried to hold me back and i had to fight him whoa he held her at arms length at that there was an angry bruise spreading from under her eye to her chin she looked dishevelled and tearful and angryand altogether far far too lovely slow down what happened it was michael angela burst out from behind them she pointed to the hapless roger francis and thisthis weed all attention swung to roger francis who looked suddenly pallid and smaller somehow what but angela was midtirade accepting no interruptions he rang molly and said michael wanted a reconciliationbut molly didnt believe it for a minute so then she wonderedwhy was he so pushy and why was michael so pushy as well then she figured hang on theyre practically the same age and how many law schools are there in this state so she did a searchand guess what she discovered roger and michael were in the same year at the same university studying the same subjects which doesnt mean anything roger said but he was edging towards the door molly had recovered enough to take over and then michael arrived and he was so nice her voice was faltering but she was managing to put in her bit something about the way jacksons arms were holding her was feeding her strength by the minute i smelled the biggest rat but he plied me with dinners and he gave sam gifts nothing as cool as the froghouse sam volunteered and molly managed a smile no silly overthetop presents and the more michael schmoozed up to us the more suspicious i got and then he practically insisted he bring me down here today and hes got a nice car and molly hasnt got a car at all and she didnt want to ask for a ride in your helicopter which i thought was stupid sam said scornfully you would have brought uswouldnt you mr baird yes he said promptly and his hands tightened on mollys waist she looked up at his face with an expression that said she couldnt quite believe what was happening where was cara she thought frantically concentrate on the story not on the body against hers not on the eyes looking down at her full of concern only she knew the sheer effort of will it took to continue to stop herself sinking into his embrace as if shed never let go but they were all still confused and she had to explain somehow i didnt have a clue what was happening but i talked it over with angela and we decided the only thing to do was go along with him so we duplicated the contracts and you duplicated the contracts roger franciss face was reflecting pure shock of course im not stupid so angela had the duplicate papers ready with instructions to get them down here today if anything happened no matter what we even had guy and his car on standby though she gave a rueful smile we hadnt quite counted on guy trading his sedan for honeymoon tickets and a car older than he is no matter she hauled herself back to the matter in hand then michael arrived and instead of bringing us here michael took us to the airport sam said incensed he said he was taking us on a holiday to hayman island it was the whole sweepingmeoffmyfeet routine molly said grimly and turned within the circle of jacksons arms to stare at roger francis you must think im really really dumb some girls would have accepted angela said blithely she and guy had moved as one to block the door leaving the hapless roger no escape michaels a goodlooking man and he was offering the holiday of a lifetime and marriage as if id believe him he thought you were still in love with him how could i be in love with him when i she faltered and jacksons arm tightened even further the gesture had stopped being a gesture of comfort it was a gesture of pure joy but jackson was looking at her face and joy or not his expression was grim so what happened so when he turned off the highway into the airport i told him he had to be joking and he said dont be a little fool he said she paused and then met roger franciss look headon there was hatred coming from him blinding unadulterated hatred he said we stood to make heaps from the commission on the blue mountain property he said roger was a partowner he was set to make a mint if the sale to you went ahead and if that happened then wed get a cut he said before you saw this place youd almost bought the other property and if this sale fell throughwhich it would if i messed them around and made both you and hannah angrythen wed all be laughing youd be laughing married to michael in hayman island im not completely daft she took a deep breath he couldnt even get that right he flashed the tickets at me as if thatd make it just greatbut they were singles he didnt even think id read the fine printjust blindly take him on trust as if he had every intention of taking sam and me to hayman island and dumping us there youre kidding by this time we were in the airport car park and i told him where he could put his tickets when he told me not to be stupid i grabbed sam and started to leave then he took the contracts and tore them up and he hit me shed been hit jackson turned her then twisting her in his hold so he could examine the bright angry bruise and he uttered an expletive that made molly catch her breath yes she said but she wasnt upset by the bruise the tone in her voice was one of satisfaction but it did achieve one useful purpose which was you dont think id let him hit me and get away with it do you do you have any idea how much security there is at airports these days well i screamed molly carried on considering his answer inconsequential there were loads of people about and i screamed the place down my nose started to bleed which was terrific its wonderful what a bit of blood can do for a drama and then sam headbutted him he went to slap sam and suddenly there were four hefty security guards holding him down and any number of witnesses plus a security camera weve had him arrested her voice was suddenly almost joyous hes in jail right now sure hell get bail but i have heaps of witnesses and the police say if i press charges ill certainly get a conviction plus damages her hand touched her cheek for any amount of emotional trauma youre not emotionally traumatised at all jackson said on a note of discovery and she chuckled and just naturally her arms came around and hugged him back no im just very very pleased that finally michael has blotted his tooperfect copybook theres a whole bunch of stuff a lawyer cant do once he has a conviction and i cant wait to get it in place then she lifted her chin and stared at roger so guy and angela brought us down hereventre à terre as the saying goeswhich was very exciting wasnt it sam and now i dont know how well deal with you roger but guy seems to think its illegal to try to sell your client something without disclosing ownership we might just get you too and roger was stuttering i dont i havent the girls get out jackson said grimly he was staring at roger as if he was some sort of pond scum get out i never you organised your thug to hurt molly and that was the nub of the matter everything elsethe liesthe deceptionthey were things that would make him angry but not to the point of whitehot fury he looked down at mollys face and he wanted to kill someone the problem was there was only this weaselly little man in front of him to be killed but there were better ways of punishing than murder so with what seemed an almost supernatural effort he stopped himself from picking roger francis up by the shoulders and heaving him through the french windows and made his voice cool controlled and icy calm get out francis i can explain shes mistaken for heavens sake you told me molly was leaving for hayman island you told me you spoke to her theres no explanation other than that you were acting in collusion miss copeland he turned to hannah will you be willing to back me up as witness i surely would hannah was staring at francis as if he was some particularly repugnant insect id be delighted hangings too good for the likes of him it might not come to that but what will happen will be effective for all that ill see you in court francis now get out but now for a minute after the lawyer left there was silence they listened as he gunned his car into action and headed off down the track and they waited until the sounds of his car died to silence then molly made to pull herself away from jacksons arms but was promptly pulled back again where do you think youre going ium she thought about it and came to a fast decision nowhere dead right nowhere she liked masterful men she decided happily okay michael had been masterfulhere are tickets to hayman island and youre coming with mebut there was masterful and masterful this masterful was just plain wonderful thank you for bringing her down jackson was speaking to angela and guy but molly was absorbing the soft texture of his shirt nice and the feel of his heartbeat nicer still think nothing of it guy waved an airy hand the fact that my car blew a gasket or six and angela and i missed a perfectly good day in bed guy angela gasped but guy only grinned well we did ill give you a decent car for a wedding present jackson told them and angela rolled her eyes wow thatll look good beside the casseroles and toasters but molly had hauled back stunned jackson baird do you think you can just splash your money about in that obscene hey whos complaining angela interrupted let him splash all he wants her eyes were brimming with laughter what about putting diamonds on the shopping list while youre at it molly caught her breath angie dont tell me you were about to say shut up she held her hands up in laughing protest okay i know when im butting into something that doesnt concern me angela looked down at sam sam the lionels have been in that box for far too long they have sam agreed then lets show them to their new home she took guys hand and sams hand and smiled at hannah how about it miss copeland would you like to see a frog launch and leave these two alone id be delighted hannah said and tossed aside her walking stick if what i think is about to happen is about to happen then im about to sell my farm and if im selling this place then i want to leave a healthy frog population behind lead on young sam hey id like to see the frog launch too molly said stung you want to see a frog launch or you want to spend a bit more time right where you are angie demanded choose now frog or prince whatll it be and there was only one decision to make after all prince please molly said and sealed her fate right there then finally they were alone together standing locked in each others arms so much had to be said but now wasnt the time for its saying there was only time for each other the feel of each others bodies two hearts beating as one it was a joining without words it was a feeling of such blessed peaceof rightnessof joythat molly could scarcely take it in jackson was holding her to him as if he would never let her go his hands were softly stroking the small of her back her aching face was leaning against his shoulder and his fingers came up to trace it through the tumble of her bright curls this was right this was for ever wheres cara molly whispered at some point but it no longer mattered cara no longer mattered what true love had joined let no man put asunderand true love had joined this pair as truly as any wedding vow he thought about that for a while cara and i decided living together at the farm would be crazy she pulled away from him then wanting to see his face wanting to understand why he smiled down at her with an expression on his face that made her heart do handsprings oh the joy of it the pure blessed joy ive been a fool i dont believe you then you wouldnt believe wrong molly he took her hands in his and searched for the words to explain something that he was only starting to understand now molly i had the pits of a childhood the only way i could be at peace was to institutionalise myself nannies boarding school university and corporate life those things followed rules that i could understand they made me safe so i tried to organise my personal life along the same lines cara is my halfsister she lived the same bitter life as i did with the same results whenever we showed emotional need so when life got too toughwell we were all we had cara is yourhalfsister molly drew back stunned yes and until now cara and i have been living under the same rule which is selfprotection at all costs i tried to move outside the rules once and it was a disaster he moved his lips in her hair and sighed a great sigh the sigh of a man reaching home i thought i loved someone she wanted me only for my money i was young and stupidbut it made me distrust for life only then i hadnt met you a man can be a fool she could scarcely believe what she was hearing please it was a desperate little prayer starting deep in her heart but by the feel of his hands holding her closeby the feel of his heartbeat under hersit had already been answered but now there was a kookaburra laughing outside its raucous cackle making a mockery of the two lovers but they didnt care it could just as well be a nightingale molly thought and found she wanted to pinch herself to wake up she didnt need to he was real and he was hers and his next words confirmed it but now caras met her raoul and and the whole world was holding its breath well maybe not the whole world there was one stupid kookaburrabut surely he didnt count and now ive met my molly my love my wonderful brave funny loyal tender wonderful molly and now i realise that i didnt know what the hell i was running from i thought i was running from love but until i met you i didnt know what love was weve spent three weeks apart and every moment ive missed you ive ached for you ive wanted you molly i want you to be my wife for now for always will you marry me will you marry me the kookaburra was definitely a nightingale molly thought deliriously shed have it renamed by deed poll would she marry him yes and yes and yes but there was one last thing she had to say it even though her entire futureher entire happinessrested on it jacksonwherever i go i need to take sam ihes part of me i must but it seemed that sam was no problem at all of course he is how could i expect otherwise hes the best kid and i have such plans you have such plans well move here he put a finger on her lips and shushed her as she tried to speak no listen you wanted things not to change for sam so you moved to the city but things have changed for sam like it or not i reckon he could be gloriously happy right here the local school has to be smaller and happier than the one hes in now hell be able to breed frogs hell have his own pup and help breed cattle and hell eat mrs grays pavlovas so he stops looking such a waif oh stop she was halflaughing halfcrying you make it sound so wonderful you make me want to agree just for sam you think id blackmail you no she looked lovingly up into his eyes and then laughed and changed her mind yes if you want your own way that is youll do whatever it takes i only want you she held him still their hands linked forming a perfect circle of trust and of joy really jackson really he bent forward and kissed her ever so lightly on the mouth a feather kiss a kiss of promise a kiss of joy to come and ive sorted it all out you have been busy its a long time three weeks a man does a lot of thinkingof hopingin three weeks so what have you decided they were making love with their eyes i thoughti dont have to travel so much i can mostly work from here wed be proper farmers but if you like you could set up an exclusive farm sales agency only the best she was laughing of course only the best and in our spare time we could be farmers together yeah yeah his eyes caressed her but there was still a hint of anxiety behind them an anxiety she loved he was her big handsome prince who could rule the world but when it came to his love for her he was putty in her hands she loved him so much she could hardly speak and in the end she didnt have to there was no need she placed her hands on either side of his face and she drew him down to her down to be kissed and kissed and kissed again kissed until they were both breathless with love and laughter and with pure unadulterated happiness and finally when they drew awayfor an instant onlymolly found the voice to whisper we should go down to help release the frogs youve released your frog jackson growled and hauled her ruthlessly into his arms for yet another crushing kiss hes your lover for lifeand kiss all you like hes never going to be a frog again marion lennox marion lennox was born on an australian
