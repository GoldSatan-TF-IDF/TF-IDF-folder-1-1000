james rollins subterranean for john clemens great god this is an awful place found scrawled in the journal of the failed south pole explorer robert f scott prologue mount erebus antarctica blue ice encased the continent from horizon to horizon scoured to a gritty shine by galeforce winds ripping shards across the frozen landscape nothing lived on the surface except for grimy patches of yellow lichen far older than any of the men stationed at mcmurdo base two miles below mount erebus through glacier permafrost and granite private peter wombley wiped sweat from his eyes he dreamed of the fridge in his bunkroom stocked with a case of coors this place is insane damned blizzard up top and hotter than a hookers snatch down here if you quit thinkin about it it wouldnt be so bad lieutenant brian flattery replied he loosened his hand lantern from the transport motorcycle lets go weve got three more relays to calibrate before the end of this shift peter grabbed his lantern and clicked it on spearing the cavern with a blade of light and followed hey watch your step there brian said pointing his light at a crevice in the cavern floor slipping past the black slit peter eyed it suspiciously since hed arrived three months ago he had learned a healthy respect for these honeycombed caverns he leaned over the edge and pointed his light down the crevice it seemed to go straight to the bottom of the world he shivered wondering if hell had a doorway wait up im going to proceed to the relay brian said pulling a transport sled into position at the lip of the tunnel youve got a fiveminute break until i return peter secretly sighed in relief he hated those wormholes as the troop had nicknamed the smooth undulating passages with diameters so small that a man could barely crawl through them only the motorized sleds made transport from cavern to cavern possible through the wormholes like a boy on a toboggan brian sprawled belly down on the sled head pointing toward the mouth of the tunnel he engaged the throttle the engines roar echoing off the walls doubling and tripling decibel levels with a final thumbsup brian shoved the throttle forward the sled shot into the narrow tunnel peter crouched down to watch brians departure the lights faded as the sled roared around a distant curve after a few moments more even the sound of the sled whined down to nothing peter was alone in the cavern using his lantern he checked the time brian should be back in five minutes he smiled maybe even twenty minutes if he needed to disassemble the communications relay and replace some parts that gave him more than enough time he slipped a joint from his vest pocket peter set down his lantern and rotated it for wide dispersal to illuminate the area then he leaned back against the cavern wall fished a match from his pocket and struck a flame he inhaled sharply on the narrow joint ahhh leaning his head back he savored the smoke deep in his chest suddenly the sound of scraping rock echoed across the cavern shit peter choked on the smoke and grabbed his light he searched the open space sweeping his lantern back and forth no one just an empty cavern he listened straining but heard nothing more the shadows kept jumping in the lantern light all at once it seemed a lot colder and a lot darker he glanced at his watch four minutes had passed brian should be heading back by now he stamped the joint out it was going to be a long wait brian flattery closed the panel on the side of the communications station the unit checked out fine only two more relays to check his support staff could have handled these routine tests but this was his baby the minor static was a personal affront to his expertise just a little fine tuning and everything would be perfect he crossed over to the idling sled and slipped into position he twisted the throttle into gear and ducked his head a bit as he rode into the tube like being swallowed by a serpent he thought the smooth walls flew past his head the headlamp guiding him forward after a minute the sled slipped from the tunnel into the cavern where he had left peter brian cut the engine he glanced around the cavern was empty but a familiar scent lingered marijuana goddamn it he exclaimed yanking himself from the sled he raised his voice private wombley get your ass back here on the double his words echoed off the walls there was no answer from peter searching the cavern with his lantern brian turned up nothing the two motorcycles they had used to travel here were still in place across the cave where was that bastard he marched toward the cycles his left boot slipped in a wet patch he flailed for a handhold on the walland missed with a squawk he slammed hard on his backside his lantern skittered across the cavern floor finally coming to rest with the light pointed back toward him warm moisture seeped through the seat of his khakis he ground his teeth together and swore back on his feet brian wiped the seat of his pants grimacing a certain private was going to find a foot planted three feet up his butt he went to tuck in his shirt when he noticed his dripping palms he gasped and jumped back as if he could escape from his own hands warm blood coated the palms book one teamwork one chaco canyon new mexico damned rattlers ashley carter knocked trail dirt from her boots before climbing into her rusted chevy pickup she threw her dusty cowboy hat on the seat next to her and swiped a handkerchief across her brow leaning over the gear shift she popped the glove compartment and removed the snakebite kit with a knuckle she tapped the radio static rasped from the handheld receiver humming she peeled back the wrapper from the syringe and drew the usual amount of venom antiserum by now she could gauge it by sight she shook the bottle almost empty it was time to run into albuquerque for more after cleaning her skin with an alcohol swab she jabbed the needle into her arm and winced as she administered the amber fluid loosening her tourniquet a notch she wiped iodine over the two punctures in her forearm then applied a bandage cinching her tourniquet a bit tighter she glanced at the dashboard clock ten minutes and shed loosen the tourniquet again she picked up the radio handpiece and pressed the button on its side randy come in over static as she released the button randy please pick up over her neighbor randy was still on disability from a back injury at the mine for the past ten weeks he had earned a few extra bucks under the table by supplying day care for her son jason she started the engine and pulled back onto the parallel ruts that constituted a road the radio belched a garbled blast of noise then she heard up ashley whats going on we expected you back an hour ago she raised the handpiece sorry randy found a new room in the anasazi dig hidden by a rockfall had to check it out before the light went bad but a diamondback had other ideas ive got to check in with doc marshall now be back in about an hour could you pop the lasagna in the oven over she hooked the receiver back on the radio a squelch of static a bite again this is the fourth time since christmas youre pressing your luck ash this solo venturing is going to get you killed someday but listen after you get checked up by doc marshall hurry home theres some marine types here waiting for you she furrowed her brow now what did she do she groaned and grabbed the handpiece again whats up over dknow theyre playing dumb he said then added in a lower voice and theyre damned good at it real gi joes youd hate em just what i need hows jason handling it over hes fine eating it up talking the ear off of some corporal i think he almost got the jarhead to give him his gun she smacked the steering wheel with the flat of her hand what are those bastards doing bringing guns into my home damn ill be there straightaway hold the fort im out she never carried a gun not even into the badlands of new mexico damned if she was going to allow some overgrown boys to bring weapons into her home she slammed the truck in gear her wheels clawing at loose rock ashley jumped from the truck arm tucked in a blue sling and crossed through her cacti garden hurrying toward a group of uniformed men huddled under the small green awning over her porch which offered the only shade for a hundred yards as she stomped up the wooden steps the men in front backed up except for one man who sported bronze clusters on each shoulder and stood his ground she strode right up to him who the hell do you think you are barging in here with enough arsenal to blow away a small vietnamese village i have a boy in there the officers mouth flattened to a thin line he leaned back to remove his sunglasses revealing a cold blue stare void of any emotion major michaelson maam we are escorting dr blakely she glared at him i dont know any dr blakely he knows of you maam he says youre one of the best paleoanthropologists in the country or so ive heard him tell the president the president of what he stared at her blankly the president of the united states a sandyhaired juggernaut plowing through the uniformed men covered her surprise mom youre home you gotta come see her son eyed her sling then grabbed the sleeve of her other arm cmon even though he stood only a little higher than their belt buckles he ushered the military men aside glaring she allowed herself to be dragged through the door as the screen door clapped shut behind her she headed toward the family room and noticed a leather briefcase parked on the table it wasnt hers the scent of garlic from a baking lasagna wafted toward her from the kitchen her stomach responded with a growl she hadnt eaten since breakfast randy armed with stained oven mittens was attempting to extract the bubbling lasagna without spilling it the sight of such a bear of a man dressed in an apron struggling with a pan of lasagna brought a smile to her lips he rolled his eyes at her as she opened her mouth to say hello there was a sudden urgent tugging at her arm cmon mom see what dr blakely has its bitchin watch your tongue mister she warned you know we dont allow that sort of language here now show me what this is all about she waved at randy as she was tugged toward the family room her son pointed to the briefcase and whispered its in there the sound of rushing water from the hall bathroom drew her attention the door opened and a tall black man thin as a pole and dressed in a threepiece suit entered the hallway he was older his closecropped hair graying slightly he pushed a pair of wirerim spectacles farther up the bridge of his nose spotting ashley he broke out in a sudden smile of recognition he stepped toward her quickly hand proffered professor ashley carter your picture in last years archaeology magazine failed to do you justice she knew a snow job when she heard one caked with trail dirt arm in a sling clad in mudstained jeans she was no beauty queen can the crap doc what are you doing here he dropped his hand his eyes widened a moment and then he smiled even broader he had more teeth than a shark i like your nononsense attitude he said its refreshing i have a proposal to not interested she pointed to the door you and your entourage can hit the trail now thanks anyway if youll only lis dont make me toss your butt outta here she snapped her arm toward the screen door it pays a hundred grand for two months work just get your her arm dropped to her side clearing her throat she stared at dr blakely then raised an eyebrow now im listening since her divorce she had been struggling to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads an assistant professors salary barely covered their living expenses let alone her research projects wait she started wait a minute is it legal it cant be legal i assure you dr carter this offer is legit and thats only the beginning dr blakely continued exclusive authorship of research garnered guaranteed tenure at the university of your choice she had dreams like this after too much sausageandonion pizza how can that be possible there are university statutes rules seniority how this is a project advocated by the highest people i have been given free rein to hire whomever i want at whatever salary i desire he sat down on the sofa and crossed his legs arms spread the length of the sofa and i want you why ashley questioned tentatively still suspicious leaning forward he held up a hand begging patience he reached for his briefcase and clicked it open using both hands he carefully lifted a crystal statuette from its interior he turned it upright toward her it was a human figurejudging from the pendulous breasts and gravid belly a female figure the fading light caught the crystalline structure and reflected radiant bursts he nodded for her to take it what do you think she hesitated afraid to touch its fragile beauty definitely primitive appears to be a type of fertility icon dr blakely nodded his head vigorously right right here look closer he raised the heavy statue arms shaking with the strain please examine it she reached to take the statuette its sculpted out of a single diamond he said flawless now she understood the armed escort she withdrew her hands from such a priceless object as she pondered the implications bitchin she whispered across the kitchen table ashley carter watched as dr blakely flipped the cellular phone closed and returned it to his breast pocket now professor carter where were we is anything the matter ashley asked sopping up tomato sauce from her plate with a piece of garlic toast the two of them sat at her green metal kitchen table the doctor shook his head not at all just confirming the addition of one of your potential teammates an australian caving expert he smiled reassuringly now where were we she eyed him warily who else will be joining the expedition im afraid those names are confidential but i can tell you were talking to a leading biologist in canada and a geologist from egypt and a few others ashley could tell this line of questioning was futile fine back to the diamond statue then you never told me where the artifact was discovered he pursed his lips that information is also confidential only for those involved with the research he folded the gingham napkin on his lap doctor i thought this was going to be a discussion youre rather lean on your answers perhaps but you still havent given me a concrete answer yet either are you willing to join my research team i need more details and more time to reorganize my work schedule wed take care of such minor concerns she thought of jason who was eating dinner from a rickety tray in front of the television i have my son i cant just up and leave and hes no minor concern you have an exhusband a scott vandercleve i believe jasons not staying with him forget it blakely sighed loudly then we do have a problem this point was going to be a stickler jason had been having trouble at school and this summer ashley had vowed to spend some time with him this is not up for debate she said with as much conviction as she could muster jason accompanies me or i have no choice but to decline blakely studied her silently she continued hes been on other digs with me i know he can handle this i dont think that would be prudent he smiled wanly hes a tough and resourceful kid blakely grimaced if i agree to this point then youll join the team he paused removing his glasses and rubbing at the indentations on the bridge of his nose he seemed to be thinking aloud i suppose he could stay in alpha base its secure replacing his glasses he reached across the table and held out an open palm agreed relieved she let out her breath and shook his dry hand so why so much effort to get me on your team your specialty the anthropology of cliffdwelling primitives your work on the gila dwellings was brilliant still why me there are other paleoanthropologists with similar interests several reasons onehe began ticking off the points on his fingersyouve demonstrated you can manage teams on other digs two your nose for detail is superb three your perseverance in solving mysteries is bonehard obstinate four youre in excellent physical shape five youve earned my respect any other questions satisfied for now she shook her head slightly embarrassed she fought back a blush rarely did one hear praise in her field uncomfortable she changed the tack of the conversation now that were partners maybe you can tell me where you discovered this unique artifact she rose to clear the dishes somewhere in africa id guess he smiled no in antarctica actually she glanced over her shoulder trying to judge if he was testing her there are no primitive cultures on that continent its a barren glacier blakely shrugged who said on it she rattled a dish in the sink so where then she turned to him leaned back against the sink and dried her hands with a damp dish towel he just pointed a single finger toward the floor down two black rock australia benjamin brust watched a brown cockroach skitter across the white lavatory sink he crossed over to the bars running a hand across the stubble that had grown over his cheeks since his incarceration the stink of old urine in the cell was less intense by the door a khakiuniformed military guard glanced up from the gq magazine on his lap he nodded to the guard who without acknowledgment returned to his reading at least bens client hans biederman was recuperating well thank god for that he sure as hell didnt need an involuntary manslaughter charge on top of everything else mr biederman was due to fly back to germany today having received no more than a slap on the wrist for their little escapadewhile ben as the planner of the expedition had a long stint in a military prison ahead of him for the past five years ben had specialized in escorting those with the proper ticket price to exotic locales to see rare sights trips that required bending even breaking a few rules to accomplish he specialized in underground adventures abandoned diamond mines in south africa monastic ruins buried under the himalayas undersea tunnels off the caribbean coastand now here in australia a set of stunning caverns restricted by the military from human sight the caverns were on a remote section of the black rock military installation these exquisite caves had been discovered and mapped by ben himself four years ago when he had once been stationed here it had all been going perfectly until herr biederman his pudgy german client slipped and broke his leg ben should have just left him to rot for ignoring his warning but instead ben had tried to haul the bastards sorry butt out of the caverns herr biedermans bellows of pain drew the military police and ben got caught for his efforts he turned from the bars and dropped onto the motheaten cot then leaned back studying the stains on the ceiling he heard hardheeled boots tapping down the hall and something mumbled to the guard the heavy magazine slapped on the floor in there sir fourth one down he heard the fear in the guards answer the tapping heels approached then stopped he pushed up onto his elbows to see who stood in front of the cell he recognized the face of his old commander bald head beak of a nose gray eyes that drilled colonel matson somehow i knew you would end up here always a troublemaker but the smile playing at the corner of his lips softened the gruffness how have they been treating you like its the hilton sir room service is a bit slow though isnt it always the colonel gestured to the guard to open the cell follow me sergeant brust its mr brust now sir whatever he said with a frown turning away weve got to talk the guard interrupted should i handcuff him sir ben gave colonel matson his most innocent look yeah matson said youd better theres no trusting civilians all right ben said standing at mock attention you win sergeant brust reporting for duty nodding colonel matson waved the guard away cmon then sergeant were going to my office ben followed him out of the prison and after a short drive they arrived at the administration building the colonels office had not changed same walnut desk with stained coffee mug circles walls festooned with banners from the old guard trophies lining the side wall during the ride over ben could tell from the hesitancy in an otherwise ebullient man that something of importance was being withheld the colonel ushered ben to sit then matson leaned on the edge of his desk and studied him the colonels face was stone ben tried not to squirm under his gaze finally his old commander spoke his voice tired what the hell happened to you the best of the best and you just disappear i had a better offer what guiding yuppies with midlife crises on little thrill tours i prefer to call them adventure vacations besides i earn enough to help keep my dads sheep station afloat and earned yourself a bit of a reputation quite the cave hound i read about that cavern rescue in the states big hero huh ben shrugged but thats not why you left here it was jack wasnt it bens face went cold at the mention of his friends name i believed in the guard and honor i believed in you colonel matson grimaced sometimes political pressure bends rules distorts honor bullshit ben shook his head the prime ministers son deserved every inch of the pummeling he got from jack after the shit he tried with his girl a prime minister has powerful friends it couldnt go unpunished bloody hell ben slammed his fist on the arm of his chair ida done the same his courtmartial was a travesty ben stopped swallowed hard then continued in a quieter voice jack was stripped of everything that made him a man and you wonder why i left matson sighed seemingly satisfied then the balance of fate has shifted your way this time now the political pressures are aligned to help you bens brow furrowed what do you mean i should pretend i never received this letter as much trouble as you caused you sure as hell deserve a couple years behind bars what letter a command from the home office youre to be set free what joke was this they were just going to let him walk ben watched a worried look pass over matsons face whats up colonel theres a catch of course ben thought there always was you must join an international expedition a professor somewhere in the americas has requested your expertise in cave exploration some hushhush operation no other details theyll waive all charges and pay you for your services he slid a sheet of paper toward ben here ben quickly read the letter and his eyes caught on the figure at the bottom of the page he stared at all those zeros daring them to change this couldnt be right after this he could own his sheep station free and clear no more shady tour operations almost too good to be true matson leaned forward his hands on bens shoulders but impossible to pass up he nodded dazed something tells me you had better watch your ass ben matson strode to the chair behind his desk and sat the big boys are playing with you and they have a tendency to roll over the little people remember your friend jack ben stared at the number at the bottom of the page drawing a breath too good to be true back in his cell with an arm draped over his eyes ben drifted to sleep and was soon lost in a nightmare he hadnt had since childhood he found himself a boy again threading his way through meterwide columns of damp stone inside a huge cave he knew this place his grandfather had once brought him here to show him aboriginal petroglyphs it was the same cave but now the rock columns sprouted fruitladen branches curious he reached for a red pulpy gourd but it was just beyond his reach as he was pulling back his arm he felt eyes drilling into the nape of his neck he whipped around but no one was there yet now those eyes were all around him just at the edge of his vision he spotted motion from behind a large rock cylinder whos there he called racing to peer behind the column just more empty space what do you want the word ghosts came unbidden to his mind he started to run he felt something following him calling him back he ignored it and ran searching for an exit the pillars closed around him slowing his progress then he sensed a soft touch at the back of his neck and heard garbled words whispered in his ear you are one of us he screamed bolting out of the dream he woke on his cot his heart still racing and rubbed at his temples bloody hell what brought back that old nightmare he closed his eyes recalling that the nightmares had first started after an argument with his grandfather in an aboriginal cave outside of darwin no its not true the thirteenyearold ben had yelled tears welling at the revelation yes it is young man and i dont take to being called a liar his grandfathers wrinkled leather face frowned at him this was once the ancestral home of my grandmother he repeated then poked him in the chest a direct relative of yours the implications that he could have aboriginal blood running through his veins had horrified him he and his friends had always made fun of the darkskinned aboriginal kids at school and now in a single heartbeat he had been lumped in with them he shook his head i am not a damned darkie a stinging slap to his cheek youll respect your ancestors even now he cringed at the memory as a youngster this heritage had shamed him aborigines at the time were considered secondclass citizens only slightly above animals luckily diluted by generations of european blood his blighted heritage was an easily kept secret except from himself it was then the nightmares had started for countless nights hed awaken with his sheets clinging to his sweating body tears coursing down his cheeks clenching handfuls of sheets he would pray no one would learn his secret over time he had matured even come to respect and appreciate his unique heritage and the dreams had eventually faded away like old toys put in cardboard boxes forgotten and no longer needed he shook his head so why now why dredge up this old childhood terror must be this bloody cell he concluded and burrowed deeper under his ratty blanket well thanks to that timely letter he would soon be rid of this damn place thirty days later his mysterious benefactor telegraphed black rock and in twenty hours ben found himself upgraded from his cramped cell in australia to a suite of rooms at the sheraton buenos aires in argentina ben tested the bathwater with his foot he cringed at the heat then smiled ahhh perfect after a month in the black rock prison a month of tepid showers that barely penetrated the layer of grime caked into his pores a full hot bath was just possibly orgasmic he stepped into the tub and settled himself into the steaming water he tapped the button for the jets tickling sprays massaged him from all sides creating a gentle whirlpool definitely orgasmic he sighed leaning back into the tub and allowing his body to relax and float in the jets there was a knock on the door ignoring it ben slipped farther into the jets the knock came again more persistently using his elbows he raised himself higher in the tub who is it a muffled voice replied excuse me sir but dr blakely requests your presence in the pampas room on the main floor the other guests are arriving now as well ben rubbed his red eyes gimme five minutes he pushed out of the hot tub the chill air raising gooseflesh on his bare legs after dressing in an old brown tweed suit ben proceeded to the conference suite to his relief the antechamber to the auditorium was set up with a mobile bar a bartender hustling hooch paraded behind a shelf of bottles already a good number of men and women stood gathered in small groups he glanced around no one looked his way so much for the warm greeting after searching the room one final time he decided a whiskey would help his outlook on this party he stalked over to the bar your pleasure sir whiskey and a beer back he leaned his elbow on the black naugahyde padding that edged the bar and watched the room it was not his kind of crowd no loud laughs no spilled drinks no angry drunks boring after dumping the whiskey straight into his stomach he slapped down his shot glass squeezing the burn then settled in with his beer from behind him he heard a womans voice whiskey neat please he turned to see who had a similar taste in beverages whiskeydrinking women were as scarce as hens teeth he wasnt disappointed she toyed with the drink set before her long fingers short nails polished no rings no wedding bandgood she stood as tall as him surprising for a woman her skin was bronzed a coppery rich hue that spoke of days under the sun but what most caught the breath in his throat was her black hair trailing in lazy curls to her waist can i buy you another he asked stressing his aussie accent that always won a ladys attention she lifted her left eyebrow theyre free she said its a hosted bar his roguish smile swelled in that case how about two she just stared at him with green eyes he thrust out a hand ben brust from sydney i couldve guessed from your accent she said with a ghost of a smile but the drawl sounds more like western australia than the new south wales territory well he said lowering his arm and stumbling for cover i actually was raised on my daddys sheep station outside perth western australia but most people dont know sydney from i thought so collecting her drink she began to turn away the meeting should be starting soon before she left he begged for at least one bone and you are ashley carter she slipped past him ben watched her walk away no professors stroll that he swallowed the dregs of his beer while appreciating her exit three buenos aires argentina ashley crossed to the young spanish gentleman who checked her identification nodding he opened the door the room was lined with some fifty seats only a quarter occupied an usher guided her to a reserved seat in the front row then vanished shivering in the light skirt and jacket she wore she wished theyd turn up the thermostat now that she was seated her mind began sifting over the events of the past weeks her old anxieties wormed to the surface one especially jason she hated leaving her son alone in the hotel room upstairs he had seemed so quiet this evening not his usual boisterous self her fingers tightened on her purse and this mission a letter with airplane tickets had arrived in the mail with instructions to be prompt everything else has been taken care of the letter had stated no other details a man sat down in the seat next to her well hi there she glanced over it was the australian fellow again goddamn it couldnt she get a moment of peace the empty canyons of her new mexico home had never seemed so appealing let me try this again he held out a hand benjamin brust not wanting to insult him she gave his hand one shake now go away she thought he smiled at her white teeth against a ruddy background his cheekbones hard sun wrinkles at the corners of his eyes full lips so what do you know about all this he asked ashley shrugged trying to discourage conversation and turned away so many secrets ben mumbled she nodded perhaps shortly well have a few answers he remained quiet still she sensed his presence at her shoulder his cologne was musky and rich his breathing deep and even she shifted the auditorium was almost full now it was getting warm in here she wished they would fix the thermostat do you trust him he asked in a whisper no she answered looking straight ahead she knew who he was talking about not at all from a doorway blakely watched the auditorium fill his team was gathered in the five front seats he signaled his assistant roland across the room roland nodded and raised a microphone to his lips ladies and gentlemen please take your seats were ready to begin after a few more moments of bustling and lastminute arrivals the doors to the auditorium were closed and the lights dimmed slightly blakely climbed the dais and stood behind the lighted podium he dabbed his forehead with a handkerchief he knew his speech by heart words carefully crafted blakely tapped the microphone testing it his tapping also signaled the murmuring crowd to hush first thank you all for joining us he paused i know it has been a hardship to leave your regular lives behind so abruptly but in a few moments im sure you will be convinced that the disruption was well worth it he picked up a remote control for the slide projector and pressed a button a photograph of a snowcapped mountain with a plume of dirty smoke appeared on the screen mount erebus on ross island just off the coast of antarctica one of three volcanic cones on this continent at the base of this volcano is the us research station mcmurdo my home for the past five years he clicked the button to zero in on a group of low metal buildings clinging to the surface of a gray glacier a satellite array sprouted like a bizarre spider from the rooftops i have been conducting geothermal studies for the past ten years on some hot rifts still active deep under the cone and under the neighboring ross sea nasa assisted with this research their third shuttle six years ago made radio scans of the earths crust looking for oil fields and other such pockets i commissioned a scan of mount erebus and found some amazing things he tapped the button and a crosssectional diagram of the crust under the volcanic cone appeared on screen a murmur arose from the crowd as you can see an intricate cavern system was discovered below erebus spreading hundreds of miles he clicked to the next slide closer investigation with sonar and radar revealed a huge cavern separated from the deepest rift by a mere six hundred meters of stone he guided a pointer to show the network of rifts that led to the massive pocket we named this cave alpha cavern almost five miles in diameter the cavern floor was plumbed at two miles below the surface of the continent almost three times deeper than man has ever stepped foot the next picture showed a group of smiling men faces encrusted in dirt and dust posing in front of a large rawedged hole after three years of work we blasted and mined our way into this chamber it took another year to wire and set up a camp on this chambers floor a spotlighted set of quonset huts and tents appeared next on the screen a threestory wooden building protruded from the middle a second similar building a mere skeleton of wooden framing and scaffolding was under construction alpha base he noted we worked in secret access restricted to those with the proper clearance the next slide caused his audience to gasp blakely smiled slightly ladies and gentlemen i present a mystery ashley who had been rubbing her eyes and yawning wondering what all this talk of volcanic activity and mining had to do with her bolted out of her seat it had to be a hoax what she saw blew a milewide hole in accepted anthropologic theory the photograph projected on the screen revealed a spotlighted section of the cavern wall dug into the wall was a network of cliffdwelling homes rising several hundred feet up the wall unlike the organized anasazi cliff dwellings she had studied in new mexico dwellings with distinct terraces and geometric conformations these cavern dwellings were more rudimentary crude a haphazard series of rough caves blakely continued after the audiences reaction had subsided to a quiet murmur unfortunately no one was homenervous laughter tickled across the roombut we discovered a few scattered artifacts he clicked through the next series of slides one of the slides was the diamond fertility figurine ashley was numb as she settled back into her seat she raised her hand excuse me dr blakely he acknowledged her with a wave then paused to sip from a glass of water has the site been dated she asked he swallowed nodding we did some cursory radiocarbon dating as near as we can tell about fivepointtwo million years what ashley jumped out of her seat a second time thats impossible its been repeated at several labs he replied his smile condescending the eyes of the auditorium were now upon her some lighting technician even highlighted her with a small spot she shaded her eyes with a hand but the first hominids the earliest ancestor of modern man only appeared on the planet four million years ago and these early hominids did not have the tools or social structure to build anything like this he shrugged thats why were here he clicked for the next slide a photograph of a tunnel in the base of the wall these tunnels leave this colossal chamber in many different directions connecting to other caverns and tunnels we believe that down one of these passages lie the answers to the questions raised by professor carter who built the dwellings who made the carvings where are they now the audience remained stunned silent ashley sat back down still in shock i have put together a small team to begin that exploration to venture deeper into the maze of tunnels and discover what else may lie below the group will be led by professor ashley carter an expert in paleoanthropology and archaeology the others on the team are leaders in their respective fields he pointed to a blondhaired woman seated several chairs over from ashley accompanying the team will be professor linda furstenburg a biology professor from the university of vancouver to study the unique biosphere weve discovered down there also a geologist khalid najmon he said with a nod toward an arab gentleman seated with his legs crossed to lindas left he as many of you know will be assisting us in mapping the riches below antarctic ice his findings may alter our view of this continent blakely finished by pointing out the other two men seated in the front row all the way from australia benjamin brust a worldrenowned cave explorer will be mapping the intricacies of this unique cavern system and that smartly dressed man in the uniform is major michaelson of the us marines who with two other trained military men will be accompanying the team to aid in logistics and protection he waved his arm to encompass the group before him ladies and gentlemen here is your team a murmur of applause spattered across the crowd ashley tried to sink deeper into her seat after some further details were explained and a handful of questions answered the meeting ended satisfied blakely left the podium in the adjacent room he sighed and loosened his tie the first part was over roland who had been his assistant for over fifteen years entered with the slide tray blakely nodded to him that went very well sir roland said as he boxed the slides the government representatives and your other financial backers seemed very pleased yes he said with a tired smile i think so too he pulled off his jacket and let it drop on a nearby chair he sat down in another roland placed the slide carousel in a cardboard box no one even suspected there was a previous exploration team he shrugged they have no need for that information right now but what if were much better prepared this time dont worry we wont lose this team four for the second time in as many months ashley stuck her nose in major michaelsons face even now outfitted in his dress blues she recognized the same blueeyed plastic soldier boy who had escorted dr blakely to her doorstep i dont care if you and your two goons come along with my team she said accosting him just outside the auditorium i want it made perfectly clear right now this team is mine he stood straight not pulling an inch from her face maam i have my orders she hated surprises like these blakely should have forewarned her that there would be armed escorts accompanying her team this is a scientific mission not a military one as dr blakely explained were merely going along for defensive reasons for safety fine she said staring him square in the eyes but you remember even though you may be carrying the guns i give the orders understood he did not blink just nodded slightly i have my orders maam she ground her molars squelching an outburst what could she do she stepped back as long as we understand each other is there some trouble ladies ben had appeared at her elbow he smiled but there was a tightness to his lips as he eyed the major ashley sensed bens edginess nothing like his earlier casual attitude probably isnt too keen on the idea of being surrounded by guns either she thought no she said aloud were just clearing up a few points good were going to be buried together for the summer in a hole two miles deep lets start out friends ben stuck out a hand toward the officer major michaelson ignored bens hand you do your job and ill do mine with a nod toward ashley the major turned and strode away nice bloke ben said real friendly the sarcasm in his voice was tough to miss i didnt need rescuing pardon me i can handle major michaelson without your intervention i could see that ben looked hurt honestly hurt but that wasnt the reason i came over i talked to professor furstenburg and mr najmon were all going to the hotel bar i just wanted to invite you along ashley glanced down embarrassed by her rude remark it wasnt ben who deserved her wrath she had just needed someone to vent her frustrations upon and unfortunately he was at hand listen im sorry i didnt mean to dont give it another thought a smile had returned to his lips us aussies are a thickskinned breed so how about coming along i should be getting back to my room my son hes upstairs ben raised his eyebrows you brought your son how old is he eleven she said defensively hes been on digs with me before cool nothin like getting your kids involved with your work he pointed to a white hotel phone on the wall why dont you check up on him if hes fine cmon and join us shed expected to be lambasted for dragging her son halfway across the globe and his response eased her tension a bit maybe it was all right that jason came along on this onceinalifetime adventure youre right let me just call him a quick call from the lobby phone found jason still hooked to his nintendo game boy like an addict she could hear the blips and dings of his portable video game in the background cant talk mom almost to level twentythree ive never been this far and i got three lives left sounds great honey listen ill be up in about an hour is that all right sure sure whenever i gotta go have fun then the line clicked off she sighed and headed toward the bar after all it would be good to get to know her teammates better before the trip tomorrow maxis the hotel bar was the designated watering hole the decor was a paris motif with tiny café tables and intimate booths a french flag hung over the bar the tables were crowded now with the evening theater crowd espresso café latté and exotic drinks cluttered the tabletops in contrast to the european trappings the latin music was loud with a throbbing rhythm a booth in a distant corner had already been staked out by her team she saw ben ferrying drinks across the room balancing a beer and three cocktails between two hands he maneuvered through the maze of elbows and feet arriving with most of the drinks still in their respective glasses ashley slid into the booth just ahead of him sliding in next to her ben passed her a glass if i remember the lady likes whiskey she smiled thanks you two seem to know each other already said the egyptian geologist khalid najmon who sat across the booth next to linda furstenburg his smile glowed against his desert tan handsome in a dark way have you known each other long he asked before taking a sip of his wine no we sat together at the meeting ashley explained otherwise were complete strangers ben feigned hurt feelings strangers is such a dirty word well khalid said while mr brust was fetching drinks ive been getting better acquainted with professor furstenburg please call me linda she blushed a bit and kept pushing a loose strand of blond hair back over an ear her manner was outwardly relaxed but she kept glancing around the room with glassy eyes he nodded linda was just telling me about her doctorate research evolutionary biology shes been studying the development of phosphorescent algae in cavern systems most fascinating ive seen some of that glowing algae ben said in a cave in madagascar there were caverns so thick with the stuff that you almost wished you had sunglasses linda nodded rinchari luminarus a beautiful species comes in a variety of colors too she talked about how the individual species differed ashleys attention drifted from the conversation she studied linda as she spoke her eyes were so blue that ashley wondered if they were real her physique was ample soft with small hands a childs delicate fingers a direct contrast to ashleys hard lean body no one would ever describe ashley as soft khalid never took his eyes from linda nodding every now and then as she continued her description he was obviously entranced by more than just the genetic variations of glowing sludge even ben had a perpetual smile on his lips as he listened ashley felt like a piece of granite next to a rose she swallowed her whiskey and thats how i received my doctorate i can see why dr blakely wanted you ashley said the two men seemed to come out of a trance your knowledge of unique evolutionary pathways will be helpful in documenting our exploration ben cleared his throat definitely an asset khalid nodded indeed ben finally turned away from linda so khalid whats your angle a geologist huh he sipped his drink then spoke the antarctic treaty of come again ben asked no one owns antarctica the treaty declared the continent to be used only for peaceful scientific purposes a world park yeah i know about that australia has a few bases there yes but did you know that because of the treatys prohibition against mineral exploration the extent of antarcticas mineral wealth is still unknown its a big blank slate khalid allowed that to sink in before continuing well the treaty ended in the continent is now open for mineral exploration but with one critical stipulation the land must be protected from damage it dawned on ashley the implications were enormous these subterranean tunnels will allow you to explore the continents mineral wealth without harm to the surface yes he said nodding and any depositsoil minerals precious stonesdiscovered are the property of the government who finds them with the us governments lust for future territorial claims she said its no wonder the national science foundation has been so generous with their funding but who exactly are we in bed with here i imagine its a combination of science commerce and politics khalid answeredand then with a grin i suppose much like your governments manhattan project ashley scowled great and look how wonderful that turned out so what do you think the likelihood of a significant find is linda asked drawing the egyptians attention considering that a researcher discovered mount erebuss volcanic plume emits gold dustthe only plume to do so on the planeti think this research teams salary will be more than adequately covered gold in volcano smoke ben said sounds pretty farfetched khalid scowled briefly at the interruption its been widely written up the other team members remained silent dumbstruck ashley bristled once again blakely had failed to reveal the full extent of this mission first the armed escort and now this i dont know if i like this she said raping a continent and for whose benefit linda nodded in agreement everyone sat quietly pondering the sobering news then ben in a sudden outburst destroyed the somber reverie to hell with it lets go dancing its the flipping birthplace of the tango cmon buenos aires is just waking up ashley frowned this australian sheepherder never stops she thought ill pass i have a son to tuck into bed khalid also shook his head we dont dance the tango in my country linda brightened ill go id like to get out of this stuffy hotel superb ben said i know of a bar in the san telmo district quaint and authentic ben scooted out of the booth and gave linda his hand the night and the stars await us he declared with a slight bow bashfully linda smiled at bens drama as the two walked away ashley noticed khalids brows lower he mumbled something in arabic then said his goodbyes to her and slipped from the table also she watched as ben escorted linda across the bar a small burst of her tinkling laughter could be heard as the two exited onto the street ashley remained nursing the rest of her drink as if on cue the plangent chords of a tango began wailing from the bars speakers the sultry music just made her feel that much lonelier book two under the ice five in a plane again ashley thought sourly her nose pressed to the window down below glacier fought granite from horizon to horizon this was the final leg of the twoday journey yesterday they had flown the eight hundred miles from buenos aires to esperanza the argentine army base on the tip of an antarctic peninsula there ashley had her first taste of antarctic airlike ice water poured into her lungs the team overnighted at the bases military barracks and the next morning were hauled once again aboard the argentine transport by noon blakely had promised they would reach their final destination the us naval base mcmurdo ashley longed to spend more than twentyfour hours outside an airplanes cabin she pushed herself up a bit to see if jason was behaving himself he was seated across the rattling cabin next to ben talking animatedly his hands expressive the two had become fast friends since bunking together in the male dormitory of the barracks in esperanza ben noticed her stare and grinned over jasons head at her the australian was demonstrating admirable patience jasons stories could get longwinded hes fine said major michaelson seated next to her startled she snapped at him i didnt ask for your opinion i just meant he shook his head with a frown never mind ashley bit her lower lip he was obviously just trying to reassure her im sorry that wasnt directed at you i just have these nagging doubts about bringing jason along the tension in his shoulders seemed to relax your son has a lot of spunk hell do fine thanks but what about ben he didnt come on this mission to be my babysitter the major smiled maybe some of jasons maturity will rub off on him she chuckled that man sure is a walking showboat at least he knows his business he nodded toward ben i read his file a celebrated searchandrescue worker specializing in cave reconnaissance two years ago he rescued an experienced research crew in the lechuguilla caves the researchers had disappeared for eight days and no one could find them ben went in alone and came out with a broken leg and the four crew members he knows his caves almost a sixth sense i didnt realize she glanced at ben who was now playing cards with jason she sat there pondering the revelation your file was just as impressive the major said my file you seem to have an amazing ability to ferret out new discoveries in otherwise heavily researched sites she just shrugged at his praise the major seemed extraordinarily talkative hed otherwise been so closelipped and stoic she turned to him you sure as hell know a lot about us but all ive received were tickets and a schedule i dont even know your first name its dennis he said dr blakely plans a full debriefing at alpha base major dennis michaelson she thought with a first name the major almost seemed human she settled back in her seat where are you from dennis nebraska our familys farm is just outside north platte so why did you join the marines my brother harry and i joined together hes a big motor buffcars bikes drag racing that sort of thing he joined to get his hands dirty on even bigger engines the guy was never happy unless his hands were filthy with oil always needing to tinker an affectionate smile had appeared on michaelsons face as he described his brother and what about you what drew you away from the farm partly to keep an eye on harry but also as i said our family farms just outside north platte and north platte is just outside of nowhere so you joined to see the world and now here you are serving at the bottom of it yes he said almost fiercely and right now north platte never looked so good so why not quit and go back to the farm his face suddenly clouded over black eyebrows pulling together he shook his head but remained silent she tried to extract more from him how did you get hitched with such a dull assignment guarding a bunch of scientists i volunteered he mumbled she crinkled her nose not exactly the expected decision of a career military man no prestige no glory stationed at the assend of the world why he shrugged his shoulders i have my reasons he unbuckled his seat belt and climbed out of the seat grumbling about using the restroom alone she went back to studying the landscape passing below the skis of the aircraft sun reflected off the ice the more she got to know her teammates the less she seemed to understand them but what else was new she never understood people look at her marriage a honeymoon that lasted eight years until one day she came home early from a dignauseated by morning sicknessand discovered her husband in their bed with his secretary no warning signs no lipstick on a collar no blond hair on his jacket nothing a mystery to her ashley placed a hand on her belly scotts infidelity was not the worst of it she remembered the cramping pain and the rush of blood the emotional overload from his betrayal had triggered a miscarriage losing the child had almost destroyed her only jason then seven years old had kept her sane even though years had passed a part of her ached when she remembered how much she had lost not just the baby but her faith in people she refused to let herself be so gullible so vulnerable again slumping into her seat she stared out the frosted window just at the edge of the horizon a tower of smoke rose into the air a dark signature against the blue sky she sat up straighter as the plane droned on the source of the gray plume appeared rising from the flat surface like some awakening giant mount erebus the interior of the dodge van reeked of cigarette smoke and bounced in rough sync with the bass beat of a pearl jam cassette a tired midday sun protruded wanly over the summit of mount erebus the driver a young navy ensign bobbed his head to the music almost home he called over his shoulder just around the next ridge of ice the road from williams field to mcmurdo base was a roughhewn stretch of carved ice with a final molarjarring bump as they circled the ridge ashley viewed their destination she swiped a glove over the steamed passenger window the other team members were doing the same beside the blue ice shelf encasing the ross sea mcmurdo base was a black smudge an industrial complex of gray buildings dwarfed by a huge junkyard to the south the van trundled past an ignited trash dump fuming oily smoke into the blue sky a navy helicopter screamed over the van the pressure and sound vibrating the windows jason covered his ears the base buzzed with other helicopters ashley tapped the driver on the shoulder is it always this busy here the driver gave her a thumbsup sign this is a slow day he yelled she leaned back into her seat great blakely smiled well only be stopping here for a couple of hours then well proceed directly to alpha base its much quieter down there he glanced wistfully out the window actually after a year or so you get accustomed to the commotion and smell up top here i almost miss it seems like a lot of pollution for a scientific station linda said with a grimace these surrounding biocommunities are fragile blakely shrugged weve been allocated a tenmilliondollar cleanup fund itll get better i sure hope so linda said they were dropped off near a cementblock building ashley tightened her parka around her the wind burned as it whipped across her cheeks frostbite could set in within mere minutes if unprotected her teammates dashed for the entryway she made sure jason was ahead of her she didnt want him wandering off and getting lost warmth the interior was heated but felt humid and sticky the pungent odor of sweat prevalent crinkling her nose she noticed the hallway was lined with a rainbow of colored parkas hung on pegs blakely directed them to hang up their parkas dont worry about them being stolen to steal someones coat is a hanging offense here ashley helped jason off with his parka and hung it next to hers well only be stopping for lunch then proceeding directly to alpha base blakely continued the emess is at the end of this corridor help yourselves and unwind well meet back here in two hours theres also a recreation room with pingpong and pool tables around the corner from emess enjoy yourselves you wont be joining us ashley asked no im meeting with the base captain to iron out the last few details after blakely left they proceeded to the mess hall a few navy personnel raised an eyebrow or two as they passed one young gentleman stared at ashley for longer than she liked until a stern glare sent him scurrying as a whole though the navy crew seemed unfazed by the newcomers she guessed that as a base of operation for the national science foundation they had become accustomed to an influx of new faces ashley balanced a tray laden with two apples a thick sandwich of luncheon meats and a pint of milk jason had tried to fill his tray with pudding and cookies until she pointed for him to return the treats lunch first then you can have a chocolate pudding and one cookie jason moped his way to the table with the smallest sandwich he could find his eye still straying to the dessert bar ben joined them at their table major michaelson khalid and linda took a neighboring table were almost there ben whispered in her ear as he sat at the threshold of a new world how are you holding up captain whether from his words or his ticklish breath a shiver traveled down her back fine she said just wound up tight anxious to tackle the caves me too with a big smile he held out a hand fingers trembling i get the shakes until i get started she couldnt tell if he was joking with her he was so hard to read to be this close she shrugged its nervewracking i know how you feel ben said with a nod ive been caving for two decades this is my first chance to scoop booty on a new system scoop booty whats that sheesh mom jason said seated beside her appalled he spoke around a mouthful of sandwich its a caving guys word it means to be the first to discover new stuff oh i see she said smiling at her sons attempt to impress her ben and i talked hes told me all aboutwhatd you call it againoh yeah the virgins passage what she turned to ben what the hell have you been telling my son virgin passages ben said straining to hold back his laughter passages never walked by man that sort of thing oh she said suddenly chagrined i thought he interrupted with a sloppy grin i know what you thought she bristled so you think youre the next neil armstrong who she shook her head at his ignorance the first man who stepped on the moon one giant step for mankind bens eyes brightened exactly to be the first human to see something new like no other thrill she remembered the hidden anasazi tomb she had discovered pulse racing breath shallow as she tipped over the final stone to reveal the inner sanctum of the high priest the musty smell of the ancient chamber the sun on her neck to be the first to view a secret hidden for centuries and now to do the same on a secret hidden for millennia what would she find there her ears rang with her thudding heartbeat yes she understood bens excitement so are you ready to scoop some booty he asked she smiled into his laughing eyes hell yes i hope theres still time later to explore those cliff dwellings id even skip lunch for a chance to get at them today taking a hearty bite of her sandwich she found the bread moist and the meat rubbery especially this lunch ben just kept smiling at her dont like military fare she smirked at him im going back for some pudding and a cookie mom jason cried no fair jasons finger dabbed up every stray cookie crumb from his dessert plate then he sucked on his finger savoring the hint of chocolate cant i have one more cookie he begged his mother youve already had two thats enough why dont you go to the restroom and wash up jason mumbled something under his breath and shoved his chair back fine ben piped up as jason passed how about a game of pool after youre done jasons tight features softened he eyed his mother can i sure now scoot we load up shortly be with you in a minute ben jason said darting from the mess hall into the restroom across the hall the bathroom was empty jason popped into the middle stall and fumbled with his belt as he sat down he heard the door swing open the noise from the hallway intruding until the door swung shut again someone whistled a tuneless melody as he approached the bank of toilet stalls and entered the cubicle on jasons right still whistling the man dropped his pack on the floor of the stall right beside jason jason watched wideeyed as a blackhaired hand reached down and released the packs clasp then fumbled within it jason heard a match strike followed shortly by a long exhalation he could smell a burning cigarette next he heard the unbuckling of a belt and the whistling continued as the whistler sat down the man bumped his pack with his heel sending it toppling over a small pile of plasticwrapped cubes of what looked like gray playdoh tumbled into jasons stall a spat of foul foreign words flowed from the neighboring stall he watched as the man reached to the floor of the stall to collect his pack and straighten it up jason raised his feet just in time as an arm swept into his stall and scooped up the cubes more angry words he could see the tip of a nose as the man checked to make sure he had all the cubes just then the door to the mens room swung open again another man crossed to the urinals jason heard a zipper whisk down followed by a characteristic splashing the man at the urinal sighed jason listened as his neighbor buckled his pants then resecured his toppled pack his neighbor left the stall the man at the urinal spoke jason recognized bens accent khalid youre not supposed to smoke in here mate ah these americans have too many rules who knows which to follow and which to ignore do you wish a cigarette thanks for the offer ben retorted but right now ive a date to play pool the restroom door was shoved open and khalid tromped out jason put his feet back on the floor and stood up while fastening his belt he looked down the egyptian man had missed one of those plasticwrapped cubes it had rolled to the far side of the toilet jason reached down and picked it up wondering what to do it squeezed like firm clay he knew he should return it to khalid but then he would know jason had been there eavesdropping he was shoving it into his pocket when his stall door popped open there you are ben stood before him your mom thought maybe you fell in jason grinned he pushed the cube the rest of the way into his pocket whatve you got there mate did you pinch that third cookie bens smile took the heat from the accusation no jason said with a hiccup of laughter its nothing all right then lets shoot some pool blakely leaned into a gust of wind as he crossed the base the cos office was on the far side of the camp away from the trash dump if he didnt need this damned equipment so badly he would have proceeded directly to alpha base but communiqués and requests by roland failed to sway the obstinate co he needed those damned circuit boards they were essential to the communications net he strode up the steps to base headquarters where a guard checked his identification blakely gave him a sour look while waiting a red us navy helicopter buzzed them spraying ice and debris into the guards cubicle frowning the guard glanced up youre clear dr blakely thank you he proceeded inside damned rules he continued down the corridor after hanging up his parka the cos corner office was on the first floor he strode up to the secretary a yeoman with blackframed glasses and poor posture ive come to speak to commander sung blakely said before the secretary could open his mouth do you have an appointment just tell him its blakely hell see me hes quite busy at the moment blakely shook his head recognizing bullshit when he smelled it tell him im here just a moment the secretary punched a button on a board of yellow lights he turned away as he spoke but blakely could discern the words excuse me sir but theres a dr blakely wanting to speak to you a pause as he listened to the phone then in an even quieter voice i tried that sir hes insistent another pause his face reddening it didnt take much to discern the secretary was on the receiving end of a good dressingdown the conversation finished with a final yes sir the secretary beads of sweat on his forehead turned to face blakely again the commander will see you now thank you for your patience blakely felt sorry for the yeoman he leaned down as he passed around the desk and whispered dont worry son everyone knows sungs an asshole the secretary grimaced good luck you make your own luck blakely thought as he pushed through the door to the inner office commander sung sat behind a wide mahogany desk so thickly lacquered it looked wet spread out before him were several open files he pushed one file toward blakely with a single finger as if repulsed by the touch ive read your request andrew blakely hated when anyone called him by his first name especially a sanctimonious paper pusher like sung this was not the first time the two had locked horns as the head researcher for the national science foundation he was often in deadlock with sung the senior navy officer oftentimes science and the military were at odds on certain subjectsespecially the scarce supplies stocked at this remote base their animosity had intensified once blakely had made his discovery of the diamond idol he watched sung turn green coveting all the attention and money that had been flowing his way ever since any cooperation with the military on the base was like pulling an impacted tooth sung continued a slight sneer at the corner of his lips i thought i already made myself perfectly clear those circuit boards are the last in stock i cannot authorize their release until the backup supply arrives thats bullshit and you know it i need those to repair a critical communications board sung shrugged damned unfortunate that your boards shortcircuited they wouldnt have if youd supplied me with new boards instead of those ancient ones you scavenged off old equipment he leaned his fists on the desk i want those new boards i wont have you jeopardize this team then wait until the next shipment itll be here in three weeks weve delayed long enough already as co of this camp my decision is final sung rocked back in his chair blakely had had enough of this bastard he reached across the desk sung slid away a look of shock on his face blakely suppressed a smile the bastard thought he was being attacked what a fool he grabbed the phone on the desk and pulled it to him what he was going to do was much worse ignoring sungs objections he dialed a number and gave a password he listened as he was connected through a series of operators finally a familiar voice blakely answered sir im having trouble with the base commander he paused yes sir thats right hes right here sir blakely smiled and passed the phone to sung your boss sung slowly reached and took the phone hello this is commander sung blakely watched the commanders face drain of color then refill a bright red again blakely could tell when someones ass was getting chewed yes ill do it sung said voice high right away mr secretary i understand the presidents wishes six just a minute longer then it will be over even though ashley was strapped securely to her seat on the navy helicopter she gripped the handhold above her head a sudden bump and turn of the craft caused her grip to tighten to a whiteknuckled clamp a dull throbbing behind her eyes warned of an impending headache just land this damned contraption she thought as if in answer the helicopter dived downward jason whooped as the helicopter tilted toward the icy wall of rock the slopes of mount erebus filled the entire starboard view seemingly an endless series of snowy cliffs and black chasms climbing to heaven ashley closed her eyes her stomach in her throat jason tugged on her sleeve you gotta see this mom she pushed his hand away not right now honey but you can see the hole its freakin weird she groaned opening an eye the world was a tilted plate and the base of erebus swung into view below them as they circled downward the area below was festooned with orange tents like boils on a white butt a road of gouged mud and slush led out from the tent site to a black mouth in the cliff face of erebus large enough to drive a doubledecker bus into snow blew from the opening as if the gaping mouth were exhaling the helicopter righted itself and descended like an elevator to the landing site ice and snow billowing around them as they touched down blakely yelled above the noise of the rotors inside the transport helicopter all right folks theres two snow cats just outside to transport us to the fissure ben seated across from her grinned its all downhill from here with her son begging for a window seat in the tight compartment of the widetreaded snocat ashley had found herself squished between jason and ben linda unencumbered by a son had nabbed the seat next to the driver the other members followed in a second vehicle the tunnel opening loomed ahead it was originally a natural fissure that sliced deep into the side of mount erebus explosives and mining equipment had widened the fissure and smoothed a passageway into the volcanic mountain she held her breath as their vehicle bounced over the lip into the cavernous tunnel wide enough for two trucks a regular twolane highway into the heart of a volcano the walls roughhewn from blasting and drilling were lighted by halogen lamps strung along the ceiling as the cat ground around a curve daylight vanished the lamps remained the only illumination the driver clicked on the headlights spearing the darkness ahead though it seemed as if they were traveling on level ground she knew from the briefing that they were heading at a downward angle the tunnel four miles long would descend almost four thousand feet but it was slow progress even traveling at a snails pace the bumpy roadway kept jarring her into bens side sorry she said pushing herself off his shoulder no worries i was sort of enjoying it she smirked at him did he ever stop linda turned to face them do you mind if i open my window a crack id like to well its kind of stuffy ashleys eyebrows pulled together lindas complexion blanched her lips dry and caked probably hadnt liked the helicopter ride either she could definitely sympathize but it was damned cold outside i dont know i dont want jason to catch a chill perhaps a little fresh air sounds good ben said he reached and squeezed ashleys hand jason do you mind ashley stared down at bens hand he kept squeezing as though trying to communicate to her she bit back a retort her son glued to the tunnel ahead mouth open waved a hand at them i dont mind fine ashley said go ahead linda but jason you stay bundled up linda grinned weakly and turned forward once more a gush of icy wind swirled into the compartment as she lowered her window an inch with her nose to the window linda inhaled deeply visibly relaxing ben released ashleys hand she burrowed deeper into her parka clutching the hood around her face she turned to question ben but he continued to study linda his brow tight with concern resigned ashley leaned back and watched the overhead lamps wink by as they passed under them down the white rabbits hole went alice blakely sat next to the driver staring at the taillights of the snocat up ahead he had been studying the passing tunnel walls eyeing the electrical and communications cables all was in order as long as the base commander didnt try any lastminute sabotaging of his plans everything was prepared khalid leaned forward from where he sat in the rear of the snocat how much farther he asked blakely glanced over his shoulder to face the geologist well reach the shaft elevators in about ten minutes be at alpha base by dinner so relax enjoy the ride khalid nodded and blakely watched the egyptian return to studying the passing lamps and cables his dark eyes taking in all the details swinging back in his seat blakely understood the geologists edginess this waiting gnawed at ones nerves ashley stretched muscles cramped by the ride she glanced back as the second snocat trundled into the large cavern and discharged its passengers then returned her attention to the massive elevatora cage of iron bars jason was exploring around the huge crates that filled the back half of the cave he looked like a mouse scurrying among a childs spilled toy blocks jason she called stay close hon her son waved his acknowledgment blakely enlisting bens aid waved toward the elevators help me with these doors ben and major michaelson hauled the doors aside so the crew could enter jason had wandered over ben tousled his hair ready for this mate jason grinned as he entered the garagesized elevator big enough to park both snocats oh yeah this is so awesome ashley eyed the interior of the elevator the ceiling and floor were sheets of solid red iron but the walls were just oneinchthick iron bars like a gigantic birdcage well travel about the equivalent of two hundred floors blakely said as the doors closed took three years alone to mine out this sixhundredmeter shaft that separates the floor of this rift from the cavern below he yanked a lever and ashley felt the familiar lurching as the elevator dropped with a rumble she held jasons hand how safe was this contraption she voiced her concerns blakely smiled weve hauled heavy machinery with this elevator even several trucks itll hold the group of us just fine he tapped the metal wall of the cage this is the lifeline of alpha base its maintained like an expensive swiss watch and guarded like the crown jewels ashley noticed khalids smile amused at her feminine fears she thought just another macho man fearless in the face of reason she watched him as he eyed the cage studying it an uncomfortable silence took hold as the team continued their descent the only illumination came from a single lamp in the ceiling of the cage it felt like they were suspended in space feeling the need to break the silence ashley turned to blakely you know she said something has been bothering me and i imagine a few of the others too hmmm he seemed lost in reverie ben perked up pushing off the wall he had been leaning on the others too were staring at them with interest lets be honest here she said are we here to investigate this continent or rape it blakelys eyebrows arched we all know science doesnt payshe waved at the steel cagethis well mores at stake than just an archaeological investigation true blakely said taking off his glasses and rubbing at the bridge of his nose but let me assure you first and foremost i am a scientist to me the mission has been and always will be a scientific one that is one of the reasons i chose you to head this team professor carter i want this mission to remain a scientific venture but we dont live in a vacuum this mission does have some significant economic and political ramifications blakely added dont be so quick to judge it gets the bills paid gets me my equipment he pointed at the others then at her and it gets me a prime team still she said whats the final tradeoff for this exploration if we end up with a stripmined and blasted continent thats too hefty a price tag i can live without answering the mystery of the caverns he stared at her a sad look on his face can you really professor carter she opened her mouth to declare her convictions but the lie would not come out she had asked blakely to be honest could she be any less she remembered the diamond figurine glowing in the last rays of the setting sun she closed her mouth damn he nodded and pointed down here it comes just then a breeze rushed into the cage blowing back her parka hood a warm breeze at the same time light burst up from below the elevator had just dropped into the cavern the ceiling of the cave illuminated from below dripped with damp stalactites huge mountains hanging upside down several reached to the floor to form gigantic pillars a natural colonnade the elevator was descending beside a pillar twice the diameter of their own cage ashley noticed someone had scrawled graffiti on the column an arrow pointing down with the roughlettered words hell one mile ben frowned defacing a cavern thats not only poor taste but among cavers its considered bad luck blakely scowled at his assistant roland lets get that removedtoday ashley shook her head droplets flew from the tip of her nose she wiped her brow damp the humidity must be close to a hundred percent but the air she inhaled deeply it was so clean she squinted but the far wall was blocked by the massive pillar damn she had hoped to spy the dwellings mom look jason pointed toward the cavern floor sighing in exasperation she stood on tiptoe leaning her forehead against the cold bars below buildings and tents dotted the floor lit by searchlights and festooned with lamps a deep chasm like a black wound cut the base in two a lighted bridge crossed the gap linking the two halves it was their destination alpha base look over here linda exclaimed you can see fish ashley sidled behind linda placing a hand on her shoulder peering over and down at the edge of alpha base reflecting the lights of the camp was a mammoth lake covering several hundred acres rippling gently from above a few glowing residents of the lake could be seen gliding and darting under the glassy surface strangely poetic cool jason exclaimed and how mate ben nudged ashley with an elbow amazing aint it ashley nodded her mind numb anxious to explore her qualms from a moment ago were a dim memory am i remembering correctly did you say the cavern was five miles across blakely nodded a smile playing about his lips approximately ben whistled within minutes the cage settled to the cavern floor secure in its berth a uniformed escort stood ready to guide them to their quarters blakely faced the group were home seven alpha base antarctica ashley watched with a smirk as jason darted around his bedroom her own room in the twobedroom suite was just as impressive hard to believe each member of the team had a separate suite in the main dormitory of the base the perks of working on this mission were getting better and better lace curtains walnut desks thick upholstered chairs designer wallpaper who would have thought they were two miles underground look mom he pointed to a desk in the corner of his room a real pentium ii not one of those slowpoke clones she hated to burst his balloon but he had to learn sometime thats for your homework jason turned to her his jaw hanging open its the beginning of summer mom its only a couple hours each day while im gone i want you to put this time to use theres a library on the base i want you to check out two books while im gone and write a book report on each his looked aghast his eyes wide some summer itll be fun roland will beshe dare not say babysitting or jason would never forgive herwatching you hell be staying here while im gone i expect you to mind him he scrunched up his face irate if you mind your manners and do your homework without sulking there are some surprises in store for you yeah he said his voice thick with skepticism like what first i found a martial arts expert on the base who can continue your lessons here if you want to get your yellow belt by years end youre gonna need to practice while im gone the black cloud over his face lifted just a bit plus they have electric bikes and jet skis to ride jason grimaced why electric to help protect the ecosystem they limit the number of combustion engines down here its the militarys small contribution to cavern preservation ashley remembered bens scowl as they traveled across the base grumbling the entire way about the blatant abuse of the fragile ecology still jasons pout drew back her attention she brushed some loose strands of hair away from her face but jason thats not all they have planned theres also fishing basketball you name it plenty to keep you entertained while im gone and if you do well with your studies dr blakely has promised you can join him in the control room and help monitor our progress youll even be able to talk to me well i guess thats okay jason said still pouting a bit finally she said pointing back into the main room of the suite they have cable a hundred and fifty channels all decoded wow i gotta check that out she caught him by the sleeve as he barreled past her whoa there sonny first we have dinner in a half hour go get yourself cleaned up geez mom cant a guy have a little fun he stomped toward the bathroom she grinned just like home only two miles below the bottom of the earths surface so what do you think kid ben asked as he approached lindas back she stood at the edge of the lake nicknamed the bottomless pit by the grunts only a foot away black water lapped at a rock from the waves created by a passing navy pontoon boat he scratched at the stubble on his cheek she glanced over at him the light of the camp dancing in her eyes its wondrous she pointed at the ceiling several hundred feet up its like being outside he nodded then shrugged in the direction of the water thinkin of skinnydipping she smiled no but you could oh no youd snatch up my skivvies and have the whole base laughing at me she grinned wider more relaxed thats not what i meant i meant you could actually swim in there ive heard that some of the marines do it the water is quite warm eightytwo degrees i tested it heated by volcanic vents seems strange ben said up above its ice and freezing winds here its bathwater and tropical breezes not really so strange ive heard that the seas around deception island off the coast of antarctica sometimes heat to spa temperatures the volcanic activity is so pronounced that often the water actually boils just meters away from a glacier uhhuh he said arching his eyebrows as if he doubted her she nudged him with her elbow its true he smiled actually i believe you ive been in other caverns warmed by subterranean rifts not really that rare i was just testing you yeah right she said rolling her eyes a glowing amber fish jumped a yard from shore causing linda to let out a quick gasp bens eyebrows narrowed listen lass theres something i want to talk to you about she wiped damp strands of hair from her face what ive been watching you and i well i she held up a hand im sorry ben i know we went dancing in buenos aires but that was only to let off a little steam i want to keep this experience purely professional ben grinned realizing linda thought he was making a pass at her from her looks she must get that a lot whoa there lady thats not why im here why then over the years ive led bushels of tourists into caves and well i can smell trouble since our night out dancing ive been watching you both in that crowded bar and now here among the caves youve been awfully edgy shallow breathing sweaty palms pale face ben saw her eyes sink to the stone floor with his words thats why i came out to talk to you alone i thought maybe there was something youd like to get off your chest she raised her face to him her eyes rimmed with tears youre right ben i have a problem with tight places claustrophobia she rubbed at her forehead eyes down again and nodded during the trip ahead there are going to be many tight places a panicked team member could jeopardize all of us i know but im on medication and have been through years of therapy i can handle this even that tango bar in buenos aires shook you up because i didnt take my pills didnt think i would need them the bar with its packed crowd and loud music just caught me off guard i can handle this mission he reached over and held her shoulders youre sure she looked at him ill be fine i can do this a fish jumped again this time the splash failed to startle linda she continued to stare ben straight in the eye silent for several breaths he weighed her resolve did you pack a fishing pole he finally asked why youll need it if you want to collect specimens during this trip right she said with a smile so you wont mention this to anyone she wiped at her eyes ben released her and picked up a flat stone he skimmed it across the smooth lake surface mention what the more life changes the more it stays the same ashley thought staring at her plate before her cheese bubbled and white pasta floated in a steaming marinara sauce waves of garlic assaulted her nose lasagna again ashley smiled remembering the last lasagna dinner when blakely first proposed this mission the food was the same but not the surroundings linen bone china crystal chandelier mahogany dining table not her trailers kitchenette she speared a forkful of the pasta professor carter blakely said ive arranged a research associate dr harold symski to guide you on a tour of the north wall hell be calling on you around eight oclock tomorrow morning with a hand held up she swallowed her mouthful since i only have the one day i would rather start earlier say around six oclock blakely smiled ill let dr symski know ben cleared his throat and wiped a dribble of cheese from his chin id like to go and check them out too fine with me blakely said is that all right with you professor carter ashley pictured ben crawling beside her into a cramped cave his body pressing against hers as long as he doesnt get in the way he raised his hands in feigned innocence who me blakely addressed the rest of the group any others jason raised a tentative hand id like to go i dont think that would be wise blakely said sternly there are many rockfalls and pits in that area its safer here jason turned toward ashley but mom i linda interrupted he can come with me to research the lake the section ill be surveying lies within the boundaries of the camp she turned to the boy would you mind helping me jason ashley looked down at her blushing son is that okay with you honey he nodded his voice squeaking a bit sure id like that linda smiled then its settled jason and i will be doing research ben seated on jasons far side nudged him with an elbow way to go champ he whispered but purposefully loud enough for ashley to hear now we both have dates jason covered a smile with a small hand ashley rolled her eyes men lights out from his window khalid watched the lamps wink out as the camp was put to bed fake sunset in the darkened cave the importance of circadian rhythms in a darkened environment had been explained earlier by blakely peak performance required tuning the environment to a regular diurnal pattern of darkness and light this worked well with his plans shadows wove a fine cloak soon only a scattering of bulbs were still lit except for the searchlight by the elevator its shaft of light stabbed the ceiling circling in slow ovals around the stalactites black fingers pointing down he glanced at his watch ten oclock time to go to work he left his room and slipped out the dormitorys entrance the night was still warm almost balmy moisture thick in the air nothing like the dry nights at home desert sands remained hot well into the chilly night stars spread across the sky like the fires of allahs jihad passing through the residential half of the camp winding among an acre of khaki tents khalid seldom strayed from the shadows yet he kept his gait casual in case any eyes spied him on the far side of the camp across a deep gorge were the research labs and military headquarters his destination the elevator was located within that distant encampment his only obstacle the bridge over the chasm on the way from the elevator earlier today he had noted it was guarded that one guard was of no concern to him khalid continued across the sleeping camp after edging around a final quonset hut he spied the bridge made of wood and metal lighted with lamps on the corners one corners light had burned out a single uniformed man leaned against a light pole a rifle over his shoulder a quick survey indicated the area was clear checking his pocket khalid stepped into the island of light by the bridge and strolled toward the black gorge the guard took note of his approach pushed off the post and unslung his rifle khalid crossed to the chasms edge a good yard from the bridge leaning over he peered into the darkness the chasms bottom remaining a black mystery the guard a young wheathaired farmboy type called to him careful there those edges crumble away easily ill be careful just wanted a look khalid reached into his jackets breast pocket noting the guard didnt even raise an eyebrow at such a threatening move good he pulled out a package of winstons and tapped out a new cigarette popping it into his mouth he returned the pack to his pocket and pulled a red bic lighter out he watched the guard from the corner of his eye as he lit up the guards attention was transfixed by the flame khalid extinguished the lighter and dropped it into his side pocket next to the knife want a smoke he called over to the guard the guard shrugged thanks man he left his post and crossed to where khalid stood at the edge of the chasm khalid fished out his pack of cigarettes and shook a few out for the guard take a couple the guard slipped one to his lips and another into his uniform pocket got a light sure khalid reached into his pocket and wrapped his fingers around the stiletto coughing to cover the click of the release as he pressed the button have they ever searched the bottom of the chasm nah the guard glanced at the black crevice too damn deep good with the guards attention diverted khalid whipped out the knife and slashed deeply into the marines neck making sure to slice below the larynx to ensure a silent death no scream just a wet gurgle stepping back to avoid the spurting arterial blood he tipped the guard backward into the gorge for a moment the guard teetered arms wheeling as he tried to regain balance eyes stretched open in horror a wash of blood flowing down his chest then he tumbled into the blackness khalid listened after a handful of seconds he heard a distant thud content he crossed the bridge and slipped into shadows from here he would need to move quickly and quietly he proceeded across the base toward the elevator avoiding pools of light thankfully they were few and far between after four minutes he was at the elevator the area well lighted but empty of eyes was unguarded the military isolated so far from the world was too damned confident with the security of their periphery after a minute of study khalid crouched and darted for the huge metal box that housed the elevators motor assembly he slipped a cube of plastique from his inner jacket pocket and secured it to the assembly in a darkened corner he paused a moment no time to be frugal he took a second cube and positioned it next to the first that was better more than enough to leave a crater where the motors now stood he carefully wired the bomb to ignite with the proper signal from his transceiver he eyed his handiwork with a thinlipped smile a security blanket when the time was right this should cover his escape ensuring no one followed him back up after a final check he fled into the dark eight seven oclock in the morning more like midnight ashley shook her head staring out the windshield as the electric vehicle bumped along due to the enclosed space of the caverns and the risk of fouling the air with carbon monoxide internalcombustion engines had been prohibited except for a few watercraft so the electric golfcartlike transports nicknamed mules by the navy personnel were the only real means of travel around alpha cavern ashley rubbed at the mules fogged window only the headlamps broke the darkness ahead beside her with both hands firmly gripping the wheel sat dr symski a young freckled researcher still new to his degree from the back seat over the buzzing whine of the electric motor bens snores erupted like shotgun blasts she glanced over her shoulder at him how could he just fall asleep like that the trip was a onehour excursion over rough terrain an exceptionally large bump jarred her back into a forward position dr symski turned one eye toward her i cant believe im sitting next to the professor carter he said ive read your paper on the gila dwellings amazing stuff and now here you are thanks she said the young researcher had too much enthusiasm for so early in the morning her cup of coffee hadnt kicked in yet and the stench of leaking ozone from the motors batteries was making her queasy i wish you were here with us from the start im afraid theres nothing new left to explore weve already searched cataloged diagrammed and explored every square inch it was all in the papers i sent you last night she rubbed at her red eyes it had taken her until four in the morning to read the reams of data two hours of sleep did not make for a pleasant morning i wish someone had faxed me those earlier i would have liked to have gone through them more thoroughly before viewing the site sorry but all this is stamped confidential we were ordered to restrict access until you arrived she watched the road ahead as the mule crawled through the shadows more goddamn secrecy she grumbled ill show you the main areas when we arrive a guided tour if you will hell with that she thought listen dr symski im sure your team was very precise but id prefer to do a little exploring on my own get a feel for the place the study of a site involves more than just numbering and cataloging what do you mean she drew a long breath how to put this into words the more you worked on a dig the more each site developed its own characteror soul for instance the gila dwellings felt different than the chaco canyon site she found this perspective added a unique level of insight into the people and customs never mind she said its just what i do he shrugged ill leave you on your own then i wanted to recheck some measurements anyhow she nodded good he was starting to grate on her nerves settling back into her seat she allowed the road to lull her just as her eyes half closed dr symski stopped the mule with a hard brake here we are he said she looked out nothing but darkness beyond the stretch of headlights where got to kick up the generator first he opened his door and the vehicles interior lights flashed on ben awakened with a startled grunt are we there yet he asked huskily rubbing a hand through his hair yes she said trying to drip as much disdain into her voice as possible you know you could have caught up on your sleep back at camp and miss this no way she watched the young doctor flashlight in hand cross to the far wall where the generator sat he bent over and began fiddling with the unit frowning ashley climbed from the truck hoping the hamfisted military researchers hadnt corrupted the dig so many times in the past key clues to an ancient societys history had been trampled on by the incompetent within moments the generator coughed sputtered then settled into an even rumbling sound floodlights ignited blinding after the dark ride the north wall lit up like a huge stage wow ben said as he climbed out next to her a scaffolding of metal frames and warped boards covered the honeycombed wall of the cavern dwellings extended up the wall in five distinct levels she estimated a total of about forty yards in height the levels connected to one another by either a series of handholds or sets of crude stairs she squinted to the left the excavated dwellings even extended over the lake with plateaus of rock jutting over the water like porches what do you think ashley ben stood to her left i could spend years here ben nodded who do you think built this place she pointed at the wall one thing i know this was not built by homo sapiens then who did it an earlier species of man i suspect look at the size of the caves none over four feet in height too small for modern man perhaps homo erectus but i doubt even that she found herself thinking out loud a neanderthal tribe i dont know ive never seen evidence of a neanderthal tribe building this extensively and how did they get here she shrugged ive got to get a closer look shouldnt we wait for dr symski i dont think thatll be necessary she strode toward the wall placing a mining helmet on her head she heard the scuff of bens boots as he followed her dr symski called to her careful where you step there are many crevasses some quite deep she waved at him in acknowledgment but shook her head what did he think that she was some damned novice she marched faster suddenly something grabbed her from behind instinctively she rammed her elbow backward ouch ben said releasing her and stepping back i was just trying to stop you from stepping in a hole he pointed in front of her rubbing at his solar plexus what do you do sharpen that thing she cupped her elbow as if trying to hide it sorry even pointed out the black hole was barely discernible from the black rock she stepped around it i didnt see it you could have twisted an ankle thanks youre welcome but next time i touch you try not to kill me her face heated up she cleared her throat grateful that they had not reached the floodlit cliffs yet the darkness hid her red face lets check out the lower dwellings she suggested stepping away from him she couldnt tell if she was more embarrassed by her near gaffe or mad at his action or something else he was so unlike her exhusband where scott ever the accountant was steady and often sullen seldom sharing his intimate thoughts bens easygoing manner and good humor were unsettling they arrived at one of the dwelling entrances ladies first ben said ashley avoided looking at him and crouched down lighting up the interior with her helmet lamp the chamber extended back about five yards the walls unadorned rock were obviously carved from the stone and polished she passed a hand over the smooth interior surface impressed by the ingenuity and tenacity of early man with crude tools it must have taken years to excavate each one of the chambers the interior devoid of any hints about its occupants stood empty bending she crawled inside it never hurt to look her helmet scraped across the ceiling as she wormed into the small opening she noticed there was a small hollow in the floor near the entrance probably an ancient firepit she proceeded to the back of the chamber nothing she sat down for a moment pondering who built these homes did you find anything she looked back at ben helmeted and crouched on one knee by the entrance he blocked the whole opening its strange she said what where did they all go he shrugged probably died off went extinct like the dinosaurs she shook her head no that doesnt make sense with the state of this site what do you mean the first researchers only discovered a handful of broken tools and crude stone bowls usually these primitive home sites are brimming with artifacts but here nothing they must have moved on taking their stuff with them exactly she nodded impressed by bens intuitiveness but why leave why spend decades digging out this habitat only to abandon it and what about the diamond statuette why leave it behind ben remained silent if only i could spend more time here she smacked the flat of her hand on the rock why sounds like they already went over everything with a finetooth comb she shook her head no clues are too often missed even after years of study i need more time but why bother we might find a lot more answers during our exploration i hope so she crawled her way toward the entrance ben offered his hand to her as she exited she took it his hand hot in her cold palm he pulled her toward him she was surprised by his strength and her left foot slipped in the damp hollow of the caves firepit and she fell backward landing her backside squarely into the firepit and dragging ben down on top of her bens nose lay an inch from her breast he looked up at her youre not going to hit me again are you sorry i slipped she blushed furiously his body pressing hard on hers he cleared his throat no apology necessary he said grinning down at her a few more slips like this and we might have to get married she grimaced at him just get off of me she meant to be stern but couldnt quite pull it off suddenly uncontrolled she began laughing she couldnt help it and couldnt stop it i mean it she said between laughs get off looking at her oddly he crawled off her its good to hear you laugh she wiped a tear from her eye still wracked with occasional bursts of laughter she dropped her head back on the floor trying to catch her breath she stared at the ceiling and saw it up there on the ceiling behind the lip of the entrance goddamn she squinted again at the ceiling it wasnt her imagination goddamn it she sat up what is it ben asked a concerned look on his face those amateurs said they had searched every square inch of this site no artwork no cave drawings she pointed to the ceiling then what the hell is that ben leaned over and twisted his head around what is what you have to lay down i think thats why no ones found it she moved to the side so he could lay down beside her she pointed with the light of her headlamp right there look the crude carving stood in the circle of her light only a hand span wide an oval was chiseled into the ceiling bisected by a jagged line like a lightning bolt ben reached up and with a long whistle traced it with his finger his next words were a whisper you know this sort of looks familiar what do you mean she expected some wisecrack ive seen something like this my granddaddy showed it to me youre kidding no im serious his voice sounded genuine almost amazed my greatgrandmother was full gagudja an aboriginal tribe in the djuwarr region did i ever tell you that no he smiled an inch from her nose gods truth my lady the man seemed to have more sides than the pentagon either that or he was spinning a wild tale she studied him and noted that his blue eyes were coldly serious she swallowed and turned back to the design on the ceiling does it remind you of anything specific he shrugged bumping her shoulder its not exactly the same but it looks sort of like the gagudja symbol for one of their spirit peoples one of their oldest named mimi she considered this information could there be some connection perhaps a lost aboriginal tribe but these dwellings were dated five million years ago aeons before the appearance of aborigines on the australian continent she frowned at the oval drawing it was probably just a coincidence she had seen the universality of some symbols across other cultures could this be the same case here hell the symbol was rather basic this mimi spirit she began what type of spirit was it its just nonsense stories no go on myths often have a kernel of truth tell me he patted the walls of the cave mimis were spirits that lived in rocks she felt a chill crawl down her spine noticing their stone enclosure the mimis taught the first bushman to hunt and paint they were greatly revered and fear just then dr symski returned standing at their feet what are you all doing his voice was both accusatory and embarrassed conscious of their odd position ashley scrambled out i thought you searched this area we did why she pointed to the spot next to ben go look up on the roof the doctor crawled next to the aussie my god he said when he looked where ben pointed its amazing jesus what do you think it means i dont have a clue she said her hands on her hips but i mean to find out linda seated on a blanket watched the crystal lake lap at the rocks along the shore a yard away the water clear as a window teemed with small fish and other marine life a luncheon basket prepared by the mess hall cook was open beside her two halfeaten sandwiches sat on a paper plate bologna and cheese they look like little monsters jason said smiling linda glanced over to the boy crouched over her portable nikon microscope viewing a water sample taken from the lake those coneshaped ones are called tintinnids she said the squarish ones are diatoms what are they some sort of bugs not really more like plants theyre in a family of organisms called phytoplankton they take sunlight and convert it to energy the way a plant does but if they need sunlight like a plantjason swiveled to face her his face scrunched up with concentrationhow do they survive down here in the dark she tousled his hair thats a very good question im not really sure but i believe there must be an underground current carrying the plankton from the surface waters to this underground lake the water is very salty like diluted seawater whats so important about these he pointed at the microscope bugs as linda considered the implication herself she allowed her gaze to drift across the camp she noticed a flurry of activity among the military personnel by the gorge that split the base probably some sort of training exercise well jason asked recalling her attention she turned back to the boy do you want a science lesson sure he replied enthusiastically all right you asked for it she smiled at him appreciating his inquisitiveness these plankton are the building blocks of life on solid ground grass turns sunlight into energy then a cow eats the grass then we eat the cow this is the way the suns energy is passed on to us in the sea it is the phytoplankton that turns sunlight into energy the phytoplankton is then eaten by small creatures such as jellyfishshe pointed to the small fish just offshorewhich in turn get eaten by those tiny fish then even bigger fish eat the little fish and so on so even in the sea sunlights energy is passed along do you understand so these plankton thingies are like our grass exactly they are the grassy fields from which this ecosystem sprouts he nodded neat so weve done step one and determined that the water is alive next after we finish our sandwiches we have to collect some of the creatures that live in the water i saw some starfish close to the shore over there and some sponges wanna help me get a few you bet later one of the marines promised to catch us one of those glowing fish too she was curious about the phosphorescent properties of these large fish never having seen anything like them before she grew excited by the prospect of classifying a new fish species why dont we start now jason began to rise i saw some hold it young man she pointed at the plate you finish your lunch first youre my responsibility until your mother gets back he curled his lip and plopped back down on the blanket oh all right passing him his sandwich she took a bite of her own lets hurry up though weve got fish to catch big ones he added with a small smile the biggest we could have them for dinner glowing fish yuck hey buddy dont knock it if the lights go out you can still see what youre eating that started him laughing she grinned almost forgetting the miles of rock that hung over her head ben watched ashley bend over and study the altar site damn nice curves on that woman he took off his helmet and wiped a red handkerchief across his damp forehead it was getting late and his stomach was growling thank god this was the last chamber to investigate he sighed as he watched ashley pull out a measuring tape not again he cursed under his breath since this mornings discovery he had felt like a third wheel tagging along behind ashley and dr symski as they explored stopping in each chamber measuring scraping sampling boring he had hoped to spend more private time with ashley but with the discovery of the carving both doctors were like bloodhounds on a scent nothing could distract them not a joke not a quip he was all but invisible so this is where you found the diamond figurine ashley knelt down beside the raised dais of stone it mushroomed from the floor of one of the chambers the pedestals carved from the base stone suggestive that the builders purposefully designed this chamber all the other chambers have their firepits in this location she pointed up to the ceiling also this is the only room that doesnt have an oval symbol above the door ben stood on the lip of rock that acted as a doorstep to the chamber he glanced over the edge to the water far below the chamber was on the highest level and was located on the section of cliff wall above the lake without the scaffolding it would have been a difficult climb even for him ashley turned to dr symski who crouched in the back of the dwelling when your researchers found the statue she asked was the figure facing out or in well he shuffled his feet you see there was this accident the first man in here knocked it over we dont know which way it was facing she slapped the altar stone what other key details did you botch dr symski flushed ben feeling irritable himself with all this nitpicking intervened what difference does it make whether it was facing in or out or lying on its freakin back ashley with narrowed eyes turned to him it makes all the difference in the world this is the only significant artifact in the dig it must have once had great importance to the culture here if it was facing out when it was found it was probably a warding charm to keep evil spirits away if it was facing in then it probably was a worship tool used in rituals ben scratched behind his ear a trickle of sweat ran down from under his helmet in the bigger scheme of things what difference does it make if it was a charm or an idol how is that going to solve the bigger mystery of where they went she opened her mouth to answer then shut it with an almost audible snap i give up was all she mumbled as she shoved past him and began climbing down ben immediately regretted his remark he knew instinctively that he had blown any progress hed made that day impressing and charming ashley wait up he called climbing down after her dr symski followed to hell with both of you she called out not even looking back it was a quiet ride back to alpha base nine mom you should have seen the fish we caught jason spread his arms as wide as he could reach almost bumping linda who was seated next to him at the dinner table it was bigger than this thats some fish ashley said it was phosphorescent that means it glowed ashley noticed he had chosen to sit next to linda at tonights dinner table the two of them must have had a great day together it was blue with huge teeth sounds bloody weird mate ben said as he entered the dining room his hair still damp from a shower a real dingoling hey ben jason said greeting him with a milewide smile you should have been there sorry champ ben said had to help your mother he sat downa couple seats away from ashley she knew why he chose to sit so far away she shifted her peas around her plate admitting that she had been a real bitch this afternoon perhaps she should apologize for her outburst earlier she opened her mouth to speak when the dining room door swung open and khalid entered good evening everyone he said as he crossed to sit on the other side of linda sorry im late but i ran into dr blakely who asked me to mention hes going to be involved with lastminute arrangements and wont be joining us for dinner ashley noticed someone else was missing has anyone heard from michaelson yes linda said holding up a hand well actually not directly a marine who helped us fish today told me that major michaelson was housing in the military section of the base across that gorge whys he doing that ashley said weve got plenty of room here this buildings practically empty i guess hes getting those other two men ready for the trip linda said our guards great she thought two more guntoting men along for the ride but this was no time to grouse it was the eve of their adventure besides as leader she should say something something dramatic something uplifting though her mind was blank she set down her fork determined to say something while she watched the others finish their dinners she struggled to find the right words by the time ben had wiped the gravy off his plate with a slice of sourdough and patted his belly with a sigh she still had no idea what to say to hell with proper words ashley cleared her throat id like to make a toast she raised her water glass and stood up the others looked at her expectantly over the past few days weve all had a lot thrown at us and i think were all feeling trampled on but tomorrow we embark on a trip where the success of our mission will depend on our ability to work as a team and as much as blakely may get under my skin personally i think he put a hell of a team together so she said raising her glass higher heres to us to the team to the team the group echoed hoisting their drinks yeah to you guys jason said swigging from his cola linda tousled his hair what about us girls jason blushed you know what i meant i know linda leaned over and kissed him on the cheek thanks jason turned an uncomfortable shade of purple as ashley smiled at her sons consternation she felt a tap on her shoulder ben stood behind her he leaned and whispered in her ear id like to talk to you would you mind a short walk after dinner umm she hedged caught off guard this was the last thing she had expected ive got to put jason to bed well how about after that i just need a few moments is it important cant it wait until morning well id rather get this off my chest tonight sure she agreed reluctantly i guess i can see you in a bit hows half an hour fine ill meet you outside the entrance im gonna fetch a jacket she nodded and watched him leave jason lets head back up to our room her son more his normal shade now that lindas attention had turned to khalid pushed back his chair with a loud squeak can i watch cable sure but only for a half hour then to bed she collected him under her arm squeezing him and waved to the other two see you in the morning linda waved back and khalid nodded after settling jason in front of a rerun of gilligans island ashley pulled on a yellow sweater ill be back in a little bit jason waved to her as she left his eyes never leaving the screen ashley pushed through the door to the outside and spotted ben talking to a guard he waved to the marine and crossed over to her thanks for coming she wrapped her arms around her chest so how about we walk over to that gorge he pointed toward the opposite end of camp ive heard the area is a bonzer makeout spot she placed her fists on her hips if you think thats not why i came out here ben grinned at her im just teasing then what did you want to talk about cmon lets walk i really want to see this chasm i barely caught sight of it when we crossed yesterday he offered his arm cmon she ignored the arm and walked past him i cant be away too long jasons waiting up he caught up and strode beside her about this afternoon she held up a hand i know i know i overreacted no not at all i was being a jackass she turned to him is that what you think sure do i was butting my big nose where it doesnt belong she studied his serious eyes and determined jaw limned in the lantern light of a nearby tent see she said a tightness in her throat thickening her words thats whats really bothering me what he brushed a hand across hers but she pulled away im supposed to be the big leader here guiding and motivating the team but a simple question sends me ballistic some leader i make her voice cracked a bit hey dont beat yourself up he reached out farther and clasped her hand his touch igniting her like an electric shock she made a weak attempt to pull away but he held her too firmly listen ash you were pressed for time hell you only had a single day to explore the ruins and i had to distract you with stupid questions your questions werent stupid my response was she tried to draw her hand free but as she pulled he stepped closer i how brightly his eyes reflected the lanterns light i think wed better continue with our walk she finally freed her hand yeah he glanced away from her youre right they continued across the camp in silence the quiet soon became painful you know she said now that ive had time to think about it what really ticked me off this afternoon was that you were right about what the statue for now it is not that vital to know in which direction the statue was facing sometimes i get so fixated on the details that i miss the bigger picture and when you brought this to my attention i lashed out im sorry hey you were under a lot of pressure besides i like people who speak their mind she smiled people like you he said in a whisper thanks ben they rounded a quonset hut and a black gash split the ground ahead to the left a lighted bridge crossed the gorge as soon as they stepped into the lighted area a guard called to them from the bridge stop right there the gun pointed toward them punctuated his statement this area is restricted my my ben whispered in an aside to her as a second guard approached i can see why everyone thinks this is a romantic spot the stonefaced guard checked their identification cards youre clear he turned to the other guard by the bridge and gave him a thumbsup sign sorry for the scare but were tightening security why she asked sorry maam thats classified information he turned and proceeded toward the bridge ashley turned to ben what do you make of that he shrugged who can figure the military bunch of buffoons i know i wouldnt mind pushing the lot of them into that damned chasm hey what do you know we do have something in common he spun on a heel very militarylike to head back to the dormitory he offered his arm this time she took him up on his offer blakely stretched leaning away from the console he glanced at a clock on the wall a few minutes after midnight now that was cutting it down to the wire the team would be leaving in nine hours all green lights said a voice behind him finally he turned to the head of communications lieutenant brian flattery i knew those new circuit boards would do the trick the doctor said with the communications net intact well be able to communicate to my team anywhere on the planet thats good said flattery but still dont fret this time itll be different flattery glanced at the floor we never found wombleys body only that splat of blood i know i know and theres still no word from the other team its been four months and what about the recent disappearance of the guard by the chasm blakely held up a hand he had heard similar rumblings across the camp were prepared this time well be in regular communication shouldnt this group be forewarned of the risk theyre taking blakely shrugged major michaelson and his two men know thats whats important i guess im going to have to give the rest of the team some details but they dont need to know everything this time were proceeding with foreknowledge of the risks were properly armed we dont really know that blakely squinted at the line of green lights on the communications console he tapped one light that fluttered it stabilized to a steady green nothing to worry about book three chutes and ladders ten the pack was heavy the cushioned straps cutting into ashleys shoulders she shrugged it off and set it down at her feet heavy but manageable she saw linda grimace as she tried to adjust her own backpack over her shoulders ashley reached over and tugged the bag higher on lindas back carry it like that and it wont be so bad linda smiled but creases of worry still etched her brow thanks i just have to get accustomed to it ashley nodded we all do she thought ashley led linda toward the group clustered near the teams radio blakely was explaining its operation to ben khalid and major michaelson our web of receivers and transmitters operates at an ultralow frequency theyre buried and spread out so we will be able to communicate through hundreds of miles of rock in all directions major michaelson hefted the radio testing its weight sort of like the buried transmitters that guide our submarines exactly the same principle lowlevel reverberations the system has been tested and checks out fine how often do we establish contact ashley asked as she stepped up three times a day at the designated hours blakely responded he pointed at the radio this is the most important piece of equipment youll be carrying major michaelson tapped his pistol at his waist this is my most important piece of equipment ben snorted youre both wrong shows your lack of caving experience he pointed to his belt with its ring of batteries this is your most important piece of equipment without batteries you have no light without light you cant see what youre shooting at and no radio in the world is going to guide your ass out of a hole he gripped his battery belt this is your lifeblood down here everyone was staring now at ben of course he said pulling out a roll of toilet paper from his pack this is right bloody important too ashley smiled and linda suppressed a giggle ben did have his moments she had to give him that what about water khalid asked standing up from where he had been hunched over the radio dehydration is a major danger isnt it sort of but most major cavern systems have abundant pools of potable water just conserve your canteen between watering holes ashley gritted her teeth radios guns batteries water lack of any of them could incapacitate the mission too many variables for her tastes the remainder of their pack contents was then explained freezedried food in tinfoil packets electrolyte replacement fluid collapsed air mattresses for sleeping a firstaid kit a small box of toiletries and coiled on top of it all a thick spool of rope besides the backpack each member had a lightweight climbing harness with a chalk bag to dry ones hands and a helmet with a carbide lamp bens pack contained additional climbing equipment carabiners quick draws and anchoring bolts the need for this equipment was obvious to ashley major michaelsons pack however frightened her it contained four more pistols a collapsed rifle and boxes and boxes of sealclothwrapped ammunition if that wasnt enough the team had finally been introduced to the two other members of their expeditionmajor skip halloway and major pedro villanueva the insignia of an eagle gripping a trident on their shoulders advertised their expertise navy seals the elite they wore weapons at their waists and each hefted a double pack a heavy load but they looked like muscled machines workhorses with weapons ben nudged her bloody lot of firepower were dragging with us she nodded i dont like it i heard about those seals never go anywhere without a wicked arsenal ashley chewed her lower lip why do you think blakely interrupted from here professor carter will be in charge her word is my word ashley noticed a smirk from the redheaded seal skip halloway he elbowed his buddy whose expression remained stoic blackhaired and blackeyed pedro villanueva was as difficult to read as a slab of marble she sighed great two more macho men to keep under her thumb she noticed she wasnt the only one checking out the newcomers khalids face was clouded with an especially dour expression as he studied the seals his lips then curled up at the corners in an unpleasant manner he turned away to whisper something in lindas ear she smiled covering a laugh with a small hand so ben said are you ready to lead this ragtag band of adventurers into the heart of the world right now im just hoping theres no mutiny ashley crossed toward the small opening in the south wall of the cavern she eyed the tiny tunnel called a wormhole it looked more like a sewer drain to her the black entrance stood only two and a half feet high she crouched and shined her hand lantern down the tube with a backpack on she estimated it would be nearly impossible even to crawl through these holes to answer this riddle the final piece of their equipment was introduced blakely handed her a wheeled plastic board a skateboard ashley spun a wheel across her palm i prefer to call them transport sleds blakely said specifically designed for these chutes here let me show you he picked up another of the seven fluorescentcolored boards he slapped the surface of the board with the flat of his hand we already devised aluminum motorized sleds but they are too bulky to carry these on the other hand are highimpact plastic both the board and the wheels the ball bearings are composed of a corrosionresistant titanium perfect for the terrain and the dampness just release this latch like so and the board expands to the length of your upper torso supporting chest and pelvis and allowing the rider to ride belly down using gloved hands and feet for propulsion and braking sort of like a surfboard ben said but on land well yes i guess that analogy is accurate once through a chute the board can be collapsed back to its original size and stored in a pack each board has been fitted to the individual names are stenciled on the back of each and each is a different color to make it easier to tell them apart ashley practiced releasing and collapsing the board easy and mercifully lightweight all this preparation just to slide through these tubes dr blakely asked linda where did these wormholes come from are they lava tubes yes and no said blakely true this area is honeycombed with lava tubes some no bigger than a fist and others as large as a man lava tubes are usually rough and irregular as are most of the ordinary tubes around here but tubes of this diameterhe pointed at the wormholeare exceptions theyre uniform in size and polished to a remarkable smoothness how and why he shrugged yet another mystery to solve how far have you explored up to now ashley asked obviously many other chutes had already been studied these wormholes extend from this central cavern like spokes on a wheel some just deadend but most like this one connect to a series of interconnecting caverns that extend deeper and deeper below the surface seismic readings suggest this system may extend several hundred miles and you explored no farther ashley raised her eyebrows but youve been down here for months blakely just stared at her for several heartbeats taking off his glasses he pinched the bridge of his nose the others stopped what they were doing and turned to them attracted by the silence ben put down one of the skateboards he had been examining and crossed over to ashleys side michaelson stepped up tell them he said his eyes glued on blakely they deserve to know more blakely lifted a hand up palm toward the major i was just getting to that ashley had a sudden sinking feeling in her gut professor carter blakely said im not proud of what im about to reveal but certain expediencies dictated this course weve had to keep certain secrets no kidding ben said ashley hushed him with a glare then turned an even harsher eye on blakely go on what secret you asked me if weve explored farther well we have he pointed to the wormhole youre not the first team to explore this route a joint team of five researchers and one marine entered this chute over four months ago ashley shook her head then why drag all of us here if its already been explored the other team has yet to return what ben said stepping closer you mean theyre still down there without radios we had no means of tracking the team they were scheduled to return after two weeks of exploring three weeks passed with no word from them so we sent in a search party a cursory search revealed a massive maze of tunnels shafts and caverns no trace of the men was found why the hell didnt you expand the search ben was redfaced by now without adequate means of radio contact the search parties were at risk they could meet the same fate as the original team so the search was called off the team was declared lost great ashley said what if we get in trouble do you just walk away from us too this is bullshit added ben downright cowardice blakelys fist clenched a tightness narrowing his eyelids that team was under my supervision i took their loss personally i could not risk losing any others we lost the first team because we were excited and proceeded without proper caution i refused to allow any others to search farther until an adequate communications system could be installed he shoved a finger toward the radio now it is ben didnt back down sorry but i still think a small team michaelson interrupted it was my decision too ashley turned toward the major who stood by the packs well then why the hell didnt you do something michaelson met ashleys stare squarely as head of the marine contingent here it was my call whether to proceed blindly or to take dr blakelys advice and wait until he completed his radio net i chose to proceed cautiously just like the military ben said sourly a sneer frozen on his lips personnel are just pawns to be thrown away as needed who cares if this other team was comprised of real men with real lives just throw them to the wind michaelson his jaw clenched spun away on a heel ben had an angry frown on his lips an ugly expression for him ashley thought ashley stepped after the major meaning to confront him further but blakley reached and touched her elbow as she tried to pass by the doctor he whispered in her ear the majors brother was on that other team ashley stopped and watched michaelson taking inventory of his pack his motions hurried and jerky harry she said softly remembering the majors warm smile as he talked about his kid brothers fascination with vehicles and motors maybe she should say something but now ben called to michaelsons back some camaraderie leaving those men to rot if i were you ashley held a hand toward ben enough its done leave him be she watched michaelson pound his gear into his pack and walk away she turned to blakely now what blakely cleared his throat the decisions of the past are moot what we have to decide now is where we go from here regardless of what you all decide the two seals and major michaelson will be proceeding today searching for clues about the fate of the previous team the rest of the team must make a decision knowing about the other group how many of you want to continue with this team ben spoke up first if it werent for those trapped men id scrap this right now but theyve been waiting long enough im going eyes turned to ashley this changes everything i need time to think this through she said were now a rescue mission no blakely said i consider it a joint mission the first objective remains the same as the previous teamsto explore this system for clues to the origin of the cave dwellers but since your team will be following in the footsteps of the first im hoping both objectives can be achieved simultaneously blakely pointed a finger at ashley thats why i picked you to be the leader here do you still want to command this team ashley frowned you should have warned us earlier i dont like being lied to i never lied to you it was merely a sin of omission i too had no choice i was under orders the fate of the original team is still under tight wraps their families havent even been told yet ben snorted and mumbled under his breath blakely ignored him professor carter she found her thoughts drifting to jason who was safe back at the base under the care of blakelys assistant roland should she take the risk she had other responsibilities besides her career she remained silent ill still go khalid said this is too important me too said linda we might need everyones expertise to find the other team ashley too could not stomach abandoning the other team she turned to blakely fine you still have a team but if we dont have complete honesty from here blakely nodded his voice serious you have my word he stepped back and waved her forward remember well be in contact regularly to map your progress in case of any mishaps otherwise the decisions from here are yours everything from how often to set up camp to the number of days you choose to explore before returning your word is law the eyes of the others fixed on her the magnitude of the search threatened to overwhelm her well said ashley were never going to get anywhere just sitting here lets head out halloway take the lead everyone else follow and well meet up in the next cave the team checked their gear and collected their packs strapping them over their shoulders ashley watched the others fumble with their transport sleds halloway wasnt waiting around for any further discussion he adjusted his helmet and dove down the chute on his board the others waited in line to follow satisfied that they were finally under way ashley pulled on her gloves and strapped the velcro bands she reached for her pack and slipped it over her shoulder as blakely stepped beside her she faced the doctor as the others slipped into the wormhole with ice in her voice she said take good care of my son of course roland will make sure the boy is at the radio each morning so you can check yourself she nodded noting the others had by now all entered the wormhole kneeling down she positioned the skateboard under her body she lit her helmets carbide lamp and grabbed the walls on either side to propel herself into the tube shoving off she entered the chute damn thing still looked like a sewer drain eleven ashley pushed her board into her pack and crossed over to the group clustered by a grove of stalagmites beams of hand lanterns and helmet lamps crisscrossed the blackness like fireflies in a jar the cavern was about the size of a football stadium infinitely smaller than alpha caverns grand canyon scale a firm breeze balmy and moist blew through the cavern linda held a handkerchief up and it flapped like a flag in the breeze caverns breathe in and out ben was explaining to linda as ashley walked up a response to changes in barometric pressure ive even flown a kite in a cavern in belize linda lowered her arm i love this wind its so so refreshing all right team ashley said as she stepped next to ben the next kilometer of this system has already been mapped so we can proceed at a fast clip ben raised a hand id like to make a suggestion ashley nodded by all means i want everyone to feel free to offer input and suggestions we are a team before we get to the unexplored areas ahead i think we should buddy up caving involves more climbing up and down than walking on flat surfaces in pairs we can assist each other over the rough spots sounds good ashley said i think ben continued also by buddying up we can conserve our batteries by having each pair only keep a single lamp lit in this darkness even a single light casts a big spot he grinned at her after a day down here too much light hurts the eyes trust me she nodded turning to the rest of the team she pointed a thumb at ben lets do it then everyone pick a partner ben stepped immediately toward her howdy partner whoa ashley said did you happen to notice we have an odd number of people here as leader ill join other pairs as the need arises by this time linda and khalid had already matched up and the two seals had their heads bowed together whispering the remaining teammates michaelson and ben stared at each other shit the major mumbled me and my dumb ideas ben said with a shake of his head ashley hid a grin as she adjusted her pack with that out of the way lets head on weve got a lot of ground to cover she nodded toward the pair of grumbling men ben and michaelson will take the point lets all pay strict attention to ben for the next few miles hes the most experienced in caving and i want everyone to learn proper spelunking skills and safety precautions lets not end up like that other team the group shifted backpacks into place and excess hand lanterns were clicked off the level of light ashley noted did not diminish to any significant degree she followed ben and michaelson as she walked she cast her lantern back and forth the darkness sucking at her light her mind turned to her missionboth missions she imagined being stranded in this stygian blackness watching the last of her batteries drain away while the darkness enveloped her in a cold embrace she shivered and what about the cliff builders those longlost ancestors of man how did they survive in this eternal darkness she shook herself from this reverie as the team arrived at the next wormhole entrance she stepped to the front ben had his notebooksized compass open a geopositional tool tuned to a radio transmitter at the base that allowed ben to calibrate not only their precise position in relation to the points of the compass but also the teams depth they call this a map ben said as guide he was keeper of the sketchy diagram drawn by the previous searchers its crap look he shoved the paper toward her no compass points no distinct cavern delineations no depth markers no wonder the other team got lost thats why youre here ashley said you just map our way back home were counting on you well he said stumbling for words the wind knocked out of his sails a child could have done a better job then that makes you right for the job he looked sharply at her and she gave him her best innocent expression seemingly satisfied he turned away his compass in hand she shook her head sometimes he and jason were frighteningly similar if everyone is ready she said lets proceed i want to be into the new territory by the time we set up camp tonight ashley hesitated just a little farther ben called to her from below sucking at her lower lip she stared down the steep slope before her it looked more like a mile greased with mud the cliff was slick as ice her eyes snaked upward following her rope michaelson was snugged into a crevice several yards above and secured in place with a safety rope above him at the lip of the cliff hung villanueva clinging to a spur of rock and secured with a safety line it was these two mens jobs to ensure a safe descent for the other teammates ashley took a deep breath and pushed away from the wall as she had been instructed allowing the rope to brake in the carabiner bars to stop her descent she scrabbled downward the toe of her left boot balancing on a protruding stone just a little farther the stone that had been supporting her suddenly slipped loose and tumbled downward she plummeted after it the rope racing between her gloved hands ben had schooled them to yell falling when this sort of thing happened but with her breath caught in a fearconstricted grip all she could do was let out a highpitched whine after a heartbeat the whistling rope snagged in her carabiner and her descent jerked to a halt a grunt of protest echoed from above as michaelson caught her weight hey careful up there ben yelled you damn near gave me a rock facial sorry she said to the muddy wall swinging inches from her nose both hands clamped on the rope cmon relax kid ben said just get those feet back on the wall and finish the descent youre almost on solid ground it was the solidness of that ground that concerned her she had pictured her head slamming into that solid ground as she was falling but she wasnt about to remain hanging here there was only one way out of this predicament pulling into a squatting position she got her boots up on the wall and straightened her legs out pushing from the wall with a jump she rappelled down two yards and caught the wall with her boots not hesitating this time she shot outward again and dropped another couple of yards after two more hops she felt bens arms around her waist there you go he said in her ear piece of cake she settled her legs on the rocky floor her knees wobbling a bit yeah no problem this is good practice luckily we came across this bunny slope the first day im sure theres hairier cliffs ahead of us she craned her head back villanueva was just a blur of light at the edge of the cliff above she suppressed a groan leaning on a stalagmite and this was only day one ashley rubbed her back lowering herself slowly onto her air mattress she could hear michaelson mumbling into the radio several yards away giving his final report of the day the team had discovered signs of the previous partys passagediscarded items boot tracks in silt scruffs on rockand were sticking close to their trail she let out a long sigh stretching a sharp jab in her lower back protested the motion their progress today seemed more like a battle slippery mud covered most of the walkways sharp gypsum crystals clung to her entire body like sand on a beach and grew more abrasive with each step steep slopes and sharp inclines impeded their forward movement slowing them to a crawl worst of all though was the heat an omnipresent wet blanket that grew heavier as the days journey wore on she took off her headband and twisted it wringing out a stream of sweat she now understood how risky dehydration was in caving she unscrewed the top of her canteen almost empty now tipping it back she swallowed the last warm drops youll have to watch your water ben warned we cant count on finding a water hole every day he nodded toward the small lake pooled in the back half of the cavern half hidden by an outcropping of rock i knew about this water hole she said its on the map true but this is the last cavern marked on the map from here its to points unknown i know ill be more conservative tomorrow we should remind everyone in the morning especially linda she ran out of water at lunch and has been borrowing from my canteen yours too huh ben said with a smile she finished the last of mine an hour ago clever girl ashley said by the way where is she over at the pond getting a drink of water she shook her head tomorrow well need to be more strict with rationing oh just leave her be i was just joking shes over there doing a water analysis besides shes having a tough time of it we all are ben gestured toward the two seals who were setting up the campstove a handful of yards away light pooled around them from their lanterns they barely broke a sweat she watched as villanueva stripped off a khaki tshirt and wiped his face and armpits before slipping into a green vest with a small pop halloway lit the butane for the campstove both appeared as refreshed as if todays journey were nothing more than a sunday walk through the park while everyone else dragged as if just completing the bataan death march haggard bonetired her stomach rumbled audibly ben raised an eyebrow im hungry too but theres nothing except freezedried beans and franks right now that would fit the bill ben grinned though a beer to wash it all down now that would be heaven as he sat down on his own mattress he suddenly swatted at his arm hey something just bit me what he shined a light on his arm she leaned over and looked at the spot looks like a mosquito bloody large skeeter just bout took a chunk out of my arm quit exaggerating he poked her with a finger wait until you get speared dont come crying to me thats odd she said scratching behind an ear whats a mosquito doing in antarctica way down here bens expression became serious good question you dont often find insects down here crickets a few spiders centipedes that sort of thingbut i dont think ive ever seen a mosquito ashley wondered at the significance of such a discovery maybe wed better ask our biologist thanks for sharing your water today khalid said linda i couldnt have made it without your help anytime he said breathing in the dank air he sat on a rock watching linda scooping water into small glass vials he appreciated the wide furrow of moisture down the middle of her back pasting the cotton tshirt to her body the clasp of her bra was visible through the thin fabric he bit his tongue to control his rising lust smiling at him linda stood up and sat on the boulder beside him shaking the vial in her hand that last ridge was brutal im glad were done for the day he could feel her body heat pulsing across the hand span of space between them they sat in silence linda studying the crystal surface of the pond khalid studying her my god she suddenly exclaimed jumping to the edge of the black water khalid look over here she crouched on her knees waving him toward her he crossed to her inhaling her scent a hypnotic perfume in the moist air what is it she lifted a curled shell dripping and luminescent in the lamps glow that had been partially hidden by a rock in the shallows khalid cocked his head to the side it looked similar to a snails shell but it was huge almost the size of a watermelon he asked again what is it she rolled into a seated position cradling the large shell in her lap if its what i think it is she shook her head and placed a hand on his knee if it wasnt for your insistence that we stay a little longer i may have missed it her hand was a burning ember on his knee he fought against pulling her into a hard embrace a tightening in the crotch of his coveralls protested his restraint whats so special about an empty shell he asked in a strained voice before she could answer voices intruded im telling you the damned skeeter bit worse than a snake with broken fangs ben spotted khalid and linda crouched by the shore of the pond he noticed linda slip her hand from the geologists knee just as they rounded the rocky escarpment ben raised an eyebrow ashley cleared her throat announcing their presence linda she said as she approached ben was just bitten by an insect that looks a lot like a mosquito we wanted your opinion oh sure no problem did you catch one well kind of he said pointing to the smashed bug still smeared on his forearm she smiled taking his forearm in her hands and rotating it into the light you didnt leave me much to go on she leaned in closer i cant say for sure there are hundreds of species of bloodhungry midges flies and mosquitoes this could be anything she released his arm i was curious ashley said ben told me there are seldom any biting insects in caves linda scrunched up her eyebrows that makes sense what would they feed on no warmblooded species down here she shook her head they must gain sustenance in some other manner but this individual was taking advantage of a new source for lunch she shrugged these caverns just get more and more curious she clasped one arm around a large shell look at this for instance she held up the shell for ashley and ben to examine do you recognize this ashley took it from her and held it up rotating it to view it from all angles and running a hand along its spiral loop looks like a mollusk shell but im unfamiliar with the species besides youre the biologist and youre the archaeologist if it wasnt for my study of evolutionary biology i wouldnt have recognized it well what do you think it is ben asked lifting the shell into his hands curious what all the commotion was about its the shell from an ammonite a predatory squid linda said species maorites densicostatus what ashley snatched the shell back from ben she examined it again with keener interest now holding it like it was the finest porcelain thats impossible this is an actual shell not a fossil ben stared at his empty hands whats the big deal whats so bloody exciting about it anyway both women ignored him are you sure ashley asked paleobiology was not a specialty of mine yes linda said look here at these striations no modern mollusk has this conformation and look at the chambering inside only one species has this unique shell definitely an ammonite ashley leaned in closer but whats it doing here ammonites died out with the dinosaurs at the end of the cretaceous period this is an old shell but i dont believe it dates back sixtyfive million years let me take a look ben said lifting the shell many caves have preserved fossils protected from the weather maybe this shell is just well preserved linda nodded perhaps but before the expedition in preparation for the trip i read up on antarcticas wildlife on seymour island not far from here scientists discovered many ammonite fossils remains that dated later than the cretaceous extinction cretaceous extinction ben asked whatre you talking about ashley answered about million years ago at the end of the cretaceous period a great cataclysm wiped out huge numbers of species including the dinosaurs some researchers theorized a massive asteroid struck the earth at that time blowing up clouds of dust that blocked the sun and chilled the planet right linda added and the paleontologists studying antarctica now believe that antarcticas polar vortex may have stirred the winds enough to keep the asteroids skydarkening particles clear of this area sparing this continent the great extinction ben interrupted thats all old history so these snails survived longer than anyone thought so what i mean linda khalid called he had wandered off and knelt by the edge of the pond heres another shell he reached into the water immersing his arm almost to his shoulder i cant reach wait no there i got it he pulled his drenched arm out his hand clasped around a shell larger than the first one he straightened up holding the shell above his head like a trophy ben shook his head showing off bigtime he thought he opened his mouth to make a comment when suddenly from the shell a flurry of thrashing tentacles sprouted linda gasped the tentacles latched onto khalids arm khalid tried to shove the squid off his arm but it clung tenaciously tears welled at the corner of his eyes and he grimaced with pain the damned thing is biting me rivulets of blood could be seen beginning to trail down his arm groaning khalid swung his arm cracking the shell against the rock wall beside himto no avail ben pulled a knife from his belt hold still khalid froze then a spasm of agony contorted his face just get the thing off he said between clenched teeth ben slipped the blade between tentacle and skin it was a tight fit the creatures appendages clamped tightly to the flesh of khalids arm ben sawed through the meat of one tentacle and greenish black ooze spurted from the amputated end the thing tightened its other appendages eliciting a groan from khalid the monsters strength was fierce if it constricts much more ben thought itll crush bone he cautiously worked the knife under a second tentacle and cut this time the thing twitched and loosened after slicing through two more appendages the creature released khalids arm dropped to the cave floor wobbled and sucked its remaining tentacles back into its shell khalid dropped to his knees with a low moan a hand clasped over the wound blood seeping between his fingers ben kept an eye on the shell black ooze dripping from its opening with a scowl he swung a boot and kicked the shell in a high arc over the pond with a splash the creature sank from view ashley yelled at him why the hell did you do that we could have studied it my god its an extinct species ben pointed to khalids bloody arm extinct my ass hell live major villanueva said ashley watched him apply the bandage to khalids arm with a piece of waterproof tape the seal with his advanced training as a field medic had taken over as soon as they had arrived back at camp after cleaning the wound he treated khalid with topical and systemic antibiotics can he continue on with us she asked villanueva shrugged one shoulder nothing more than a deep puncture to the muscle of the forearm and some bruising hell be fine she nodded and turned away good shed hate to lose a team member before they had reached uncharted territory as she passed the campstove halloway offered her a bowl of lukewarm chili and beans in a tin pan she accepted it with a curt word of thanks and settled onto her air mattress with the pan balanced in her lap ben had already scraped his bowl clean and looked greedily toward her plate so hows khalids arm he asked fine they shot him full of antibiotics and painkillers ben set down his plate that was one bloody weird creature she shrugged and spoke around a mouthful of beans i was talking to linda she said their main food source was a type of prehistoric lobster and these waters are teeming with crustaceans of various types so i suppose in this isolated environment the squid survived on similar food makes you wonder about what he nodded across the camp where michaelson had disassembled his rifle into small metal parts and inspected and cleaned each item what else has survived down here that night ben had the dream again he was walking through the cavern of his childhood nightmares full of columns that sprouted fruitbearing limbs light suffused from all directions and as he wandered through the grove something seemed to be drawing him forward calling to him hello he hollered into the empty cavern whos there drawn toward the north side of the cavern he tried to follow the song of the invisible sirens but the trees crowded closer blocking his passage unable to squeeze between the columns any farther he could only peer past the trunks the north face of the cavern glowed with a soft light except for a single black hole in the wall a small cave like the dwellings found near alpha base is anyone there he called his face pressed between two trunks no answer he waited pushing against the trunks as if he could shift the rocky columns as he watched someone crawled from the small cave on wrinkled hands and gnarled knees the old man stood into the light dark face painted with yellow and red stripes dressed in a loincloth the figure waved him forward ben stretched out an arm struggling to pass between the trunks of stone grandfather with a start ben jolted awake bathed in sweat he sat up on his air mattress only a single lantern illuminated the sleeping camp villanueva who sat on a rock raised a glance toward him the seals had insisted on posting guards after the squid incident no one had argued settling back into bed ben rolled over his back to the light the dream echoed in his mind as if bouncing off the rock walls around him he still felt a vague pull a drive to continue deeper into the maze he squeezed his eyelids closed twelve cmere ben called to ashley look at this wiping her hands on the seat of her coveralls she crossed over to ben what did you find after three days on this trek into unmapped territory she was getting used to bens continuous chatter he was always pointing out unusual cave formations to herdogtooth spars boxwork formations cave pearlsoften scowling when she didnt respond with the correct degree of awe coming up behind him she leaned over his crouched form in his hands he held a tin cup dented on one side the handle snapped off it looked just like the ones they carried with their canteens yeah so what she said its not ours she knelt at his side taking the cup are you sure maybe someone dropped no he said its caked in old silt half buried its got to be from the first team i think they camped here for a night this cavern has potable water he pointed to a stream that crossed the center of the small cavern and look how this area of mud is trampled i bet if we looked hard enough we would find other debris from their bivouac i think youre right she sighed since the last switchback yesterday thered been no signs of the previous explorers we should let michaelson know hes been nervous as a mare in heat since we lost track of the original team ben snorted his agreement this should light a fire under him they crossed the cavern hopping over a small stream that had dug a trough through the center of the cavern and wove around the many stalagmites clustered across the floor ben proceeded ahead ashleys helmet light spotted on his backside she watched as he climbed over a small outcropping muscles bunching and relaxing the damp and muddy coveralls clinging tight she swallowed and pointed her lamp to the left away from ben she wiped a hand across her brow these damn caves were hot as hell something moved to her left startled she almost lost her grip on a muddy rock swinging her light in the direction of the movement she searched but saw only the usual twisted stalagmites nothing was there ben noticing she had stopped turned back to her do you need a hand no i just thought i saw something moving over there she nodded across to the left but it was nothing just shadows moving with my lamp i guess ben feigned fear eyes searching rapidly to his right and left or perhaps it was that predatory snail looking for more of khalids blood i can see it now the vampire slugs of antarctica she shoved him forward get going within moments they arrived at the next wormhole where the remaining team members clustered slouching on rocks linda was examining khalids arm everyone looked exhausted except of course the two seals perhaps the team should stop early she thought and camp for the night searching for michaelson she noted he was missing greatdid he start his own search already she had told no one about michaelsons brother being a member of the lost team she figured if he wanted to keep it a secret it was his business but she had been watching as the lines of worry creasing his forehead had become deeper and more numerous if he ran off she called to villanueva wheres michaelson he pointed down the chute ahead of him recon damn him she thought he couldnt sit still he always had to be running ahead to check for clues about his brother i didnt authorize anyone to proceed ahead on his own halloway shrugged you werent around well now i am and i expect him back up here on the double again she caught a condescending smirk on the soldiers face ill tell him when he gets back she shoved a finger hard into halloways chest find him now a dark cloud descended upon the seals features halloway towered over her like a lion before a mouse ashley cut him off before he could open his mouth you have your orders soldier she drilled him with her eyes halloway clenched his teeth then suddenly smiled coldly ready or not major michaelson here i come he spun on a heel and within a heartbeat he vanished down the hole she quietly let out her pentup breath linda and khalid stared at her villanueva clearly unimpressed by the exchange shrugged and went back to sharpening a knife ben clapped her around the shoulders causing her to jump good job captain scary sorta bloke isnt he she couldnt stop herself from leaning into his arms shaking just a little from the adrenaline surge of the altercation he squeezed her tighter then guided her a few steps away from the others in a quiet voice he said you did good but you didnt make a friend she nodded then softly broke his embrace i have enough friends but thanks ben anytime ash she looked away resisting the urge to fall back into his embrace just for the momentary comfort they just sat in silence knees touching after a lengthy wait linda finally called look its major michaelson ashley glanced toward the wormhole and saw the major climbing to his feet by the entrance of the wormhole from his dour expression it was evident he was disappointed michaelson she said i thought we all agreed to congregate here for a rest break i know but i had to find out if the other team had come this way if you hadnt been in such a flaming hurry to race ahead and instead like ben had searched this cavern more thoroughly you would have found what you were looking for what do you mean there was a hint of hope in his voice did you find something ben stepped up only this he held up the dented cup not much of a trophy but from major michaelsons responsehis eyes lit up like christmas tree bulbs his slumped shoulders straightenedit could have been the holy grail as usual though he tempered his emotions are you sure its not one of ours he asked soberly ben nodded good he turned to settle his pack on a rock then were on the right path after this rest break we should push forward its still early whoa ashley said its been a long day and with this discovery perhaps we should start fresh in the morning michaelson grimaced i hate to disagree but my reconnaissance into the next cavern did reveal an obstacle we may want to cross today rather than tomorrow and whats that ashley asked wondering if he was just trying to egg the team forward to keep them all racing after his brother a river about ten yards wide fairly swift cuts across the next cavern were going to have to cross it i figured it would be better today get it over with rather than getting wet first thing tomorrow and being soaked all day linda groaned sliding past khalid to join them not today id rather tackle that in the morning heck were wet all day anyway whats a morning dip going to change khalid of course agreed its late i say we camp here too ashley watched the lines on michaelsons forehead deepen apparently the dented cup had made him even more anxious to search for his brother she could tell he needed to push forward youre right after the crossing we can dry out our clothes overnight good plan major with much grumbling they put their gear together and pulled out their skateboards ashley called across to michaelson is halloway waiting down below halloway michaelson raised an eyebrow and glanced around ashleys heart pounded i sent him down after you i thought he was the one who sent you back up here michaelsons features went cold i didnt see anyone thirteen as ashley scooted through the exit of the wormhole she pushed quickly to her feet and stepped aside to allow villanueva room to slide out good he was the last team member the rest scanned the new chamber with their flashlights ben bellowed halloways name she stepped up to michaelson any sign the major shook his head no and with all these damned obstacles its going to be a long search ashley grimaced time was precious if halloway was injured any delay could mean his death she waved her flashlight ahead and groaned at what she saw this could take hours huge spherical rocks a yellowish ocher in color dotted the floor some as big as elephants others the size of cottages several were clustered into nests like huge fossilized eggs others sat by themselves brooding solitary behemoths the boulders towered over the team she shook her head the large rocks chopped up the view of the room making a search with flashlights difficult an injured halloway could be sprawled behind any of those boulders well split up into three teams ashley said struggling to be heard above the echoing babble of the river that coursed in a deep trough through the middle of the cavern she waved ahead well have to search behind each of these boulders ben dragged a fingernail across the surface of one of the rocks bloody hell theyre cave pearls he stepped back and scratched his head never seen them anywhere near this big usually theyre no bigger than grapefruits ben we dont have time for that ashley said there are more important concerns we need to he held up a palm no this is important why she sighed praying he would be brief you see cave pearls are buildups of dissolved limestone layered around a pebble or piece of sand they only form in eddies of flowing water suggesting at one time this cavern had been flooded to the roof great she said so what are you saying do you think this cavern might flood again cut off our return he shook his head no these pearls have been dry for aeons the waterways must have shifted she sighed ben i appreciate your cavern lore but right now we need to concentrate on finding halloway i know thats just it even if he was behind one of these boulders wed know it ben clicked on his flashlight and placed it on the surface of the boulder suddenly the boulder lit up like a huge lamp glowing a clear yellow color theyre translucent even though they look opaque light shines through the bloody things if halloways here hes without his lights ashley sighed any chance of quickly finding halloway was fading fast so hes either hurt or purposefully hiding ben nodded linda who had walked over to the boulder suddenly exclaimed my god look in the center of the rock ben was the next to spot it he let out a long low whistle ashley peered within the stone thats no pebble at the center of your pearl ben pressed a palm flat on the rock anything can seed a cave pearl he waved ashley over to his side we need more light to be certain ashley crouched next to him and clicked on her flashlight focusing into the heart of the stone the stone glowed now with a clear white light even through the distortion of the crystalline layers there was no mistaking the object at the core its a skull a human skull linda spoke from a yard away her voice wavering this one has a skull too you dont think this could be the missing team do you ashley shook her head removing her flashlight from the stone no from the extraordinary size of these rocks they must have started forming a million years ago id say these are our cave dwellers she stepped away from the stone god shed love to spend hours just studying this discovery but this mystery would have to wait damn after three bonecracking days they finally find a clue about the lost civilization but have to ignore it at least temporarily halloways safety depended on an expedient search she raised her voice everybody regroup we need to head out the other team members returned from their cursory check of the neighboring pearls michaelson arrived first i think we should proceed with a systematic search of this side of the river halloway may be injured or have fallen down a crevice ashley nodded as khalid and villanueva stepped up to join them maybe he already crossed the river linda said doubtfully glancing toward the remaining seal villanueva shook his head shifting his stubbybarreled car assault rifle from one hand to the other he would not have abandoned the team he said fiercely ashley turned to face the group then we search here linda and khalid will stay by the wormhole in case halloway comes back while were out ben and villanueva will head north and michaelson and i will curve south that should allow us to canvass the entire area ben interjected i think i should go with you no i want one armed personnel with each search team well need to leave a weapon here with khalid too she turned away from ben since there were no further objections the teams set out ashley called as she and michaelson headed away lets be careful out there keep your eyes openand i want all lights on nows not the time to spare batteries she watched as other lights blossomed in the darkness good she didnt want anyone else disappearing into the dark michaelson helped her hop over a wide hole yet another obstacle so far their progress was impeded by the need to dodge around boulders backtrack out of dead ends and sidetrack dangerous crevices it was no wonder halloway was lost this wouldve been a hell of a lot easier ashley said as she edged around a crevice if the team had been outfitted with walkietalkies we could have just radioed halloway michaelson grunted too much rock wasnt feasible ashley sighed and continued in silence for several yards then asked for the third time so you saw and heard nothing while you were down here wait until we reach the river its roar is deafening a herd of buffalo could have stampeded through here and i wouldnt have heard it he sounded exasperated i hate these delays we should be over that river and on our way by now damn that halloway ashley jumped slightly at the vehemence of his outburst its not his fault what do you mean you had orders to stay by the wormhole you took it upon yourself to venture ahead on your own because of that i had to send someone after you now halloways lost michaelson shook his head i was doing reconnaissance looking for ways to hasten our passage avoid needless delays thats bullshit dennis he stopped at her words his back taut dennis she said i know why youre down here i know about your brother so blakely told you it doesnt matter who told me she said what matters is that your drive to find harry is hurting this mission he tensed even more i dont see that i know thats why im bringing it up someone needs to tell you youre thinking with your gut not your head youre racing past clueslike the dented cup for instance youre flying ahead of the rest of the team alone which is risky enough to yourself but now youve put another team member in harms way he tensed his shoulders and lowered his voice but i have to find my brother ashley placed a consoling hand on his shoulder he flinched from her touch well find him but we work as a team he stood silently for several heartbeats then took an awkward step forward breaking the moment clearing his throat were almost to the river its just up ahead shaking her head ashley followed michaelson around the next boulder the path became more difficult as they approached the roaring river the last yards to the river were blocked by a cluster of cave pearls forcing them to crawl covered in mud they finally reached the rivers edge below black water churned between steep banks its spray rich with salt stung their eyes ashley wiped mud off her forehead with a damp handkerchief and leaned close to michaelson yelling directly in his ear trying to outshout the river below he wouldnt have tried to cross this river alone michaelson nodded maybe ben and villanueva are having better luck he hollered why dont we a scream pierced the roar of the river echoing through the cavern stunned michaelson and ashley stared at each other what the hell she hollered it sounded like it came from across the river michaelson tried to bore his light through the rivers mist it could just be an echo i dont like this lets get everybody back together she turned to trace their route back when a second scream erupted it cut off abruptly wed better hurry michaelson stood his light fixed on the darkness beyond the river ashley grit her teeth she yanked on his arm now soldier were out of here ben scratched behind his left ear what was taking ashley and michaelsons team so long he and villanueva had completed their leg of the search fifteen minutes ago the seal had set an intense pace ben had always considered himself to be in decent shape but as he struggled to keep up with villanueva he felt like someones arthritic grandmother his contribution to the search consisted mostly of him yelling for the seal to slow down still for all their effort they found no sign of halloway arriving back at the wormhole with no new information for linda and khalid ben glanced toward villanueva the seal paced back and forth one hand on a holstered pistol that man was wired as tight as a kangaroo in heat it obviously tortured him to have to wait for the others to return ben too was becoming concerned they should have been back by now he struck the rock he had been examining with his flashlight he should have gone with her he knew more about caves than michaelson what if she disappeared like halloway linda called from where she crouched by a cave pearl the size of a beachball ben come see this ben crossed to her squatted on his haunches beside her what shine your light inside the details are clearer here in this smaller stone linda is this really the right time for this he grumbled but did as she asked an escalating excitement hurried her words look at the orbital ridges they bulge too thickly and the auditory orifices theyre too low on the skull she turned to ben her eyes shining its not human or i should say not modern man the size of the brain case does suggest an advanced hominid but theres too much distortion for me to recognize the species ashley needs to see this shed know linda suddenly looked around voicing bens own concern whats taking them so long to get back a sudden scream echoed through the cavern both ben and linda jumped up linda sidled closer to him bens heart had climbed into his throat and was caught there ashley villanueva already had his pistol raised and stood frozen his flashlight beam acting as a gunsight khalid crossed to linda and like a small moon pulled into a different orbit linda drifted from ben into khalids shadow a second scream ben stepped over to villanueva we need to go after them ben said theyre in trouble no said villanueva we stay here are you crazy theyre being attacked the seals face was stone no the scream was far away beyond the river how can you tell for sure the acoustics in a cave are tricky villanueva continued to study the darkness ahead im sure i dont care im heading out to check on them if you try to leave ill shoot you in the leg the casualness in which he said those words suggested he was not joking who the hell do you think you are im the senior ranking officer here what i say goes but this is the designated rendezvous location if the others are in trouble they will head here well give them ten minutes then what go look for them no we head back up and leave them down here like hell i will michaelson has the radio without him we have no means of communicating topside if hes not back in ten minutes we evacuate ben stared into the black curtain beyond which he imagined horrible acts being played out ashley running hiding pursued by slavering creatures ashley mauled and bleeding he held his breath for most of the ten minutes to hell with the damned seal if she didnt return he knew how to take care of himself in caves villanueva lowered his arm the blackness quickly filled the void of his flashlight greedily reclaiming its lost territory pack up he said over his shoulder were heading out ben shifted from foot to foot straining to pierce the darkness lets go mr brust the seal pointed with his gun dont make this hard ben had an idea wait everyone turn out your lights what said linda a tremor in her voice are you nuts just do it if theres no sign of their lights then well get the hell out villanueva studied him squinting warily one minute linda snuggled closer to khalid as they turned their lanterns off the camp was swallowed up by darkness it took a few seconds for bens eyes to adjust to the blindness the vanquished camp lights still burning dull flares on his retinas as these last traces faded one area persisted off to the left his dilated pupils strained to focus a glowing cave pearl then the glow shifted to another cave pearl closer the lights were approaching someones coming ben said his voice booming with relief theyre on their way back linda said yes i see it too villanueva called for lights the darkness was beaten back by the flaring lanterns within minutes bobbing flashlights could be seen approaching through the darkness the seal still stood with his gun pointed forward once the lights were close enough he yelled stop there identify yourselves ashleys voice came back angrily who the hell do you think it is then michaelsons voice its just us major relax villanueva lowered his gun ashley stomped into camp followed by michaelson who kept glancing toward the river behind him whose bright idea was it to turn your lights off like that ashley asked sourly we were using them as a beacon back here we thought something happened and started racing back almost ran myself right over a cliff linda pointed a thumb at ben just looking for you he said nodding his head toward the seal after we heard the scream our mate here was planning on scrambling back topside with our tails between our legs if you didnt show ashley bristled what the hell michaelson interrupted a hand raised in the air he was correct we had the radio they didnt ben swallowed but to leave you ashley rubbed her temples thoughtfully then nodded hes right next time listen to him ben she brushed past him scanning the camp okay under the circumstances we need to make a decision whether to continue forward or go back michaelson stepped forward i suggest villanueva and i cross the river to take a closer look while the rest of the camp stays put ashley shook her head no we stick together weve already seen what happens when we split up then we evacuate michaelson stated bluntly i wont risk any more civilians halloway knew the risks ashley scowled and what if it was one of us out there screaming would you be so quick to leave michaelson remained silent i thought so she said i think halloway deserves as much support as any of us linda spoke up besides he might just be injured or unconscious hes been silent since the first screams we cant leave without at least looking thoroughly michaelson began to object but ashley held up a hand since its our civilian butts on the line it should be our decision to continue forward or not ben and linda nodded khalid merely stared i say we go forward ashley said any objections the others remained silent fine she said i want to be across that river in thirty minutes ashley paced the rivers edge villanueva had stripped to his underwear and cautiously waded into the oilblack water a rope tied around his waist draped back to the team at the rivers edge michaelson had anchored the rope around a stalagmite nearby we couldve all swum across by now ashley said all this juryrigging is just wasting time no michaelson said looping a knot in the rope the currents too strong if we tried to swim someone could easily be swept away then just tie everyone together with rope she didnt understand why he was being so obstinate didnt he realize every wasted second could mean halloways death ben shook his head and tried to calm her with a smile too easy to get tangled up my dear a good way to get someone drowned a loud splash drew her attention back to the river as villanueva dove beneath the churning water clearing half the stream before resurfacing strong arms cut the water in broad strokes but still the current propelled the seal far downstream linda grabbed ashleys arm pinching hard in panic look ashley followed the biologists outstretched arm back upstream from where they stood a threefoottall dorsal fin albinowhite crested the churning waters then sank back from view ben openmouthed had spotted it too jesus almighty christ michaelson with one hand tangled in the seals anchoring rope struggled to free himself but the rope was cinched tight around his midsection he freed his rifle and tossed it to ben who had the easier shot use it before the thing reaches villanueva fumbling the rifle to his shoulder ben searched the water for his target then just below them a tip of white broke the surface and a blast of rifle fire exploded a small geyser of water erupted where the slug hit the watera good several feet from the fin ben had missed shit said ben pumping a second shell another miss villanueva having heard the shots over the noise of the river had stopped and twisted around to stare at them treading water linda and ashley waved him toward the far shore go get the hell out of there ashley screamed the dorsal fin emerged again to its entire yard of height now slicing the water halfway between the team and the seal in an arcing dive the seal flung his body toward the far shore the water churned white by his pumping arms and legs but the current resisted his progress he seemed to be wallowing like a fly in amber he wont make it to shore ashley thought clenching her fists willing him strength the fin turned smoothly toward the thrashing seal ben had raised the gun once more then lowered it damn it i dont have a clear shot at this angle if i miss i could hit villanueva ashley snatched the rifle and raised it to her shoulder her first shot tore a chunk out of the fin she aimed lower for the second shot below the fin as she pulled the trigger the recoil crashed into her shoulder this time the geyser of water from the shells impact spurted red the fin tilted to the side then sank from view ashleys teeth ground together she expected the injured creature to suddenly lurch out of the water and grind up the seal she watched the rifle butt pressed tight to her shoulder as villanueva reached the riverbank and scrambled up the slippery rock he acknowledged the teams cheers with a wave and marched back upstream ben stepped next to her taking the rifle from her shaking hands i thought you hated guns she rubbed at her hands youve got to know something to hate it ben just nodded seeming to sense she didnt want to continue this conversation she stared across the river villanueva had untied the rope from his waist and was rigging his end to a thick stalagmite michaelson tugged the slack up and secured his end of the rope to a rock on this side creating a rope bridge slung between two stalagmites the two worked as if nothing had happened as if some creature of nightmare hadnt just tried to swallow up one of their teammates the major tested the security of the bridge by tugging at it satisfied he turned to the team now we can cross taking a deep breath ashley steadied her stillpounding heart put it behind you she told herself there is still a team to lead and a teammate to find using carabiner hooks to attach waist harnesses to the rope the team scooted hand over hand across the bridge dangling from the rope ashley was careful not to look down the drop was not far but the thought of what else might be lurking under the black reflection of water was paralyzing villanueva now suited back into his coveralls helped her unhook from the bridge his hand shook a bit as he helped her stand whether from the cold of the water or from the aftershock of such a narrow escape she couldnt tell thanks he said quickly an embarrassed look in his eyes i owe you she tried to answer but he turned his back to her and returned his attention to michaelson the last in line as he crossed over the river as soon as the major had set his boots on the rocky edge ashley called everyone together this section of the cavern is much smaller so well explore this area as a group lets head out keep your eyes and ears open whatever caused those screams may still be out there this search is futile khalid thought he dug black mud from under a fingernail with a small blade halloway had to be dead when would these damned idiots realize it so they could move on he watched the seal examine the wormhole they had discovered no trace of the missing teammate had been found they had searched behind every pebble and down every black crack nothing this is no use villanueva said as he shined his flashlight down the wormhole no ones been through this hole in years look at the layer of mud at the entrance no footprints or sled marks ashley crouched at his side and pushed a finger knuckledeep into the mud youre right if anyone had passed there would be some sign she pushed back up and faced the team theres got to be another exit we missed maybe khalid said trying to wake the team up to get them redirected to the mission at hand he had an agenda to follow whether halloway was found or not maybe he got caught in the river and was washed away michaelson shook his head no the scream was well beyond the rivers edge i agree with ashley there must be another exit khalid hid a scowl before we leave here ashley said i think we should send someone down this wormhole just to make sure any volunteers villanueva pulled out his sled ill go she nodded be careful just check out where this exits and come right back no solo venturing he nodded and slipped into the hole ashley checked her watch rolling his eyes at another delay khalid walked over to where linda sat on a rock she had her arms wrapped tight around her chest as he sat down beside her do you think well find him she asked her voice tiny no no matter what the major believes i think he was washed away linda shuddered he could tell what she was thinking the fin had been as white as the belly of a maggot like some ghost shark coming to claim their souls men and rock he could handle but the creatures down here first the squid trying to gnaw his arm off and now this monster the sight of that fin had made his flesh crawl as if nature were showing them how small they were he remembered as a boy hearing about the sandstorm that had buried his mothers camp in syria killing everyone the black hand of allah they had called it but he knew better it was just nature an indifferent god oblivious to the plans of man to her savagery everyone was vulnerable and khalid hated feeling vulnerable linda hugged herself and kept staring back at the river that albino shark it was huge to support such a predator the aquatic ecosystem down here must be more extensive than anyone had imagined if it werent for halloway i wouldnt mind stopping and doing some tests khalid scowled rubbing at his arm where the ammonite had bit him id rather avoid that ecosystem myself and stick to dry land i found something ben called from several yards away khalid craned his neck to stare over at ben he stood by the cavern wall with a match in his hand ashley called to him what is it ben i found another passage out of here who was he kidding ashley thought eyeing the narrow crack buried in the shadowed fold of the rock face it extended from floor to ceiling but gapped only a foot wide easy to miss nobody could fit through there she said its too narrow no i measured it ben said with what my boot she gave him a blank stare its a cavers rule of thumb if its wider than your boot through there one can scoot i dont think so especially halloway hes a big guy it would be a tight squeeze but i know he couldve fit besides who knows if theres anything on the other side in answer ben held up a lighted match to the crack the flame bent away from the opening wind he said theres a breeze blowing from beyond there ashley watched the flame flicker perhaps a scraping from the wormhole behind her drew her attention away a pair of legs slid backward out of the opening it was villanueva he stood up wiping his hands on his knees its blocked he said huffing a bit theres a rockfall blocking the passage about thirty yards in i had a hell of a time backing all the way up here ashley swore if it was blocked then there was only one other way to proceed forward linda stepped up and peeked into the narrow slit but would halloway have gone this way she seemed to eye the crack with fear i mean why would he even cross the river villanueva answered if something attacked him something he couldnt handle he would try to lead it away keep it from surprising us like it did him why do you think that ashley asked villanueva met her eyes its what i would have done ashley chewed at her lip so what do you suggest we do hes trying to buy us time to escape i say we use it she closed her eyes hating the thought of abandoning him ben called from where he had edged into the crack exploring the passage come see this as ashley approached ben he reached a hand toward her from the narrow slit his palm was covered in blood fresh blood hes been this way ashley muttered just recently she turned back to villanueva so do you think we should still go back his jaw muscles tightened youre the leader ben climbed from the slit so whos going through first we should hurry ashley sighed obviously ben had been deaf to their discussion its more complicated than that what were right behind him villanueva thinks halloway might be trying to draw something away from us bens voice rose in anger or maybe hes just bloody hurt seeking shelter he grabbed her shoulder ash i swear hes just ahead of us we cant leave him she rubbed at her tired eyes then nodded okay lets go linda stood in her underwear shivering by the wall she had shed her backpack and even her coveralls less to snag and catch ben had said narrows the profile she shuddered how could she possibly wedge her body into that slit the walls would squeeze the breath from her chest they waited for ben to report on his reconnaissance of the crack he had squished into the black rock over three minutes ago ashley and michaelson stood as sentries to either side as he reported his progress im through he called his voice echoing into their cavern the passage is only six feet long then it abruptly widens into a decentsized tunnel its a piece of cake only one doozy of a tight spot just near the end ashley faced the group im gonna send villanueva next hes the widest of all of us if he can make it through then we all can no one argued linda held her breath hoping the seal would fail then she wouldnt have to face the crush of those walls her heart sank when she heard bens cheer hes through scraped his chest a bit but no harm done ashley rubbed her hands together all right lets move khalid went next before he left her side he gave lindas hand a squeeze she hardly felt it linda watched as he disappeared a rope trailing from his waist once through the rope would be used to ferry the packs through the slit all clear ben called send the packs next it took ten long minutes to hook and drag the packs of supplies and weapons to the far side thats the last of them ashley yelled she turned to linda youre next linda didnt move staring at the black crack she willed her legs forward but they refused it was getting hard to hear the others over her pounding heart her wheezing breath linda i i cant do it sure you can villanueva is twice as big as you she shook her head swallowing hard pushing the words through her constricted throat no i cant its too tight ashley came over and put an arm around her linda shivered uncontrollably we cant leave you behind ashley tightened the arm around lindas shoulder i tell you what ill go with you be right behind you you can do this linda ashley stepped forward forcing her to follow i ill try linda said dragging her leaden feet but please hold my hand dont let go her voice cracked at the end i wont well do this together linda attempted a smile but failed miserably led by the hand she was coaxed forward her mouth felt as if someone had poured a bucket of sand down her throat just keep your helmet light pointing forward ashley said lean your back on the left wall according to ben its the smoothest then just slide linda maneuvered her left shoulder into the crack her toes pointing forward and backward inching into the crack she tried to halt the panicked flutter of her heart and just concentrate on going forward up ahead light diffused around the curve of the narrow crack just steps away the others waited for her the crack swallowed her up the walls pressed too tight even to turn her head to see ashley behind her all she could do was slide one leg forward and drag her body along behind it she counted the steps trying to divert her mind a trick from therapy youre doing fine ashley said behind her squeezing her hand just a little farther five six seven her breathing had steadied to a regular rhythm one breath with each step she could now see the end of the passageway a face peering back at her good girl ben said you are one amazing piece of work three more steps and youre through a ghost of a smile played about her lips she was doing it eight nine te her left foot moved forward but when she tried to wiggle her body to follow her chest jammed snug in the crack a squeak escaped her throat in panic she tried to force herself ahead only pinning herself tighter she squirmed backward trying to free herself but failed please not this way she prayed dont let me die this way by now she was beginning to hyperventilate pinpoints of light began swirling before her eyes her knees began to give way linda ashley said dont stop now youre just about through im stuck she squeaked a panicked pitch to her voice ben ashley called ahead lindas caught bloody hell he said give me more lights here in a heartbeat the crack blazed with light i see ben said listen to me linda reach a hand forward stretch it to me there ive got your hand now on the count of three i want you to blow out all the air from your lungs shrink your chest and im going to yank you through no she whispered closing her eyes she could hardly expand her chest now ill get stuck again then i wont be able to breathe at all silence a standoff then linda felt ben release her hand and someone else take it she recognized the grip it had supported her over many obstacles khalid her caving partner the egyptian spoke in a calm reassuring voice almost as if trying to hypnotize her linda you know i wont fail you you know the strength of my arms do as ben says i will pull you to me trust me lindas heart pounded she opened her eyes again the pinpoints of light had multiplied to small constellations she knew she was close to passing out she nodded her head i trust you on the count of three ben said from behind khalid one two three linda pushed all the air from her chest her lungs protesting her arm was pulled forward dragging her body ten inches farther until she jammed again tears now coursed her cheek this was how she would die sudden pain shot through her shoulder her arm was yanked again almost separating her shoulder joint she screamed the last ebb of air from her lungs it was enough she popped out of the crack like a cork from a shaken champagne bottle free is she all right ashley asked as she slipped from the treacherous crack noticing that linda was supported in khalids arms ben nodded i think so mostly shaken up her shoulders going to ache like a son of a bitch but shell be fine she nodded that leaves only michaelson i want everybody ready to continue once he arrives villanueva who was crouched several yards down the tunnel called to them halloways been this way the seal shone a light on his upraised finger it was red with blood he then turned the light down the passageway it trails that way ashley didnt say a word halloway was still running i want everyone armed she said in a small voice now at the sound of scraping behind her she turned to see michaelson scrambling from the crack his tshirt torn ashley waved the group together lets gear up we leave in two minutes i want a pistol or rifle in everyones hand maybe we should just leave linda said her cheeks still wet with tears her voice trembling ashley rested a hand on lindas shoulder weve come too far weve all got to stick together linda took a deep breath seeming to gird herself when she spoke her voice was steadier youre right ashley squeezed lindas shoulder then faced the team lets get moving no one else argued within moments the group was hiking down the tunnel villanueva and ben took the point scouting several yards ahead stay within sight she called when ben drifted too far ahead lets keep a tight group the tunnel split at a fork which way ashley looked questioningly at her scouts villanueva pointed with his light blood trail goes this way he said ashley waved with her pistol for them to proceed ahead expecting to find halloways collapsed body behind every turn of the tunnel as each step drew them farther down the tunnel their pace became more furious ashleys group now dogged the more cautious point men youre on my back woman ben hissed at ashley it wont help halloway if we run over a cliff sorry but theres so much blood were going as quickly as safety will allow villanueva halted their discussion with a firm motion of his arm he pointed around the next corner ashley crept next to him and peered past the curve up ahead the tunnel dumped into a large cavern i think i should proceed alone the seal said check out the area no not this time ashley said firmly i want the team together more eyes to watch backs and more trigger fingers to protect those backs villanueva shrugged the team proceeded as a group into the cavern flashlights flared out like the spokes of a wheel the chamber was similar to the others they had crossed in their journey here stalagmites littered the floor stalactites stabbed downward except there was one new feature ashley rubbed a snowflake from her eyelash damn its snowing in here a small flurry of soft flakes fluttered through their light beams linda held a hand out and flakes settled on her palm theyre not cold or wet ben shouldered his way to ashleys side brushing at the sifting of flakes this is bad why its not snow its gypsum crystals he pointed his flashlight to the branches of gypsum crystals festooning the ceiling of the chamber like twentyfoot white chandeliers theyre fragile delicate structures body heat can cause them to weaken and flake away ashley brushed flakes from her shoulders like dandruff i still dont see the danger for this snowfall to be happening now a lot of body heat had to recently pass through here more than one injured seal ashleys eyes widened with the implication were not alone down here the drifting of gypsum crystals thickened as the team crossed the cavern lights jittered in every direction shadows jumping and lunging ashley adjusted the handkerchief she had tied over her nose and mouth to keep from inhaling the flakes she glanced at the others masked like a bunch of bandits sneaking up on an unsuspecting victim villanueva still had the point crouching low and darting from cover to cover before waving them forward with an allclear sign no one spoke much fearful of just what else might be lurking in the next shadow ben marched beside her pointing his gun forward he shifted his light to the cavern floor blood trail is thinning he whispered their evening report to alpha base was now an hour past due but they couldnt halt their search now it would take half an hour to unwrap the radios components from their waterproof plastic assemble the parts and make their report time like the seals blood trail was running out a frantic hissing from villanueva drew her attention away from the red trail the others had frozen in crouched positions she was the only one still standing ben pulled her down beside him he kept a hold on her hand the seal crouched at the base of a huge boulder held a finger to his lips and motioned her to come forward quietly ashley crept to the point position villanueva pressed his lips to her ear he spoke in a hurry weve reached the other side of this cave therere two exit points a large tunnel and small wormhole so lets go which way does the blood trail go he shook his head i cant say for sure the mud is too chewed up out there to get a clear trail so we just check both she said leaning away wait thats not why i called you over he pointed beyond the boulder poke your head around the corner and listen raising an eyebrow ashley craned her neck around the boulder in the rock face before her she spotted another roughwalled tunnel like the one that had led them to this cavern at first she didnt hear anything above her own panting breath perhaps her ears werent as sharp as the seals as she was turning to ask villanueva for elaboration she heard it too a cracking and crunching like dry sticks underfoot and a throaty slurping a shiver passed through her it was coming from the tunnel ahead she raised her light to flash it into the heart of the tunnel when villanueva swatted her arm back down no he hissed whatevers in there doesnt know were here maybe its halloway she said earnestly but even she didnt believe her words bullshit the seal said well what do we do just sit here and wait a sharp sneeze retorted from behind them ashley whipped around khalid shrugged apologetically and pointed to the drifting flakes his other hand restraining a second outburst turning back to villanueva ashley held her breath i cant hear it anymore she whispered the seal nodded he had his eyes closed neither can i shit whatever was in that tunnel now knew they were here there was no further use hiding she stood up now holding her pistol in both hands ben villanueva youre both with me michaelson you stay under cover behind the boulder with the others michaelson stepped forward this is a military matter you should remain here its safer ill go with ben and villanueva no she said checking her pistol i want you here guarding our rear and protecting the others we may need a fast retreat she watched the major chew over her decision apparently unable to find fault he nodded be careful she cocked her pistol lets go her group crossed to the front of the boulder gun barrels pointing toward the tunnel opening i say we open fire the seal said quietly blast the tunnel and ask questions later no ashley hissed theres still a chance halloway may be in there villanueva raised his assault rifle we take the advantage while weve got it she shoved his rifle with her shoulder and stepped forward halloway she called if youre in there give us some signal the tunnel just stared blankly back at them satisfied the seals contempt dripped from the word as he repositioned he lowered his head closer to his rifle sights the cavern exploded with rifle fire as he blasted blindly into the dark eye of the tunnel the reverberations rocked through the cavern her ears still rang after the seal ceased firing a cloud of rock dust and smoke rolled from the assaulted opening ben narrowed his light beam trying to dig deeper into the inky blackness but failed damn from the mouth of the tunnel erupted a ululating cry like a keening hawk but more guttural and rasping ashley winced at the noise a primordial part of her responded wanting to cower and flee but she dropped to one knee and raised her pistol higher then something small bounced out into the main cavern jesuschristgoddamnmotherfu villanueva swore a stream backing a step away it was halloway his head the decapitated head of the former seal bumped to a stop a yard away eyes staring up snowflakes settling softly on the eyelashes fourteen jason plopped into his chair in the office expelling a sigh loud enough to draw his babysitters attention he had been waiting for five minutes already five minutes he was going to be late for his karate practice roland looked up from his papers his glasses drooped to the tip of his long nose oh jason are you still here i thought you had already left for the gym you know i cant he stressed each syllable why jason rolled his eyes dr blakely said i was not to leave any of the buildings without a stupid babysitter he scrunched up his face and imitated the nasal quality of blakelys voice its for my own protection well thats just silly the gym is right next door be a good boy and scoot on over there ive still a huge pile of reports to log and index jasons face brightened all right he shoved his chair back with a loud squeak and bolted away he ran down the hall and out the door his gym bag bumping against his leg he sprinted the ten yards to the next building lieutenant brusserman was probably already waiting once through the door jason was assaulted by the familiar smells of a gymnasium sweaty cotton jerseys varnish on the basketball courts floor and the tang of disinfectant he searched the aerobics area for lieutenant brusserman but saw no sign of him jason crossed the gym heading for the locker room he stopped to watch a game of oneonone being played on the basketball court jason recognized major chan with whom he had gone boating yesterday signaling a time out major chan crossed over to where jason stood he was winded and spoke between gulps of air hi kid listen the lieutenant called he wont be able to make it today but he said to say sorry hell see you tomorrow the major faked a punch at him playfully and then returned to his game jasons heart sank but what am i supposed to the major was already back in the game defending a drive to the basket darn it now what he didnt want to go back to rolands office hed be stuck thumbing through those boring magazines about navy life he nudged open the door and slipped outside a group of whitesmocked researchers milled past him heading toward the dormitories joking and laughing jason sat on the steps and searched in his gym bag for something to do his nintendo game boy he crinkled his nose noboring his hand curled around a spiderman comic book but hed read it sighing he juggled the contents a few coins jingled and a pack of gum fell out of his bag frowning he picked up the package of juicy fruit and shoved it into the side compartment of his bag while doing so his hand fell upon a hard round object hidden in the pocket he fished it out oh yeah he fingered the old red firecracker a cherry bomb he smiled remembering how he had traded for it with billy sanderson for an xmen comic book almost forgot about this little baby glancing around him with a mischievous gleam in his eye he pondered sneaking off and trying it out just then a whitesmocked scientist turned a corner nearby and walked in his direction he quickly returned the firecracker to its hiding place maybe hed better wait until he returned to the states if his mom found out about his little treasure no hed better play it cool he zipped up his bag still unsure what to do with his free time standing he moved from the steps shifting his gym bag to his other hand just then angling around the corner of the hut a group of officers passed by one of whom was decked out with enough medals to choke an elephant the decorated man took off his hat and wiped his brow is it always this damned hot down here one of his companions spoke up its not the heat its the humidity its the heat lieutenant the man said with authority yes sir yes admiral jason impressed by the fear this man could generate stood transfixed now where is that blakely fellow the admiral asked replacing his hat this way sir the lieutenant bumbled his way around the corner wow something big must be happening jason peered around the corner the men disappeared into one of the concreteblock buildings jason knew that building it was the communications center he had been in it three times when he was allowed his two minutes of morning air time to talk to his mother usually the conversation consisted of his mother questioning if he was obeying his babysitters still he thought with a sigh it had been good to hear her voice over that static scratching behind an ear jason wondered what all that brass wanted with dr blakely he pursed his lips maybe he could find out he knew his mother hated his eavesdropping but he couldnt resist a good scoop besides it might be information about his mother he slinked around the corner and crept to the door no one was around the secretary sandy was not at her desk what luck he slipped inside as he reached for the door to the main hallway the doorknob turned and the door swung open sandy stood in front of him a halfempty coffeepot in her hand oh jason she said with a big smile pushing a stray lock of blond hair back over an ear i didnt know you were coming by jason bit his lip and backed a step ready to bolt he cleared his throat i i just wanted to tell something to dr blakely she placed the coffeepot down and fingered out a new filter im sorry hon but the doctor is busy why dont i tell him for you no you see he stammered wideeyed its something personal private she pursed her lips then smiled i see well then why dont you have a seat and we can wait until dr blakely is free he nodded this was getting him nowhere perhaps he should just leave and say hed talk to blakely later that would be the smart thing to do his mouth had other ideas i have to use the restroom well dear its just through the door on the left of course he already knew that more importantly it was also next to the main communications room he crossed to the door thanks sandy smiled up from her computer keyboard and winked at him holding his breath jason passed into the hallway his sneakers squeaked on the waxed linoleum no one was in the hall but he could hear the buzz of voices from the various offices raising on tiptoe he crept down the hall trying to move as silently as possible he reached the door that led to the main communications room freezing in midstep he listened blakelys voice was clear and curt why the hell do you think i wanted this communications net you damned well know from my reports that there is an undetermined danger down here we need to the admirals voice interrupted be that as it may your teams evening report is only an hour late i think calling this red alert was premature if able michaelson would not be a second late with his reports the majors too close to this mission its too personal for him you should never have allowed him to go weve had this argument before its done now i want to know what youre going to do about this nothing a large crash listen here i have motion sensors going crazy yesterday another man was lost in sector four and now my team is late with their report and youre going to do what sit on your ass and wait for more of my people to disappear the next words were so cold that jason shivered no washington sent me to do only one thing upon my judgment to decide if you are fit to continue command youve made my decision easy as of this moment youre relieved of duty silence then words spat with vehemence you jackasses planned this all along didnt you you never had any intention of keeping this a civilian project when did the brass decide to snag this facility from me was it when the last team was lost or since the very beginning dead silence followed before jason could react the door burst open blakely wildeyed bowled into the boy knocking him down jason i i i what are you doing here i was going to i mean never mind blakely bent down helping jason up cmon pushed toward the door jason stumbled ahead whats going on is my mom okay the old man ignored him i need to get you somewhere safe i should never have allowed you to come down here the admiral stepped out into the hall if that is jason carter leave him be he is my responsibility now go to fucking hell blakely yelled pushing jason through the hallway door half shoved jason tumbled into the reception area too frightened to think focused on trying to keep one step ahead of the raving doctor he bumped into the door sandy her mouth hanging open in surprise stood up from her typing whats happening no one gave her an answer jason was brushed through the door blakelys arm around his shoulder by now tears started to flow down jasons cheek he clutched his gym bag to his chest in the open air blakely seemed to be calming down im sorry jason i didnt mean to scare you but you should know a siren blasted through the cavern its scream so piercing that jason cringed covering his ears what is it he yelled periphery sensors the base is under attack hurry blakely yanked jasons arm fifteen silence now ten long heartbeats had passed since the scream had blasted from the tunnel the dark entrance was beginning to clear of smoke from villanuevas assault was it killed swallowing hard ashley stared down the length of her pistols barrel from the corner of her eye she could see halloways head it still lay a yard from her toe staring at her as if asking why she let this happen she risked a quick glance toward ben on her right he caught her look and shrugged maybe whatever killed the seal was dead maybe they had lucked with a bellow it burst from the tunnel a flash of teeth needlesharp and serrated christ ashley yelled in shock she stumbled backward losing her shot ben knocked her to the side out of the way of the lunging jaws then hauled her behind a jumble of boulders somewhere far off she heard linda screaming what the hell ashley began but ben silenced her with a hand over her mouth a foul carrion scent flooded their hiding place as a massive snouted head reptilian like a crocodile swung over the lip of a boulder weaving on a scaled neck its nostrils open wide snorted the air searching oily black skin stretched over skull and jaw then its snout swept toward them rolling a lidless black eye like a chunk of polished obsidian in her direction beside her ben struggled to free his rifle to swing it around but the narrow space behind the boulder was too small ashley went to raise her pistol but her hand was empty the gun lost in the fall shit villanueva stood his ground silent fearing movement would distract the beast and ruin his shot he studied his target searching for a weakness what the hell was it villanueva squinted through his rifle sight it stood ten feet tall pitchblack towering on two heavily muscled hind limbs balanced with a thick tail its arms spindly when compared to the muscled hind limbs ended in articulated claws like some feral cat he could see the claws razoredged extending and retracting as it scrabbled at the boulders surface villanueva continued to watch as it stalked back and forth its head out of sight behind the boulder the hooked scimitars of its hind limbs gouged the cavern floor how to kill it the creature was thick across the chest layered in mud and scales that looked ironhard could a rifle blast to the chest penetrate to the heart maybe but it was risky he would get only one shot he swung his rifle sight forward it would have to be the head the creature still probed behind the pile of boulders where ben and ashley had fled keeping villanuevas target out of sight suddenly its body tensed its tail stopped twitching it had discovered something behind that boulder and he could guess what that waseither ben or ashley a loud hiss arose from it like a rabid dog raising a hackle a ridge of spiked bristles sprouted in a crest along the back of its snaking neck tracing down the length of its body show me your head you fuckin monster villanueva thought gimme one clean shot he ground his molars a nonfatal shot would just enrage the beast making a second shot impossible he tried to will it to move helpless he watched the beasts muscles bunch up as it prepared to spring on its quarry he had to distract it villanuevas knuckles whitened as he gripped his rifle retreat thought michaelson linda and khalid were his responsibility he huddled behind the sheltering boulder he hated to abandon the others but he was in no real position to offer any help he glanced over at linda who still shook in khalids arms they needed to retreat to a more defensible position he pushed off the boulder and scrambled next to them grab your packs were heading out linda raised a white face from khalids shoulder but the others now he said hoarsely shoving her pack toward her khalid tossed his pack over a shoulder and helped linda pull hers on hes right we cant help them michaelson with his rifle in hand herded his two wards forward as they passed around the first boulder a panoramic view of the bowlshaped cavern opened up before them here at the lip michaelson had a view of the sloping valley they had crossed just an hour ago shit he said stopping khalid stood at his elbow what is it over there just past the next ridge of rock khalid looked where he pointed then said something foul in his native tongue linda crushed her face into his shoulder michaelson studied the view four reptilian heads swayed above the boulderstrewn floor long necks stretched upward looking in their direction like malignant prairie dogs as he watched one of the heads lowered out of sight there was no telling how many of them were out there but one thing was sure an attempt to cross would be suicide their retreat was cut off jaw tight he wound his hand tighter into the rifles strap a sudden motion caught the corner of his eye he swung his light to the left ten yards away stood a stocky stalagmite like thousands they had passed to get here nothing moved there now he clenched his jaws tightening his grip on his rifle was there something behind it suddenly the stalagmite sprouted a snaking tail and a snouted head perfectly camouflaged against the oily rock even lit up it was hard to say where the rock began and beast ended the black eyes swung in his direction its mouth opened revealing row after row of teeth ashley cringed as the snout turned in her direction it hissed its breath reeking of carnage reaching blindly for any weapon her hand fell upon the flashlight attached to her belt maybe she could club it away grabbing the thick handle she swung the flashlight forward ben stopped his struggle to dislodge his rifle turn it on he yelled high beam reacting spontaneously to his command she clicked the lever all the way up a spear of light lanced out of their hiding place stabbing the beast squarely in the eye roaring the creature snapped its head away as it retreated beyond the ridge of the boulder an explosion of rifle fire erupted villanueva she thought hes still out there she pushed onto her knees a second round of rifle fire this time from behind them ashley turned a questioning eye on ben go he yelled she sprang to her feet jumping a few steps away clearing room for ben just as another blast of rifle fire exploded from ahead a scream of hissing rage echoed through the cavern followed by a loud crash into the boulders watch out ben shoved her from behind falling forward she rolled onto her side and saw the cascade of boulders tumble between her and ben filling the space where she just stood ben from behind the wall of rock im okay but i dont see a way to get to you then try for michaelson bloody hell im not leaving you go not waiting any longer fearing for villanueva she cautiously crept to the front of the boulders and peeked beyond its edge her eyes widened in terror villanuevas shot went sour missing the head and glancing harmlessly off the beasts neck but it was enough to draw its attention it struck at him like a riled snake the mouth snapped at where the seal had been standing but he had already hopped several yards back it opened its mouth and bellowed its eyes reflected red he backed up another faltering step the beasts head lowered closer to the ground its body bunched close behind taut with quivering muscles it was going to lunge aiming from the waist villanueva pulled the rifles trigger as the beast burst toward him the shot hit home striking the beast in the shoulder a spout of blood flying unfazed it barreled forward he dodged to the right this time he was too slow as he tried to turn away his arm was yanked back toppling him onto the hard rock suddenly his whole body was jerked into the air and dangled by an arm from the jaws of the beast searing pain threatened to swallow him into darkness clenching his teeth he struggled for his rifle the leather strap still wrapped around his forearm but it dangled just out of reach he pulled it up to his chest trying to grip it onehanded just as his fingers slipped in place the beast shook him like dog with a rag doll his shoulder popped from its socket a bone snapped a tidal wave of blackness washed over him drowning him the rifle slipped from his limp fingers michaelson shoved linda behind him get back he dodged behind yet another boulder his rifle raised to cover their retreat it was stalking them backing them toward the wall from the sound of gunfire they were being forced in the direction of the group battling the other monster a clever move he thought it was trying to corral him back into the jaws of the other beast khalid get your butt up front here he yelled i want your gun on this trail i need to reload no answer khalid he glanced over his shoulder no khalid no linda where were they he turned forward to face the trail again two yards away a head the size of a bulls snaked around a boulder small nostril flaps spread like chinese fans tested the air as it hunted it shied from his light then stepped into view it walked upright on two thickly muscled legs its mouth gaped open almost like it was grinning it lowered its head close to the rock floor searching for scent with its back bent michaelson noted the ridge of raised quills running down its back fuckin monster he raised his rifle and zeroed his sights on its buttugly face smiling grimly he pulled the trigger snick the firing pin snapped on an empty chamber ashley crawled forward please still be alive villanueva hung limp in the jaws of the beast the creature jerked the seals body back and forth a final time then dropped him to the rocky floor cringing ashley held her breath blood soaked his entire torso shit he wasnt moving the beast cocked its head from side to side studying its catch like a bird with a worm focused on its prey it was unaware of her careful she thought dont draw its attention she crouched and placed each step cautiously her pistol was three yards away she swallowed and took another step forward almost there clenching her teeth she slipped to the gun the beast still toyed with villanueva using a daggered claw it flipped the seals sprawled body over she could hear it sniffing at his blood ashley reached for her pistol as her fingers wrapped around the gun she froze voices rose behind her its just over here she recognized khalids thick accent are you sure lindas strained voice the beast whipped its head around right toward ashley she froze afraid to move praying the creatures vision was poor well be safe in the wormhole too narrow for them to get to us the voices were approaching her location well make a dash for it the beasts neck strained forward head cocked still as stone it listened to the voices and sounds of movement approaching perhaps she raised her gun moving with agonizing slowness no sudden motions to distract it focusing down the barrel she tried to target its obsidian eye but a huge bridge of bone protected it she didnt have a shot unless it tilted its head just slightly from behind her linda cried its ashley shut up she silently willed the woman linda obviously hadnt rounded the boulder far enough to see what else was out here ashley heard lindas boot heel scrape loose shale khalid ashley must have had the same idea asoh god the beast twitched its head in lindas direction an eye rolling into view ignoring lindas scream ashley pulled the trigger twice in rapid succession the recoil dumping her backward unsure if she had hit her mark she struggled back up into a crouched position expecting to see a maw of teeth snapping down on her she cringed as the beasts head which had been thrown back by the impact of the bullets swung once again in her direction one eye now a cratered ruin it took a step toward her hissing a piercing note ashley scrambled backward tumbling into linda get back ashley screamed fumbling to raise her gun again before she could take aim it lunged at her ashley dodged to the side linda however didnt it snagged the biologists backpack as she twisted to flee it dragged her past ashley a scream frozen on her features ashley pointed her pistol but lindas flailing body blocked her shot khalid ran forward do something she pressed the gun forward with both fists no clean shot lindas eyes met hers pleading and terrified still no shot a loud explosion rent the air everyone froze then like a marionette with its strings cut the beast crashed to the floor ashley trembling now continued to point the gun at the monster it lay still beyond the bulk of the beast she saw villanueva bloody as hell sitting up with his rifle propped in his good arm smoke trailed from its muzzle he fell backward with a moan she rushed to where the seal lay sprawled he struggled to push himself up but ashley held him down dont move she said wincing it was difficult to look at him a fragment of bone poked from his upper arm blood flowed thickly from ragged wounds he saved my life linda whispered coming up behind ashley to kneel beside him taking his scraped hand in hers he tried to grin twin trails of blood seeped out of his broken nose i feel like i got hit headon by a locomotive his eyes were glassy with pending shock he coughed thickly dont try to talk ashley said then turned to khalid go get the packs i need the medical kit khalid who still stood a few feet away glanced at the wormhole opening then back at her we dont have time linda stood up we cant leave him here khalid if you wont get the packs i will she stepped away scowling he followed ashley turned her attention back to villanueva as another volley of rifle fire erupted from across the cavern the seals eyes closed others are coming he mumbled khalids right you need to get out of here just leave my rifle shut up were all getting out of this fucking cavern every one of us she turned back to search the darkened cave did you hear that ben she thought that means you too michaelson yanked the trigger again another empty chamber no time to slap in another magazine with an angry hiss the creature lunged at him using his rifle like a baseball bat he slammed the wooden butt into the soft sinus tissue as the snout snapped at him the creature grunted taking a step back it pawed at its nose with a tiny forearm not waiting michaelson bolted away thanking the gods for his years of little league back in nebraska while sprinting down the trail michaelson pawed for the extra magazine in his breast pocket distracted his foot slipped in a hole he stumbled but managed to stay upright but his ankle shot a bolt of pain up his leg he hopped a few steps twisted or broken he couldnt tell he hobbled farther after several painful yards he realized he would lose this race he stopped and glanced back all clear still hed have to make a stand as he kept his eyes fixed on the trail he struggled to force the rifles magazine into place but had it upside down damn it all flipping the magazine the right way he slammed it home as he shouldered his way around a boulder and aimed down his back trail now come to me you ugly fucker he heard something approaching cautiously a shadow suddenly popped between two boulders just a few feet in front of him startled michaelson jerked his trigger finger the round blasted past the figure what the hell do you think youre doing ben said covering his singed ear sorry i thought a simple please move will do fine next time just beyond bens right shoulder michaelson noted a familiar bruised snout edging around the trails bend he raised his rifle again move not hesitating ben scrambled next to michaelson swinging around with his own rifle as the head edged completely into view michaelson aimed and pulled the trigger the head bounced backward and blood fountained from its mouth its body flopped into the trail its tail beating convulsively several times before finally ceasing jesus christ how many of them are there ben said winded i spotted at least four we need to hurry ben urged ashley and villanueva are still struggling with the other one as if on cue a pistol shot rang clear as a bell followed by a second lets go ben said his eyes shined with worry my ankles screwed up i cant move very fast ben bit his lower lip then you go first ill cover the trail behind us well work our way back as best we can no you go on alone ill get there when i can forget it ben said im not leaving you out here injured now move it were wasting time the stubborn stiffness of the aussies shoulders told michaelson it was useless to argue he pushed off the rock and winced when his ankle touched the ground he hopped two steps on his good leg for every one on his bad bens next words sped up his hopping weve got company laying on her sled and peering out from the opening of the wormhole ashley winced with each rifle blast for the past fifteen minutes shots rang out sporadically five shots in a row then nothing for a minute then an explosion of gunfire again but for the past two minutes the cave was silent not a sound the quiet was agony cmon ben just get back here from far down the wormhole she heard villanueva mumble something the morphine had made him incoherent his arm was bandaged and wrapped to his chest it took a good dose of painkiller and a sharp pull to his arm to get his shoulder in place afterward he had slipped into a fitful slumber damn he was one strong son of a bitch still he needed more help than a glorified firstaid kit could supply as soon as they were somewhere safe they would radio for assistance in the form of huge guns bazookas preferably linda and khalid had moved the packs and helped haul the seal deeper down the shaft ashley waited at the entrance watching the cavern where are you ben she strained her eyes in an attempt to pierce the wall of blackness from behind her she heard wheels scraping rock do you see anything linda asked ashley glanced over her shoulder underneath the helmet lindas face was pale her breathing raspy no she answered and its too damned quiet out there ashley i need to get into the open its safer in the wormhole no i cant breathe i need air ashley finally realized hell thered been enough signs youre claustrophobic arent you linda remained silent then a timid please okay ill go with you ashley slid out first releasing a hand lantern and flashing the immediate area she turned to wave linda out but the biologist was already standing up slightly wobbly on her legs linda took a few steps breathing deeply ashley studied the cave still no sign of anyone or anything linda spoke behind her her voice trembling slightly so what do you make of this creature ashley turned to her the small woman stood by the collapsed bulk of the beast the back of its head a bloody mass the biologist nudged it with a toe ashley shrugged not in the mood to discuss it not with ben still out there i dont know linda knelt down by the huge creature her nose crinkling in disgust at the odor she ran a finger over the ridge above the good eye the orbit of the eye is strange for a reptile the zygomatic arch is wrong more mammalian and the pelvic structure is odd look how it moved upright with birdlike joints and legs she talked as if in a dream half aware of what she was saying ive never seen anything like it ashley shrugged sweeping her light across the boulder face hell its been isolated here for centuries no telling what evolutionary pressures created this monstrosity she mumbled distracted only one thought occupied her full attention where are you ben linda continued to examine the creatures carcass moving down its sprawled length hmm come look at this ashley turned to linda pointing her light the biologist was raising and lowering a few of the bristled spines that composed the creatures ridged crest this isnt scale its bunched hair intrigued ashley stepped closer careful linda warned i think the bristles may be poisoned see the glistening sheen at the tip of each and the pulpy gland at the base of the bristles be cautious linda moved aside sliding farther down the carcass continuing her examination ashley knelt beside the damaged skull and carefully lifted one of the bristles with a gloved finger then she sat on her haunches maybe its some unknown species of dinosaur i can see several primordial reptilian traits even its scales are similar to the scales of the plesiosaurs a species of dinosaur but what about the rest of it the temporamandibular joint is too low on the skull hinging its jaw like a snake allowing its mouth to open wide enough to swallow a small pig in one gulp and i know of no dinosaurs sprouting hair ashley come see this ashley crouched next to the biologist what did you find its not a dinosaur or a reptile or a mammal linda reached to the exposed belly of the beast pulling back a flap of skin she revealed a pouch in its abdomen its a monotreme her mind fuzzy and distracted ashley recognized the term but couldnt quite recall its exact meaning a what an egglaying marsupial like the australian platypus the species shared characteristics of both reptiles and mammals supposedly an evolutionary dead end the injured seal moaned stuporously from the tunnel behind ashley hell of a dead end ashley said big bertha was still behind him from several yards away ben watched the largest of the trio of beasts that stalked his trail she leaned down reaching with a claw and picked up one of the expelled shells from his rifle she snorted at it then threw it away the other two crowded behind her until she hissed them away ben rolled back around the boulder three against one not good odds maybe he shouldnt have been so hasty to send michaelson on ahead his plan to lead the trio away to buy the major some time now seemed bloody daft rifle fire had drawn the group after him but the buggers were getting smart skulking behind boulders making difficult targets and no matter how fast he ran they matched his pace just minutes ago one had almost outflanked him catching him by surprise a lucky shot that ricocheted off a rock and struck it in the tail had delayed it long enough for him to slip past he pushed off the rock and ran he needed something to distract them buy himself some time to slip away he heard the characteristic snuffling as the hunters pursued think damn you youre smarter than a freakin cave monster then it came to him in a flash maybe just maybe he sped up searching for a perfect spot luck for once was with him he came upon a clearing in a grove of boulders he mapped out the plan in his brain if he stood over there hidden by that rockfall hell this just might work he reached for his belt to set the trap once finished he crammed his body into the narrow space between two jagged slabs of broken rock careful not to entrap his rifle arm from this vantage point he had a view of the entire open area his hand lantern rested in a crevice nearby illuminating the area ahead but leaving him in shadow he raised his rifle and waited counting each heartbeat the cavern was quiet as a tomb then a soft snuffling arose followed by a blast of angry hissing big bertha stepped into the circle of light cautious head low she darted forward damn she moved fast within a single twitch of an eye she had jumped to the center of the clearing drawn by the shiny object the two others younger it seemed slinked in behind her she picked up the bundle of rifle shells ben had taped together ben rested his cheek against his rifle butt eyeing his sight lines he allowed a small smile to come to his lips curiosity kills bertha raised the shells to her nose sniffing at them ben targeted the bundle and pulled the trigger upon impact a thunderous explosion rocked the cavern where berthas right arm had once been now only a bloody stump remained waving plumes of black blood her snout was now a ruin of bone and gristle she teetered then crashed to the floor thrashing in death throes panicked the others jumped away one leaping atop a high boulder they screamed at each other whipping their tails angrily taking advantage of their confusion ben slipped from his hiding place grabbed his flashlight and ran that should keep them distracted for a while he hoped he pounded away at a dead sprint he needed five minutes then he would be far enough ahead after ten yards he spared one look over his shoulder two reptilian heads stared in his direction no longer hissing at each other they had figured out his ruse and knew who to blame turning forward he willed his legs to move faster a quick glance backward showed the heads had vanished the chase was on ashley stared at the pouch of the beast so its some sort of marsupial how could that be linda shrugged all manner of marsupial species existed at one time they filled every environmental niche predator prey et cetera id say this is an early prototype something that eventually died on the evolutionary vine even if suddenly the sound of approaching movement intruded ashley snapped her head around several yards away a single lantern bobbing erratically appeared around a boulder ashley flashed her light in its direction michaelson limping with a pained expression hobbled up to them ashley kept staring over his shoulder wheres ben he was behind me covering the rear michaelson turned a worried eye to the black cavern but i havent seen him or heard any rifle fire in a while just that loud explosion so you just left him there on his own he insisted that she stopped him with a raised palm later right now i want you two in the wormhole were too exposed sitting out here michaelson shook his head ill stay and cover the entrance until ben gets here no ashley said eyeing his ankle with your injuryill stand guard frowning he obeyed her orders soon ashley stood alone with a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other her heartbeat so loud she was sure it could be heard across the cavern cmon ben dont stand me up from a distance down the wormhole michaelson called any sign of ben ashley stood at the entrance no just keep moving ill tell you when i see something by now her palms were sweaty her pistol slick in her grip ten minutes had already elapsed since michaelson had arrived surely ben should have been back by now her mind conjured up all kinds of horrors befalling ben just get back here she willed to him then from across the open space another lantern appeared bouncing wildly thank god she thought raising her own light ben was running at a full gallop toward her he threw his rifle over his shoulder and waved her away run he yelled from behind him two huge bulks stalked into the open area necks twisting back and forth as they spied their escaping prey get inside he hollered to her panicked she turned to obey then stopped how would ben whipping back around she shoved her pistol into her belt picked up his sled and yelled to him catch she flung his board toward him and watched him snag the board in midair then she did the hardest thing in her life she turned her back on ben and dove headfirst into the wormhole holding her breath she scooted down the shaft once she was a safe distance away she braked to a stop and looked over her shoulder from this angle she could see ben racing toward the entrance a reptilian snout just over his shoulder hurry he sprang for the hole sled clutched to his chest she cringed he was going to miss the entrance and hit the wall but instead he landed with a loud ooof and dove smoothly into the tunnel he made it unclenching her fists she let out a long sigh bumping into her ben smiled his expression both strained and relieved now isnt this cozy his rough hands held her legs she wished those hands would wrap her up hold her reaching back to him she squeezed his hand suddenly the shaft was drowned in a scream of anger one of the pursuers plunged its head down the hole toward them its jaws open wide ben shoved her forward time to go she started to sweep her hands forward pulling farther away when she heard a yelp from ben she twisted around he was sliding away from her back toward the entrance the creature had snagged his boot and was hauling him back out ben kept kicking at its snout with his other heel she flipped onto her back sacrificing her sled hearing it skitter down the shaft away from her then snatched her pistol lay flat ben down eyeing the muzzle ben slammed flat covering his head her hands clutched her gun stonesteady over the hump of bens back she spotted the eye within her sights then pulled the trigger the blast deafening within the tunnel an echoing screech of pain instantly followed within a moment ben was rolling toward her again before she could react his mouth was against hers their lips crushed together he suddenly withdrew as if shocked himself she blinked at him her mouth still slightly parted damn he said ouch ben shifted his hips beneath her youre crushing me riding on bens back she felt his muscles flexing beneath her as he drove their sled forward emotions warred within her giddy relief at their close escape trepidation for what lay ahead and a rising lust for the man beneath her sorry she said scooting farther back resting her head on his left shoulder her hands at his waist the heat from his body was like that of a furnace steady and hot she closed her eyes allowing her cheek to brush against the nape of his neck ben said i see lights up ahead she raised her chin to look forward its the others i told them to stay in the tunnel they slid forward michaelson was last in line he contorted his large bulk in the shaft as he turned toward them he had a look of genuine relief on his face that was oddly touching jesus christ michaelson said you had us worried first that scream and gunfire then your empty sled slides down we decided to carpool ben smiled saves gas and is good for the environment ashley pinched his waist eliciting a pained expression from him she craned her neck to look over michaelsons head hows villanueva groggy still but stable breathing evenly now strong pulse good then lets pause here try to contact alpha base can you reach the radio michaelson nodded i already tried and only static she wrinkled her brow if they couldnt contact someone get some help maybe were too confined here all this rock no it shouldnt make any difference down here were always surrounded by rock then whats the matter is the radio damaged no it checked out fine and the communications center at the base is staffed around the clock for them not to have responded his words stumbled to a stop what something damned serious must be going down sixteen run blakely said pushing jason from behind to my office but hurry blakely raced for his office passing the boy and dragging him by the arm thankfully jason still shocked by the commotion allowed himself to be towed sirens wailed in blakelys ears making it difficult to think men and women raced about them a thousand floodlights swung in wild arcs across the rooftop from the sounds of gunfire the assault was striking the base periphery from all sides blakely pounded up the steps of the administration building jason stumbled after him his gym bag strap tangling around his feet once through the door and down the hall they burst into blakelys private office roland was stuffing papers into a briefcase by the handful he didnt look up as he spoke i heard almost ready good make sure you get the research documents in my desk drawer too those military assholes might take my base but ill be damned if theyre going to get my work why the alarms roland asked whats going on he ran a hand through his thinning hair its a full base alert i have a feeling a huge explosion rocked the building jason hugged his gym bag tighter to his chest tears started to well roland began shoving papers faster that sounded like the munitions dump on the south side blakely nodded leave the rest we evacuate now he opened a drawer and pulled out a colt automatic he checked to make sure it was loaded and handed it to roland along with a spare clip take it roland looked as if he had just been offered a venomous snake he shook his head another explosion caused the building to shake and ceiling dust to sift downward roland snatched the pistol with a tiny key blakely opened a locked drawer and pulled out a sawedoff shotgun he cracked it open two red shells sat in the firing chamber he snapped it closed turning he stumbled into jason their collision loosened the boys quaking control my mom he sobbed between tearful breaths blakely knelt and held the boys shoulders jason i need you to be strong right now were going to make a run for the elevator try to get you topside machine gun fire rattled from only a handful of yards away time to go roland said holding the briefcase in one hand and the colt in his other out the back way its a shorter route to the elevator good blakely said standing and keeping one hand on the boys shoulder lead the way ill cover the back roland swung around and headed out the door they followed on his heels blakely clutching the shotgun with both hands outside the sirens had cut off but islands of gunfire flared around them armed men ran in every direction two men running with a stretcher darted past them toward the small hospital a draped figure writhing on the canvas a bloody arm slipped free of the sheet and fingers dragged on the ground blakely searched around the milling men he needed information a wildeyed private backed around a corner into their group his helmet was gone and his gun shook in his hand blakely recognized the red hair the freckles private johnson blakely said pushing as much authority into his voice as possible give me a report johnson swung around a look of panic frozen on his face blood dribbled from a wound on his forehead he stumbled back to some semblance of military decorum coming to shaky attention sir the base has been breached they came from everywhere popping out of holes pouring out of tunnels my my platoon was overrun wiped out as he reported his eyes became wider and more glazed and his shivering worsened who private whos attacking with a wildness in his eyes johnson blurted they theyre coming this way we have to get out of here who blakely tried to grip the mans shoulder but the private whirled from reach afraid to be touched then darted away roland stepped next to blakely the elevators south of us if its been lost then its the only way out of here blakely mumbled well have to try and avoid the worst of the fighting roland nodded jason stuck close to the aides side they proceeded cautiously zigzagging away from areas of gunfire slipping around a darkened quonset blakely bumped into roland who had suddenly stopped blakely followed rolands gestures and carefully peeked around the corner the space between the next two buildings was crowded with four torn bodies limbs shredded from torsos intestines strewn like party streamers suddenly one of the torsos jerked into the darkened alley beyond dragged by something hidden in shadow blakely suppressed a scream as he too was jerked backward but it was only his assistants hand pulling him out of sight a howl erupted from only yards away something wild inhuman an answering scream bellowed from behind them close roland tested the door to the quonset hut the hinges squealed with rust as he swung the door open they hurried inside fearful of what the noise might attract blakely coaxed the door closed as silently as the hinges would allow then flipped the deadbolt darkness swallowed the group blakely snapped on a small penlight attached to a key chain it cast no more than a weak glow in the dimness rows of stacked boxes stretched the length of the long building the tight columns went from floor to ceiling no clutter no cover to hide behind but there should be an exit on the far side of the quonset blakely pointed with his light down the rows to the other door a large crash boomed as something heavy hit the door a bellow of protest followed again something crashed into the door this time the frame buckled metal groaned but the deadbolt held it wont take another hit blakely yelled above the din run roland sprinted forward blakely grabbed jasons hand and hauled the boy with him racing between the walls of boxes a third crash echoed through the supply hut a screech of metal then light flooded the room blakelys breath caught in his chest as something large pushed into the building blocking the outside lamplight for a moment plunging the room in darkness the smell hit blakely first the rot of a charnel house then the sound scraping and scrabbling it certainly didnt sound like any footsteps hed ever heard in a heartbeat it crashed into the neighboring row hissing as it paralleled their course down the building in near panic he jerked jason forward causing the boy to yelp and stumble before jason hit the floor blakely grabbed a fistful of shirt and pulled the child back up but it was too late the pile of boxes just behind his heels tumbled down as a scream of anger erupted the boxes were being tossed aside like toy blocks in moments it would be on them searching in front of him he could see roland nearing the door scooping up jason blakely tried to race forward but his old knees couldnt manage with the boys weight his breath burned in his chest jason seemed to sense this and squirmed put me down i can run not having the breath to argue he dropped the boy and willed him speed the boy was a rabbit off and running as soon as his sneakers touched the ground blakely took a step in pursuit when a tumbling crate knocked him forward pinning his legs he let out a loud cry as he slammed into the floor struggling with his arms he pulled frantically at his legs jason had stopped several yards ahead and turned the boy took a step toward him no he yelled run ill catch up with a crash of splintering wood a reptilian snout burst into the row ahead snapping at the empty space between jason and blakely it hissed and wrenched its neck in the direction of blakelys penlight with massive shoulders it tried to push itself farther through the wall of boxes blakely scrambled for his shotgun but it had skittered beyond his fingertips as the creature lunged at him he twisted to the side as far as his pinned legs would allow luckily it was enough the snout brushed his shoulder missing him the head collided into the crate atop his legs bouncing it off of him not waiting he rolled away his instinct was to cram himself between the boxes but they refused to budge trapped he prepared to make a desperate run after the others the beast snarled and hissed drawing back for a second attack as the beasts neck tightened to strike jason bounced in front of it twirling his gym bag in circles startled the beast froze the boy used his entire upper body to slam the bag forward cracking the creature solidly on the nose its head flew back from the force of the impact blakely didnt wait run adrenaline ignited his heart fueling a hot panic he bolted forward grabbing his shotgun in one hand he pounded down the aisle jason agile as a monkey raced ahead the creature thrashed behind him as it tried to extricate itself from the piled boxes he kept running oblivious to the strain his sight fixed ahead bright light exploded in front of him roland had reached the other exit he stood silhouetted against the glare waving them on hurry roland yelled its coming blakely tried to increase his speed but his legs began to buckle he stumbled to his knees the sound of crashing boxes got closer blakely heaved to his feet lightheaded and wobbly then a sharp pain burning like bile blossomed in his chest and shot down his left arm his heart the room tilted blackness tried to swallow him up suddenly roland was there supporting him he allowed himself to be dragged knowing he should protest insist that they leave him but he was too weak to utter a sound they tumbled as a group through the exit jason kicked the door shut behind them as they limped away a bellow of rage erupted from within the quonset hut claws gouged metal as it tried to rip after them blakely his hand tremoring pointed forward the noisell attract more of them they hurried back toward the center of camp abandoning any hope of reaching the elevator gunfire burst sporadically around them clouds of smoke billowed in the cavern breeze near the north end of the camp a fire burned flames flickering halfway to the ceiling they stumbled across the camp hiding from every sound resting in a sheltered doorway roland was the first to speak since the ordeal where do we go theyre attacking from all directions no blakely whispered hoarsely theyre only attacking from land wheezing he pointed toward the lake his aide nodded it could be safer there if we could get a boat get on the water jason spoke up what if they can swim blakely tried to joke then we better get a speedboat lets go he pushed off the stairs the slow pace across the base had allowed him to recuperate enough to proceed on his own with roland leading he and the boy followed with a little luck then from around a corner one of the reptiles a smaller one muscled and scarred like a street bully burst into their pathonly six feet away it crouched and hissed at them bristled hackles raised blakely raised his shotgun and blasted wildly the creature howled and took a step backward a bloody gouge torn from its right flank roland fired shredding its upper arm spinning it away move roland screamed grabbing blakelys shoulder and jasons arm he shoved them toward a narrow alley between the mess hall and a wooden dormitory run scrambling away blakely heard the rapid explosions of rolands pistol fire and a loud crash wood splintering then silence in a heartbeat roland was beside him again hooking an arm around blakely so they could travel faster i knocked it down but its getting back up a trumpeting of red anger buffeted them from behind in here blakely said between gasps for air indicating the dormitory it could break in wed be trapped again no follow me blakely led the way into the dormitory empty and silent except for a radio rasping an old show tune this way limping across the recreation room he waved them to follow a pool table with torn green felt sat empty a cue leaning against it as if the player had stepped out for a smoke a pinball machine pinged and blinked in a corner where are we going roland asked motor pool get transportation he nodded toward the hall that exited the room his assistant nodded cmon a window exploded behind them shards of glass spraying everywhere the pursuing beast bleeding from several wounds landed with a thud the worn pool table blocked its path diverting its attention buying them the seconds needed to escape into the hall the creature attacked the table like wounded prey stripping it apart with tooth and claw through here blakely whispered pushing open a side door the garage reeked of burned oil and spilled gasoline his tiny light scanned nothing but open space then he spied a single ford bronco in the last stall one of the few regular trucks still remaining since the arrival of the electric mules thank god they might still have a chance roland hustled him forward through the darkness looking down blakely felt a stab of fear no tire the front left wheel rim was empty no wonder it was still here he tried to protest to roland but his assistant nearly threw him into the vehicle resigned he leaned back into the seat as jason flew into the back seat the keys thankfully were still in the ignition its going to be a bumpy ride roland said as he tapped the remote opener buckle in the metalpaneled garage door rattled upwardmuch too slowly they all held their breaths as the door trundled higher revealing the outer lamps the way forward appeared clear the engine noise roland said as he revved the motor is gonna attract them like cats after a mouse slipping into first gear he slammed the accelerator sending the bronco careening forward the empty wheel rim spat blue sparks as metal chewed stone just as they cleared the dormitory the beast crashed through a door and with a keening cry it leaped toward the truck even injured it flew at them jason leaned away from his window as jagged teeth snapped at him claws scraped paint from the door move the boy screamed roland popped the car into second gear and ground his heel on the accelerator the bronco seemed to pause midshift allowing the creature to strike the window creating a spiderweb of thin fractures as if spurred by the damage the truck leaped forward and away a howl of rage could be heard above the engine noise but soon faded behind them the bronco bounced between buildings tents and huts here and there from a distance an ashen face would pop into view some panicked straggler peeking from a hiding place roland fiddled with the radio trying to raise someone but only static answered just as they trundled across the bridge to the north side a barrage of grenades exploded farther in front of them near the base periphery sounds like the troops have regrouped roland said a hopeful edge to his voice making a concerted effort now perhaps they can win back the base maybe blakely said his chest aching but we cant risk it waters still our safest bet roland pointed ahead were gonna pass damned close to that fighting maybe we should lay low in the truck itll offer some secur the bronco rumbled around a corner almost sideswiping a vehicle that lay on its side in the road the doors had been torn off the roof ripped open in curled strips a severed arm lay on the ground next to the vehicle a pistol still in its grip never mind said roland blakely clenched his jaw as they slowly edged around the wreckage as if it were some gory traffic accident he couldnt take his eyes from it through the shredded metal the interior was spattered with splashes of tissue he twisted his head forward away from carnage his teeth aching as he focused on the headlight beams a beast pounced directly in front of them cutting off their way forward huge the size of a bull elephant this one was twice as big as any of the others seen so far legs like tree trunks ending in sicklelike claws jaws that could swallow a calf in one bite rolands neck wrenched around checking behind them as he searched for reverse with the stick shift jason sat in the back seat eyes fixed forward go go go he mumbled with a bonejangling grind the bronco popped into reverse but another monstrous creature stepped behind them pinning them where they were both creatures lowered their snouts and bellowed at the bronco tails thrashing readying to attack goddamn it roland swore as he slammed the vehicle back into first gear each creature looked like it could pick up the truck and juggle it like a tonka toy roland pounded a fist into the steering wheel blakelys panicked breathing tore at his chest suddenly the bronco jerked forward it looked like roland was trying to slip past the beast ahead but blakely knew it wouldnt work the damn things were too fast and too big jason let out a squeal as roland aimed for the monster but just before impact he jerked the wheel to the right grinding the empty wheel rim across the beasts toes crushing the tissue between sharp metal and coarse stone the creature jerked upward its neck stretched as taut as a bowstring howling at the roof it ripped its damaged claw from under the truck almost flipping the bronco the truck teetered on two wheels for a second then slammed to the ground roland didnt wait he edged past the injured beast the pain of its crushed toes had inflamed the beasts rage it charged the truck ramming the bronco a solid blow jarring it two feet to the right almost shoving them into a quonset hut roland wrestled with the wheel trying to keep them moving forward after a moments struggle the bronco cleared the irate monster the beast bellowed its protest but its injury kept it from pursuing soon its pained roar faded behind them as they approached the lake close to the fighting roland was forced to slow the smoke was so thick from the fires and explosions that even the broncos lights could cut only a couple yards into the darkness are we heading in the right direction roland asked i think so blakely leaned forward his nose almost touching the windshield between his blurred vision and the smoke it was difficult to tell if we keep the big inferno to the left of us we should head straight to the lake blakely glanced in the rearview mirror jason still sat frozen in his seat belt howre you holding up jason the boy remained quiet only his eyes moved making contact with blakelys in the mirror this summer sucks he said shifting the gym bag in his lap that it does blakely thought he nodded to the boy and again concentrated on the road ahead a sudden gust of cavern air cleared a narrow tunnel in the smoke blakely sat straighter just before the tunnel collapsed under the weight of the smoke again he spotted it lapping water the lake they had made it roland had seen it too a large bump tossed them all a few inches off their seats i hope you can steer a boat better than this bronco blakely said weakly the bronco suddenly crashed to the left the wheel spun under rolands hands hang on roland managed to yell just before the truck careened into the side of a building knocking over a lamp pole blakelys seat belt cut into his shoulder as the momentum slammed him to the side hitting the door he groaned as he touched the welt on his head roland unhitched his seat belt and reached for him are you okay what did you run over blakely asked jason screamed behind them watch out he already had his seat belt undone and was clambering over the front seat to join them the rear window of the bronco shattered inward as a crocodilian head rammed through the safetyglass coating kept the pane together draping over the snout of the beast the creature struggled to shake it loose out roland commanded run for the water roland pulled jason after him blakely clambered over to the drivers seat and dropped out of the bronco smoke enveloped them as they struck for the water blakely desperately hoped he was right and the dock was nearby glancing back blakely glimpsed the beast struggling to free its head of the bronco screeching its frustration once free it would be upon them in seconds he stopped roland turned to him what are you doing keep going take the boy ill delay it are you insane youre not in any shape roland shoved the boy toward him take jason i can catch up leave me your shotgun blakely hesitated he could order him roland snatched the shotgun from his grasp and pointed it at blakely move it blakely knew he wouldnt shoot but they were losing time arguing the timbre of the beasts bellow had changed it was free well get the engine running blakely ran stumbling after jason a shotgun blast tore the air behind him he prayed for his friend jason ran a few steps ahead i see it the lights of the dock bloomed through the smoky air thank god within moments they were pounding across the wooden planks of the pier shots rang out in the distance to the left a green zodiac pontoon boat was moored with two ropes hop in he wheezed but the boy was already in im going to start the engine i want you near the rope when i say pull you yank the end of the rope to free us i know jason said staring back down the dock blakely turned to the ignition cord and pulled it the engine sputtered but didnt catch he yanked it again the same shit here comes roland blakely looked up his aide sprinted toward them barely visible through the smoke he yanked on the cord again it almost caught this time sputtering longer before dying blakely prayed as he watched roland scramble toward the dock from out of the smoky blanket a reptilian head shot forward grabbing roland by the shoulder his body was flipped into the air his momentum carrying him down the length of the dock he landed beside the boat the cracking of bones audible as he crashed to the planks in thick pulses blood flowed freely from his torn shoulder blakely strained toward him meaning to pull him into the boat the creature had stopped at the docks edge suspicious of the water blood seeping from his lips roland struggled to rise but toppled over he turned to blakely and shook his head with his good arm he pulled the last mooring free the boat drifted from the docks edge go he sputtered he struggled to remove a ring from his left hand he tossed it toward the boat blakely caught it recognizing the ring from rolands partner in seattle tell eric i love him roland pulled his pistol from his belt as the creature placed a tentative claw on the dock blakely yanked the cord and the engine caught with a clanking whine with a twist of the gasoline feed the prow of the boat tilted up as the craft accelerated from the dock he watched as the monster crept down the dock hissing toward his friend roland tried to steady his pistol but he was rapidly weakening his first shot went wild the creature was on top of him now roland raised the pistol to his forehead blakely looked away a shot rang out echoing over the water when blakely turned back the smoke had drawn a curtain between him and the dock just a dull glow marked its location through the grime a sudden bellow of frustration trumpeted across the water it had been denied its kill seventeen what do you mean lindas gone ashley said raising her nose from the radio she wasnt able to reach anyone either why cant people stay put i told everyone to stay inside the tunnel michaelson packed away the radio and pointed behind him sorry i turned my back on them for a second and she and khalid were gone the tunnel exits another hundred yards ahead ben spoke behind her its the claustrophobia its too tight in here well its a damned sight tighter in the belly of one of those predators khalid already reconnoitered the next chamber michaelson said i havent seen it but he told me its safe only a second wormhole enters the chamber too small for one of those creatures yeah ashley said but what about other predators things that can travel through these wormholes michaelson shrugged fine lets head on i want the team to stick together she helped michaelson with the sleeping villanueva he moaned as he was moved she checked his forehead damp but not feverish he needed help soon too damn this shitty radio michaelson backed down the tunnel pulling the seal along ashley pushed from behind her knees raw by the time the glow of the exit appeared ben brought up the rear lugging the packs with a final heave the seal was extracted from the tunnel ashley tumbled after himinto a natural wonderland holy shit ben said as he crawled from the tunnel ive died and gone to heaven ashley stood stunned before her opened a chamber the size of a small ballroom almost cozy iridescent crystals some as small as thumbnails others the size of ripe watermelons encrusted the walls and floor casting back the lamplight in scintillating sparks rainbows reflected everywhere stepping gingerly across the uneven floor ashley crossed to the center of the chamber her mouth hanging open do you know what this is ben asked slipping his hand in hers she just shook her head linda and khalid crouched a few yards away noses together examining one of the larger crystals were in a gigantic geode ben said whats that she asked only half interested unable to turn away from the natural splendor youve seen them those hollow stones sold in naturalist shops that are cracked open and lined by clear quartz or purple amethyst crystals they form predominantly in volcanoes and are usually spurted out during an eruption yeah ive seen those but theyre seldom bigger than beachballs i know he waved a hand to encompass the room nothing like this has ever been discovered but hell were miles under an active volcano she looked at his face ruddy in the reflected light strong chin raised as he stared at the ceiling his excitement was contagious she squeezed his arm michaelson intruded stepping up to them if this is quartz maybe the sheer load is somehow affecting the radio but i doubt it she hadnt thought of that hope flooded her perhaps khalid called to them its not quartz what she asked surprised to hear him join the conversation he was usually so tightlipped then what is it its diamond ben laughed sure it is whos the geologist here look at the angle of crystal fracturing its diamond thunderstruck everyone looked again at the pure mass of stone around them khalid smirked at their surprise linda held up a chunk of diamond the size of a softball my god ashley thought of the diamond statue how many other similar chambers were down here this much wealth the sharp edge of her excitement dulled with concern she shook her head and released bens hand before everyone starts counting their pennies we still need to get out of here michaelson try the radio one more time everyone else set up camp for the night as she made her announcement her exhaustion finally hit her every muscle burned every square inch of skin felt bruised it seemed like they had been running for days she glanced at her watch after midnight still no response michaelson said turning off the radio ben spoke from where he had set up an air mattress he had his geopositional compass open this isnt working either maybe michaelsons right about some sort of interference my compass uses a radio beacon at the base as a stationary reference point to home in on he snapped the compass closed this bloody thing keeps searching but its not picking up the beacon she nodded too exhausted to think clearly and too worried about jason perhaps its some power outage at the base well try again in the morning she said rubbing at her eyes her mind kept pushing jasons face before her if she thought about him too much shed begin to cry what could they do anyway tomorrow would have to be soon enough ben stepped up to her he had finished inflating her air mattress your bed awaits he made a sweeping bow she took the mattress with a weary smile thanks ben i found a relatively flat area over there just enough room for two people a grin played about the corner of his lips the invitation clear in answer she crossed to the spot and placed her mattress down his smile had widened with each step she took whos going to take first watch she asked watch ben said she nodded were in uncharted worlds down here carnivorous snails whalesized sharks and now marsupial predators we dont know what else might be lurking out there just in case someone needs to stand guard well rotate shifts michaelson spoke up ill take the first shift but with two entrances to the cavern i recommend two people per shift good idea any volunteers to join michaelson on first watch she stared directly into bens eyes he resisted for a few heartbeats then sighed and raised his hand gosh i feel a second wind coming on with the schedule established those not on watch retired to their respective beds ashley sank into her mattress as if in a lovers embrace soon all but a single handlight clicked off expecting to be swallowed by darkness her lids drooped downward what the she sat back up the chamber had not darkened it continued to glow ben stood up bloody hell thisll save on batteries linda sat up its coming from the walls the biologist said glancing around reflecting off the diamonds she crawled up and crossed to a wall where a section of diamond had fallen away scraping with the edge of a blade she studied the rock then turned to them with the blade upheld it glowed a soft yellow its fungus great ashley thought with our luck its probably emitting some toxic radiation what a find linda settled onto her mattress and wiped the blade off in a specimen bag she wore a huge grin talking rapidly as she worked this makes the fifth phosphorescent species ive found down here so far even the fish back at alpha base glowed due to the buildup of a type of fungus on their scales but this she waved her arm this is almost worth being chased by monsters michaelson sat back down and rested his rifle across his knees is it worth someone dying for lindas smile deflated and she sealed the bag the majors words sobered the team and exhaustion overcame wonder everyone settled back to bed ashley stretched and curled her wool blanket around her bare feet retreating into a cocoon she peeked at bens empty mattress she could hear the two men mumbling quietly together as they stood watch she closed her eyes touching the tip of her tongue to her bruised lower lip remembering his kiss and fell into a dreamless sleep a hand on ashleys shoulder woke her too soon she rolled away from the lantern light wake up sleeping beauty its your shift bens lips brushed her ear i even made some coffee she moaned and pushed herself upright rubbing at her gritty eyes her muscles felt like stone weights thanks ben coffee sounds wonderful he helped her stand it tastes like mud but itll crank those pretty eyelids up she offered him a weak grin she noticed michaelson was already bundling up in his blanket youd better get what sleep you can its only a few hours until morning he nodded sliding out of his boots as he sat on his mattress ill be out as soon as my noggin hits the pillow she envied him her rumpled blanket never looked so inviting yawning she crossed to the makeshift guard station by the camp stove she was surprised to see linda sitting next to khalid what are you doing up she asked as she approached this is supposed to be khalids and my shift i know linda said sliding over to make room on the boulder but i couldnt sleep too excited i wanted to run a few tests besides i took a little nap and thats all i usually need ashley noticed the biologists test kit spread out on a relatively smooth table of rock linda raised a small vial in front of the lantern light and shook it the phosphorescent glow in the vial increased amazing she said then jotted a note in her logbook ashley glanced at khalid holding a pistol in his left hand he cautiously lifted the hot coffeepot from the camp stove he sloshed some of the syrupy drink into a tin cup absently linda held up her cup for a refill not even glancing in his direction almost like an old married couple at breakfast once her cup was filled linda took a sip from her cup and grimaced this is awful but she took another sip then sighed she sat back and glanced at ashley you know since im up anyway why dont you go back to bed this option hadnt occurred to her but it made sense and was damned attractive i suppose if you really think that you linda nodded you need the sleep you should see your eyes theyre bloodred and they felt like it too ashley glanced over to where ben was snoring linda didnt have to offer twice ill see you in the morning before you go though linda said from behind her theres a question thats been naggin me ashley turned back reluctantly the pull of her mattress strong whats that those marsupial creatures theyre obviously predatory how does something like that get enough food to eat she shrugged i dont know i mean they have to be at the top of the food chain but whos below them look at the lions in africa to support even a small pride of lions it takes a huge reservoir of herbivoresantelopes water buffalo zebras from a biological standpoint these beasts would need a huge supply of prey ashley rubbed her sore eyes yeah i guess so so where are they linda took another sip of coffee where is their food supply khalid snorted hell all i know is that i dont want it to be us ashley nodded the question was intriguing what did they hunt from their demonstrated teamwork in the other chamber they had a rudimentary intelligence almost cunning im not sure its a mystery thatll have to be answered by a future team linda nodded she held up a second vial of yellow phosphorescence so many mysteries down here she checked a note in her book and pursed her lips ashley said her good nights and retired to her mattress she snuggled into her blankets still warm from her recent slumber sighing she closed her eyes but the biologists questions nagged at her what did they eat ben struggled in his sleep knowing he was dreaming but unable to stop it he was in that damned cavern once again he walked among the fruitladen trees red pulpy gourds drooping obscenely hello he hollered into the grove of trees no answer he had seen an image of his grandfather the last time he was down here in a cave now just where was that he headed in a direction that seemed familiar he brushed past a low mass of foliage with petite blue flowers didnt he pass a similar bush before it was like returning to your hometown after being gone for decades his feet seemed to remember their previous steps as he approached the far wall he knew he was going the right way he could even see the black hole in the glowing wall glowing it was the same fungus growing in the geode room strange he continued toward the wall expecting the trees to block his way forward like his previous visit but this time no trees stopped him taking a handful of steps he found himself standing before the wall a soft muskiness enveloping him the fungus was sporing little pods the size of pinheads he brushed a hand against the wall with the sweep of his hand the odor became overpowering his mind reeled explosions of colors flashed before his eyes he swooned to his knees fighting to stay conscious but his vision swirled in fantastic eddies of colors and textures he slipped to the floor the back of his head exploding as it hit the ground a voice arose from beside him bennyboy enough of that bloody crap he knew that voice from childhood it was his grandfather jesus snap out of it mate his vision cleared as his grandfather waved a twisted leaf under his nose it smelled of mint with a hint of cherry with each wave the swirls of colors were wiped away as if erased by the passing of the leaf there you go bennyboy bout time you got your bloody arse down here of course he was dreamingbut it seemed so real he could see the spiderweb of broken blood vessels at the tip of his grandfathers nose the tufts of white hair at the edges of his ears the everpresent laughter in his eyes granddad whod ya think well considering youre buried six feet under aussie soil i didnt much expect to run into you anytime soon he pushed himself upward the musky odor still strong threatening to overwhelm him again why are you here ive been sent to warn you we know about those black beasties youre a little late those wankers dont let them pests get to ya pests those pests just about consumed our entire crew his grandfather sat down beside him crossing his legs bennyboy you have to continue down dont go up but down bennieboy down the muskiness intruded again smearing the image of his grandfather with wide swatches of purple and orange i dont understand he felt himself falling away again only his granddads words followed him as he faded away down down wake up ben ashley patted his shoulder surprised at how deeply he slept the others were already up and about he was the last still in his bedroll even villanueva was sitting up doing much better his arm in a crude sling she shook bens shoulder cmon breakfast is about ready she glanced over to where michaelson was bent over the campstove how he managed to turn dehydrated eggs into a damned close approximation of a denver omelet was a mystery that would baffle betty crocker her stomach rumbled in response to the tantalizing scent of grilled onions and tinned ham ben groaned rolling onto his back eyes cracked open a slit bloody hell what is that stench its breakfast and if you dont hurry youll be eating cold cereal he propped himself up on his elbows his hair sticking out in all directions he scratched at himself under the blanket blimey my heads aching like shes about to blow its not fair that i get a hangover without a fine evening at the pub concerned ashley placed her hand on his forehead thankfully ben had no fever its just a headache ill get you a couple aspirin how about a fistful he said with a tired grin she crossed over to the bag that held the firstaid kit shaking out three aspirin from a small plastic bottle villanueva sat next to the kit he doesnt look too well ashley couldnt help but smile at his observation this from a man whose shirt was still soaked in his own dried blood and whose arm had just about been torn off im sure ben will be fine you on the other hand need to rest you shouldnt even be sitting up he looked at her stonily as if she were speaking a foreign language michaelson stepped up behind her and handed the seal a steaming bowl chicken broth he said when villanueva raised his eyebrows you lost a lot of blood you need plenty of replacement fluid drink up ashley crossed over to ben a slight smile on her face major michaelson was turning into a regular florence nightingale thanks ben said when she offered him the aspirin but im already feeling better once im up and moving ill be more chipper than a roo with a full pouch take the aspirin anyway she pushed the tablets into his hand and passed him a cup of water weve still got a big day ahead of us he pouted but took the pills now werent you saying something about breakfast earlier i always wanted to be served breakfast in bed if youre feeling hungry then youre fit enough to get your own meal besides we need everyone together at breakfast to discuss our options and i want your input oh all right but thats a good way to give everyone a bad case of indigestion she helped him stand quit griping with a mock scowl he accompanied her to the camp stove where michaelson was already scooping out platefuls of omelet and fried potatoes quite a spread of tucker mate ben acknowledged hefting a tin plate from the majors hand since we havent had hot food since breakfast yesterday i thought everyone could use a big meal michaelson filled bens plate with a tap of his ladle ashley took a smaller helping and sat down on a flat boulder khalid and linda were already seated around the campstove forkfuls eagerly being consumed villanueva sipped at his chicken broth lustfully eyeing their greasy meal once michaelson was settled in with them ashley spoke up we need to decide a course of action from here we have only supplies for another eight days nods and chewing were her only answer the others waited for her to elaborate our options are to go back and try to make it through monster alley back there stay here and hope that after a period of time the lack of radio contact may generate a search party or push forward and try to find an alternate route up knowing that there may be other nasties awaiting us linda put down her fork i think we should stay here eventually someone will come looking for us perhaps said michaelson but consider the previous team we were sent three months after the first it could be a long wait thats true said ben and those beasts will be waiting for them too its not fair to ask someone to walk into the same lions den without warning and going back through there ourselves is not an option i say we push on ashley nodded she felt the same way but there were other concerns to take into account she pointed to villanueva we have an injured teammate here and additional traveling will risk further injury villanueva lowered the bowl from his lips ill manage just fine i know how far i can push myself ashley looked over at him im sure you do but what if we run into more trouble your injuries are a serious hardship on the mobility of the team if that happens then leave me behind dont risk the team for my sake noble words but its us abandoning you i for one wont do that me either bloke if we get in a scrape we all go or no one goes villanueva shook his head and raised the broth to his lips civilians he mumbled across the steaming bowl khalid spoke up so then what do we do push forward or not it sounds like were damned if we do and damned if we dont i have a suggestion ashley said we split up linda and khalid stay here with villanueva where its safe the rest of us will head out well try to find a way back up and come down with a rescue team everyone was quiet as they pondered her plan then michaelson nodded its a sound plan an efficient team has a good chance of making it back up but ashley theres no reason for you to come along ben and i ben interrupted the majors right two could move faster than three bullshit i can move as fast as you and im a sharper shot besides the more eyes watching the trail the better im going both men tried to beat her down with stubborn stares but she didnt budge finally ben turned to michaelson its a lost cause mate we got us some female company have to watch our language and be careful where we spit fine michaelson said then lets divvy up the supplies and get going were gonna have to travel light just the necessities guns radio canteens ropes ashley picked up her holstered pistol and lots of ammunition khalid stood off to the side as the others readied themselves for the journey from under heavy brows he eyed ben and michaelson packing supplies villanueva struggled to be of use disassembling the radio and wrapping key components in waterproof seals khalid studied the seal weighing the strength left in villanueva linda stepped beside him look at this he turned to her theres actually a phosphorescent species of mold growing within this diamond she cupped the glassy chunk in her hands and leaned close to him blocking out the surrounding light her hair brushing his cheek see the golfballsized crystal glowed a soft yellow between her palms why dont you add it to your specimens specimens it took him a heartbeat to understand her then he realized she meant the collection of fistsized diamonds he had stored in his pack hed told her they were geologic samples scientific research i will he said accepting her gift he fumbled his bag open and snuggled the diamond carefully among the others he ran a finger across the other diamonds twelve of them regardless of his employers desire he wasnt leaving this cavern emptyhanded linda watched with mixed feelings as the others exited through the wormhole she waffled between trepidation that the team was splitting up and relief that she was safely ensconced in a cavern secure from the predators she noted khalid had already returned to studying the diamonds he seemed fixated on the wealth around them constantly drawn back to collecting stray fragments villanueva dozed nearby on his mattress only she stared as bens light faded around a curve in the wormhole she wondered what new discoveries they would encounter what marvels she would miss by staying behind a small spark of envy tried to blossom into a flame but the horrors that could also lay ahead lessened her regret glancing around the small cavern iridescent in the lamplight she smiled at the thought that she linda furstenburg claustrophobic extraordinaire was happy to be trapped in a confining chamber miles below the earths surface let the others discover new wonders at least here she wouldnt be somethings dinner she crossed to the miniature laboratory she had set up besides there was plenty to research right here she sat down and checked her figures twice then monitored the new hyphae growth under a microscope she pulled out a slide of the older fungus and studied it too my god if that isnt a chloroplast she muttered villanueva who had been dozing nearby opened an eye are you talking to me linda blushed no sorry its just this mold is fascinating villanueva pushed into a seated position obviously still groggy but bored too what did you find i thought at first it was a dimorphic species two forms of the same fungus but now i dont think so i think they are two unique species surviving symbiotically each sustaining the other you lost me doc one type of moldthe one with glowing hyphaegets its energy from hydrogen sulfide in the trace volcanic gases but its rate of growth is too fast to attribute to the amount of gas present plus it wastes a lot of energy to produce the glow so how come it does that thats just it theres a second species of fungus interwoven with it this second fungus is full of a type of chloroplast she pointed at the microscope slide as proof the seal shrugged so so the second fungus uses the glowed energy from the first like a plant uses sunlight it feeds on this energy and in turn not only thrives but also produces hydrogen sulfide gas to feed its glowing counterpart so each mold feeds the other exactly but obviously there must be more to it more energy is needed to sustain this relationship whether from thermal heat or from something in the rocks here or from decomposition or something else i dont know theres so much to learn i could spend years studying just this relationship villanueva seemed to be losing interest in her revelation uhhuh id still rather just get out of here me too but the fungus explains a lot like what villanueva yawned like why the predators down here still have eyes why they camouflage so well with the rock it was strange why creatures isolated for millennia in perpetual darkness should still have eyes and need to blend into the background most isolated cavern species are blind and albino due to the darkness hmmm so what youre saying is that these creatures have been mostly hanging out in lighted areas or at least at their fringes thats good to know so anywhere theres fungus there might be predators around exactly ashley noted two things as soon as she exited the newest wormhole it was getting damned hotter and the fungus grew thicker and brighter the farther they descended they had been traveling for half a day now stopping only to check the radio periodically no one ever answered their call wed better conserve our batteries while we can ben said the glow here is sufficient to see by he was right when all the lights were turned off she could see just fine she wiped her brow the cavern ahead was spotted with bubbling pools of steaming water the room as hot as a sauna it reeked of rotten eggs ben offered her a sip from his canteen we must be approaching a hot vent of the volcano she nodded we need a way up soon michaelson called from yards away your wish has been granted ashley theres a crack over here its scalable and seems to climb at least a hundred yards up this may be the break we were searching for ashley hurried over to him she would climb a sheer cliff if she could get away from this sulfurous heat she clicked her flashlight back on and probed the way up the fissure was craggy with many handholds and footholds the top extended beyond her light excellent ben approached her side theres another wormhole on the south wall it heads down again who cares were going this way ben peered up i dont know he mumbled what do you mean she gave him a perturbed look this is perfect we cant tell where it ends who says it ends in a chamber it may just peter out ben feel the breeze it practically sucks you up this crack didnt you say that meant there were continued passages i guess so his voice was a whisper she glanced at him wondering what he balked at surely not the climb it looked like a piece of cake to her ben he shook his head as if clearing cobwebs of course youre right everyone hook on your quick draws and belaying harnesses were going up ashley stared at the aussie she had only known him a short time but already knew his moods something was bothering him ben youre the expert here he fastened his rope in place and approached the rock face im fine with this just had this urge to he shook his head again hell never mind lets go she watched his left hand jitter as he gripped his first handhold linda woke with a snap her head pounding khalid lay on a mattress nearby snoring loudly it was one of his rasping snorts that had startled her she glanced at her watch four hours had passed since the two had retired for a nap after lunch she glanced at villanueva he too was sound asleep odd she was never one to take naps let alone allow hours to slip by like that she sat up and stretched of course the present circumstances were unusual after running all day yesterday from monsters her body deserved a rest she stood up and the room spun pinpoints of light exploded across her retinas she almost stumbled to her knees close to blacking out after a few wobbly seconds the spinning stabilized must have stood too fast she thought shaking her head her heart pounded loudly in her ears each beat throbbing at her temples she reached for her canteen and took a deep swallow breathing heavily she saw something that almost made her drop her canteen the walls the smoothsurfaced fungus was now festooned with protruding balls of growth as she watched several hundred pods burst releasing a small puff of smoky dust spores in the lamplight billowing clouds of spore dust wafted through the chamber she watched as khalid inhaled a stream of the smoky air this couldnt be healthy she knelt by khalid and shook his shoulder he didnt awaken she shook him harder nothing she raised his eyelids his pupils were dilated in the bright light nonresponsive damn the spores were acting like a drug anesthetizing them she realized that if they kept inhaling the drug an overdose pended the fungus was trying to kill them agitated her breathing grew ragged blossoms of color flared across her sight the spores must remain calm must breathe slower take in less of the drug she held her breath still the room began to spin again think damn it an idea occurred to her she grabbed a handkerchief and splashed water over it soaking it she wrapped the dripping fabric over her mouth and nose the moistened fabric should filter the spores at least she hoped it would hurrying she applied a similar wrap to khalids face trying to prevent him from taking in any more spore dust dont you die on me she thought she scooted to villanueva for a moment she thought he had stopped breathing but on closer inspection she could see his chest rise and fall still his complexion had a blue tinge cyanotic she prepared a third handkerchief and wrapped it around the seals face clenching her fists she studied him the seals breathing was ragged and shallow in his debilitated state from yesterdays attack he was more susceptible to the drug she glanced around the glowing fungus had dimmed slightly while sporulating probably to conserve energy for the production of the spore dust but what had set it off their body heat a change in the level of carbon dioxide from their breathing she did not have time to seek answers right now she had to get them out of here but where there was no telling if the monsters still lurked in the other chamber and who knew what awaited them if they followed in the other teams footsteps only one thing was certain if they stayed here they would die she crossed to the wormhole that ashley and the others had gone down several hours ago a slight breeze blew up from below wafting a few blond strands of her hair the air was fresher free of spores she made a decision she would have to drag the two men through this wormhole if anything threatened beyond they could at least stay in the passageway but more importantly the direction of the breeze should keep blowing the spores clear of the wormhole at the thought of hiding for days in the narrow tunnel a twinge of anxiety threatened but she squelched it she turned to the men it would be difficult hauling them over the rough terrain of the floor the jumble of diamond made the sleds useless but once at the wormhole she could use the sleds to easily maneuver them from there she crossed to the two sedated forms grabbing the seals legs she hauled him toward the wormhole grunting with the effort after fifteen hard minutes she had both men in the wormhole sprawled across their sleds her head pounded and sweat stung her eyes by now she weaved drunkenly as she stood unsure if from the strain or from the drugged spores she splashed her face with more water readying herself holding her breath she dove into the wormhole trying to ignore the walls pressing around her concentrating on maneuvering the men ahead of her she shoved khalids limp form forward bumping his shoulder into villanuevas sled causing the seal to roll several yards ahead before settling to a stop bumping her way forward it was slow progress but the farther away from the cavern they progressed the clearer her head became she stopped for a moment and rested leaning a cheek on her arm she had done it the air was clear here a groan arose from khalid he was waking she allowed herself a weary smile only a vague sense of unease because of the closely surrounding rock intruded on her satisfaction but it was only that of a buzzing gnat not the usual panicked roar no the enclosing grip of the tunnel had lost its hold she had saved them ashley followed bens lead placing her hands and feet where he placed his her fingers stung and her thighs screamed the fungus growing on the walls made the grip slippery but at least the farther they climbed the less prevalent the fungus was as they progressed they eventually had to turn on their helmet lamps with the disappearance of the mold the perpetual darkness had crept back to smother them michaelson followed pushing her over some of the rougher spots she watched ben jam a quickdraw bolt in a crack above and secure a loop of rope he was humming roughly under his breath as he worked after two hours of climbing she was sick of that tune ben michaelson called from below how much farther bout another hour ashley groaned leaning her face into the rock ben continued but there appears to be a wide ledge about ten yards up we should be able to take a lunch break before we challenge the last leg of the climb grasping that small hope ashley thanked the gods of climbing then lets get up there ben im tired of hanging around here she watched ben reach for a handhold and pull himself upward you wanted to come this way he said in good cheer i was the one who wanted to go the easy way so quit your bellyaching at least his initial trepidation had seemed to fade as the strain of the climb progressed the first hour of the climb had been easy but it was only a warmup for the nearly vertical climb they had been struggling with for the last hour ashley stretched up to secure her hand on bens previous foothold she couldnt quite reach she searched for an alternate hold on the sheer face only a blank wall faced her damn ben i cant get past this point she called trying to hide her increasing panic ben glanced down at her no problem ash just let go ill haul you with the rope to the level of the next quick draw then you can reestablish your holds ive got good leverage here she swallowed hard common sense kept her clutched to the wall he winked down at her seemingly reading her mind i wont drop you embarrassed by her doubts she willed her hands to let go the carabiner brakes held her in place as she hung from the rope swinging away from the wall and out over the hundredyard drop suddenly she jerked upward as bens arms pulleyed rope through the quick draw in two pulls she was hauled next to him still swinging a couple feet from the wall he held his hand out to her she reached for him his fingers slid across her palm before gripping her hand his eyes never left hers as he pulled her toward him he held her waist steady his palm hot through her damp tshirt as she planted her feet and gripped the wall thanks ben anytime love he whispered in her ear then brushed her cheek with his lips she blushed and glanced away wed uh better get going michaelsons waiting he turned back to the wall and continued she watched him climb with the ease of a mountain goat his legs spread wide she had to force her eyes away before she could continue her cheeks still flushed within ten minutes all three were sitting on the ledge sipping warm water and chewing on jerky and dry cheese ben sat close to ashleys side his leg brushing hers they ate in silence all of them exhausted michaelson seemed lost in his own thoughts finally ashley dusted crumbs off her lap and pushed to her feet her leg muscles wobbling planting her fists on her hips she glanced up the pocked slope thankfully it was a short easy grade if she had to climb another vertical wall shed need at least a days rest ben stood up beside her ready she nodded okay ben said then lets cinch up and head on out he grabbed the bundle of climbing rope and hooked her to him he stood close as he knotted her up then leaned toward her sometime were going to have to try this when were not rock climbing he said with a jaunty grin rolling her eyes she shook her head lets get going whistling that damned tune again ben tackled the slope ashley followed for a good part of the ascent she found she could simply walk only needing to crawl over short sections of the climb near the very top though the climbing became tricky again footholds and handholds had to be searched for carefully each yard gained only with planning and muscle sighing ashley glanced up wondering if they would ever escape this damn crack she watched ben suddenly heave himself up and roll out of sight he had reached the lip of the cliff with renewed energy she followed scrambling from handhold to handhold suddenly bens face popped over the lip only feet from her he wore a huge smile cmon whats keeping you just get out of my way she said with a matching smile he reached down and hooked a hand into her harness i can manage on my own just he yanked her up to him kissing her squarely on the lips then rolled backward hauling her over the edge and on top of him she laughed convulsively as she lay sprawled across his chest relief at finally surmounting the cliff washed over her bens nose was only inches from hers but he wasnt laughingonly staring into her eyes his seriousness sobered her there was a hunger in his stare a desire she had never seen so openly offered and in his eyes a question as she stared her laughter died in her throat restraining for only a heartbeat she answered his question leaning down and returning his kiss at first gently then with a passion that had been too long suppressed in response he wrapped his arms around her swallowing her up enveloping her deeper to him bodies crushing together as fervently as their lips words intruded if you lovebirds are done i could use a hand blushing furiously ashley rolled off ben and sat up michaelson with the biggest backpack struggled to pull himself up over the edge ben scooted over and by pulling on his pack was able to wrestle the major up michaelson shoved to his feet well were up here now but where the hell is here clearing her throat ashley shot ben a guilty glance they should have been checking out the site she unclasped her hand lantern and clicked it on the men followed her example lets find out she said ben freed the geopositional compass from his pack and fiddled with it still not working he snapped it closed and rummaged through his pack forget all that newfangled computer crap sometimes you have to resort to oldfashioned methods he pulled out a scratched silver box the size of his palm and kissed it ah heres my darling simple magnetic compass with builtin barometer for measuring pressure great for approximating depth he studied the tiny tools measurements id estimate weve just climbed two hundred meters bringing us just that much closer to home he pointed the compass forward we should head this way ashley took the lead michaelson limping behind her ahead of them the surrounding rock opened into a spacious cavern a short rise blocking the view into the main chamber leading ashley reached the crest first she froze as she waved her light across the cavern floor ahead ben tromped up beside her shit he said as he looked down goddamn michaelson whispered ashley widened her lantern beam before them strewn across the cavern floor lay thousands of white eggs the size of ripe watermelons most were clustered into distinct groups nests several patches of cracked empty shells dotted the field halfway across the cavern three immature marsupial creatures about the size of small ponies huddled together necks entwining as ashleys beam settled upon them they began a strident mewling linda was right ashley thought egglaying like the platypus this is not good ashley said not good at all only one other passage exited the chamber a tunnel large enough for a train to pass through the babies cries continued grating like a fingernail scraped across a blackboard the trio quieted cowering in their nest when a bellow erupted from the tunnel ahead something large and angry barreled this way eighteen leaning over the green pontoon jason watched the triangular wake his fingers made in the water he wished his mother were here not that he was scared actually the initial terror of their escape yesterday had dulled to a mere worry he just missed her behind him blakely snored slumped in his seat for nearly a day they had anchored here a hundred yards offshore nothing to do nothing to see a smoky pall obscured the shoreline yesterday brief explosions of fire had brightened the waters edge today though nothing but oily smoke and darkness it was hard to tell in which direction the base even lay just walls of emptiness like they were adrift in space jason rolled onto his back a buckle on his orange life jacket gouged his side he squiggled into a more comfortable position studying the world above him the single lantern cast a splash of illumination toward the ceiling poking through the black mist stalactites pointed down to the boat like they were pointing at him even as the boat drifted the rocky spears seemed to bend and continue to accuse him before finally disappearing into the smoke jason sat up suddenly rocking the boat wait a minute they were anchored the boat shouldnt be gliding past stalactites they were moving drifting dr blakely jason crawled across the bouncy floor to the doctor somethings wrong blakely groaned and pushed back into his seat now what jason did you see another fish he straightened his glasses one lens of which had been knocked out sometime yesterday he kept squinting the unprotected eye almost like he was winking look up dr blakely were moving sighing blakely craned his neck back his lip cemented in a disapproving line then his expression jumped to a startled look both eyes wide damn we are moving blakely reached over the side and began hauling the anchors line tossing dripping loops of rope onto jasons toes jason nudged the slimy smelly loops away with a scowl damn blakely held up the frayed end of the rope no anchor looks like something chewed through it he dropped the end of the rope and sat down by the rudder the currents strong here were moving at a fair clip what are we going to do blakely crossed to the motor first we need to find out where were heading jason go to the front and turn on the searchlamp jason scooted to the prow of the boat grabbed the handle of the lamp thumbed the switch and swung the beam forward a thick blade of light shredded the darkness ahead but the smoke fought it to a standstill an endless shroud of oily mist blocked the light only yards from the prow jason why dont you free those oars we may need to paddle why we could just use the motor blakely shook his head theres not much gas in the engine and with the smoke this thick it would be suicide to go too fast we could barrel right into something or into shore and besides if were close to shoreand who the hell could tell in this pea soupi dont want to draw attention so lets paddle nodding jason locked the light in position and slipped to where the two plastic paddles were housed as he was lifting one free of its berth blakely suddenly swore jason glanced up a wall of jagged rock raced toward them stretching wide ahead of them black daggers jutted from the walls and water the current was aiming their boat right for the thickest cluster of sharpened stone suddenly floating on big rubber balloons seemed a stupid way to travel blakely yelled while he leaned his full weight on the rudder boy get on the right side and paddle like mad jason understood the danger and flew to the right side lunging over the pontoon to plant his paddle he pulled as his mother had once showed him while canoeing down the colorado river he dug deep with the blade of the paddle making his strokes long and fast were not going to make it blakely yelled each word louder than the last the note of panic in his voice was contagious jasons studied paddling grew frantic he concentrated on the water he was churning still he kept listening blood pounding in his ears expecting to hear at any moment the rip of shredded pontoon his shoulders burned with the strain but he kept digging with his paddle were turning blakelys voice had an edge of hope jason glanced over his shoulder the boat was now running at an angle toward the wall rather than straight he continued pulling with his paddle get the motor started he yelled not enough time i dont dare let go of the rudder jason had been on enough canoe trips to know that they werent going to make it still he wrestled with his paddle then through the smoke ahead an opening appeared in the wall as their boat angled to the side a wide black mouth if they could aim for that maybe they could miss the jagged wall blakely saw it too its our only chance jason dug savagely luckily the current aimed for the hole too as he worked the paddle the prow of the boat crept deeper into the current watch your head blakely called out jason ducked as a shelf of rocky overhang passed over the boat they were about to hit the wall he crouched low in the boat anticipating the collision but the strength of the flow suddenly grabbed the boat and pulled the prow around the bend and into the black tunnel we did it jason said they glided smoothly into the tunnel jason crawled forward to the light at the prow he swiveled it about examining the walls no rocky spars awaited to jab them instead the walls were glassy smooth it looks safe blakely said this is the river that drains the lake luckily for us the years of running water have polished these walls his words echoed giving them a hollow feeling the river carried the boat deeper into the tunnel the light pierced the tunnel to a bend ahead where does it go jason asked i dont know and i dont think this is a good time to explore lets see if we can swing the boat around and ill get the motor running jason passed blakely a paddle and each took a side jason paddled forward while the doctor backpaddled the boat began to turn on its axis just as the current passed around a bend in the tunnel the river beyond the curve suddenly dropped at a steep slope the increased speed of the flow ripped the prow of the boat forward again hang on jason blakely said as the boat was dragged toward the racing waters jason swallowed hard winding one hand into a rope handle the boat plunged into the trough accelerating rapidly the prows light bobbed across the churning waters the sight ahead caused jason to wrap a second hand into the rope the tunnel curved around a tight bend the river swung in an arc up the side of the wall as it coursed around the turn tilted at an impossible angle shit blakely blurted quickly wiping spray off of his glasses with the cuff of his shirt then frantically grabbing his handle the boat shot into the curve climbing high on the wall as they made the turn like riding some water slide down a sewer drain jason thought he watched as blakelys side of the boat tilted up over his head the doctor struggled to maintain his seat legs scrambling on the slick rubber floor jason cringed praying the boat wouldnt flip then the boat slammed back down as the corner straightened out throwing jason to the floor another turn blakely yelled jason braced for it this time his side of the boat was thrown high he saw the bald spot that crowned the doctors head then the boat leveled again how do we stop blakely squinted at the tunnel ahead as the boat raced past the walls i dont know just hope that eventually it levels out so we can slow down hang on here comes another turn after five more turns jasons stomach began to get queasy the dry rations he had eaten for breakfast felt like a gnarled lump in his stomach im going to be sick he mumbled shhh blakely said listen the boat had slowed somewhat the river leveling out but the current was still strong restraining a groan he cocked an ear now what then he heard it too it sounded like someone gargling it swelled louder and louder until it was thunderous blakely said the next word as if it hurt his mouth waterfall he grabbed the rudder weve got to turn around and get the motor going jason looked at the rocky tube tight around them no room to turn even ignoring the torrent of water then he remembered something his mother had taught him spin in the next curve he yelled above the thunder what blakely looked at him as if he might be insane as we turn the force of the water can help spin us thats too dangerous jason pointed ahead yeah but what about that good point how do we spin jason pantomimed frantically while trying to explain lean the rudder in the opposite direction of the next turn force the prow up the wall the current will whip the stern around spinning us backward my mom and i tried it once did it work well no we flipped the boat great its supposed to work we just did it wrong well we have only one chance to do this right theres the next corner blakely had to holler to be heard above the roar jason scooted back beside blakely ready to add his weight to the rudder push when i say he shouted the doctor nodded jason waited until the tip of the boat entered the curve now blakely shoved the rudder leaning hard on it jason pushed too the prow shot up the wall tilting the boat vertical dont let up jason yelled sensing that the doctor was beginning to ease up on the rudder not till were around the boat shuddered for a heartbeat then the stern of the boat flipped around the light pointing back the way they had come my god blakely said wideeyed we did it jason swung around to check where the current was still dragging them a hundred yards farther the river emptied into a large cavern he squinted his eyes at the approaching hole thats weird he thought he rubbed his eyes glancing at the tunnel walls around him it didnt go away look theres some sort of light coming from the walls here blakely craned his neck to see some sort of glowing mold he pulled on the motors starter cord the engine clickclacked but died uhoh jason said look blakely had already seen it and yanked frantically on the cord downcurrent the glow revealed a whitewater turmoil the roar now pressed on the eardrums rattling inside his skull the river disappeared beyond the churning water over a cliff jason turned to the doctor as the boat raced toward the plummet hurry with a fierce pull the engine sputteredthen caught blakely twisted the throttle wide open the motor fought the current at first there was no effect the current still pushed the boat toward the waterfall but finally only yards from the whitewater the engine started winning the boat now sat still in the river engine struggling with the current cmon cmon cmon jason willed the boat forward as if the boat heard him it inched forward at first slowly then faster and faster jason whooped blakely wore a fierce smile until the engine died nineteen another piercing scream it had almost reached the cavern ashley searched for any other exit from the nesting area even a small crevice in which to hide would do a hurried scan with her hand lantern revealed only rock back down ben said pointing his lantern back to the cliff michaelson already had his sawedoff shotgun in his hand no we stay and kill it ashley shook her head might be others gunfire could draw a whole flock of those damned creatures we only shoot if cornered ben glanced back at the cliff id say were cornered we just need somewhere to hide she said if big mama finds the cavern empty hopefully shell lose interest and go away again but where could we hide michaelson asked he checked his rifle to make sure the clip was secure ben tugged on the coil of rope over his shoulder we could hang over the cliff edge wait for it to leave if it finds us we can rappel farther down the cliff face ashleys arms still felt like limp noodles but what choice did they have good idea lets go ashley slid down the ridge following ben to the cliffs edge from the ridge michaelson guarded their backs watching the tunnel for mamas appearance loop your rope over that stalagmite ben instructed like this she followed his example pulling on her knot even more strongly than him she gave it a third yank thats plenty tight ash just making sure she watched ben set up the majors rope on a third outcropping he threw the coiled rope over the edge letting it drape down the cliff face a bellow of anger thundered through the chamber she glanced toward the nest michaelson scrambled down the slope toward ashley clutching his shotgun in one hand here she comes ash get going ill make sure michaelson gets hooked up she nodded clipping the rope through the carabiner dont take any chances who me he winked at her herding her toward the edge another bellow erupted hurry grasping the rope she leaned over the edge and hopped down a few yards then braked to a stop the cliffs edge blocked her view of ben as she descended damn she couldnt see what was happening up top but she could hear dont wait ben get your ass over the edge michaelsons voice was nearhysterical shes right behind me just get your butt over here mate a scattering of loose shale rained over the edge as the major skidded to a halt she sees us here she comes the sound of claws ripping at rock sent a cataract of tremors up ashleys back a deafening scream blasted from above sounding as if it were coming right from the cliffs edge michaelson suddenly leaped over the precipice rope zinging through his carabiner his boots hit the rock yards to her left his face was beetred in the glow of her helmet lamp ben she asked searching the cliffs edge between gasps for air michaelson shook his head he he had turned off his lamp then bolted behind a boulder fall i dont think it saw him instead it fixed on my light she prayed he was safe eyeing the empty dangling rope to her left she could hear something snorting just overhead more shale tumbled down pelting michaelson a reptilian head shot over the edge of the cliff searching with one black eye then the other it was right above the major its scanning halted one eye pointing toward michaelson opening its jaws it screamed at him michaelson leaped another yard down now well beyond the reach of even its long crested neck the predator hissed at its escaping prey then cocked its head a final time before snaking back over the edge ashley blew suppressed air from her chest as michaelson gave her a thumbsup they were safe but what about ben she searched again a gasp from the right drew her attention back to michaelson he had lost his footing slamming into the wall as his rope was yanked upward she watched wideeyed as his flailing figure was dragged another several feet up he hit the wall hard with his shoulder jesus christ its got my rope he was hauled farther up now only two feet from the top again the beast peeked over the edge eye cocked toward michaelson the rope clamped in its jaws it reared up dragging michaelson straight up into the air to dangle from the jaws of the creature ashley tried to loosen her pistol with one hand while gripping the rope with the other her fingers struggled with the clasp over the gun damn it she fought the holster then froze when she heard ben hey there big mama is that any way to treat a guest he followed his words with a loud whistle ashley watched as the beast twitched in the direction of his voice swinging michaelson wildly the creature opened its mouth to hiss at the new intruder dropping the rope michaelson plummeted past her his arms and legs wheeling the slack in his rope snapped taut he crashed into the wall the sound of snapping bone accompanied the collision she stared down at him he groaned eyes narrowed with pain as he struggled into a rappelling position using only one leg satisfied that the major had survived the fall she turned back to the cliffs edge the monster had disappeared beyond the horizon of her view she could hear it snorting and sniffing up there claws tentatively scratching at rock searching cmon ben get down here she listened for any further sign of what was going on up there silence she glanced to her left bens rope was gone when had that disappeared a loud snort of glee drew her attention the hunter had found its prey a frantic scraping and scrambling erupted look ma bens voice was savage i knitted you a new scarf a bellow of rage suddenly ben leaped over the edge shooting over empty space rope trailing as he reached the end of the slack he twisted in midair to face the cliff and plunged toward the wall using his legs he absorbed the brunt of the impact only an explosive oof indicated that the collision had any effect on him ben she said relieved and confused what about the ben pointed up she turned her eyes back to the cliffs edge the marsupials head dangled over the cliff its blubbery tongue hanging from its slack jaw bens rope was looped around its neck digging a trench in its flesh ben pushed a pouted lip at the beast now hows that for gratitude i dont think she likes my present as the seal groaned and opened his eyes linda checked his pulse hes coming out of it she said she had been worried that in his weakened state the fungal spores may have been too strong for him thats good khalid said from his queasy expression he was still suffering from the aftereffects himself he closed his eyes and pressed fingers to his temples here try this she passed him a damp towel lay back and place this over your eyes he smiled wanly at her but accepted her offering as he lay back linda turned to villanueva she wiped the seals forehead with khalids help she had been able to transport him to a relatively fungalfree chamber a stream of cool water coursed through the cave slightly tangy with dissolved minerals the only entrance to this room was a narrow hole too small for any large predators still she kept a pistol resting on a rock within arms reach villanueva struggled to speak between sticky lips wwwater she helped him sit up and raised a cup to his lips with shaky hands he collected the cup and managed himself what happened he asked glancing at khalid who now snored quietly from under the wet cloth she explained the story of the poisonous fungal spores while he finished his water he handed her the cup is there anything down here that doesnt want to eat us she grinned at him this is a hostile environment i think for anything to survive it must learn to utilize the scarce resources to the fullest that means intense competition and varied modes of attack great whats next carnivorous butterflies she shrugged he shook his head damn i could use a smoke i dont think that would be good for you he raised his eyebrows ive just about had my arm yanked off ive been a chew toy for a monster and now some freakin mold tried to poison me i think i can survive one cigarette she nodded i could check in khalids stuff he has a few extra packs im sure he wouldnt mind sharing one she tugged his pack over to her surprised at how heavy it was then fumbled the flaps open she rummaged through the extra clothes and climbing gear its got to be in here somewhere thats all right i could here i think i found one still in its cellophane with her arm buried to the elbow she felt the plastic crinkling with her fingertips got it she pulled her arm free clutching her find embarrassed she realized it wasnt a pack of cigarettes curious she held it up to the light to see the object better villanuevas eyes sprang wide when he saw what she held in her palm careful with that what is it plastic explosive let me see it explosive she handed him the cellophanewrapped block of clay he flipped the package around this insignia stamped into it its german manufacture why would she glanced at the sleeping man as a geologist maybe he thought he might need to explode some sections to get to samples the seal shook his head i was briefed i would have been told if someone had plastique this is obviously contraband pass me his pack she held her breath and a thousand thoughts bounced around her head as she passed him khalids pack she now recalled how guarded he was at times when anyone handled his pack how odd some of his expressions were when anyone asked about his past but she also remembered his strong hand pulling her up steep slopes and his kind words of encouragement villanueva closed the pack theres twelve packages in here enough to bring the entire volcano crashing down on us he reached for her pistol but his injuries prevented him give me your gun instinctively she started to obey but with her hand on the pistol grip she froze suddenly unsure what to do with a rattling snort khalid coughed himself awake he pushed the cloth off his face and sat up what are you his eyes shifted from villanueva with the pack to linda with the gun his brows drew together lowering over his eyes his accent became thicker what the hell are you doing with my pack his words were directed at the seal but the heat of his anger scorched her too embarrassed words flowed from her we were just looking for a cigarette and villanueva cut her off what is your game here khalid who sent you i dont know what youre talking about give me back my pack the seal shook his head go to hell linda backed a step away from the combatants her gun hung limply in her fingers she kept staring at khalid he was the same man who had shared his canteen with her the same man who had pulled her free when she was trapped in the narrow crack her motion attracted khalids eye he spoke to her pointing a thumb toward villanueva is he feverish is it the fungal poison why is he acting like that he waved her away from the seal be careful he may be dangerous numbly she watched as her feet started stepping toward khalid hes fine its just that he doesnt understand why you have explosives get away from him villanueva struggled to stand but was too weak and unstable he toppled back down dont trust him give me the gun khalid turned to her dont hell kill me she glanced toward the seal villanuevas lips were a cruel line and what did you have planned for us with all these explosives khalid lowered his head linda let me explain hes twisting it all around im not some arab terrorist hes letting his prejudice delude him khalid she took a single step toward him now only a few feet between them watch out villanuevas words were too slow much slower than the sudden speed of khalids leap he was upon her before she could gasp he held her in a tight hug one hand reached down and freed the gun from her trapped hand im sorry he whispered in her ear it wasnt supposed to be like this with the gun in his hand he released her she stumbled a few steps away tears pooling in her eyes he pointed the gun at villanueva so now what khalid he said with a sneer how do you think youre gonna get out of here by lightening the load he pulled the trigger twice villanuevas head bounced back two small holes appearing in his forehead his body slumped to the floor linda screamed covering her face she dropped to her knees sobbing expecting at any moment to feel bullets ripping into her too a hand touched her shoulder no words she cringed from his touch and continued crying the hand did not try to touch her again eventually her wracking cries dissolved to a simple flow of tears she glanced up khalid sat on his haunches hanging his head the gun still rested in his hand as comfortable and easy as a pen he must have noticed her look she sniffed why his words were dry unemotional i was assigned this mission khalid shifted to face her blakely was naive news of his discovery of a huge diamond statue reached many ears a south african diamond cartel approached my employer if the source of such huge diamonds were ever discovered it would destroy the diamond market current prices would plummet i was assigned to find the source of the diamonds then sabotage the site explode the entire system she lowered her head all those deaths just for money he reached over and tipped her face toward him his fingertips warm from the hot gun no he said i accepted this assignment from the south africans for another reason too one closer to my heart like the diamond market if this continent should open up as a major oil competitor it could devastate the middle east economy oil is my countrys lifeblood before oil my country was poor no education no health care no way out of the sand i will not see that happen again not after so much progress a flash of pain in his eyes i care for my country as much as you do yours would you kill to save your country unsure herself she did not answer only turned her face away releasing his grip on her chin he stood up i need to head back up complete my mission he walked to villanuevas body he had to be killed his knowledge was a threat to my mission but you i need another pair of eyes another pair of hands its a long journey back up she allowed herself a moment of hope i have my mission and wont fail he said you could stay here or you can come with me but you must understand if you come along and betray my secret then i will be forced to kill again he held a hand out to her can i trust you linda stared at his calloused palm to go with him he might turn on her as swiftly as he had turned on villanueva but to stay alone down here unarmed meant certain death wrapping her arms around her body linda ignored his hand and made a decision ill go with you thank god michaelson thought as ben stopped in front of him he steadied himself with a hand on the aussies shoulder the crude splint on his ankle biting into his calf the halfassed contraption had been hurriedly slapped on his leg after climbing back to the nest area walking was possible but slow and wobbly michaelson winced when he saw how far they still had to go to reach the nurserys exit did you hear something ben asked his head cocked to the side ashley shook her head michaelson listened from several yards behind the infant marsupial predators hissed at the group tiny crests twitching up and down their protests had become less strident as they became aware that the group was leaving the nest still the tunnel was some distance away a black slash in the wall no michaelson said nothing sounds clear ben nodded using a finger to clear an ear i could have sworn he proceeded forward michaelson followed his steps clumsy on his bad ankle ashley stepped up beside him how are you holding up fine but i still think you should proceed without me im holding you up she frowned its best if we go slowly anyway no telling what lies ahead resigned he tromped after ben keeping an eye on the tunnel entrance a goal he began counting his steps each odd numeral painful as he hopped his weight on his splinted ankle on his thirtythird step he finally reached the opening he leaned on the wall of the tunnel perspiration soaking his forehead a stitch of pain had started throbbing on his right side damn it must have cracked a rib too he thought rubbing a hand over his side ben stepped up to him he had reconnoitered the passage ahead while waiting for michaelson to hobble up he glanced at where michaelson rubbed and raised an eyebrow but thankfully didnt ask any questions it was already embarrassing enough to have the aussie pull his butt out of the fire when that enraged creature had caught him up if it wasnt for bens foolish stunt he would have been dead by now he dropped his hand from his side what did you find its a bloody maze down there passages crisscrossing every which way some lighted by fungus some clear we need to be careful at least we have plenty of escape routes yeah but which passage gets us out of here theres only one way to find out suppressing a wince he pointed down the tunnel after you ben flashed his light forward and entered the tunnel after several yards of careful progress michaelson realized bens description of the passages ahead was an un derstatement the first intersection had five rocky passages sprouting in all directions now which way ben asked his question directed at ashley michaelson hopped forward irritated that ben should exclude him from the decisionmaking process even if he was an invalid he was still the senior military presence here their safety was still his primary responsibility ashley pointed to each of the tunnels with a beam of light she settled her light on one of the passages this passage seems to be heading up and it has some of that glowing mold on the wall michaelson peered down the tunnel selected he made a noncommittal grunt ashley looked at him the mold will allow us to conserve batteries we still dont know how far we have to travel before we find our way out of this hellhole so we better think conservation try to stick to lighted passageways as much as possible besides the more light around us the safer i feel michaelson nodded as much as it grated on him her assessment of the situation was sound he couldnt have planned any better lets go then he said ben took the point again he turned his light to a weak diffuse setting just enough to highlight some of the blacker nooks and crannies otherwise the thickening mold added sufficient glow to see by ben waved them to turn off their lights including their helmet lamps michaelson followed ben ashley covered their rear pistol in hand michaelson ground his molars both from the pain and his frustration with his physical shape he should be guarding their retreat or sweeping ahead for dangers not sandwiched in the middle like some sheltered mamas boy still he couldnt argue with the order of their procession ben had already skipped several yards ahead while michaelson hobbled to keep up glancing behind him balanced on his good foot he watched ashley check the passage behind her she swung forward and caught him staring at her she smiled weakly at him almost like she was trying to reassure him pinching his brows together angrily he increased the pace of his hopping side passages and crossways flew past he didnt try to memorize his route only kept his eyes fixed on bens back struggling to match his pace as much as his hot blood drove him forward past the pain past his incapacitation eventually his feverish pace dwindled back again to a pathetic crawl ben disappeared around a bend in the corridor panting now sparks of lights danced across michaelsons vision pain shot in electric bolts from his ankle he stopped leaning on the wall his side now burning with a hot flame ashley stepped to his shoulder her voice a mixture of concern and anger quit pushing yourself were not in a race careful progress is what will get us out of here im slowing you up he said between painclenched teeth bens face suddenly appeared in front of him damn that aussie moved silently when he wanted to ben wore a concerned expression michaelson glared at ben im fine he dared him to argue thats good said ben his voice an urgent whisper because i think were being stalked ashley crossed next to ben what do you mean i keep hearing something scraping and shuffling in neighboring passages keeping pace with us maybe theyre just echoes of our own progress ashley said but her eyes darted behind her i havent heard anything she glanced at michaelson have you he shook his head but he was no judge all he could hear when he moved was his own wheezing pants and his heart pounding in his ears hell he hadnt even heard ben approach until he was on top of him ben hissed his words youve got to know what to listen for i know noises that are natural for a cave and these arent normal so what do we do ashley asked we need to shake this tail but it knows these passages better than we do our only hope is speed outrun it michaelson was very conscious that ben didnt glance his way ashley didnt either but an uncomfortable silence descended like a weight upon them he knew what they were thinking they needed to move quickly but wouldnt leave him behind rolling his eyes he started to speak when he heard it too they all did six eyes turned in unison to their back trail something scraped rock behind them out of sight followed by the sound of a single pebble displaced and bouncing something was back there leave me he said he pulled his pistol and pointed it not down the trail but at ashley and ben now quit that shit ben said were not in some damned rambo movie we know youre not gonna shoot us i wont allow my injuries to get us all killed he raised the barrel to his own temple pressing the cold muzzle to his heated skin go or ill shoot michaelson ashleys voice was tight with fear were a team go ill cover the back trail for as long as possible no ashley said youre coming with us go he cocked the pistol with his thumb now or in three seconds youll have no one to cover your escape he watched ashley swallow hard and glance at ben for help if either rushed him he would pull the trigger he knew he needed to force them to leave him behind a second pebble tripped somewhere behind them ben turned to ashley the stubborn set of his shoulders slumped hes right weve got to think of the others if we dont reach help theyll all die too ashleys fists clenched her knuckles white i hate this ben rested a hand on her shoulder he turned his eyes to michaelson i know youre keen on this suicide mission kamikaze and all that but up five yards ahead is a small alcove with a tiny pool of water its large enough to hide three marines in there i suggest you hole up itll be a secure spot to keep out of sight and offers good coverage if you need to shoot michaelson nodded suspicious go ill check it later ben pulled ashley away cmon maybe we can lead the pursuers away from him she allowed herself to be shifted away but not before her eyes locked on the majors one final time tears at the corners of her lids dennis be careful dont do anything stupid he waved her away with the muzzle of the gun he watched her twist around and leave with bens arm around her they disappeared around the bend without a glance behind he listened as their footfalls faded down the tunnel until there was only silence he listened carefully ears straining making sure they had definitely left as well as trying to hear any telltale sound of the stalkers he heard nothing other than his own pulse throbbing at his temples he continued to wait still after nearly an hour nothing appeared or was even heard maybe ben had been panicked over nothing but he couldnt convince himself ben was too wise in cave lore to be fooled by an echo or natural noises he licked his dry lips caked with dust and dried sweat he swirled the canteen at his belt almost empty hed better take bens advice and check that alcove fill his canteen and hole up there wincing he stumbled as quietly as possible down the tunnel searching for the side cave the scrape of his boot on the rocky floor sounded explosively loud in the empty tunnel luckily only steps past the turn in the passage a small black aperture appeared in the right wall of the tunnel he clicked on his lantern and flashed the opening with his light it was dark in there no glowing fungus just emptiness the roof was low too low to stand up in but by crouching he could enter and move around in the corner a small trickle of water ran down the rear wall and accumulated in a puddle he tested it with a finger a strong mineral tang but should be okay to drink after finishing the dregs of his canteen he positioned his canteen under the trickle to collect the fresh water satisfied he settled by the opening hidden in shadow the glow of the moldencrusted passage allowed him to view both directions in secret it was a secure post he waited his gun pointing forward cowards she thought thats all we arecowards no matter how logical their decision to abandon michaelson was ashley still felt like a dog running with its tail between its legs she followed bens back through the twisting maze almost five hours had elapsed and during brief rest breaks to sip warm water from her canteen she still heard the noises trailing them sometimes from a long distance away sometimes from just around a blind bend ben stopped ahead of her his brow drenched in sweat and unscrewed the lid of his canteen he raised it to his lips and took a short swig wiping the cuff of his sleeve across his mouth he said it doesnt make bloody sense he shook the canteen and frowned at it hers was almost empty too what do you mean by now we should have either lost this tail or been caught this stalemate is bloody odd maybe weve just been lucky a tumble of loose rock down a tunnel to their right caused them both to jump ben scrunched up his nose as if he smelled something foul i dont trust luck any more than these caves she capped her own canteen after sipping just enough to flush the rock dust from her mouth lets go ben set a faster pace his shoulder muscles knotted with tension his gun tight in his hand this constant waiting was getting to her also what the hell was stalking them and why wasnt it attacking her stomach churned with hot acid she almost wished their pursuers would pounce at least then she could fight do something instead of running in fear for the next hour they traversed numerous tunnels some heading up some heading down some with smooth floors some tumbled with boulders some illuminated with fungus some black as pitch ben held his silver compass in his free hand were heading in the wrong direction away from the base what choice do we have hunger and the twisting passages were making ashley dizzy she had been nibbling dry rations as they moved but she needed a meal she found herself dreaming of a cheeseburger with an extralarge order of fries and of course a cocacola this warmed spit in her canteen failed to even moisten her mouth she tripped over a rock dulled reflexes causing her to stumble to her knees she tried to push herself up but then her legs protested muscles tired and strained she collapsed back down with a sigh ben returned to her and crouched down we cant stop now i know she said heavily just need a minute thats all he sat next to her resting a hand on her knee squeezing her thigh reassuringly well get out of here will we she whispered what if they didnt make it out of here she thought of her son ensconced in the security of alpha base and hung her head at least jason was safe if something happened to her she gritted her teeth to hell with that type of thinking she would see her son again she pictured his silly grin when something surprised him the way his hair had a stubborn cowlick causing it to stick out behind one ear she pushed bens hand off her knee and stood up even if it meant wrestling every damned predator in this hellhole she would see her son again cmon she said offering her hand to help ben stand weve got to find a way home sounds bloody fine to me ben grinned one of his wide smiles every tooth showing then set off down the passage she tramped after him determined now ready to run miles if necessary but after only a hundred yards ben stopped he held a hand up in the air his ear cocked she remained silent straining to hear but she heard nothing unusual ben what is it a breeze he pointed to a side tunnel she stepped next to him now that he mentioned it she could feel a slight wafting from the passageway raising a few stray strands of her black hair what does it mean i think its the end of this maze then lets go she headed out taking the lead this time as they progressed the passage narrowed with sudden knifesharp turns the breeze becoming stronger and stronger the fungus on the walls had thinned as they followed the turns eventually they were forced to click on their hand lanterns and helmet lamps after almost a mile of trekking ben spat bloody hell what weve yet to cross a single side passage in this chute it would be easy to get pinned down in here no escape routes she frowned and continued great one more thing to worry about but they were committed with only one way to go straight ahead as she worked around the next tight bend in the corridor the roof lowered crouching she continued the breeze had become a wind blowing hair about her face whipping it behind her as if pointing for them to turn back the rushing air whistled in her ears ben poked her from behind did you hear that she twisted around what theyre behind us nowand theyre coming fast she turned around her lips drawn into tight lines she increased the pace crouching and running into the wind she turned the next corner and the passageway ended just yards ahead wind blew from a wormhole opening at the end of the tunnel the first they had seen since entering the maze she ran forward praying that this tunnel would lead up toward home she knelt beside the opening and pointed her lantern the sight forced a groan from between her lips it not only led downward but at a frighteningly steep slope deeper into the heart of the continent ben leaned beside her he already had his sled out and was releasing the catch to expand it better hurry ash theyre about a hundred yards behind us she pointed at the wormhole sullenly it heads down pretty far too id say we cant go back he helped her unstrap her sled i have the sneaking suspicion that weve been herded to this place what she unhooked the catch to expand her sled a scrabble of rock echoed from behind them no time ben said he waved to the hole ladies first he pointed his gun to their back trail ashley glanced at the black tunnel behind them then at ben she took a deep breath and shoved into the wormhole on her sled the steepness of the slope quickly accelerated her plummet she braked with the heels of her gloved hands and toes of her boots but succeeded only in slowing her pace slightly she heard ben enter the wormhole behind her his wheels whisking toward her hell he called to her its like a slide lets see those bastards catch us now by now her rate of descent was such that it burned her hands to brake even through her climbing gloves and as they flew farther down the tube the fungus began appearing in patches on the walls were in a big corkscrew yelled ben can you feel the centrifugal force she did her board kept climbing higher on the walls as their speed increased and the tunnels curves tightened to try to brake now was impossible during their flying descent the fungus had grown thicker and thicker its glow almost blinding now the mold also made the walls slick so even the tips of her boots dragging across the floor failed to offer any significant braking she hoped the tunnel would level out before ending give them a chance to slow down at this speed shed hate to be spewed out of the tunnel right into a slumbering stalagmite she watched the tunnel ahead praying for an easing of the slope no such luck the tunnel exit appeared around the next bend no time to brake no time to slow down only time to cover her head with her arms and cringe she shot out of the tunnel blasting into the next cavern blinded for a moment by the bright light she jolted and bounced across the slightly rugged floor when her eyes adjusted she saw herself barreling toward a solid wall of yellow vegetation closing her eyes she slammed into the thick stalks of growth her collision tumbled her from her board but the field cushioned her fall as she rolled for several yards once stopped she pushed to her knees she was almost up when ben tumbled into her with a wild yell she fell in a tangle of arms and legs well that was different ben said speaking to her left knee she untangled herself and stood up with a groan bruised everywhere she glanced around as ben stood up the field of yellow vegetation like wheat stood chesthigh and spread for miles across the rolling cavern floor miles she craned her neck around the cavern was monstrous dwarfing even alpha cavern almost like the grand canyonbut with a lid the walls stretched hundreds of stories high the roof far overhead glowed with thick fungus some patches glowing as bright as sunlight she glanced across the smooth yellow fields that undulated across the wide plain broken only by tiny groves of spindly trees like islands in a sea i dont think were in kansas anymore ashley said with her mouth hanging open a rustle of vegetation drew her attention from the panorama around them from several yards away something was working through the field toward them maneuvering around clusters of trees too low to be seen except for the wake of bending stalks like a shark through water she glanced at ben as she backed away he pointed off to the left two more wakes arrowed toward them she studied the field more closely now noticing three other trails moving in their direction six in all she backed away pulling bens sleeve he didnt resist almost tripping she stepped from the field onto bare rock and stumbled back until she stood by the wormhole opening their sleds were lost somewhere in the field reaching for her pistol her hand touched the empty holster damn the gun must have been knocked away by her fall she turned to ben thankfully he had his pistol already gripped in his right hand i lost mine she said between tight lips thats all right i lost my extra clips and ive got only three shots left on this clip she stared at the six trails inching slowly toward them not good the nearest one was only ten yards away now it had stopped and held its position waiting soon the others had drawn even with it the wormhole she asked sounds good to me go on in their words seemed to jar the stalkers in the field they rushed with lightning speed with their sudden movement ashley froze crouched by the wormhole like a deer in headlights the six creatures burst through the wall of vegetation then stopped in unison hunkering on all fours haunches raised ready to spring tails slashing they looked like a cross between a wolf and a lion amberfurred a cowl of thick mane around their necks huge eyes slitted pupils long jaws bristling with fierce teeth a steady growl arose from the pack freeze ben whispered no sudden moves she wasnt about to move still frozen in her crouch her eyes glued to the six sets of unblinking eyes that stared at her and she was willing to stay that way for as long as it took until something shot from the wormhole and grabbed her ankle a highpitched scream burst from her throat twenty try the paddles blakely called above the roar of the approaching falls he gave one final pull on the engines starter cord it sputtered and died he watched as the current dragged the boat toward the precipice it was impossible to determine from here how high the waterfall dropped but the noise the crescendo of rumbling water and rock suggested a deadly fall he grabbed his paddle and scrambled to the side of the boat he noticed jason digging with his paddle on the other side harder jason harder he called to the boy as he added his strength to fight the current his shoulders burning with exertion im trying its not working were not slowing down blakely darted a look behind them the stern of the boat was at the edge of the falls he watched as the current pushed the boat over the edge grab on tight he hollered and grabbed the strap handles on the pontoons while jason did the same the boat seemed to hover at the edge of the waterfall teetering blakely held his breath as the boat flipped over the edge for a moment walls of water encircled the boat as it plummeted he watched the boat try to tumble on top of him he opened his mouth to yell when the boat slammed into the bottom of the waterfall both of them pressed to the floor of the boat sprays of water flaring in jets around them luckily they hadnt flipped blakely raised his head the waterfall was only about fifteen feet high i cant believe it we the boat tipped over a second waterfall blakely almost lost his grip in his surprise as the boat slipped over the edge crashing downward even above the noise of the thundering water the sound of a ripping pontoon was terrifyingly clear damn it the boat smacked into the bottom of the falls and rapidly filled with water the remaining trapped air in the damaged float barely keeping it above water he pulled jason away from the sinking side so the boy could grip the intact pontoons straps jason stared back behind his shoulder here comes another one before he could even glance behind to confirm the boys panicked statement the boat twisted over the edge of another fall the sinking pontoon acting like a drag spun the boat the uneven motion tumbled the boat over the falls capsizing it into the surging water just before blakely plunged beneath the water he saw jason fly from the boat his hands still reaching to regain his hold as he was launched from his seat then salty water surged around blakely swirling up his nose triggering a fit of coughing which only emptied his lungs of lifegiving air he clamped his mouth closed his chest screaming in protest he fought the current to free himself of the foundering boat with a final push off the intact pontoon he shoved himself away and into clear water with the aid of his life jacket he popped to the surface of the roiling waves gasping air he searched the waters before him crashed the series of three cataracts down which they had fallen he twisted to see if any new falls threatened as the current pulled him away from the others luckily that was the last of them they had reached the bottom of the deep cavern the current pushed him into a pondsized eddy where the waters swirled torpidly treading water he searched around him the cavern glowed with wide patches of phosphorescent fungi in the faint light he spotted an orange object bobbing near the far shore jason blakely kicked vigorously his boots heavy with water jason did not seem to be moving just drifting in the eddy the current threatened to pull the boy from the shoreline and back into the main flow it was taking too long to reach jason as he swam closer he could see blood trailing from a gash in the boys scalp but at least the jacket had kept his head above water hang in there son he increased his effort and within a minute had the edge of the boys jacket in his grip he allowed himself a moment of relief when he heard jasons breath raspy but strong he kicked for shore hauling jason behind him careful to keep the boys nose and lips above water his shoulder bumped into rock he had reached land letting go of jason for a moment he clambered onto the slippery shore once up he lay on his belly and reached out to jason where he listed by the shoreline catching the jacket with the tips of his finger he pulled the boy close enough to grip handfuls of jacket just as he started to yank him up jasons lids fluttered open confused and dazed the boy panicked thrashing his arms wildly garbled protests burbling from his lips a wild hand struck blakely in the temple and he almost lost his grip on the boy he raised his voice trying to be stern and comforting at the same time jason calm down its me youre safe his words seemed to penetrate the boys haze jasons thrashing quieted to a dull squirm thats it blakely said soothingly as he hauled him up onto shore he dragged him back from the edge then collapsed beside him jason struggled to sit up but blakely his breathing ragged held him down dont move rest he gasped blakelys adrenaline rush from the falls seeped away into the slick rock his limbs suddenly waterlogged and heavy he hung his head a moment taking deep breaths what were they going to do now jason coughed moistly beside him drawing blakelys attention once more he reached over and unbuckled the boys life jacket then checked for any additional injuries no broken bones no other lacerations he gently palpated the wound on the boys scalp where he must have hit his head on a rock grimacing he decided that it looked worse than it was but nevertheless he needed the firstaid kit from the boat for antibiotics and a dry dressing he glanced to where the damaged boat had eddied out a few yards from shore before the boat drifted back out he decided hed better salvage what he couldrations flashlights firstaid kit no telling how long they would be down here he glanced at jason the boy was now staring back at him a clear lucidity had returned to his gaze jason licked his lips my head hurts he said his voice a throaty whisper i know my boy you got conked pretty hard jason reached up and touched his head he then stared at his bloody fingertips his eyes wide blakely patted his shoulder youre gonna be fine its only a small cut im gonna swim out to the boat and get a bandage for it but dont worry ill be right back blakely pushed himself up with a groan his chest sending flares of warning pains he did not want to enter the water again but had no other choice jason raised himself up on an elbow watching silently slipping into the water blakely struck out for the boat thankfully it had drifted even closer to shore while he had consoled jason only a few kicks and strokes and he was at the halfsubmerged boat though everything had been secured with ties and straps some things had knocked loose at least the rations and firstaid kit were still there he searched the remainder of the boat damn it the plastic carton that housed the spare flashlights and batteries had been knocked free leaning on the remaining pontoon he rested for a moment in this cavern it was no problemthe fungus gave off sufficient illumination but if they should need to leave shaking his head he explored the remainder of the boat he found jasons gym bag tied to a strap he fingered the bag hmmm made of waterproof material this discovery should offer some consolation to the boy he picked loose the swollen knot and added the bag to his armload of supplies with a final cursory exam he kicked away from the boat and headed to shore luckily the rocky coast was near still by the time he reached shore his lungs burned and a pain had developed in his left arm he threw his collected items up on the edge of the bank then followed them slipping a few times in his attempt to get up finally after severely scraping a knee he managed to clamber up on shore and stand he froze staring at the empty life jacket jason the boy was gone linda reached up and grabbed khalids offered hand fighting back a wave of revulsion at his touch she almost pulled back but his grip dry and warm in her palm held her tight reluctantly she allowed herself to be hauled up the last yard of the rockfall she risked a glance back down the cascade of boulders they had just climbed lit by the ubiquitous fungus the cavern floor was hundreds of yards below them i was right khalid said pointing to the crack in the wall at the top of the rockfall look it is a faultline crack and it goes up he turned to her with a huge grin do you feel it the wind she felt a soft brushing of air across her cheek as the crack drew a breeze down its dark throat almost like it was trying to suck them in the draw of air whistling down the passage away from them it seems promising she forced the corners of her lips up in answer his grin became even wider she stared up into his eyes two black holes in this light as he turned she was tempted to twist free and rush down the rock face but her feet followed khalid into the vshaped crack in the rock after a few yards khalid clicked on his helmet lamp no fungus grew on these slanted walls his beam of light thrust forward ripping into the virgin darkness she unharnessed her own hand lantern twisting it to a diffuse setting to wash broadly across the rock walls spread to either side like wings of stone the roof far above their heads looked like a single slab of rock tilted and resting precariously in place so fragile it seemed even a loud noise might shake it loose crushing them under miles of rock i think this is a relatively new formation khalid said from a geologic standpoint that is maybe only a thousand years or so the rockhe patted the wall on his rightis not as waterworn as the rock in the previous cavern notice how sharp the rock is like it was sliced with a knife a recent seismic event must have created this crack theres no fungus either she mumbled what she waved her light on the walls no fungus here i think if it was a millionyearold crack the fungus would have invaded here too he nodded true we need to be sure that wherever we make camp tonight theres no fungus nearby or if there is that i check it first she said she found talking seemed to push back the clinging terror around her heart during the rest breaks ive analyzed several samples of the fungus theyre not all the same im pretty sure that most of this glowing fungus is safe the predatory species though has a distinct hyphae structure so we need to watch out for it of course we must be more wary he turned forward she wanted to continue talking to keep herself distracted from the thought that she was following a coldblooded killer how did you get picked for this mission was it because of your geology background or were you always a she almost said terrorist but she allowed the word to die in her throat im not a geologist he said i was assigned this mission two years ago and was taught as much geology as i could learn in that time not only to impersonate khalid but also to better understand what i might discover down here i had plenty of time to study as i recuperated from my plastic surgery her mind spun with his revelation youre not the real khalid najmon he helped her over a blockage of tumbled stone i already looked much like the original khalid thats why i was chosen but my superiors are thorough they wanted a more exact match she watched his back as he climbed ahead of her beginning to understand the depth of his drive his fanaticism what happened to the real khalid he turned his dark eyes toward her his gaze disapproving as if her question were foolish what is your real name he ignored her question and turned away theres light up ahead she sidled next to him to look ahead suddenly hopeful maybe a way out the tunnel here widened to the size of a small cavern a glow emanated around a turn in the tunnel the characteristic green light left no doubt what lay ahead fungus she said tiredly he nodded but listen now that he mentioned it she could hear it too a low roaring she recognized the sound from her grandfathers home outside of quebec city sounds like a waterfall yes i think so but its getting late and with fungus ahead we should make camp here we can strike out in the morning for the falls she nodded she too had no desire to battle another attack by the predatory mold but she had been dreading this moment as well camping spending the first night with the man she now knew as a murderer suddenly a yell echoed from the tunnel ahead startled linda involuntarily stepped closer to khalid someone calling it was from far away but it was human jason where the hell are you gosh jason thought cant a guy get a little privacy zippering his pants he stepped back around the stalagmite into view i just needed to take a leak he called to dr blakely ive been holding it all day the doctor hurried over to him still dripping from his swim his eyebrows knit with anger dont ever do that again what run off like that i was only over there jason pointed at his rest station i dont care there are all sorts of hazards around here blakelys face relaxed but his breathing was still raspy listen jason we need to be careful stick together all right i didnt mean to its fine now lets see about that bump on your noggin dragging his feet jason crossed to the small boulder and sat with a grimace he let blakely clean his wound it wasnt too bad when he flushed the wound heck it almost felt good he relaxed closing his eyes suddenly his forehead stung as if it were on fire owww oh quit fidgeting its only a little iodine it burns thats good that means its working blakely strapped a sticky bandage over the cut then he sat back seeming to admire his handiwork well need to change this twice a day jason rolled his eyes great blakely crossed to fish through the collected salvage from the boat are you hungry no im fine unless you have one of those chocolate bars blakely hauled out the box that held the food and cracked it open he reached in and pulled out a foilwrapped bar jasons eyes widened he held out a hand the doctor split the bar into quarters then passed him a single section were going to have to strictly ration our supplies he accepted his share with a frown man this sucked so how do we get back up we dont we have no flashlights so what do we do we wait a day or so someone will find us jason knew a lie when he heard one but he kept his mouth closed the doctor had enough on his mind and jason didnt want to be a bother slumping on the rock he noticed a familiar red bag hey my gym bag you saved it thanks scooting over to his bag he opened it up and pawed through it still here he pulled out his nintendo game and sat back on his heels with a sigh he thumbed on the power button and in a few seconds a familiar theme song jingled from the game cool jason leaned back against a stalagmite and attended to his game at least he would have something to do while they waited immersed in the world of nintendo it was almost like he was back home by now his mother was usually complaining about the noise from his game boy sighing he plunged his character into level twelve jason could you turn that off blakely said standing up the noise jason grinned just like his mother what was it with grownups anyway please jason hurry there was a note of urgency in his voice he clicked off the game and stood up crossing closer to blakely what shhh i thought i heard something jason held his breath picturing another of those creatures sneaking up on them he shifted farther behind the doctor they waited for several tense heartbeats it was difficult to hear with the waterfall crashing so close straining with so much churning water nearby was beginning to make his ears ring he swallowed hard his mouth dry maybe the doctor had just thought he heard something like one of those desert mirages but with sound he sure as heck hoped so blakely shook his head i dont know hellooo the call echoed through the cavern causing both of them to jump blakely looked at jason someones out there i cant believe it jason watched as blakely climbed on top of a boulder it took the old man a few tries to boost up on top jason clambered deftly up next to him who do you think it is i dont know but lets find out blakely cupped his hands over his mouth and yelled were over here by the foot of the waterfall jason listened for a reply nothing for several heartbeats then an answer were coming stay put i told you someone would find us i told you blakely suddenly sounded exhausted and wheezy as he scooted from the boulder jason watched the doctor slump to his knees beside the rock something was wrong jason hopped down and crossed to the doctor blakely coughed raggedly then slipped to his side and collapsed dr blakely jason tugged on his arm he didnt respond jasons heart seized in his throat he searched around him desperate his hands shaking jason darted to the boulder top and screamed at the shadows help linda hurried to catch up with khalid her pack dangling from one shoulder she stared across the cavern that sounded like ashleys son khalid grunted and continued deeper into the cavern aiming for the foot of the falls he held a pistol in his left hand if it is jason he finally said then we must be near the base blakely would not let the boy travel far from the security of the camp she eyed the gun whatre you going to do complete my mission what do you mean that depends on you linda swallowed hard listen khalid i dont want anyone else killed his eyes became shadowed under heavy brows then keep your mouth shut as long as they stay blind to my mission ill spare them she remembered villanueva murdered so suddenly and needlessly i wont say a word khalid nodded and set up a quicker pace again within a few yards he pointed forward over there on top of that rock i can see him its the boy she squinted there were boulders everywhere then she saw the tiny figure waving his arms she called to him hang on jason were coming jason saw them two people wearing helmets their lamp lights sparked across the funguslit cavern they had seen him someone called to him but the falls drowned out the words still it didnt matter the important thing was they were coming he clambered off the rock to check on blakely the doctors color had blanched his lips purplish he still breathed but each inhalation rattled as if pebbles filled his chest jason hugged himself shifting from foot to foot cmon doc dont die help is coming he turned in the direction of the rescuers hurry he prayed he sat down next to blakely picking up one of his hands so cold he thought he rubbed the hand like aladdin with a lamp wishing for the doctor to get better as if in answer to his wish a groan escaped the old mans lips jason rubbed harder then darted to the other side and rubbed his left wrist and hand cmon doc cmon the doctors eyelids fluttered apart pupils crossing then his eyes snapped back into focus he let out another loud groan then just breathed thickly finally he spoke jjason are you okay the doctors lips were taut with pain as he whispered mmy mmedicine nitro nitroglycerine jason looked around him where the doctor lifted his hand but it dropped limply mmy pocket inside my jacket jason patted the doctors clothes and discovered a telltale bulge in the inner breast pocket he fished out a red plastic bottle is this it yyes what do i do one no two pills it took jason a minute to get the childproof cap off the bottle he tapped two pills into his palm the doctors eyes opened again good boy his voice sounded ghostly almost like he was some ventriloquist doll and the speaker was miles away uunder my ttongue jason reached across and dropped the two pills inside the doctors mouth he watched as blakely worked the tablets around then the doctor closed his eyes and took several deep breaths letting his head hang in relief jason thanked whoever was watching over them just then a voice spoke directly behind him causing him to jump in fright jason my god what happened he whirled around and stared into a familiar face her hair was stringy with mud and dark shadows circled her eyes but she was still a wonderful sight linda he jumped up and ran into her arms she hugged him tight and tears burst forth from his eyes he cried into her shirt all the pain and terror of two days releasing in a single torrent oh jason she rocked him in her arms youre okay he continued to cry knowing he should stop but he found he couldnt he let himself be held and rocked his body wracked with sobs he didnt ever want to leave her arms an accented voice intruded jason peeked a moist eye open and saw the bluesteel pistol in the egyptians hand he stiffened in lindas arms so what the hell happened here khalid asked book four drums and death twentyone with ashleys panicked scream the furry grip tightened on her ankle like a closing vise what the hell she sprang to the side yanking her leg and breaking the hold of the attacker she collided with ben accidentally knocking his gun aside a shot rang out as his pistol fired shooting toward the distant roof the waste of a precious round christ woman ben blurted shoving her behind him his eyes still glued to the pack of slathering wolfish creatures pawing the ground somethings in the wormhole it ggrabbed me he darted a look toward the hole nothing was there i dont see anybloody hell it was bens turn to hop away from the wormhole as something crawled from the passage shit ashley thought at first it was a small dirty child naked and covered in filth but when it straightened and turned to her she knew she was vastly mistaken she took another step back it stood four feet high squat and unclothed and from the exposed genitalia it was obviously male his muddy black hair was tied back from his face with a leather ribbon and his chest and legs were covered in coarse matted hair ashleys first thought was that she faced a hominid or protohuman maybe some type of dwarf neanderthal several of the features supported her supposition the thick bony brow bulging above huge eyes the wide blunt nose that sniffed in her direction the protruding jaw and maxillary bones that created a muzzlelike countenance ashley though had studied the fossil record of all the hominid and protohuman species and this breathing and stinking specimen conformed to none of them the closest might be the australopithecine species but this creature was vastly different the body though thick with muscle was not as bulky as the early hominids and the neck was too long and slender his ears too were striking slightly tufted and pointed they actually swiveled back and forth wary none of these features matched the fossil record of any ancient protohumans suddenly the creature stepped toward them ben raised his gun eyeing the pistol the creature opened his mouth baring short fangs then turned away and waved a muscled arm toward the pack of beasts and grunted toward themunkh unkh like a precision drill team they all turned and vanished back into the field he turned back to ben crossing his arms ben lowered his gun he spoke out of the side of his mouth what do you make of this ash im not sure she said with wonder in her voice but i think weve just met one of our cave dwellers one of the creatures ears swiveled away from them he seemed to be listening his eyelids drifting closed after several heartbeats his lids snapped back open he swung around and began walking away with a rolling sort of gait ashley watched him dying to run a hand over his pelvic structure it didnt appear right either matching none of the hominid species who was this what was this the creature walked several yards then stopped and turned back to them his arms crossed again waiting i think he wants us to follow she said stepping forward ben touched her elbow stopping her we dont know where in bloody hell its taking us he whispered for all we know we may be on tonights dinner menu ben raised his voice calling to the waiting figure hold it right there my hairy buddy where are we going the creature glanced toward ben then turned and walked away ashley stared at the retreating figure she had to find out more about these creatures deciding she had nothing to lose she started to follow calling over her shoulder i think its safe ben he couldve let those wolf things attack if he meant us harm ben shook his head but he followed cautiously trailing several yards behind their guide they were led to a thin path in the field of yellow vegetation before the creature started down the track he took a long dagger from a belt which was his only piece of clothing the blade was a long crystal shard it was diamond ben held a restraining arm across ashleys chest obviously worried that their guide was about to attack dogaomarubi their guide said as if explaining hefting up the knife ben nodded uhhuh whatever little fella just keep that little poker in your pants my god ashley said hes trying to speak to us verbal communication its incredible the creature swung away and led them into the yellow fields the grainlike seeds at the tip of the stalky vegetation waved above the head of their guide while reaching only chesthigh on ashley she had to push down the narrow path shoving her shoulders through the barrier of vegetation on either side while their guide seemed to glide down the path without disturbing a single stalk ashley felt like some lumbering elephant after an hour she stumbled more than pushed through the growth ben followed grunting with effort to haul through the dense growth id love a machete he said huffing or a fourwheeler she added i need a rest as if in answer they entered a clearing in the field a small creek crossed the path forded by a stone bridge their guide waited at the foot of the bridge sitting on a stone seat the dagger in his hand dogaomarubi he repeated he pointed to two smooth rocks ashley looked at ben mystified ben looked at their guide she watched as their guide pantomimed sitting down dogaomarubi he said more forcibly he wants us to sit she said crossing to a stone taking off her pack dogaomarubi must mean rest break ben sat on a neighboring rock dropping his pack with a sigh bout time the creature crossed to ben and offered him his dagger ben accepted the dagger thanks i guess he turned to ashley so is this a gift do i give him something in return i dont know cultures vary sometimes its an insult to give a gift in exchange for another then what do i do does he want me to do something with this cut my palm become blood brothers she shrugged their guide stared at them during their conversation ears swiveling back and forth as they spoke finally he grunted loudly and stepped forward snatching the knife from ben he knelt by ben and yanked his pants leg up ben began to snatch his leg awaythen froze ashley saw it too and gasped what is that she crossed to examine it closer bending down beside ben a palmsized black slug was attached to his shin as she watched its body quivered in a wave of undulating tissue it grew a few millimeters larger their guide reached forward with his blade and deftly scooped the creature off bens leg its suckers caught stubbornly on his flesh then popped free two small pink circles with pinpoint holes in the center marked bens leg where the creature had attached a couple drops of blood oozed out fucking leeches ben exclaimed a shiver passing through him he stood up and stripped off his pants his face frozen in a look of disgust five more leechlike parasites were attached grimacing ashley noticed one had climbed as high as his right buttock she glanced down at her own pants suddenly it felt like thousands of scabrous creatures were crawling up her legs knowing it was only her imagination she still quickly unbuckled her belt and climbed out of her pants holding her breath she looked down two black patches covered her left thigh and there was one on her right shit there was no telling what sort of diseases these slugs might be carrying ben standing naked from the waist down looked green as his last parasite was extracted once finished the guide came toward her with the knife i can do this myself she said holding out her hand for the knife their guide glanced at her hand then up to her face she pushed her hand out further insistent he paused and seemed to understand even nodded he placed the hilt of the knife in her hand goddamn leeches she used the tip of the knife to pry the posterior sucker loose then lifted the parasites trunk with the blade until the anterior sucker was reached it took a bit of tugging to dislodge this last sucker carrying the leech on the diamond blade she tossed it in the creek like their guide had she then went to work on the other two once the last one was scraped off its black body still balanced on the blade their guide carefully picked up the leech he pointed at it dogaomarubi he said then threw the parasite into the creek ben buckled his pants i dont think dogaomarubi means rest break i think it means goddamn fucking land leech hooking the pack over her shoulders she nodded notice how he didnt destroy the parasites he was careful cutting them free i watched one of the leeches in the water it swelled with water then crawled back into the fields yeah so i think theyre used in maintaining the fields like a farmer uses bees they use the leeches as some form of irrigation a biological tool ben quivered yeah but bees dont suck your blood he mumbled ashley rolled her eyes and followed their guide over the bridge and into the fields again after an hour a herd of lumbering creatures could be seen in the distance apparently grazing they raised blocky heads on short necks to stare at them as they passed sorta look like wallabies on steroids ben said turituri their guide said pointing at them ashley nodded amazed at the ecosystem evolved here phytoplankton and volcanic gases as a base energy source initiating a food chain based on fungi and microorganisms the system must be incredibly fragile requiring constant manipulation to maintain like the leeches each organism played a key role in fortifying and protecting the environment she eyed their guides back what level of intelligence did this ecosystem require to maintain itself mere chance would not allow such a rich and varied environment to flourish as she continued a flock of birds exploded nearby quick as lightning their guide whipped out a sling and chucked a stone at the birds knocking one from the sky he bolted into the field to retrieve his kill returning shortly with the bird tied to his belt ashley stared at his catch no feathers what she had thought was a bird was a winged lizard ben had been eyeing the bird too i hope thats not our dinner probably tastes like chicken she said tugging him along their guide stopped several feet ahead and squatted down ashley followed his example and slunk lower fearing a predator might be approaching she cautiously surveyed the savanna what is it ben asked slipping behind her crouching too ashley glanced ahead toward their guide he squatted a few feet away defecating beside the trail ashley was speechless ben wasnt not exactly a private sort of folk are they their guide finished and cleaned himself with a frond from the field he then turned around and used the same frond to pick up his stool and store it in a small pouch on his belt tidy too said ben ashley shook her head conservation what this ecosystems energy is limited everything must be put to use for this fragile system to survive nothing can be wasted still remind me not to shake this fellas hand their guide continued forward with hardly a glance back ashley followed after two more hours of travel and two more stops to remove leeches ashley dragged at a snails pace drenched in sweat every part of her anatomy scratched and poked their guide turned to her daga mond carofi he said his slitpupiled eyes narrowed with concern she shook her head not understanding she uncapped her canteen and drank he pointed toward the distant wall the path now turned in that direction carofi she wiped her forehead and squinted where he pointed just barely distinguishable from the shadows on the far wall was a pattern of black dots arranged in rows and levels she recognized the pattern similar to the grouping of dwellings in alpha cavern even from this far away she could see plenty of motion little figures clambering among the dwellings my god ben look a village she said turning to him pulling on his right ear he wore an odd expression a mixture of surprise and fear do you hear a buzzing his eyes rolled back the whites of his eyes showing ben he began to sway a bit teetering then collapsed into the field ben struggled against the darkness he could hear ashley call to him but it sounded like she was down a deep well so far away fading the blackness swallowed him further he felt a tugging on his shoulder at first tenderly then more urgently bens eyes fluttered open his grandfather shook him again benny boy no time to take a nap we need you up and about not again he thought as he looked around at the familiar cavern trunks of rock bearing red bulbous fruit surrounded him he was dreaming but how could that be his grandfather was naked except for a loincloth his chest painted in primary colors what do you want he asked come follow his grandfather stood up and pointed to a cavern opening with a star scrawled above the doorway this way his dead grandfather crossed to the opening and climbed inside ben tried to follow but found he couldnt sit up he was paralyzed i cant move he called only a voice from the cavern answered come when you can you are one with us blackness swallowed him up once again he tried to push it back succeeding this time light burst around him and he found himself staring into ashleys worried face ben she asked what happened i dont know he sat up i dont know as they approached the encampment ashley stared up her mouth hanging open she tried counting the number of dwellings carved into the wall but lost her concentration after a hundred the grouping of homes was crowded in a scalloped declivity about a mile wide forming a natural amphitheater the level of homes climbed some twenty tiers up carved stairways joining landing to landing thick ropes and crude pulleys draped down the face of the cliff in several locations these cave dwellings though similar to the ones found in alpha cavern were not the stark spartan dwellings found there rather they had been transformed into comfortablelooking homes the walls were festooned with multicolored weavings entryways were draped with blankets in intricate designs woven banners hung from various levels depicting strange animals and complicated hunts stone pottery painted in yellows reds and blues dotted many landings ben reached across and took her hand as they left the yellow fields and entered the curve of homes squeezing his hand she noticed the rock floor had been polished to an almost smooth surfacewhether from years of arduous labor or simply from centuries of ordinary foot traffic she wasnt sure she followed the guide through an increasing throng of spectators some hung back with wideeyed awe some crept up to gently touch her arm or pluck at her clothes and some hid behind others peeking around a shoulder she stared up at the cliffs surrounding them small hands held blankets aside to stare at them the carved stairs between levels were crowded with thousands of sharp faces peering from above a scattering of toddlers ran between the legs of their parents all were naked like their guide a few however were adorned with various crude necklaces and some wore caps of woven reed one group of males all charcoalhaired had some type of sharpened bone piercing their noses their guide stopped and knelt on a stone head bowed waiting ashley and ben stood behind him looking over their guides shoulder ashley caught sight of one adult female who drew her attention while only slightly less furred than their guide her pendulous breasts were bare with wide tan nipples drooping down to her bulging belly she exhibited all the signs of pregnancy ashley was about to turn away when a sudden motion caught her eye a tiny hand popped out of the bulge in the females belly it reached up and grabbed a handful of fur beneath a breast using this handhold a mewling infant pink and hairless pulled itself from her belly and began suckling the mother seemed unaware and just continued to stare at ashley ashley squinted fascinated the infant made nervous by the commotion around it lowered itself back down into its hiding place into a pouch look ben ashley said her words causing the spectators to back a step away that mother over there shes carrying a child in a pouch yeah so what did you see those guards at the entryway with the spears and leashed wolf creatures if we want out of here it aint gonna be easy i dont care im not leaving here until they push me out kicking and screaming theres too much to study do you realize what this means she said nodding toward the female what only marsupials carry their young in pouches these creatures must be evolved from marsupial origins great weve been captured by a bunch of kangaroos she ignored his remark still thinking out loud the huge predators that attacked us were also a type of early marsupial its like this whole ecosystems environmental niches have been filled with various marsupial species but how how did they get here how did they survive ben shrugged i mean think about it ben a whole marsupial ecosystem separate from mammalian competition and intrusion has evolved here in these caverns evolution has taken an entirely different branch to sentience just then a hush descended on the whispering crowd total silence ben nudged her and nodded forward a towering creature strode out of the entrance to the largest dwelling he was blackhaired but a spattering of gray dotted his beard his eyes so richly yellow they almost glowed the creature stood a head taller than their guide shoulders wide and muscular he carried a walking stick taller than himself in his right hand topped by a ruby the size of a grapefruit their guide raised his head for the first time and began speaking rapidly the other clearly the leader of the community blurted a word here and there ashley watched the exchange curious what was being said their guide spurted out a last growl and lowered his forehead to the stone before him the leader finally turned to them eyeing ashley first then ben he seemed to be studying them absently scratching at his belly he barked something at them though unintelligible to ashley his words caused the crowd to gasp and step away from them some even darted away scurrying behind drapes ashley turned to ben he shrugged then whispered i dont think this is good the leader stamped his stick on the stone and turned away just then a tottering figure with coarse silver hair emerged from a neighboring cave he moved so slowly and carefully that ashley was sure she could hear his bones creak like the leader he carried a walking stick but unlike the leader he needed it leaning heavily on the staff with each step also rather than a ruby his stick was topped by a pearshaped diamond ashley noticed as he approached that painted on his chest was a design in reds and yellows ben started fidgeting beside her i gotta be going crazy shhh she said i dont think its polite to talk the ancient one looked toward her though his body was obviously old and decrepit there was a sharp intelligence in his eyes revealing an agile mind he turned to ben and nodded toward him then began talking to the leader ben shifted back a step ash ive seen that design before that painting on the ol blokes chest what where she whispered he swallowed hard a trace of fear frosted his voice in a dream painted on my dead grandfather she took his hand listen well figure that out later right now we need to find out what they intend to do with us while they had been whispering the discussion between the old man and the leader had become heated voices were now raised punctuated by the stamping of walking sticks finally the leader bared his teeth and cracked his walking stick across his knee snapping it in half and stormed away now what ben asked the ancient one turned to face them and pointed his stick in their direction he uttered one word death twentytwo exhaustion lulled michaelson from his surveillance of the tunnel outside his tiny refuge it had been hours since ashley and ben had disappeared leaving him alone he strained to listen for any sign of the stalkers nothing silence pressed like a physical weight against his eardrums he sighed at least his ankles throbbing had dulled to a mild protest eventually hed have to adjust the ankle splint but he was too tired for that now he closed his eyes so he could concentrate with less distraction still there was only silence and more silence a yawn escaped him and his head sagged to his chest he shook his head knowing he must stay alert he checked the corridor still clear after several minutes like sinking suns his eyelids began to droop downward again his breathing deepened he hung suspended in that fuzzy haze between dream and reality it was then something brushed across his hand his eyelids snapped open and he threw his head back almost cracking the back of his skull on the wall he fumbled with his gun and pointed it at a man dressed in a ragged marine uniform the sleeves torn off at the shoulders it was impossible he blinked a few times must be dreaming he thought but the figure persisted smiling down at him michaelson stared up into the eyes of his longlost brother harry my god youre alive his brother pushed the muzzle of michaelsons gun away with a fingertip not if you pull that trigger harry said a tired grin on his face michaelson threw his gun to the side and ignoring the protest from his ankle jumped and grabbed his brother in a bear hug he squeezed back tears praying he wasnt hallucinating but his brothers amused chuckles were not those of his imagination he was real thank god thank god thank god michaelson chanted into harrys shoulder brother you gave us quite a chase harry said breaking their hug and swiping a hand through his black hair a familiar mannerism smiling michaelson realized he hadnt seen that gesture in ages it had been decades since harrys hair had been any longer than a tight military crewcut but after the months down here the gesture like an old friend had returned michaelsons voice caught in his throat he almost took his brother again in his arms but then noticed the scar that ran the entire length of harrys right arm it was still pink and raised something recent he reached out and touched it what happened harrys expression sobered michaelson studied his brothers face closely and noticed the circles under his brothers blue eyes a haunted look harry had lost weight the remains of his uniform hung on his frame its a long story harry said well i think we have the time no not really we need to hurry the crakan are close the who those monsters harry waved him to follow gather your gear soldier were bugging out michaelson tossed him his gun and climbed into the alcove to collect his pack and canteen as he crawled back out he noticed his brother checking his gun with an appreciative smile harry handed back the gun reluctantly nice tool i could have used that firepower when i was escorting those scientists maybe then he stopped talking a fierce set to his lips michaelson approached his brothers back laying a hand on his shoulder still half expecting him to vanish in a puff of smoke like some trickster spirit teasing him with his brothers image he noticed his brothers hands were empty how had he survived running around here without a weapon ive got another gun in my pack he started to say no need ive got friends friends michaelson searched the empty passageway shifting his pack to his shoulder who was harry talking about his brother then growled something that sent a chill up his back half howl half moan inhuman low but penetrating michaelson stared at his brothers back as he howled had his brother gone mad during his isolation harry turned to him dead serious dont shoot at them who the hell are you talking there was movement along the walls farther down the passage small figures camouflaged against the rock stepped into the passage knives and spears glistening in the greenish mold light michaelson heard a pebble shift behind him glancing around he saw more were approaching from the rear harry theyre friends saved my life one of the creatures separated from the others and approached his eyes fixed on michaelson as he edged toward harry michaelson held his gun tightly the creature naked stood only four feet high but was wiry with welldefined muscle its shaggy sandycolored hair was secured with a bloodred headband large eyes searched michaelson from toe to head while its prominent ears swiveled in all directions like radar dishes as the small figure approached michaelson judged the weaponry he carried a long knife with a crude crystalline blade was belted around his bare waist and in his fourfingered hand he clutched a long spear as michaelson watched the creature crossed to harry and handed him the spear then it backed away who are no what are they they call themselves mimiswee one of them darted from behind startling michaelson and slid past him to approach harry he pointed behind them doda ferago he said doda crakan harry glanced over to michaelson he says weve got company theyve caught our scent and are closing in on us time to hightail it as if on cue a roar erupted from behind them a second and third answered it coming from all around them they were being boxed in michaelson thought of ashley and ben lost out in the maze of tunnels he stepped next to harry listen ive got friends and i know a small team of my buddies were dispatched after them he pointed a thumb forward your friends have been herded to safety where a second volley of roars echoed through the tunnels ill show you cmon before were someones dinner michaelson stuck close to his brother the tiny figures scurried around him some passing him and running forward others hurrying behind him to check their trail he struggled to keep up biting his lower lip but his bum ankle soon began throbbing in protest again a gap started forming between himself and his brother harry slowed down grabbed michaelsons arm and hooked it over his own shoulder supporting his injured side by now only two or three of the little hunters still jogged behind them guarding the rear im not leaving you behind dennis im slowing you down i didnt come down here to get you killed shut up brother no one is going to get killed today he squeezed michaelsons shoulder besides hooked together like this its just like the threelegged race in kearney when we won the blue ribbon at the fair grimacing with pain michaelson spat out its because you cheated i didnt see you giving back your ribbon there was a sudden eruption of commotion from behind them one of the hunters scurried toward them and growled something to harry harrys expression sobered he answered something unintelligible the figure nodded its chin and scrambled forward only one tiny figure remained behind them now what did he say one of the crakan is closing the gap we wont make safety michaelson ground his molars now he had put his brother in new danger i told you yeah yeah youre always right his brother stopped their shuffling gait the remaining hunter blackfurred with a scar down the right side of his face halted beside harry dennis go on ahead try to keep up as best as you can nobcobi and ill try to slow it down buy some time for the others to hell with that ive got the gun yeah and ive got the experience now move it he recognized the stubborn set to his brothers eyes there would be no arguing well at least take my gun then harry shook his head you may need it his brother then hefted the long spear still held in his right hand besides using nontraditional weapons lessens our chance to gain iljann from the kill what harry waved him on its sort of like counting coup a measure of honor a scrabbling of claw on rock could now be heard coming from down the tunnel now get going michaelson nodded and started down the tunnel no way was he going to leave his brother to fight with only a spear as soon as he reached a side tunnel he ducked in and checked behind him his brother and the other hunter had their heads together the little figure was gesturing with his hands and nodding dropping his pack he unhooked his gun and lay flat in the tunnel sighting back down the passageway he waited listening to the increasing noise of the approaching predator suddenly his brother tensed and swung his spear forward apparently seeing something still out of sight from michaelsons position the tiny hunter pressed himself flat against the passage wall harry planted the haft of his spear in a divot on the floor and held it in place with his foot leaning the length of the shaft forward blade pointing down the tunnel he crouched holding the spear steady a roar of rage echoed down the tunnel then the monster stalked into view filling the entire tunnel massive larger than any michaelson had seen before black as if soaked in pitch it twisted its head back and forth snorting explosively when it spotted harry it froze tensing on its two thickly muscled hind legs it backed a step stretching its neck forward then opened its mouth and screamed harry held his position but answered the monster with his own yell fuck you michaelson let a small smile come to his lips nothing intimidated the foolish bastard laying on his belly michaelson narrowed his eyes raising the rifles butt to his shoulder eyeing through the sights his shot was blocked by his brother shit with a howl of fury the beast burst toward his brother barreling across the gap between them everything happened too fast for michaelson to react harry ducked down as the head lunged at him then braced himself as the beast rammed into his planted spear impaling itself through the chest the shaft snapped in half as harry rolled away just then the tiny hunter leaped from the side wall and landed straddled on the neck of the monster a long knife clutched in his fist he drove the blade at the eyes of the beast gouging viciously the beast reared with an agonized roar throwing its head back dislodging the hunter the long knife though protruded from the monsters left eye the tiny hunter landed hard where he was flung but he quickly scrambled away from the thrashing beast and crawled toward harry the predator spotted the hunter with his one good eye and snapped at him harry tried to reach his fellow hunter first and yank him out of reach of the beast but his hand fell just inches too short the little man was snatched up in the jaws of the monster still harry scrambled forward with the snapped half of his spear apparently intending to use the sharpened remains as a weapon to free his friend michaelson gritted his teeth his brother still partially blocked his shot but obviously wasnt going to leave the tiny hunter to the jaws of the beast damn him holding his breath michaelson squinted and pulled the trigger the explosion from the rifle deafening in the narrow space the sudden noise froze everyone harry stopped his approach to strike the creature the stump of his spear still gripped in his hand the beast paused in midstride harry michaelson called his voice shattered the tableau the beast collapsed to the floor dead a bullet through its brain as it fell it released its prey the hunter tumbling from its jaws harry ran forward to his friend michaelson crawled from his hiding place and approached his brother eyeing the bulk of the beast that blocked the passage how is he harry helped the tiny hunter stand hell live theyre a toughskinned lot a few punctures in his shoulder nothing seriously damaged though good michaelson knelt beside the mimiswee hunter and lay a hand on his good shoulder harry sat back on his haunches dennis i thought i told you to get out of here michaelson frowned besides being your older brother i also outrank you suddenly im glad you rose through the ranks faster than me otherwise you mightve actually listened to me harry then turned to him his eyes serious thanks dennis the tiny hunter started spouting gibberish a pained expression in his eyes harry nodded soberly the tiny figure reached to his injured shoulder and dabbed a finger in the seeping blood then turned to michaelson nobcobi wants to share his iljann with you harry explained its a distinct honor among his people equivalent of blood brothers the furry hunter reached forward and placed a bloody finger to michaelsons forehead br brother he said in a half growl twentythree khalid watched as linda embraced the frightened boy her cheek resting atop jasons head she whispered consolations in the boys ear khalid crossed to blakelys form sprawled on the rock the doctors eyes were open and staring at him his breathing still ragged and hissing the doctor had information he needed data necessary to complete his mission he knelt beside blakely and offered his canteen pouring a small stream of water into the doctors mouth blakely closed his eyes and swallowed greedily then pushed the canteen away sloshing water across his chest thanks he muttered what happened khalid asked how did you end up here blakely spoke with his eyes closed as if remembering the camp it was attacked destroyed he breathed thickly catching his breath khalids first thought was that someone had outmaneuvered him a second agent but the doctors next words dismissed this idea huge creatures hundreds of them overwhelmed the camp we escaped in the raft ended up stranded here khalid frowned at the bad news damn so there were more of them he had hoped the few they had run into were the only ones he looked up at the series of waterfalls if they should eventually find their way back up awaiting them lurked a herd of those predators he sat back on his haunches and holstered his pistol what now he mumbled to himself the doctor heard him and answered his voice still hoarse but steadier we wait leave it to the military once they realize what happened theyll be swarming through here let them find us khalid rubbed the thick stubble on his cheek the doctor was right the military would be mobilizing shortly reestablishing the security of the base and with the entire us navy down here combing the place his mission would be that much more difficult if not impossible he rubbed at his tired red eyes sandy grit ground under his lids he would have to reach alpha base somehow before military reinforcements did and with enough spare time to finish setting his charges and get the hell out of the place a tall order even for himself perhaps this was a test from allah the forces of nature pitted against him testing him how else could one explain the vile monsters that blocked them the innumerable obstacles the new horrors at every turn it had to be a test from the almighty he closed his eyes placed his palms across his face and prayed for the strength to succeed and for a sign that he was honorable in his mission he prayed for five minutes his heart beating in his ears but still no sign appeared finally he sat back with a sigh placing his hands on his knees nothing then when he raised his eyes he saw it a plume of oily smoke curling out from an opening halfway up the wall of the cave khalid sat up straighter doctor was the camp burning was there lots of smoke the doctor cleared his dry throat yes thick with smoke why khalid pointed to the far wall a smile of delight on his features look over there the smoke it must be the way back up he continued to stare at the billowing smoke like some cloudy finger of god still holding jason under one arm linda stared at the smoky tunnel opening emotions warred within her relief at finding a way back up and dread for the events that might transpire what would khalid do he couldnt let blakely and jason know his plans without killing them she turned to stare at khalid his expression as he stared up the cliff face was one of strange exaltation his eyes wide glassy a shiver passed through her when those eyes met hers he smiled at her its almost finished he said she nodded it had all happened too fast she had expected days of searching before the way home was discovered giving her plenty of time to formulate a plan extra hours to decide if she should try to stop him or just save her skin and let him do what he wanted a tugging on her arm distracted her she looked down at jason linda what about my mom do you think shes okay she squeezed the boys shoulder as he stared up at her she should lie tell him everything would be just fine but jason was an astute kid his eyes as he looked at her were dry and serious he wanted an honest answer jason i truly dont know but ben and major michaelson are with her shes in good hands jason nodded khalid touched her shoulder startling her he gestured for her to follow him a few steps away to talk in private her heart pounded in her throat as she followed he checked over his shoulder to make sure they were alone listen i want us to head out tonight her mouth dried this was happening too fast like a freight train racing toward a demolished trestle but blakely shouldnt be moved so soon khalid didnt blink i wasnt planning on taking him or the boy her words were a whisper you promised me that you wouldnt kill anyone else if i stayed silent im not going to kill them just leave them is that any different he shrugged as i told you if they find out about my plan i would be forced to kill them at least by leaving them they have a chance to fend for themselves staring at khalid she pictured jason starving to death and blakely being devoured by a beast how easily he condemned blakely and jason to a lingering death where was the heart in this monster she swallowed i hate this well leave after the other two fall asleep khalid whispered in her ear like a lover passing secrets you wont have to face them his words threatened to destroy her sanity how could he so casually plan their deaths just stroll away from them in the night how could then an idea formed in her mind she chewed on the idea but there wasnt much time and the risk was great she bit her lower lip unsure she watched jason grin at something blakely said she saw his eyes shine brightly in the fungal glow shining with young life with so much of life yet to explore she closed her eyes firming up her plans she could do this no she would do this okay well leave tonight she said with resolve while linda feigned sleep blakely and jason slept wrapped in spare blankets blakely snored a whistling gurgle heard over even the rushing falls but lindas slitted eyes stayed focused on khalids profile where he sat half in his sleeping bag leaning on a boulder she waited she watched his head slip down then bob back up as sleep almost overtook him almost linda had talked khalid into resting a bit pleading exhaustion herself just a nap of two hours she had begged enough to charge her batteries for the next leg of their journey he agreed she then secretly dissolved several of her prescription antianxiety tablets in khalids water and made sure he drank his fill the strong mineral tang of the local water disguised the taste of the tablets the pills wouldnt knock him outthey only had a mild sedative effectbut in these numbers the medication should make him so drowsy he might accidentally fall asleep while standing guard it was all she needed she saw his chin hit his chest again this time his head stayed down with her heart pounding in her ears she listened tense in her sleeping bag close enough to khalid to recognize when his breathing deepened into a regular rhythm she knew she did not have much time with agonizing slowness she inched from her sleeping bag thankfully the roar of the neighboring falls muffled her movements she slipped next to him and collected his lantern and helmet from a nearby rock she had originally planned to snatch khalids pistol but he had fallen asleep with it tucked in his sleeping bag to try to get to it now was too risky so she resorted to a backup plan she removed the batteries to his lantern and helmet he may still have the gun she thought but lets see if he can travel blind once finished she turned her attention to the dozing doctor linda placed her hand over the doctors lips pressing hard when he jerked awake she leaned over him and pressed a finger to her lips indicating silence once he settled from his shock she removed her hand and waved for him to follow quietly she led him off several yards once far enough away she pressed her lips to his ear hoping the roar of the falls kept her words from reaching the sleeping figures we need to sneak away now can you travel he squinted at her yes but why whats going on she gave him an abbreviated version of the events that led her to him by the time she had finished her voice was trembling blakelys eyebrows had risen higher and higher as she told her story the asshole i didnt think hell its my fault i should have checked more thoroughly too damn naive about everything the doctor looked decades older than just a week ago sunken eyes slumped shoulders even his hair looked grayer she placed a hand on his arm we need to get jason and steal away now he shook his head why dont we just jump on him and wrestle the gun away or grab a big rock and clobber him hes a trained killer a machine she could not keep the fear out of her voice were no match for him if hes attacked and only injured then were dead its safest if we just run try to get into the darkened tunnels where without light he cant follow what about the other hazards out there he pointed toward the far wall we wont survive long without a weapon she hugged her arms around her body i know but id rather take my chances on the unknown than with him okay but we travel light only canteens and rations she nodded lets get jason jason panicked when he was shaken awake he couldnt breathe he struggled violently for several heartbeats until he realized his respiratory distress was due to lindas hand clamped over his mouth she hushed him her lips at his ear quiet jason he stopped struggling but his heart still pounded his head ached what now more monsters he scooted up into a seated position and saw blakely collecting the boxes of dry rations creeping like a thief in the night careful where he placed his feet khalid slumped in his sleeping bag both blakely and linda kept glancing toward the snoring man jason turned to linda with a question on his lips she held a finger across her own he didnt know why he had to be so darned quiet the crashing waters were noisy enough still he did as he was told and sat silently within less than a minute linda and blakely had piled three canteens flashlights and a bag of rations near him blakely showed linda a widemuzzled pistol he had found in the supplies from the boat a flare gun jason noted blakely crouched by him and whispered listen boy we need to sneak away leave khalid behind we have to move fast do you think you can do that he nodded confused but from lindas pale face and nervous eyes there was something to fear here he eyed khalid hunched like an ogre linda and blakely quickly split up the small pile of supplies and waved him to follow he stood and picked up his gym bag blakely eyed the bag and shook his head leave it he mouthed to him no way he could carry it he wasnt a baby he shook his head and clutched his bag tighter the doctor opened his mouth but linda touched blakelys arm and silenced him she waved for the two of them to follow her jason marched behind her and blakely followed no one spoke as they traveled even when their abandoned camp was hidden by stalagmites and boulders the silence pressed around jason more frightening than screaming monsters and firing guns every odd noise made him jump every crunch of their steps seemed to holler across the cavern thankfully a half hour later when they finally reached the tumble of rocks and boulders that led up to the smoking tunnel linda spoke look she pointed to the opening far above the smoke has thinned already thatll make it easier for us to breathe yes blakely said but it may make it harder for us to trace the way back up his expression was grim as he eyed the climb can you manage linda asked do i have a choice linda squeezed the doctors shoulder then turned to him jason what about you can you climb up these boulders piece of cake he said with a squeak then wed better hurry i dont know how long the drugs will keep khalid sleeping khalid dreamed he gripped his mothers robe as the black storm descended on her camp in the desert he tried to warn her that the gale was coming but she just continued to talk to the other robed figures oblivious to the roaring of the approaching sand and winds he tugged on her robe trying to get her attention but she shoved him aside with her hip he raced to the tents flap peeking out at the seething maelstrom as it wiped away the horizon he turned to the group of robed figures his mother among them he screamed at them his voice a reed before the wind this time they heard him and turned he opened his mouth to repeat his warning when he saw the faces peering over the veils not faces skulls yellow sandscrubbed bone peering over black veils skeletal hands reached for him from folds in the robes he backed away into the roaring storm a scream clutched in his throat facing the storms attack khalid jerked awake confused as the roar followed him from his dream he cringed against the roar until he realized it was just the waterfall crashing nearby swallowing hard almost imagining his throat was caked with sand he pushed out of his sleeping bag he reached for his canteen it was gone he bolted up in one scan of the empty sleeping bags like so many discarded snakeskins he realized he had been duped damn her he raised the pistol as if expecting an attack he peered around no sign he glanced toward the distant smoking tunnel where only a whispery black trace still seeped from the opening at least he knew where she had gone he kicked through the scattered debris inventorying the remains all the lanterns were gone batteries too no light source he reached into his pocket and pulled out his cigarette lighter he flicked it open a flame burst upward it would be a fire to light his path a smile of determination pressed his lips flat he would teach her soon shed know his wrath and beg his forgiveness he would be like the black storm of his dream merciless and unstoppable twentyfour ashley took a step back wondering if her ears were playing tricks how could this creature speak english it had to be a coincidence a common series of sounds that just happened to match an english word death the old silverhaired creature repeated pointing his stick and shaking it at her as if trying to get her to understand he then planted his staff and leaned heavily on it a saddened set to his shoulders dobori dobi he finally said in a tired voice at his words a gasp arose from around her igniting a scurry of commotion the few curious onlookers who still thronged around her scrambled away disappearing into cave openings cloth flaps quickly drawn across entryways not a single face peeked around a corner only a scattering of the small creatures remainedthose armed with diamond spears and even these warriors shifted their feet nervously ben spoke up beside her ash weve got trouble she glanced at him his eyes were huge ben she whispered feeling exposed under the eyes of the creatures what do we do hell if i know youre the anthropologist maybe we should ashley was interrupted by a firm stamp of the old creatures staff on the rock demanding their attention dobori dobi the creature boomed pointing at ben with a long crooked finger then he turned and hobbled away wait ben called the creature turned to face him but it took much effort he was obviously exhausted coughing raggedly and leaning heavily on his staff with large moist eyes he stared back at ben he lifted a finger and placed it at the tip of his ear then lowered his finger to the center of the design painted on his chest just above his heart he turned away and thumped across the empty rock to vanish into a cave opening ash what do you make of that im not sure he was trying to tell us something but who knows what she swallowed hard trying to dislodge a solid lump that had stuck in her throat she swiveled around to check behind her nothing she and ben stood alone at the edge of the yellow fields the cliff walls that contained the village cupped around them swinging back around she counted ten guards who remained out in the open stationed at the ramps that led up to the second level of dwellings no guards blocked them from just heading out into the fields as she was about to suggest that maybe they should just leave try to find their own way back across the fields a deep booming erupted from the cliff face rhythmic and slow the low resonant throb cut to her diaphragm vibrating through her as if she were a plucked bowstring she knew even if she crammed her fingers in her ears she would still feel the sonorous beat drums ben needlessly explained she nodded cultures use drums to mark ceremonial rituals she turned to stare again across the yellow fields especially rituals of death but she left that unsaid ben though knew what the drums meant hell he had watched enough tarzan movies to know the natives were restless still a strange calm enveloped him he knew his heart should be racing and his palms should be clammy with fear but no instead he felt detached as if viewing events through anothers eyes ever since the old man had touched his finger to his chest a sense of peace had descended upon him with each new drumbeat odd thoughts intruded upon him almost as if the drums spoke to him boom death approaches boom survive and live boom one way out boom prove your blood ben ashleys face appeared before him seeming to appear out of nowhere her voice tiny when compared to the call of the drums she waved a hand in front of him are you okay im fine he shook his head just trying to think you were mumbling something something about blood its nothing are you sure youre all right considering our predicament im peachy keen he offered her a weak smile hoping she would swallow his lie while wondering himself just what the hell was wrong with him im fine he repeated still she wore a worried expression on her face any idea what they might be planning she asked while searching the cliffs for movement he shrugged there might be any of a number of ways the creatures could murder them rush at them with spears drop boulders on them sic those wolf creatures on them let those damned leeches suck them dry who knew he rubbed at his temples oddly enough he did know they would be attacked by air death approaches but just how the hell did he know this he turned around and searched the skies above the fields trying to see if anything was visible nothing but glowing fungus roofed the world but he was sure he even knew from which direction he squinted his eyes to the left then he saw them black specks against the greenish background glow approaching swiftly growing rapidly in size as they closed the distance he pointed over there ash do you see them what where he tilted her chin until she was looking in the correct direction the drums must be calling them he said my guess is theyre acting like a dinner bell what are they she asked something hungry cause theyre coming in bloody fast ashley pointed to the gun at his waist how many bullets did you say you have left only two he scanned the horizon counting the flying black figures larger than specks now their wide wings could be seen beating the air id say theres a flock of at least fifteen aiming our way so we cant shoot our way out ashley eyed the fields maybe we could run for it there are no guards out in the fields anymore no wed be just sitting ducks out there we need to find cover ben turned to the village the drums had increased in fury pounding wildly making it harder to think clearly he surveyed the village all the dwelling openings were now securely covered with thick drapes nervous guards stationed at the ramps watched him with narrowed eyes clutching spears tightly no guards stood between him and a handful of openings on the ground level he nudged ashley and nodded to the six black openings how about we take cover in one of those will the guards let us those spears dont seem too inviting notice theyre only guarding the way up these dwellings he said waving an arm to encompass the six black openings are uncovered and unguarded wed better take a chance then look ben swung around what the hell are they the flock had approached close enough to make out details leathery wingspans spread several yards wide armed with hooked black beaks and ebony talons longer than his forearm and their eyes black dull orbs unblinking like those of a great white shark some flying predator a descendant of the pterodactyl maybe ashley said tugging on his arm lets go theyre almost on top of us we need cover he tore his eyes from the approaching flock now only fifty meters away run he hollered as he pushed her forward the guards made no move to stop them the drums suddenly stopped the frantic pounding ceasing in a single beat leaving only a heavy silence he hurried his pace struggling to keep up with ashley behind him he heard a loud thud followed by several others like boulders crashing to earth the flock had landed screeches erupting from several throats ahead ashley had almost reached the closest opening the five remaining black holes spread farther along the wall suddenly he remembered the message from the drums almost like the words blazed across his minds eye one way out he again studied the six openings six and only one way out he noticed a small carving above the entrance ashley was driving toward a circle with a triangle within it not the correct symbol wrong way he sped faster and tackled ashley as she tried to duck into the opening he rolled across the floor jamming his shoulder as he cradled her from the fall she struggled free whatre you doing no time he pushed up yanking her with him follow me ben behind you he swung around pulling his pistol free as he turned knowing what he would find it stood taller than an ostrich but unlike the thinnecked bird it was all muscle and beak it lunged at him striking low trying to gut him with its hooked beak bloody hell he was getting damned tired of things trying to eat him he fired two shots into its skull the last at almost pointblank range bugger off he screamed ducking away pulling ashley aside with ashley in tow he sprinted across the cliffs base searching for the correct symbol behind him the beasts carcass was attacked by the others hot blood splashed across the back of his legs as he ran he prayed the body would buy them the time they needed he continued to search the next opening had a squiggling line with a circle atop the next a crooked arrow then a circle within a circle like a doughnut wrong wrong wrong he rushed past these openings then he saw it carved above the next tunnel was a crude star like an explosion in his brain he pictured his grandfather in his dream cave beckoning him inside an opening with an identical star this was the one way out he flew into the opening dragging ashley with him as he tumbled into the hole he almost crashed into a figure standing just six feet from the opening there was just enough light to make out the design painted on his chest as he leaned on a staff teetering the old man raised a tiny hand and rested it on bens shoulder he growled thickly but the words were understandable you are one of us ashley untangled her hand from bens grip what was going on she stepped aside as the old one waved his staff to clear room using his staff like a crutch he stomped between them and crossed to the lip of the entrance he waved them over to peer out ben she gave him a questioning look he shrugged at her and joined the old man frowning ashley crossed to join them having to hunker down to get a better view outside the flock of predators had finished cannibalizing their dead companion leaving gore and bones strewn across the rocky floor a couple of the winged monstrosities were trying to get past the guards and up the ramp to the habitats but spearing lances kept them at bay a whistle sounded from somewhere to the left and from the other five openings a small procession of mewling hoofed creatures burst forth prodded out by spears held by other tribesmen the creatures were similar in size to a small calf but more horselike in appearance except for the sharp curling tusks they reared and pawed at the rock eyes rolling white with terror once free of the poking spears they scattered darting in all directions their motion caught the attention of the flock and the hornybeaked creatures tore into the herd of hoofed animals if we had chosen any other tunnel but this one ben muttered to her wed be herded out along with those animals to the slaughter it was a test ashley started to turn her face from the carnage but not before she saw one little animal zip away from the rest and freeze wildeyed just outside their cave as it spotted her she cringed as she saw a predator pounce from behind its hooked beak swinging forward intending to impale the tiny creature the creature mewled plaintively at her its eyes wide with fear without thinking she darted from the cave snagging the nape of the terrified animals neck and dragged it into the cave then this little one gets sanctuary too she said gasping as she led the small creature deeper into the tunnel the old man turned to her his eyes wide with shock with his back to the entrance he failed to see the open beak plunging toward him the foiled hunter was not going to give up its prey so easily ashley opened her mouth to warn him raising an arm but before she could utter a sound the old man without even glancing over his shoulder swung his staff backward the crack of staff against beak echoed loudly down the tunnel there was surprising strength in those old thin arms still staring at her he mumbled to himself and crossed to her laying a hand on her shoulder he then nodded to her and continued deeper into the tunnel pausing only to beckon for them to follow a loud clangor erupted from outside sounding like pots and pans banging together ben stepped away from the entrance and crossed to her now that theyre fed the noise is driving those buggers away like so many trained parakeets she said she stood up and followed the old man the little animal clopped after her mewling quietly ben eyed the hoofed creature you couldve been killed she said sheepishly it was an impulse i was thinking that if you hadnt chosen correctly then that could have been us out there crying for help i couldnt just leave it out there to die the little animal bumped against her and nuzzled at her boot as she walked ben put his arm around her shoulders and squeezed i think you made a friend she leaned into bens arms jason always wanted a pet together they trudged down the darkened tunnel lit only by occasional splashes of glowing fungus after a few minutes she said now tell me how you knew which was the right opening she felt him tense beside her ash youre gonna think im nuts after this trip i could believe almost anything she stared at the back of the old creature a creature who spoke english and whose tribe predated man by several million years yeah she was feeling pretty openminded right now okay he took a deep breath remember when i told you i had seen that symbol on the old blokes chest before yeah something about a dream of your grandfather right well in that dream my grandfather led me to a cave opening with the same symbol carved above this opening he told me it was safe she stopped and stared at him are you serious he laughed weakly pulling her forward were alive arent we have you had clairvoyant experiences before hell no if i did i wouldnt be in this trouble right now id be basking in the las vegas sun waiting for my next performance as mr clairvoyant then why now he squeaked out a nervous laugh slipping ahead of her as they followed the old man i have an idea but its bloody creepy what these dreams of this place ive been having them a lot since i first got wind of this trip theyve gotten clearer and more frequent since we got down here so you think it has something to do with the cavern no with him he pointed at the old mans bare backside i think hes been communicating with me when the drums began beating earlier strange thoughts and words formed in my mind telepathy she said pondering the implication but why only you he shrugged i dont know my aboriginal blood maybe she stared up at his blue eyes and blond hair considering your appearance that blood is awful thin well there must be enough why do you think it has anything to do with your ancestry the images in my dreams he said counting off his points on his fingers first my grandfather appearing dressed in traditional aboriginal garb then the recent recurrence of my childhood nightmare of the cave even the words from the drumsprove your blood it all seems to point to some ability inherent in my ancestral blood she took a deep breath common sense and logic made her want to scoff at his claim it had to be pure hogwash still ben had proven himself by selecting the right cave she remembered a colleague who researched his doctoral thesis on aboriginal tribes there is a lot of mysticism in aboriginal lore spiritual walkabouts elders able to communicate over vast distances using dreaming pools that sort of thing right he said i thought it was mumbo jumbo myself an aboriginal friend that i used to cave with swore he had seen some pretty weird shit but i never believed him distracted ashley pushed the little hoofed creature aside as it tried to get underfoot it bleated and took off down a side passage whats the connection between a previously undiscovered tribe of evolved marsupials in antarctica and aborigines in australia hell if i know but that drawing you discovered in the cliff dwellings in alpha cavernthe oval with the lightning bolt through itmakes me wonder what remember when i told you i had seen them before in aboriginal cave paintings she nodded some sort of spirit guides of the aborigines right the ones who supposedly taught early aborigines how to hunt the mimis the old man glanced backward at them he mumbled something gota trifluca mimiswee both ben and she looked at each other youre the telepathic one she said what did he say ben shrugged and shook his head the old one seemed to sense their confusion and sighed heavily he pointed at his chest mimiswee he waved to encompass the entire warren of village tunnels mimiswee i still dont get it ben said ashley held up a hand mee mee swee she stammered concentrating on the correct pronunciation she pointed a finger at the old man his old neck creaked up and down then he turned away ashley stumbled in shock this was impossible he was telling us the name of his tribe the mimiswee she said then under her breath she uttered mimis the aboriginal rock spirits theyre one and the same bens eyes widened with sudden understanding before he could say anything the tunnel emptied into a large cavern lit by fungus on the walls and ceiling ashley stared in awe at the columns supporting the distant roof but it wasnt the rocky colonnades that drew her attention it was the thick growth that wrapped around the columns sprouting white limbs laden with a pulpy red fruit hanging like japanese lamps damn said ben from behind her not here again ben hesitated before following ashley and their old guide into the chamber he studied the room expecting to hear ghost voices or see his grandfather moving in the shadows but neither occurred on closer inspection the fruity growths were the only similarity between this chamber and his dream cavern the formations were all wrong and the growths werent nearly as thick or leafy as in his dream taking a deep breath he followed ashleys slim back ashley stopped reaching up to one of the red fruits i think theyre a type of mushroom she said breathless nodding toward the growth notice the lack of leaf structure the interconnecting root system hyphaelike linda would go apeshit over this stuff speaking of linda ben said this is all very fascinating but we have friends depending on us i know ben i know i havent forgotten maybe with the mimis rudimentary grasp of our language they can tell us a way up from here well lets ask ashley shook her head and continued deeper after the old man first we need to gain their confidence your stunt in escaping those predators helped but they still seem suspicious of us wary we need to proceed cautiously or we might still find our heads on the block by now they had reached the center of the chamber here the floor was clear of the rocky columns and their bulbous growths a shallow pit was carved into the center of the floor about a hand span deep around the declivity the stone was polished to a glassy sheen and bloodcolored drawings encircled the central pit the old man leaned on his staff on the far side of the clearing my god look at the detail ashley said leaving bens side to study a drawing closer up she knelt to peer at a depiction of a creature being attacked by a group of tiny warriors look the red paint is the same color as those weird fruits the mushrooms are probably some type of homegrown dye great he said sarcastically some freakin artists den no i think its a religious place primitive cultures place great stock in graven images idols statues paintings that sort of thing give me a few minutes to study these maybe i can learn something she slid over to examine the next picture not even bothering to glance at him ben felt the stare of other eyes like in his dream drilling into the back of his skull he turned around the old man stood on the far side sparing only a quick glance at ashley before settling those gray eyes back on him the elder nodded and sat crosslegged down on the floor his staff balanced across his knees he motioned for ben to do the same lowering to the floor ben finally noticed how tired his legs were it had to be evening by now late evening with a rattling sigh he settled to the hard floor stretching a kink out of his back he allowed his body to slump into a relaxed pose he dreamed of a tall bottle of warm beer glancing up he noticed the old man staring at him not uttering a sound just peering across at him with those intent gray eyes he seemed to want something but what ben smiled across at him one of his patented charmers that was known to turn a crocodile into a pussycat but the elder only frowned back at him his gaze still expectant well stuff him then ben thought letting his lids drift closed as he relaxed further he had solved enough mysteries for one day now he only wanted to find a soft spot to sleep his chin slowly sank to his chest maybe just a nap he drifted into a hazy land half aware of the tiny noises ashley made as she scuffled from drawing to drawing it felt so good to release the pressures of the day allowing them to seep into the rock his breathing deepened and a slight snore rattled from his nose if only he could ben benny boy wake it up there son bens eyes snapped open who the hell he still sat in the same cavern the ring of columns and pulpy fruit surrounding him but instead of the old creature his grandfather sat crosslegged across the pit he waved a liverspotted hand in his direction ben glanced around the place was otherwise empty not even ashley was there he craned his neck peering that was odd he could still hear her moving off to the left mumbling something but she was invisible benny whatcha lookin for where am i his grandfather lifted a finger crooked with arthritis and pointed to his skull in here my boy ben took a deep breath his heart beginning to beat faster this was insane his grandfather and the chamber began to fade to blackness whoa there boy ya need to calm yourself cant get all riled up or this here wont work swallowing hard ben began to get an inkling of what was going on he concentrated on letting his body relax starting with his toes and working up the imagery around him intensified with clarity there ya go benny thats better he concentrated on breathing evenly and deeply as he spoke youre not my grandfather no im not his grandfather smiled slightly then his image slowly shrunk and swirled his brow thickening his eyes widening a staff appeared resting across his knees the swirling settled into the figure of the old crippled creature this is of course my true image i am called moamba the elders voice still sounded like his grandfather it was disconcerting to hear it coming from such an alien face how why questions tumbled in his mind benny neither of us speaks the others language so i speak to you with the language of the mind my thoughts are translated by your mind into images and words you understand so you stole the memory of my grandfather to represent yourself not me you did it was your mind that pulled up your grandfathers image to represent a herihuti ben pictured his grandfathers stern sober face and just what the devil is a herihuti i am as are you someone with the ability to connect on the dream plane to see farther down the dark paths to the unknown but why me i can read the history of your blood a strong herihuti glides in your bloodline from the distant past very strong you are still unlearned but with time your skill might even surpass mine a skill that my village needs in order to survive what do you mean survive i am the last of my people with this ability moamba said his expression suddenly pained with the passing of time i have seen the other herihutis depart this world until only i was left now even i cant lead the hunters to feed our people and protect the boundaries from the crakan anymore the hunters go out alone blind without the guidance of a herihuti to see beyond the next bend it is very dangerous and we have lost many hunters widows wail every night we cannot survive much longer without a new herihuti to guide our people he pointed one finger at ben you are the one me i have been calling for many years seeking to draw others like me here to our village but you were the only one to answer bloody hell there must be others others like well like you maybe another village would share their herihuti with this village moamba shook his head after the scattering the other villages were lost to us in deep dreams i sometimes hear inklings of the lost ones but it may just be wishful dreaming rather than true dreaming still you cant expect me to moambas form drifted back into the image of his grandfather anger lines deep around his eyes blood runs true you are one of us ben opened his mouth to protest when ashleys voice suddenly intruded ben you must see this with her words the images around him faded the face of his grandfather swallowed by blackness he opened his eyes and shook his head clearing the clinging cobwebs of his dream ashley stared at him with a crinkled brow jesus how could you sleep at a time like this what dazed he rubbed his temples a vague throbbing still there come see this ashley said oblivious to what had just transpired she crossed a few yards and knelt by a painting waving him over he glanced across the clearing to the old man he still sat staring with a shiver ben pushed up to his feet and slid over to ashley unsure what to tell her what did you find ash look at this painted petroglyph its a triptych a trip what three pictures see the last one ashley crouched before three painted red circles and pointed at the third one ben knelt closer not quite believing what he was seeing the third circle held a crude map of landmasses of the southern hemisphere my god thats australia i know its crude but fairly accurate now look at the other two ben studied the other two circles the first showed the australian continent connected to the antarctic continent by a thick land bridge the second showed the same huge land mass breaking away what about them its the connection it explains how the mimis of australiaat least some of themended up here i still dont get it ashley sighed as if she had already adequately explained millennia ago land bridges connected various continents with the continental plates shifting and ocean levels changing dramatically land bridges rose and sank frequently some disappearing in a matter of months the fossil record also supports the existence of just such a bridge many fossilized remains of extinct marsupial species have been found in antarctica he shrugged so you think yes look at the first map she pointed to the link between the continents thats the land bridge the second picture shows the breakup of the bridge the third picture shows how the continents eventually became isolated but how could these people know about this map this ashley sat back on her haunches they obviously lived through it and mapped it like the american indians did their coastlines and through either an oral or pictorial history they kept the memory alive she pointed to both australia and antarctica on the third map they were once connected then something drove these people out of australia at least some of them they were trapped here when the land bridge sank ben studied the images imagining a people forced to flee to the icy continent across a bridge of rock he placed a finger on antarctica two tribes separated my god the scattering he mumbled maybe this was what moamba was talking about who ashley asked turning her nose from the middle picture ash you better sit down for this one he watched as she gave him her full attention her eyebrows knitted tightly together as he explained what had just occurred between him and the old man her eyebrows drew apart and climbed high on her forehead you mean he can speak to you she exclaimed when he had finished they do use some rudimentary telepathy she glanced toward the creature seated crosslegged across from them is he listening to us right now reading our minds i dont think so we both have to be in a trancelike state like the aborigines do with their dreaming pools when they communicate and hes the last of his people with this ability ben nodded besides me ashleys expression became thoughtful from the standpoint of population genetics the loss of this trait among the tribe makes sense this community has been isolated for thousands of generations the amount of inbreeding in this closed group without the infusion of fresh genetic stock would weaken the complex string of genes that creates this ability eventually wiping it out she turned to him her eyes wide and glassy i could spend a lifetime just studying this single traits effect on a population it will turn the field of anthropology on its ear i mean ben held up a hand ash thats all just fine and dandy but we still need to get out of here or at least retrieve michaelson and the others ashleys expression sobered with his words youre right she said nodding theres plenty of time to start investigating after we get back to alpha base she pointed at the sitting figure did you ask moamba how to get out of here no and i dont think hell be too cooperative he wants me to stay take his place in the tribe that could be a problem ashley started tapping the tip of her finger on her chin something doesnt make sense if youre so damned important to the tribe why did they try to kill you i dont know apparently not everybody shares moambas view that young buck with the ruby staff possibly the village leader sure as hell didnt seem to want us around perhaps we could a sudden commotion erupted behind them ben turned to see a familiar figure limping toward them from between the shrouded columns a small group of armed creatures followed spears knocking the red mushrooms to swinging ashley sprang up its michaelson bens eyes drifted across the legion of spears that followed the major he studied the score of armed warriors while most of the warriors held their spears casually across their shoulders some kept wary hands on scabbarded knives stepping up to michaelson ben clapped him on the shoulder he noticed the smears of blood on his face what happened he asked it looks like youve been through the bloody wringer ashley joined them a worried expression frozen on her face as she looked him over for injuries michaelson avoided their eyes wearing an embarrassed expression its nothin most of its not even my own blood besides thats not important listen we dont have much time the crowd of warriors stirred behind them michaelson glanced back a tall figure wearing torn military fatigues elbowed his way through the crowd of warriors as he crossed to michaelson ben recognized the family resemblance same black hair and blue eyes same hooked nose my brother harry michaelson stated youve got to be kidding ashley said you found him actually he found me hes been living with these these creatures for the last three months ben noticed harrys eyes wander appreciatively up and down ashleys physique did you tell them harry asked his brother no i was just about to nodding harry turned to ben and ashley im sorry i thought you all were refugees what do you mean asked ben harry swallowed hard i thought you already knew or i would have tried harder to reach you sooner what ashley asked forcefully trying to get harry to spit out whatever he was holding back michaelson cleared his throat alpha base its been destroyed overrun by those dinosaur things ashley froze her mouth parted with an unspoken question then she turned slowly to ben fear bright in her eyes it cant be she whispered what about jason ben collected her in his arms holding her tight shhh he whispered im sure at the first sign of trouble blakely would have whisked him out of harms way his words seemed to calm her giving her an anchor on which to hook her hopes her trembling slowed then ceased she wiggled out of his arms a fierce set to her jaw weve got to get up there i need to know what happened ben could hear the tears just behind the words i know well leave immediately harry stepped forward listen we cant just he jumped as a loud crack exploded behind them ben whirled around to see the chief of the village cross toward them he slammed his new staff again on the floor the crack deafening in the chamber uhoh ben said under his breath someones bloody pissed moamba struggled to rise at the sudden appearance of the village leader heaving himself up with his staff he shuffled across the floor to intervene heated words were exchanged back and forth finally in a burst of growls the chief swiped his staff across the floor knocking moambas staff out from under him unsupported the old man toppled to the floor a gasp arose from the warriors who circled the group several turned their backs the chief eyed the others warily his chest heaving up and down finally he seemed to calm a bit and helped moamba up quieter words were then exchanged followed by an awkward moment of silence as they stared each other down the chief then growled pounded his staff on the ground as punctuation and stomped away michaelson turned to harry did you follow any of that harry nodded his face drained of color trouble twentyfive jason knew they were in trouble when the two adults started talking in low tones just ahead the tunnel passage was blocked by an old rockfall only a small hole the size of a pumpkin penetrated the tumbled stone out of this tiny hole smoky air buffeted toward them blowing in their faces he stared at the two adults crouched by the rockfall we cant go back linda said hell be waiting well then maybe we can find another way back to alpha base one of the side tunnels blakely said his voice wheezing in the smoky air his eyes red and watering jason looked back the way they had come pinching his nose against the stench he watched the whorls of black smoke fly away from him smoke that stank like roasted rubber tires he could even taste its foulness on the back of his tongue the dampened cloth wrapped around his face did little to stop the stench still no one complained since the smoke was also their guide for the past day whenever they had reached a crossroads in the tunnels pausing to decide which way to go the smoke wafting through the passageways marked the correct path turn around i dont know linda said behind him none of the other passages had a breeze the air seemed stagnant what other choice do we have we cant go forward the doctor coughed harshly and at least wed get away from this damned smoke jason crossed to lindas side maybe i can wiggle past the hole linda gave him a weak smile no honey its too small let me see jason said squeezing between linda and blakely he coughed when he got a whiff of the thick smoke coming from the opening blakely put an arm around him hold up jason we dont know how stable that is besides lindas right its much too small jason persisted just let me see he shoved past blakelys hand and crouched down the column of smoke looked like a solid pillar jetting toward him from the opening pushing a fist into it he was amazed at the pressure of the wind like sticking his hand out of a speeding car but his amazement turned quickly to nausea as his probing arm disrupted the flow diverting a stream directly into his face gagging he pulled his hand back out lights twinkled before his eyes as he gasped for clear air blakely placed a hand on his shoulder a halfamused smile on his lips careful boy thats potent enough to kill you his face reddening jason shrugged off his hand now even more determined to investigate the hole before anyone could stop him he sucked in a lungful of air and clamped his eyes and lips closed then he dove forward into the smoky wind he found himself almost instantly buffeted back by the pressure but he dug his toes in beneath him working one arm and shoulder through the hole he wiggled around seeking a way to crawl ahead if he could just turn his head and twist over this way but rock blocked him at every turn in a few seconds he realized it was much too small for him to squeeze through disappointed he pulled back and rolled to the side letting out his held breath in a long sigh he saw blakely waving his hand before his nose as the disturbed smoke billowed around him a lot of good that did you you almost gassed the two of us with your foolishness but i was just enough of this tomfoolery we just need to accept our predicament and find an alternate route this tunnel is a dead end for us jason sniffed trying to save face but i did find out that the hole is only about two feet deep after that it widens again i think the tunnel is fine beyond this short section if we can find a way through well unless you happen to be hiding a pickax under your shirt im afraid thats not much help jason finally defeated hung his head linda laid a consoling hand on his knee hey at least you tried and besides theres no harm done heck if i had been any smarter i couldve stolen a cube of khalids plastic explosive we could have blasted our way out she lifted his chin with a finger im very proud of you jason tried to suppress a smile but couldnt stop it thanks she tousled his hair then turned back to blakely i guess weve no choice but to search for an alternate route blakely mumbled something in response but jason had stopped listening instead lindas words repeated in his mind cubes explosives he stood up could it be he crossed to where linda huddled in conversation with blakely and tugged on her sleeve linda glanced at him and blakely frowned down his eyes narrowed with irritation at his intrusion what is it jason she said pushing back a strand of blond hair he shifted his feet um linda that explosive you were talking about i think i may have some of it blakely stepped forward what how linda placed a restraining hand on blakelys arm jason why do you think you have some explosive scuffing the toe of his sneaker on the rocky floor not looking anyone in the face jason explained about the incident in the bathroom when khalids bag spilled into his cubicle i have it in my gym bag he finished pointing to the red nike bag at his feet ill show you he unzipped the bag and rummaged through it he should have told someone now he was going to get into trouble he shifted the contents of the pack around it was difficult to search full of gym clothes an orange towel a pack of playing cards that had fallen loose and scattered loose change for the videogame machine where was it after a full minute blakely exclaimed in exasperation just dump it on the floor he tried to take the bag from jason wait jason pulled his nintendo game boy from the bag itll break he shoved the game boy in his jacket pocket the doctor overturned the bag and shook it all his stuff tumbled to the floor the three of them searched through his loot jason carefully tucked his spare pair of underwear out of sight mortified that linda might see his boxers as he was hiding it under his towel he spotted the familiar gray material picking up the clay he held it out to linda here it is with a whisper of a smile on her lips she accepted the sculpted clay eyeing his handiwork nice airplane he shrugged i thought it was some sort of hard playdoh blakely looked on with disbelief are you sure its the explosive linda fished a piece of crinkled cellophane from his belongings yes this is the same cellophane that wrapped the other cubes blakely took the airplane from her as if handling the most fragile piece of expensive art okay weve got an explosive but nothing to detonate it with we need a blasting cap whats that jason asked blakely just frowned at him but linda explained theyre little explosives that set off the chunk of plastic explosive like fireworks that would do the trick blakely answered but were not going to find any fireworks stands down here fumbling through the side pouch of his bag jason pulled out the little red cherry bomb hed hidden from prying eyes will this work linda stared at it do you think will it work blakely nodded grinning i believe so she returned his grin then turned and hugged jason youre just full of surprises little man jason blushed purple just dont tell my mom about the cherry bomb shed kill me khalid crouched by the fork in the tunnels leaning first into one then into the other he sniffed like a cur on a trail the lefthand tunnel had a subtle sting to the air causing a slight burning in the nose smoke he proceeded left holding his lighter before him he had been careful to twist the controls to set the flame at its lowest setting creating only a feeble flicker conserving the butane in his lighter if it should run out he would be blinded unable to complete his mission he had to pamper his tiny flame in the stygian darkness even this small flame was enough to light the way for several meters he marched steadily ahead not wasting time to rest there was no way of judging how much farther linda and her group might be but there were clues he was heading in the right direction footprints in mud a wrapper from a ration bar a spot where someone had stopped to urinate the ammonia odor still pungent he was close his mind wandered as he raced along the monotonous tunnels allowing his trained body to continue its pursuit stepping around pitfalls leaping crevices climbing over boulderstrewn obstructions hellbent on narrowing the gap linda pushed jason farther back around the tunnels curve praying that blakely knew what the heck he was doing it was quite possible the entire tunnel system could collapse on them still she knew they had to take the risk to go back only invited disaster i wanna watch jason said no honey its dangerous here put in your earplugs she handed him two cotton balls from their firstaid kit and when i tell you cover your ears and open your mouth why the explosion is going to be dangerously loud it can damage your eardrums jason fidgeted i still want to watch blakely suddenly appeared before them slightly winded all set ive shaped the charge to blow away from us are you ready linda nodded how good a shot are you okay but with this pressure he shrugged you only have the one shot he raised the flare gun i know the cherry bomb had been embedded in the plastic explosive and the plan was to ignite it with the flare from a safe distance he waved them back farther she nudged the boy behind her good luck blakely swiped his damp brow with the edge of his sleeve then took a few steps down the tunnel to get a straight shot she noticed his lips had a purple tinge to them the stress and the foul air were worsening his heart condition watching as he plugged his ears with cotton she admired his tenacity he then gave her a thumbsup sign and leveled the flare gun she pantomimed to jason to cover his ears and open his mouth he did as instructed but kept trying to peek around her to see where the doctor stood with her ears covered she heard the pop of the flare gun sounding like a toy then saw blakely lower his gun nothing happened he turned to her shrugging and opened his mouth to speak when the explosion occurred the wind seemed to precede the noise she watched as blakely was suddenly blown backward by the concussion flying off his feet colliding with the wall before she could move to help she too was thrown down the tunnel landing on top of jason the cracking roar washed over her like an invisible freight train barreling past the noise so loud that her mind tried to turn it off first the boom then nothing but a dull ringing dust and smoke poured down the tunnel choking her leaving her and jason isolated in a sphere of her helmet light walls of swirling dust swallowed them up she helped jason to his feet he held his elbow and winced but otherwise he seemed unharmed dazed she wasnt even sure which direction led back to blakely he could be hurt she unhooked her hand lantern hoping its additional light would penetrate the darkness better than just her helmet lamp she swept the beam through the dusty air nothing jason pointed with one hand while pulling cotton out of his ears over there i think i see a light she now saw it too a glow of light bouncing her way she let out a relieved breath she hurried over to check on blakely hoping that the way forward was now clear wait jason suddenly yelled pulling on her arm to halt her she glanced down at him what she then looked back as the figure penetrated the smoke lunging into her sphere of light it wasnt blakely she stumbled a step backward no he held a lighter aloft in one hand and a pistol in the other blood drizzling down his right cheek from a gash at his temple how appropriate that a thunderclap should precede my storm khalid said then aimed the pistol at lindas chest blakely groaned pain flaring red in his chest his first thought was that it was his heart again but he noticed that the pain worsened as he inhaled and retreated as he exhaled broken rib he thought he ran his hand over his right side just below his armpit a lump of agony confirmed his suspicion definitely broken but only one of them damn like he didnt have enough problems already he leaned his head back on the wall closed his eyes and pulled the damp handkerchief back over his nose although it stank of mucus and sweat it was better than inhaling the air stirred by the blast he would wait for the dust to settle then let linda help wrap his chest before they continued forward he sighed meaning to relax but a sudden fear opened his eyes again what if the blast hadnt cleared enough of the rock to allow them passage or worse yet just collapsed the tunnel further what if he had broken his rib for nothing he needed to know grimacing teeth clenched against the pain he reached to his waist for his flashlight he popped it from his belt with a wince any motion felt like someone was jabbing him with a dull spearand twisting it mercilessly struggling against the pain he raised the light and clicked it on the beam shot forward but was blocked by the eddying rock dust and smoke he could not see beyond ten feet maybe if he could move just a few yards forward he could examine the explosion site what if he had screwed up in shaping the charge no he couldnt have he had done just like hans the german demolition expert for alpha base had shown him there was only one way to find out he carefully pushed up to his feet the pain flared worse but only to a point that raised tears in his eyes he could stand it for a short time he took a deep breath girding himself for the painful journey forward just before he took his first step he heard a raised voice echo from behind him it was linda good at least she was okay he pointed his light toward the voices his lamp revealed only black smoke and the dull ringing in his ears blocked out all but the loudest noises he shook his head swinging his light back toward the bomb site theyd be joining him shortly he took a step forward meaning to check the blast site before they returned the increased motion burrowed the spear of pain deeper in his side cautiously he took shallow breaths knowing that a broken shard of rib bone could slice into his lungs after taking two more steps he stopped to rest his brow now dripping with sweat this wasnt good for his heart either but desperation pushed him on besides if he had screwed up in placing the charge he wanted to be the first to know following the trail of debris with his light he saw the wall of rock that had blocked the way forward and smiled a gaping maw large enough to pass a baby elephant through now opened the way ahead from behind him a pistol shot suddenly echoed down the tunnel not thinking blakley jumped and twisted at the retort a whiplash of searing fire ripped into his chest as he turned his flashlight beam dimmed to a flicker as the pain blackened his field of vision threatening to overwhelm him he took a step forward his arms wrapped around his chest trying to squeeze back the pain he coughed into the handkerchief over his face triggering a spike of agony that sent him to his knees smelling his own blood in the sputum he tore the handkerchief from his face in disgust pinpoints of lights cartwheeled across his vision as he fought oblivion a second shot rang out linda winced as the bullet ricocheted off the rock over her head and zinged past her ear khalid stood coolly before her punctuating his words with blasts from his pistol pocking the walls with glancing shots she placed a hand on jasons head trying to reassure him as he cowered behind her khalid spoke slowly i had hoped that you would recognize the importance of my mission khalid linda began her words were sticking in her throat but she had to try to reason with him you left me no choice i couldnt let you abandon them leaving them to die quicker than she could react khalid lunged at her shoving her aside and grabbed jasons arm pulling him free of her set off balance she slipped and fell to the floor landing hard on her knee dont khalid she pleaded tears welling in her eyes please ill do anything for a moment he seemed to hesitate his pistol wavering then he clutched jason tight to his chest pressing the muzzle of his pistol to jasons temple the boys eyes were wide with fear but dry his lips pale he squirmed but khalid knew how to restrain a hostage even with jasons frantic wiggling the muzzle never shifted from his temple she realized there was no hope suddenly leave the boy alone blakely stumbled into view startling linda even khalid jumped slightly backing a step away blakely leaned with one arm on the wall of the tunnel the other held the flare gun pointed at khalid linda knew it was an empty threatthe gun already spentbut khalid didnt know she allowed herself a small hope she saw blood dribble from the doctors lips heard his labored breathing the blow from the explosion must have hurt him badly i said he wheezed leave the boy alone release him the flare gun swung circles in his weakening grip blakely stepped between linda and khalid now khalid seemed to cower from the gun then like a striking cobra he burst forward knocking the gun from blakelys hand with a swipe of his pistol empty threats are dangerous doctor i watched you use the flare to blow the opening khalid nodded toward the blasted tunnel thank you by the way blakely coughed and slumped against the wall his lips narrowed and blue from pain and exhaustion he turned to linda fresh blood flowed from his lips im sorry he whispered she crossed to blakely as khalid backed away clutching jason with the pistol jammed to his temple again she checked the doctors pulse weak and thready he needed immediate medical attention she turned to khalid where he had backed about several feet away please stop this she begged we can all leave together theres no reason anyone has to die let the boy go staring at her khalid did the most amazing thing he leaned down and placed his gun on the ground for a moment her heart soared as he stood however he removed another small gun from a hidden holster above his boot he pressed this new gun against jason whom he still held tight to his chest the boys arms pinned within the circle of khalids arm you want the boy to live khalid said his eyes narrow he kicked the gun toward linda kill the doctor she stared at the pistol as if it were something toxic afraid to touch it what are you talking about she said turning her eyes up to khalid were carrying too much dead weight here ill take either the boy or the doctor with us you choose theres one bullet left i want you to shoot blakely or ill kill the boy no she cried backing away from the gun then the boy dies its your choice i am only the instrument khalid please she said tears flowing dont make me do this blakely spoke up pick up the gun his words were so plain and calm that she found herself reaching for it before she realized it she froze her hand hovering over the grip do it she snatched up the gun it was still hot to the touch from the rounds already fired she cradled it between her two hands afraid to trust only one hand she glanced up at khalid as if reading her mind khalid warned you have a single shot my dear even if you manage to hit me the boy would be dead before you could squeeze the trigger her shoulders slumped why she asked in a small voice why do this to me i need help and i need obedience i will teach you how to obey i cant she said i cant just kill someone like that listen blakely said his voice hoarse and moist youve got to do this now in a whisper you need to buy some time hes going to kill us all anyway but he coughed tears welled in his eyes lines of pain etched his features do it im not going to make it anyway i i still cant she whispered her head falling to her chest blakely reached to her placing a hand on her head whispering in her ear my wife died four years ago my kids have grown up ive bounced seven grandkids on my knee ive lived a full life but jasons is just starting he lifted her head then picked up her hands that held the gun he placed the gun in one of her palms and raised her hand positioning the muzzle against his forehead be strong linda no please no she cried tears flowing down her cheeks he closed his eyes still holding up her hand with his own hidden from view she felt his finger push hers off the trigger i know he whispered i wont let the bastard win his finger replaced hers on the trigger she felt his finger twitch and the blast and recoil jumped the gun from her hands it clattered to the ground smoke trailing from its muzzle stunned she froze in place her hands still raised as if she held the gun blakely had slumped over to his side staring blankly at the far wall a hole the size of a dime in his forehead the wound looked so small like a simple bandage would fix it no she moaned rocking back and forth no no no suddenly jason ran up beside her hugging her from behind khalid had released the boy jason held her silently staring at blakelys still form with wide eyes linda turned to khalid his pistol was pointed at her you promised that you wouldnt harm the boy i wont he said his words were cold devoid of any concern for the dead man sprawled in the tunnel unlike yours my word is good but its now time for your next lesson you cant keep me tied up for the whole trip linda protested her attempts to loosen the knots that bound her only tightened their cutting grip youre clever linda khalid said smirking at her effort to free herself and we still have a long way to go to reach alpha base i wont lose you again he grabbed jason by the upper arm and manhandled him down the tunnel you can be sure of that frightened that he intended some harm to jason she called after him what are you promised not to hurt him dont worry ill keep my word he disappeared around a bend she stared at the tunnel around her her heart beating so hard in her throat she could hardly breathe what did he have in mind now she gave one final pull on the cords that gripped her she searched around her the helmet lamp casting only a weak finger of light at least the smoke had thinned allowing them to breathe without masks but there were still enough fumes to sting the eyes and nose swinging her helmet the other way she tried to see some sign of what khalid was planning she heard an occasional word or echo from where he and jason had disappeared what was he up to almost two hours passed before she finally heard the scrape of boot on rock signaling the return of khalid and jason exhausted she had almost dozed off it had to have been at least forty hours since she had last slept are you okay jason she asked he nodded but had a strange expression on his face khalid crossed to her and loosened her bonds freeing her hands ill set up camp he said well stay here for six hours then continue rubbing at her red wrists she noticed khalid did not have his gun strange she had not seen him without a pistol clutched in his hand since blakelys death he turned his back on her and walked away leaving her and jason alone his lack of concern jarred her she could just grab jason and run but she knew better than to try he would just track them down again still this sudden lack of caution disconcerted her she knelt down by jason did he hurt you no but i couldnt stop him jason suddenly burst into tears she hugged him tight what is it jason tell me his sobbing subsided into spasms of quivering he he i dont wanna die she just held him tight allowing him to calm on his own after several minutes he sniffed back his final tears ill get you out of here i promise she told him she hoped it was a promise she could keep now take a deep breath and tell me what happened he hung his head then lifted up his shirt she cringed a bit expecting him to reveal some form of physical molestation by khalid but what jason revealed was worse my god linda gasped what did he do to you jason cautiously fingered the black nylon belt strapped tight around his waist cutting snug into his white belly bulges of gray plastic explosive dotted the belt connected from one to the other by multicolored wires she stared closer at the large belt buckle a lighted led panel with a small keyboard the size of a business card was attached to the clasp a twisted bundle of colored wires converged into the device tiny red numbers counted backward on the display why linda mumbled to herself he said it was an obedience lesson jason answered every two hours khalid has to punch in a secret code or the bomb will go off and if i try to take the belt off itll explode lindas shoulders sank the bastard so were dependent on him if we leave or something happens to khalid then she stopped then ill explode jason finished he told me it wouldnt hurt he explained all this to you what sort of monster is he jason answered in a tiny voice a smart one twentysix ashley tugged on harrys sleeve noticing how much like major michaelson he looked especially when he wore a stern expression like now his lips pinched a deep trough between his eyebrows what the hell were they arguing about she asked moamba had already followed the chief out of the chamber and a good portion of the warriors had vanished in different directions she glanced around her a small cadre of spearbearing tribesmen still surrounded them their expressions wary what sort of trouble are we in now she asked turning her attention back to harry he eyed the guards from between narrowed lids then spoke trouble is too mild a word theyve decided that you two are still to die ashleys eyes grew wide but why what about you and michaelson weve been adopted by the warrior sect the groups got a strict honor codeiljann they call it not even the elders will mess with it you two on the other hand are foreigners scapegoats ashley glanced toward ben she should be terrified for her own life but it was her sons fate that kept her chest tight and made breathing difficult she couldnt die not until she knew jason was safe ben kept watching the naked warriors around them but she managed to catch his eye he reached over and squeezed her arm i know i know he said as if reading her mind were going to get out of this and well find jason ashley took a deep breath and turned to harry what about moamba harry shook his head the leader borada swayed the rest of the tribe against you but youve gotta give it to the olguy moamba was able to get a full council hearing before the sentence is carried outbut just barely its scheduled for tomorrow morning ben stepped up what if we make a break for it tonight shaking his head harry sighed youd never make it too many snares booby traps and beasts out there even if you managed to slip past unharmed these little guys know this territory your throats would be slit before you heard em coming ben rubbed his temples well bloody hell if theyre getting my head without a fight ill ashley interrupted harry will we be given a chance to speak at this council hearing i suppose so can you translate for me yeah sure it may be crude but ill do my best good theyve been acting hostile with us but from the petroglyphs they seem normally to be a benevolent society communal everyone sharing the weak and lame supported almost like a big family they did take me in as one of their own harry agreed ashley nodded somethings shaken them up and put them on edge if we can discover what that is maybe we can save our skins and what if we cant ben muttered ashleys voice went cold then we fight a gong suddenly sounded from somewhere deep in the village almost vibrating the very rock as if on cue the group was shuffled by the armed guards through a warren of tunnels to another large chamber ben and ashley were herded within and several guards posted themselves at the portal ensuring they did not wander back out harry spoke to her from the doorway dennis and i must spend the night in the warriors den but ill make sure im here first thing in the morning maybe we can talk some sense into them make sure youre here ben said i was never good at charades ashley watched as the brothers left then she turned to survey the room spread around the chamber were yardwide pillows with folded blankets atop them each in a different pattern of weave and hue at the corners of the room stone water basins dotted the floor i guess this is our cell ben said kicking one of the pillows ashley nodded her arms folded across her chest after all the commotion of the day she felt numb ben put his arm around her were gonna be fine he said his words so quiet and softspoken that she looked up at him as if expecting someone other than ben to be standing there where was his usual loud bravado he squeezed her shoulder and stood quietly supporting her im so worried about jason she said leaning into his embrace this not knowing is agony what if ben laid a finger across her lips shhh your boys fine again his words were so firm and plain that she found herself believing him she looked into his serious blue eyes no longer were they the laughing eyes of the jester it would be so easy to lose herself in him just let those wide shoulders carry her burdens and worries for a time old emotional wounds surfaced willing her to protest but before she could utter a word ben leaned over and replaced the finger brushing her lips with his own mouth his lips pressing steadily refusing to allow her to voice her misgivings only a small moan escaped her then his lips slid down to her throat his stubbled cheek brushing past her cheekbone as he sought the tender angle at the base of her neck losing herself in the gentle strength of his embrace she arched her head back offering her neck more fully to him for just a moment he paused raising his eyes to look into hers his ruddy cheeks flushed with passion she knew this was her last chance she could stop him now his eyes said for a frightened moment she froze wary of releasing herself so fully to him opening herself once again to the possibility of pain and abandonment seeming to sense her fear he pulled back slightly the fire in his eyes dimming to a warm concern never had she encountered a man so passionate yet at the same time so compassionate she watched her own hand reach up and tangle itself in his thick hair she pulled him to her as if she were a drowning woman struggling to fight to the surface entwined in his arms she allowed herself to be lifted and gently lowered to the pillowed floor ben stared at the rocky ceiling sleep still escaping him ashley lay curled at his side an arm draped across his chest a leg thrown over his belly as she stirred in some dream her tiny motions awakened a thickening heat he had to resist rolling toward her and seeking once again to explore the depth of their passion he knew she needed sleep the next day would hold many challenges still he couldnt resist reaching over and tracing a finger down the curve of her right breast she moaned softly in her sleep just as he reached to kiss her temple a blackness suddenly slipped over him like a heavy blanket he fell back into the darkness away from the light and ashley then a voice startled him its about time benny boy the darkness flared into the image of his grandfather sitting crosslegged on a pillow only a few feet away groaning ben sat up as he tried to focus on his granddad the figure melted into the image of moamba the old one nodded to him ive been waiting a bloody long time for you to hear my calling clearing his throat ben looked down at his naked self his body still prominently trumpeting his passion he covered himself with his hands ive been busy moamba cleared his throat i think three times is more than enough its time we talk ben pulled a blanket over his lap youre right i have a lot of questions for you like why in bloody hell does your leader want our heads he and the village are scared many have died the crakan have increased their forays into our territory wiping out entire herds of our food animals surprising our sentries with their sudden appearance deep in our territory killing many of them so what does that have to do with us for countless generations our people and the crakan have struggled after the scattering of our people they became stranded here with us when we first sought shelter here in the underworld to escape them and the cold they followed us down eventually a great cataclysm shut off the upper world trapping all of us down here together how did you survive we adapted where you designed machines and iron tools to help your life we designed living toolsplants and animals to help us through study we learned to select those aspects of both that would best suit our needs then propagated them we learned to grow food he pointed to the walls even to grow light to guide us we adapted but the crakan did not they have haunted our periphery living off the dregs of our work but dont get me wrong they are cunning constantly probing our defenses trying to find a breech through to us with all your smarts why didnt you just make a concerted effort to wipe them out be done with them moamba shook his head we must not just as they need us to survive we need them their spoor contains a substance that we need to grow our food without it the plants would die and then we would die we actually herd our aging milk animals those no longer producing well into the crakans territory to feed them you feed those monsters no wonder there are so many of them we must maintain their numbers to produce enough spoor it is the main goal of our hunters to collect the spoor and bring it back here shit collectors ben said so much for the noble hunter image they are noble they risk much to venture into the realm of the crakan especially now without the aid of a herihutis sight the old one looked meaningfully at him lets not bring up that argument again ben said fearful that moamba would again demand that he stay and help this village a village that right now wanted him dead so you still havent told me why this bloody death sentence hangs over our heads i was getting to that you see we have for generations honed our tools to keep the crakan in check away from the center of our lives one of our main defenses is the tinaifori it ben waved a hand hold on a sec whats that moamba pressed his lips together thoughtfully his eyes narrowing you dont have a word for it he reached behind him and scraped a sample of the glowing fungus from the wall it is a special type of this but it kills we have surrounded this central cavern with a thick perimeter of tinaifori it protects our village so how come these monstersum crakanare now able to get through and attack you all of a sudden the answer is a secret known only to the warrior sect and the leaders moamba cleared his throat his voice lowered slightly as if someone might be eavesdropping the tinaifori is dying slowly now the edges of our defenses have blackened and fallen away thinning the barrier between the crakan and us eventually this barrier will crumble ben imagined flocks of the beasts sweeping into the sheltered valley even though he had been given a death sentence by these people he still shivered at the thought of the carnage so what has all this to do with us the tinaifori began dying soon after the arrival of your people what how i dont know a few of the warriors and i believe it is a sign a portent that it is time for us to move back to the upper world but many others believe you are demons meant to destroy us and i suppose your chief is one of these believers moamba nodded as are most others so howre we going to persuade him otherwise i dont expect the word of a demon will mean much to him no it wont so tomorrow you must follow my lead your companion harry will help unknown to him i have been teaching him the rudiments of our language during his dreamtime helping him learn our tongue listen to him but what are you planning moambas figure faded away as contact was broken raising a hand in farewell tomorrow twentyseven the next morning ashley paced the floor of the room still struggling with the information ben had received from moamba their only ally among these people how could they fight superstition like so many missionaries who had been killed by superstitious natives in hidden corners of the world she found herself wondering how this could be happening ben stepped close to her and hugged her from behind nuzzling his chin next to hers youre gonna wear a track in the floor if you keep pacing like that he said she sighed he was right there was nothing she could do now but wait her mind switched to another concern listen about last night hmmm he squeezed her closer to him i was well i mean just because we i dont expect that you should you know it was just a moment listen lady dont try an wiggle out of this im no onenight stand do you think you can just use me up and toss me out she smiled thinly and slipped out of his grip suddenly uncomfortable with his intimacy was he as sincere as he sounded how many other men had vowed perpetual commitment only to vanish from her bed and disappear into the night and what about her exhusband scott had sworn devotion and love just as sincerely and look what had become of that she placed a hand on her belly remembering the pain and her loss she stepped away from ben trying to ignore his wounded eyes we need to make a plan just in case we cant talk our way out michaelson still has his backpack of weapons we should a commotion at the entryway to the chamber interrupted her twisting around she saw harry push through the guards michaelson limped behind him using one of the spears as a makeshift crutch ashley secretly sighed in relief at the interruption glad to have others around to dilute the intimacy of the moment she cleared her throat harry have you heard anything he nodded ive been up all night prying information out of some of the local gossips theyve got this type of rotgut booze made from some type of moldtastes like warm toothpaste but hell a buzz is a buzz get on with it ben prodded gruffly we dont have all bloody day ashley glanced at him it was unlike ben to snap at people like that harry blinked a few times obviously tired or maybe even a bit hungover anyway this little libation loosened a few tongues it seems that everyone thinks youre killing their precious fungus ashley nodded we know all about that his eyebrows shot up how the heck never mind that now what have you heard about the council meeting will we be given a chance to defend ourselves harry looked at her quizzically rumor has it that moamba will plead your case even though hes old hes someone many dont want to cross so we might have a peasized chance to dissuade them but we still need a backup plan she glanced over to michaelson noticing he still carried his holstered pistol hows our armament he slapped his holster this a stubbed ak and my collapsible rifle back in harrys room what are the odds of shooting our way out of here i wouldnt bet a plug nickel ive seen the council chamber its deep in the village its doubtful well make it to the outside and even if we should manage we still have to find our way back up ashley frowned then wed better be damned persuasive drums began beating a slow cadence somewhere far off the guards stirred at the door one of them barked an order harry turned to her its showtime the first thing ashley noticed about the council chamber was the floor the rock had been polished to a mirrored sheen that gave it a slippery appearance like black ice the floor sloped to a small bowllike pit in the center of the chamber positioned in a circle around the room like guards were stone pillars polished to the same silky smoothness ropes of fungus some glowing red some green trailed in loops and spirals down the shafts of the pillars in delicate designs similar designs in phosphorus lines etched the walls eight tufted pillows each of a different color ringed the central pit ashley raised an eyebrow at the scooped depression this was the only nonpolished area of the chamber looking as if it had been crudely chopped out of the rock her mind even spinning with fears for jason and trepidation for herself and ben was still that of an anthropologist it kept gnawing at the many mysteries of these people like just what was the cultural significance of these pits almost every chamber even those at alpha base had one of these dugout spots she had originally dismissed them as mere firepits but after seeing how these creatures lived she no longer believed this she had yet to see even one flaming hearth with the many boiling springs the volcanic heat and the scarcity of wood she did not see the cultural necessity for so many firepits so what the hell were they a hand one of the guards pushed her from behind she stumbled into the chamber ben nudged her looks like were the first to arrive ashley moved aside to allow harry to enter michaelson with his injured ankle had detoured back to the hunters enclave to retrieve his weapons and ready them the majors pistol dug into the small of her back where she had shoved it into her belt hidden by her loosehanging shirt just in case things went sour they could use the gun to reach the hunters area and join up with michaelson and his arsenal one of the tribe entered from another doorway carrying an amethysttipped staff her pendulous breasts marked this one as female and from the bulge in her belly most likely pregnant she crossed to kneel on one of the pillows guards flanking her on either side she ignored ashley and her group avoiding eye contact as she lowered to her pillow she did however acknowledge with a small nod the next creature to enter the chamber he was difficult to look at with a missing hand and a jagged scar ripping across his face his left leg dragged slightly as he crossed to a purple pillow and collapsed with a loud sigh harry stirred next to ashley thats trugula hes the head of the warrior clan he may look a mess but hes a sharp one harrys words though merely whispered in her ear apparently carried to trugula he gave them a stern heavybrowed look harry stepped away from ashley remaining silent as a procession of staffed figures eventually filled the remaining empty pillows soon many armed guards lined the walls around them ashley shifted trying to work the hidden gun into a comfortable position even though it dug into her back there was a certain security in its pressure moamba passed close by ashleys side as he thumped over to his redandyellowcheckered pillow he too ignored their presence the last to arrive was the village leader borada harry had told her that borada was the son of the last chief he had been bestowed the honor of chieftain out of respect for his famous father most of the other elders tolerated him but he was not well respected too volatile too quick to make decisions the council liked to mull over decisions sometimes taking years to decide on simple matters the young chief with his fidgeting and sudden anger was an embarrassment to the older members still he did have his followers harry pointed out an exceptionally thin male tribesman whose eyes and ears kept darting in every direction his hands tugged at the pillow under him as if struggling to find a comfortable position for his bony rear sinjari harry said an oily sycophant of borada beware of him hes as sneaky as he is nervous it looks as if a stiff wind could snap him in two ben said dont underestimate the creep hes the one who convinced the leader that you two should be killed hes a wheedling sort of guy he knows how to play to peoples fears work them into a frenzy the leader stamped his staff three times on the floor then sat harry stepped between ben and ashley translating for them as the meeting opened ashley had expected their fate would be the first item on the schedule but she was sorely mistaken the first item on the agenda seemed to deal with the harvesting of the fields a lengthy dispute seemed to center on whether to proceed now or to allow the hoofed food animals another month of free grazing after much arguing during which moamba seemed to be dozing it was decided to harvest now ashley straightened up expecting their fate to be discussed next she was wrong the only female council member jussiri stood up next assisted from her pillow by one of her guards due to the preponderance of her gravid belly ashley shifted her feet now what this interminable waiting was beginning to grate on her even ben was beginning to grumble she watched jussiri waddle to the small dugout pit at the center of the chamber the other elders encircled her many smiling in delight ashleys jaw dropped at what happened next ben curled his lip thats disgusting jussiri reached within her belly pouch both hands disappearing within the fold with a bit of a strained face but with her eyes shining proudly she pulled from her belly a brownspeckled egg about the size of an ostrich egg she held it aloft her belly now sagging empty the other elders began stamping their staffs and hooting jussiri then carefully placed the egg within the small pitnot a pit ashley finally realized but a nest the proud mother stepped back my god ashley blurted stunned theyre not marsupials theyre monotremes what ben asked his lips still curled in disgust linda and i discussed it monotremes just like the crakan egglaying mammals considered to be an evolutionary link between reptiles and mammals sharing traits from bothegglaying like reptiles but furbearing and milkproducing like mammals supposedly an evolutionary dead end looks like this group took a detour ben said ashley turned to harry whatre they doing its a naming ceremony jussiri is offering her child to the tribe ashley watched as moamba struggled up off his pillow and crossed to the egg kneeling down he placed both hands gently on the egg whats he doing ashley asked her question was directed at harry but ben answered hes reading the egg and the child within ashley raised an eyebrow toward ben but he just shook his head as if unsure himself how he knew this moamba raised his head to the mother still holding the egg smiling he mumbled something to her its healthy harry translated then moamba suddenly jerked away almost accidentally flipping the egg out of the nest ben jumped beside her i felt it he said like a baby kicking felt what ashley asked ben just shook his head again ashley watched as moamba rested his hands back on the egg even more tenderly this time his hands trembling with more than just old age he again turned to jussiri who now wore a concerned look on her face with tears in his eyes he spoke to her the crowd erupted with cheers staffs stamping jubilantly ashley turned to harry impatient for his translation well again ben answered the child is herihuti it bears the trait of seeing and speaking with the mind he turned to ashley wonder in his voice i actually felt the child stir moamba stood up his joy so powerful he didnt even use his crutch he stamped his staff to quiet the crowd once the commotion settled to a low murmur he spoke again punctuating his statement with two stamps i name this child tushama harry translated the one who sees our future the crowd erupted the name tushama chanted from many tongues well ben said at least theyll be in a good mood when it comes to deciding our fate ashley nodded hopefully they wont simply delay the decision i dont want to lose another day as if the scarred trugula had understood her words he stamped for attention and proposed that the decision on ashley and bens fate be put off in response many heads nodded even borada then the bonethin sinjari stamped to be heard with harry translating his words chilled it truly is a time of joy but we cannot forget that with joy there is also sorrow how many widows now wail his words sobered the audience here stand demons meant to destroy us he pointed a long finger with thick knuckles at them ever since they arrived and desecrated this world we began to die we have tried befriending them he continued nodding toward harry but still we have continued to perish i think it more than chance that when we finally decide to destroy the demons a new herihuti should suddenly appear i say its a sign from the gods a sign that we must drive the demons from our world without delay now several heads nodded in agreement with sinjaris words ashley reached behind her back and shoved her pistol deeper in her belt securing it she started eyeing the obstacles between her and the door moamba stamped for attention bens nervous shifting calmed once he saw that moamba was to speak in their defense he reached over and squeezed ashleys hand hell make them see reason he said moamba waited for the noise of the crowd to subside before speaking sinjaris eyes twitched and his hands scrabbled on his staff he was obviously worried but as moamba began speaking a smile grew wider and wider on sinjaris gaunt face revealing too many teeth harry translated sinjaris correct that many of our protective barriers have fallen that many of our people have died i have given this much thought spending many hours praying and seeking guidance from our ancestors and have come to only one answer moamba pointed his staff toward ben and ashley sinjari is correct they are to blame twentyeight michaelson crouched over his arsenal taking inventory of his weapons one collapsible rifle a snubnosed ak two pistols and four boxes ofcaliber shells why hadnt he requisitioned a grenade launcher for this mission he shook his head frowning he realized that they didnt have a chance in hell of getting out of here alive if a fight was necessary he sat back on his haunches wincing as his injured ankle protested behind him a couple were copulating in full view of the other hunters their grunting and moans interrupting the silence of the chamber having spent last night here with harry he had almost grown accustomed to their openness during the night the same open passion had been abundantly displayed still he kept his back to them and studied one of the warriors working in a corner the creature seemed old graying at the temples thin but with piercing eyes he clutched a crude diamond spearhead in his hand and smeared a gray paste over its surface even in the dim fungal light a reddish glow could be seen developing in the spearhead clucking his tongue in satisfaction he spread a thicker layer of paste to the edge of the rough blade the edges now began glowing a deeper fiery red fascinated michaelson watched as the craftsman now used another tool to grind at the spearhead filing the edge of the nowsoft diamond the paste seemed to have weakened the surface of the crystal into a malleable consistency though judging from the corded muscles of the creatures forearms it was still stiff resistant almost like softened lead michaelson watched as he tooled the diamond into a wicked blade so thats how the fuckers did it he thought sculpting chunks of diamond with the aid of some crystalsoftening mold as a final step the old creature dipped his handiwork into a bowl of water removing the dripping spearhead he tapped it with a bone tool it rang like a struck goblet solid once again awed michaelson stood up and stretched his legs the passionate couple had finished their sexual dalliance and now lay napping in each others arms he worked the kinks out of his legs but the low roof kept him from being able to straighten his back a sudden flurry of raised voices near the entrance to the hunters warren of caves drew his attention the garbled speech had a keening edge of panic in it thinking that the ruckus might be ashleys group trying to beat a hurried retreat michaelson grabbed a loaded pistol he elbowed his way through the small crowd to the center of the commotion shoving past the last onlooker he froze as he saw the source of the agitation four hunters carried the body in a rough woven sling they laid the limp form at his feet the seals torn uniform bloodier than the last time he had seen him from his cyanotic pallor and fixed glassy eyes he knew there was no use checking for a pulse villanueva he said goddamn it michaelson holstered his gun and knelt down he picked up the limp hand of his friend fuck he spat out he stared at the two bullet holes in the seals forehead two this was obviously no suicide someone murdered him but who ashley bit back a scream of frustration it was bad enough that they had wasted a day in this council meeting now moamba their only ally had betrayed them she clenched her fists and her shoulders trembled jason could be in danger right now she closed her eyes he has to be okay ben spoke up beside her poking a finger into harrys chest you couldnt have heard moamba correctly he said hed help shhh harry said waving bens hand away im trying to listen moamba had started to talk again after his accusation probably cinching the noose tighter around our necks ashley thought she studied the council chamber eyeing the exits and counting the guards harry began translating again haltingly but with gaining confidence as he concentrated moamba spoke calmly these newcomers to our world caused the death of the tinaifori this i have read in the whispered words of our ancestors there was much stamping of staffs from borodas group of lackeys echoing painfully across the chamber ashley noticed however that sinjari the leaders righthand man refrained from stamping his approval but simply wore a thin smile of triumph moamba held up a hand for silence before continuing but these newcomers are not demons they are flesh and blood tendon and bone like us it is not their evil that is harming us only their ignorance sinjari whose smile had deflated into a wary sneer spoke up it does not matter our tribesmen die and the law is clear the responsible must die and even you agree that they are responsible i say we vote harry stopped his translating licking his dry lips he glanced over to ashley i told you that guys a bastard ashley nodded not taking her eyes from moamba the herihuti wore a shadow of a grimace he held up a hand our esteemed sinjari states that our laws are clear in this matter and again i must bow to the expertise of our colleague here he is right those responsible for the death of another must die it is the law moamba paused when sinjari tried to speak again moamba frowned at him silencing his outburst moamba then leaned heavily on his staff as if the meeting exhausted him he spoke slowly giving harry plenty of time to translate the key word in our law is responsible i did not say these newcomers were responsible i said they were to blame it was their ignorance of us and our ways that caused them to blunder and inadvertently harm us we cannot hold someone responsible for actions they were not aware of borada spoke up this time these are just words the result is the same words moamba answered focusing his eyes on the tribes leader it was these words that kept your right hand attached to your wrist i seem to remember a small boy who let a herd of treferoshi loose from their pens they destroyed almost a tenth of that years crop the law states that a hand who harms the wellbeing of the tribe should be cut off i was only a boy then borada blurted i didnt know what i was doing you couldnt hold me responsible for sinjari reached over and clutched the leaders knee stopping him from speaking anymore attempting to limit the damage moamba turned to the other village elders leaning even harder on his staff now his back bent i am an old man older by far than all of you i have seen each and every one of you blunder while growing up yet all of you still have your hands feethe pointed a finger at sinjariand noses blundering is a process of learning these newcomers are learning too we must teach them not destroy them a murmur spread through the cavern sinjari fidgeted in his seat one of his underlings leaned down and whispered something in his ear sinjari nodded then cleared his throat harry gave ashley a glance that seemed to say here we go again harry translated sinjaris words as if they left a foul taste in his mouth moamba is wise as always and has given us much to ponder but how does he know the harm done to our protective tinaifori was accidental how did the newcomers cause this damage how great thought ashley how is the old man supposed to answer that moamba spoke up i have prayed upon this matter for many days and an answer has come to me through their blundering they have created an imbalance between ohna the female spirit and umbo the male spirit an imbalance that is tearing apart the weaving of our world a hushed murmur spread throughout the room even sinjari remained silent jussiri pushed to her feet to speak how can this be stopped i must show you moamba said then all will be clear you will know why i have protected these foreigners if we kill these newcomers we destroy our only way to reverse this damage sinjari snorted this is preposterous hes only trying to delay the vote i say we vote now destroy them before they destroy us borada placed a firm hand on sinjaris shoulder silencing him ive been accused of being too rash before but this time i will bow to the council i say we hear moamba out the matter is too serious sinjari seemed to shrink with the leaders words show us moamba borada continued show us how this occurred and how to stop it moamba nodded and led the way to the exit of the council chamber the other members fell in line behind him ashley and her group were ushered by guards behind the tribes elders i knew the old bloke wouldnt betray us ben said to ashley were not out of here yet she answered but for the first time she felt hopeful with the tribes cooperation and their knowledge of the cavern system she could be back at alpha base in a couple of days she adjusted her pace to that of the village elders repressing the urge to shove them from behind to get them to hurry after arcing through several tunnels and climbing a winding flight of carved rock stairs the council filed into a cavern barely large enough to contain the group ashley had to squeeze between trugula whose fur reeked like a wet dog and the rock wall to get a view of the proceedings she whispered to harry where are we harry shrugged bumping trugula with his shoulder the leader of the hunters grunted something angrily at him wincing harry leaned toward ashley dont ask me to translate that youve never been to this chamber before ashley asked no this section of the village belongs to the religious sect a very closemouthed lot i usually stuck to the hunters group ashley wiggled trying to get a better view of moamba all eyes were on him something flashed brightly at the old mans feet but she could not see the source she waved to ben give me a boost ben helped her place a foot on his bent knee holding her steady with a firm grip she pulled up balancing on one foot using a hand on bens shoulder and the wall to maintain her precarious perch her head was now far enough above the crowd to see moambas entire figure he began speaking as harry translated i have brought you all here because you know the significance of this chamber this is the home of umbo the male spirit he then stepped aside and pointed with his staff there on a stone pedestal ashley saw a familiar object flashing brightly in the meager light it seemed to collect the light in the room and radiate it out in bursts of sparking darts a crystal idol about fifteen inches high diamond similar to the one blakely presented to her months ago but this one had a definite and prominent protrusion below its naked waist male this figure was the masculine twin of the other here stands umbo moamba declared as he should protecting our world but he cant protect alone he is only half of the whole his other half ohna the female spirit is missing yes sinjari spoke up the newcomers stole her not stole our original village stood empty they could not have known she was the connection to our distant past she who was left to help guide our ancestors back to us in our new village now she is gone the balance of umbo and ohna was destroyed by those unfamiliar with our ways it is this imbalance that has disturbed the warp and weave that holds the fabric of our world together it must be corrected it can be sinjari stated by destroying the invaders he looked around but was only met with worried murmuring no said moamba the balance can only be achieved by returning ohna to her proper place the old mans logic seemed faultless even to ashley who didnt believe a word of it the elders around her even their leader were nodding their heads in agreement except for one sinjari strode to the center of the chamber his bony limbs twitching in agitation moamba has proven his wisdom he turned to face the crowd it is clear we must kill the stragglers left from the attack of the crakan and reclaim ohna for ourselves return her to her rightful place a firm murmur of agreement followed his words but no stamping of staffs this seemed to rankle him he rattled his staff on the rock floor almost begging others to start stamping their own staffs moamba however did not allow the crowds murmur to grow harry continued to translate his words our esteemed sinjaris wrath seems to have blinded him to an important law of the tribe moamba turned to the thickchested leader borada tell us what happened after you let loose the treferoshi from their pens to wreak havoc on our crops father and i rebuilt the pen and reseeded the trampled fields it took us three days without sleeping to accomplish it exactly you were given a chance to right your wrong the newcomers deserve the same chance let them correct their own error again the crowd murmured their assent even trugula stamped his staff in agreement sinjari though was not ready to give up his battle the newcomers are not of our tribe our laws dont apply to them whats to stop them from running off with ohna and letting our world die they are different moamba agreed one only has to look to see that but the difference is minor moamba pointed his staff at ashley harry and ben come here join me now what ashley thought if things should go sourand with sinjaris pitbulllike persistence it was a good possibilitythey would have the entire council and its entourage between them and the only exit ben helped ashley off his knee rubbing at his thigh after she stepped down at least you werent wearing high heels he complained ben were putting our backs against the wall if we go out there trust him he said hell get us out of this mess ben squeezed through the narrow opening afforded him by the crowd pausing only to reach back and pull ashley after him harry trailed behind them once they were congregated before the wall of staring eyes moamba stepped between her and ben then continued with harry translating these newcomers may look strange and even slightly offensive to some but another villager might find trugula with his scars strange and even unsettling but he is still one of us what matters is the spirit he tapped his chest with his staff here we are not so different he paused to level his staff at harry here a newcomer has proven the bravery of his people proven that they are worthy of iljann like any other tribesman next he swung the staff toward ben here is a newcomer with the powers of a herihuti a gift from the gods why would our spirits bestow such a gift unless they thought him worthy finally he pointed the staff at ashley the gods have given us another clue to their worthiness the newcomers herihuti planted his seed in her during the last sleep cycle he place a hand on ashleys belly it has taken root and the gods have blessed her with a child a child conceived here in our village a new child of the tribe ashley blinked a few times staring at the hand on her belly he had to be kidding she looked up at ben his mouth hung open if the gods have blessed them with a child the spirits have judged them worthy who are we to judge them any less so sinjari struck a rock with his staff we have only your word that this this this invader is a herihuti he spat moamba eyes thin with anger opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by the stamping of a spear all eyes turned to borada who stamped his stick a final time borada spoke enough sinjari to accuse moamba who has served our tribe for generations of falsehoods is a rudeness that cant be tolerated i shun you from further discussion in this matter borada waved the ruby tip of his staff across his lips the crowd gasped ashley looked questioningly at harry who leaned closer toward her this is a rare act this society is very open to free expression a shunning is a major punishment just as long as it keeps sinjari shut up she muttered fidgeting in place where did the council now lean she wondered death or acquittal had moamba convinced them she glanced at her belly swallowing hard he could be very convincing borada had not finished speaking i believe moamba the newcomers deserve a chance to correct their mistake he then pointed his staff at ben harry translated do you know where ohna is kept ben nodded will you return her i will try my bloody best ben said as they translated thats all i can promise then i cast my vote that we stay their execution depending on the successful completion of this mission but because i harbor reservations similar to those expressed by sinjari i will require some reassurance the female stays here until the mission is completed if its not accomplished within one day then she dies he stamped his staff his words caused all the elders to stamp their staffs in agreement except two sinjari who was shunned from voicing an opinion and moamba the old herihuti just stared first at ben then at ashley she could see the sorrow in his eyes as he finally raised his staff and stamped it three times on the groundagreement twentynine i cant just leave her ben said to moamba the other elders had already left umbos chamber leaving only a cluster of armed guards around them ben stared at ashley where she leaned over the tumescent image of umbo studying the figurine always the anthropologist he thought always in command still he noted the way her hand trembled as she coursed a finger down the figurine im sorry moambas words were translated by harry its the best i could do you have today to prepare yourself and your team of hunters then you have one day to return ohna or else borada will kill ashley and your unborn child ben rubbed at his temples with the tips of his fingers you you mean shes really pregnant the old man nodded a father he mumbled to himself shaking his head things were happening too quickly the winds were blowing in too many directions the old man leaned closer to ben whispered something guttural to him too low for harry to translate then touched the center of bens forehead with the touch a sense of peace and calmness saturated ben like a cool shower after a hot day under the aussie sun ben sighed how does the bugger do that moamba stepped away now calmer ben could think more rationally rather than just relying on gut reactions he needed to plan at least the village elders had given him a day to work out a strategy still he remembered the long journey down here even if supplied with a map it would take longer than a day to reach alpha cavern exasperated ben turned to harry are you sure you translated that correctly theyre giving us one day twentyfour hours harry nodded almost their daily cycle termed cucuru is actually twentysix hours thats a lot of help two extra hours i dont suppose you happen to know a quicker way up to alpha base i know of a route up but itll still take at least a day and a half and thats if we hurry and dont get ambushed by any of the crakan i was eventually planning on taking the journey myself once my broken arm had healed and strengthened but dennis beat me down here shit moamba suddenly stamped his staff looking frustrated he motioned them over to the wall he struggled to speak a few words of english i show fast up he seemed to have understood the gist of their discussion moamba crossed to the far wall and pressed the butt of his staff against a rocky outcropping as he pressed the outcropping receded into the wall and a section of what looked like solid rock swung inward its a secret door ben leaned down and stared into the revealed tunnel leading to another of those goddamn wormholes he waved ashley over moamba hobbled to the side with harry in tow the two already conversing animatedly ashley knelt next to ben i should have suspected she whispered a trace of tension in her voice the holy places of many cultures have hidden chambers and passages ashley sat back on her heels seemingly despondent at missing a key anthropologic connection then suddenly she sprang up damn ive been so stupid what this this tunnel i can guess where this leads baffled ben raised a questioning eyebrow this is the male spirits chamber i would bet the female spirits chamber in alpha cavern has a similar hidden passage that we all missed i would bet my life that this tunnel connects with her chamber a symbolic vaginal canal linking male and female spirits you mean its a straight and safe shot right back up top ben allowed himself a glimmer of hope but are you sure if youre right he whispered to her maybe we can make a break for it use this tunnel so all of us can escape ashley knelt back down no with their small physiques they would be on top of us in seconds we wouldnt have a chance besides moamba and his tribe are trying to accept us this is a crucial test between our peoples i wont betray their trust as an anthropologist i cant destroy this tentative bond that they are working to establish with us but what if no she said but ben could see the agony in her eyes it was taking all her will not to rush into the tunnel and go seek out her son a few steps away harry and moamba had finished their animated discussion well ill be damned harry declared loudly drawing their attention he turned back to face them youre not going to believe this this wormhole leads to alpha base ashley finished for him standing up harrys brow furrowed with creases how did you know i finally remembered im an anthropologist ashley said sourly so what else did you learn from moamba if im understanding correctly its about a thirtymile long tunnel ben eyed the tunnel and about two miles up he guessed itll be a bloody long crawl andll probably eat up a good part of the day maybe not said harry cryptically lets get out of here join up with dennis plan your strategy ben turned to moamba harry ask him to help us plan he knows these caverns nodding harry blurted a few words to moamba gesticulating with his arms the old man answered shaking his head harry translated he says he has much to prepare and hell talk to you later but i dont know if im translating that correctly its a looser translation its almost like he said hed be dreaming of you later ben nodded with a sigh lets be going we have a lot to do before tomorrow as they turned to leave he stared back at moamba the old mans eyes drilling him should be an interesting night of dreams he thought as he followed ashley out the exit back at the hunters enclave ashley stared at the still form of villanueva at her feet too stunned to speak she had almost forgotten about the others left in the diamond cavern figuring they were safer where they were eyeing the bullet wounds in the seals forehead she realized there were more dangers here than the caverns and its denizens it must have been khalid michaelson said what about linda ashley asked did the hunters see her i dont know the major answered i didnt have a translator he nodded toward his brother who was deep in conversation with a hunter named tomarsu hopefully harry can get an answer to what happened ashley couldnt stare at the corpsewhite face of villanueva any longer as she turned away something caught her eyein a ragged pile of collected loot stood a familiar fluorescent green plastic object her sled she had thought it lost after she and ben had crashed here she noticed bens red sled had also been recovered pretty efficient scavengers she thought but that made perfect sense considering the meager resources afforded them suddenly the conversation between harry and tomarsu escalated in volume ashley glanced in their direction harry was holding up his fingers apparently counting off some point finally in exasperation harry clenched his fist and turned away ending the conversation what was that all about ashley asked as he rejoined the group he wasnt making any sense harry said he described what sounded like gunfire the noise drew his hunters to the diamond cavern by the time they got there they only found this this dead soldier villanueva ashley corrected he was a friend harry nodded his brow furrowed in concern when i asked him about the other two he said his team followed their trail to a cavern with a waterfall and observed them camping so linda is alive well thats the weird part when i asked them how many were there he said there were four of them four ben said i know harry ran a hand through his hair i kept asking him over and over again he was adamant four harry held up four fingers seems as soon as we solve one mystery another crops up ben said the news gnawed at ashley even with the recent events she had to know where are these four now tomarsu says they went into a tunnel that smelled like death and his hunters balked at following them smelled like death harry shrugged thats what he said they all stood silent for a long moment ashley finally spoke up to hell with it we arent going to solve this now lets concentrate on the situation at hand harry you mentioned you might have a quicker way to traverse the wormhole harry brightened at her words yeah maybe if i can get it to work come see he led her and the others to a neighboring cavern almost a cubicle not much he said ushering them in but its home in a corner thick green pillows huddled under a rumpled blanket the remainder of harrys cubicle consisted of an odd assortment of crude tools spearheads and a long tarpwrapped object ashley curled her nose at the strong smell of gasoline gasoline harry followed them inside squeezing past her all the others at alpha base are electricwhining little putputsbut i juryrigged my own with a combustion engine i wanted power he bent over and grabbed the edge of the tarp after i was attacked my fellow hunters retrieved it from our last camp it was pretty beat up but ive been tinkering with it he yanked the tarp free revealing a transport sled one of the big ones i built it out of aluminum to be lightweight blakely let me bring it since we didnt think wed need heavy ammunition for our explorations he sniffed in derision i brought one fucking pistol with me stupid does the sled still work ashley said trying to keep the conversation on course mostly it used to collapse down to a compact size for carrying but its jammed open still this is just a straight trip up so that shouldnt be a problem harry patted the sled the engines sound but i only have a single tank of gasoline so ive been leery of running the engine for a long time probably needs a bit of tuning still is there enough gas to get all the way up ben knelt down and cocked his head from side to side studying it should be plenty harry used to race dirt bikes michaelson said he knows his way around an engine if he thinks itll work it will ben nodded seemingly satisfied thisll buy me several hours theres only one problem harry said the front axles bent if i can fix it itll be an allnighter so you might want to have a plan b just in case right ashley said then lets get a few things settled since im the only one being held hostage here isuggest everyone else accompany ben on his mission put as few at risk as possible down here no maam ben argued im going alone a solo mission youre gonna need firepower ashley said theres no telling how many of those crakan are still hovering around alpha base shes right harry said the council has allowed a small team of hunters to go with you since were officially bloodbonded hunters my brother and i can accompany you trust me youll need the backup i can tie those cheap plastic sleds of yours to mine and form a train to drag everyone quickly up top bens face reddened with determination i wont leave ashley here alone shes ill stay with ashley michaelson interrupted my ankles crap ill only slow you all down anyway maybe ashley and i can come up with a contingency plan if it comes to that ben seemed as if he was going to argue further but their arguments seemed to be wearing him thin all right harry can come but michaelson whatever it takes i expect to see the mother of my child again you will ben ben nodded but ashleys mind was whirling mother she had succeeded in pushing that fact from her mind but bens words had dredged it back up she placed a hand on her belly mother she didnt even begin to know how to feel about that revelation but one point of motherhood she was damned sure of ben youve got to find jason even if it means scrubbing this mission promise me ill try ben said you know i will dont just try do it ben reached to her and folded her in his arms in his embrace the tears she had been holding back finally flowed she sank deeper in his arms thirty ben lay awake in his cell he knew he needed to rest but after a day of planning plotting divvying up arms and choosing the mimiswee hunters to accompany them his mind still ground on details of the mission what if he didnt succeed he rolled hard onto his left side burrowing into his pile of pillows and twisting the thin blanket tight around his feet ashleys face kept flashing across his minds eye earlier she had been led to a separate cell for the night guarded a hostage they were not even allowed a final night together he rolled onto his back and sighed loudly this worrying was getting him nowhere maybe stretching his legs a bit would help besides he should check on harrys progress slipping from his pillows he crossed to the exit within a few minutes he had made his way back to the section of hunters caves harry was bent over the disassembled sled pieces strewn across the rocky floor michaelson leaned over his shoulder a loud snap cracked across the cavern shit harry jumped back from the sled whats wrong ben asked stepping up behind them harry held up two pieces of aluminum rod not good i pushed too hard and snapped the axle bens heart clenched in his chest can you fix it i dont think so i was softening the aluminum with heat and trying to straighten the bend when it snapped i should have waited until it was softer but was afraid of weakening the metal harry threw the pieces to the floor sorry ben i screwed up michaelson laid a hand on harrys shoulder you did your best fuck that i blew it harry shrugged off his brothers hand dont beat yourself up ben said so we use the plastic sleds and push our way up itll slow us down somewhat but well manage at least he prayed so what if this delay made the difference between succeeding and failing in their mission listen michaelson said to harry i may have an idea what ben said michaelson his eyes tired and irritated glanced back over his shoulder and pointed to the exit ben just go to bed let my brother and i work this out its a long shot anyway so get yourself some rest ben only stared glassyeyed he knew the major was right well see you in the morning michaelson said turning his attention back to harry and the sled dismissing him during bens journey back to bed his mind spun with the ramifications of harrys bad news even if it took them eight hours to crawl the thirty miles surely the remaining day would leave them plenty of time to accomplish their goal it would have to he thought adamantly suddenly he realized the twists and turns in the tunnels didnt look familiar he turned and looked back the way he had come should have taken that last turn or maybe angled left back by the big boulder a scraping noise behind him drew his attention in the dim light he could see a skeletally thin apparition approaching him from down the tunnel he froze startled by the otherworldliness of the figure bathed in the greenish fungal glow like some netherworld phantom but as it approached he recognized the gnarled and bony countenance sinjari the creature who had so stubbornly insisted on their deaths as the tribes elder closed the space between them ben noticed the two brutish guards following sinjari buttugly fellows where most of the mimiswee were small and sinewy these two looked like scarred bulldogs hunched and menacing sinjari stepped before ben raising his staff to block the way forward then barked something angrily to his flanking guards the two burly creatures advanced toward him though physically drained ashley still found sleep escaping her her head pounded and a bruise on her hip throbbed she found herself recalling bens arms as he held her the scent of his hair his fingers on her back and neck she had gone too far the night before in a moment of horrible weakness and misled him badly as to her true feelings she clutched the blanket around her shoulders afraid of an even more frightening reality had she really misled him she glanced at the glowing dial of her watch two hours until the clock began ticking toward her death sentence too many worries battled within her bottled up in her chest what had happened to jason and linda too for that matter what about ben would he die trying to save her could he save her and worst of all if he should fail would she then die never knowing what had happened to her son she clutched the blanket to her face her tears finally overwhelming her control time was running out ben took a step back from the lumbering creatures who now leered at him in a threatening way they were unarmed but somehow ben knew this was small comfort he backed another step debating what to do he could try making a dash but they would be at him like dingos on a wallaby hed best take his chances where he stood okay you bastards he grumbled more to center himself than to intimidate his combatants lets see how bloody easily those long necks of yours break ben dug a heel into a rut in the floor to gain some leverage for a punch he was readying himself when something suddenly grabbed his shoulder from behind wound tight he instinctively swung a roundhouse blow toward the unseen attacker he halted his punch just in time it was moamba the old man released bens shoulder staring for just a heartbeat at bens upraised fist moamba then glanced away to stare down the two guards who were frozen where they stood he barked something that made the pet dogs of sinjari bow their heads and slink back their master though stood his ground his staff still raised across the passage barring the way forward sinjari hissed something at moamba the old man merely shrugged which caused sinjari to rattle his staff and quiver with rage moamba tapped ben on the shoulder and indicated he should follow acting as a guide moamba led the way back away from sinjari but the elders howls echoed behind them as ben followed moamba after much twisting and turning ben found himself back in a familiar chamber he glanced with a sigh at the red gourdshaped mushrooms hanging from the pillars why do i always end up here as he followed moamba deeper into the chamber weaving among the mushrooms he noticed something strange about the pillars of stone the first time through here with ashley he had been so fixated on the red fungal pods that he had assumed the pillars were just natural rocky colonnades but now on closer inspection he realized he was wrong he traced a finger down the coarse grooved surface of one of the pillars bloody hell it was a petrified tree trunk he glanced around him his mouth agape the whole chamber contained a grove of petrified trees a grunt of impatience drew his attention back to moamba he waved for ben to sit at the edge of the circle of painted glyphs ben found a comfortable spot on the rocky floor and the old man slowly sat across from him once settled ben knew what moamba wanted he closed his eyes and let his body relax starting at his toes and working up from there still his mind spun with so many thoughts and worries he could not focus he tried again to relax but stray concerns kept him edgy just before he was about to give up a calming sense of tranquillity washed over him he knew it was some sort of sending from moamba and allowed the sense of peace to quiet his worried thoughts the blackness behind his eyelids blossomed into full color again for just a moment the image of his dead grandfather was superimposed over moambas face the familiar visage further calmed his heart like a favorite old song heard in the background moambas image solidified you must be more careful ben he admonished wandering alone in the village there are still factions here that would see you fail or wish you dead sinjari is not one to give up easily howd you know i was in trouble anyway its the job of a herihuti to see what no one else sees thanks i owe you i was about to get my butt kicked no you were about to be killed those two are part of sinjaris clan they are silaris the poisoned ones a shiver passed through ben disturbing his mental connection like a pebble dropped in a still pond what about ashley when i leave tomorrow will she be safe yes she is guarded by trugulas men hell protect her no one not even sinjari will bother his circle are you sure ill watch over her myself trust us we will guard your mate until you return shes not my oh never mind i dont even know what she is please just keep her safe until im back and i will be back you will fail ben ben stunned was sure he must have heard wrong what i can see down narrow paths of time if you go as you are now youll fail what does that mean you are herihuti but you dont believe it here moamba pointed to his naked chest you must accept your heritage or you and many others will perish but i dont see how moambas image swirled into the image of his dead grandfather your minds eye chose this memory to represent me when first i called you yet you rejected your grandfathers heritage it shamed you for you to succeed you must learn to embrace your blood cherish its memory as much as you cherish this image only then will you have a chance how am i to succeed then the old man held both fists to his chest listen to your blood but what do you mean by the images dissolved away leaving ben in blackness only the words echoed back to him listen to your blood he blinked his eyes and stared at the mute figure of moamba so many questions still on his tongue but moamba pulled himself up with his staff wait ben crossed to moamba i need to know what you meant yyou he garbled at ben gutturally you sleep he turned his back on ben obviously believing he had said enough sleep ben wondered like thats bloody likely ashley woke with a start surprised she had fallen into real sleep a female member of the tribe bowed her way into her chamber laden with clattering platters of colorful fruit and some type of steaming meat she shuffled to a flat stone about kneehigh and spread out the meal ashleys heart sank as she realized where she was she wanted to retreat back to her dreamland she had dreamt that she was back in her tiny trailer in the new mexico desert jason and ben were playing catch in the dusty yard their feet trampling her feeble attempt at growing a succulent garden she should have known it was a dream because all her garden grew were those weird red mushroom pods the oddest part though was how easily she accepted ben in a fathering light she glanced at her belly ben as a father a gentle snoring drew her attention to the mound of pillows beside her she sat up straighter as she recognized the tangle of blond hair peeking from under the blanket nearby ben what was he doing here as she reached to nudge him his snoring tumbled on a loud snort he jerked awake startling her he rubbed at his eyes what time is it she ignored his question how did you get past the guards he pushed up on an elbow his eyes bloodshot and a rusty stubble on his cheeks even down here its who you know moamba bullied the guards into letting me pass i just needed to know you were okay why didnt you wake me and ruin your beauty sleep not a chance ben crinkled up his nose whats that smell the sizzling meat on the platter had filled the cavern with smells that tantalized the tongue her stomach growled in anticipation breakfast she said hungrily he sat up in his pillows finally noticing the naked server not exactly a modest group are they ben slipped out of his covers and with his back shyly turned to the server slipped into his trousers ashley also used the moment to get dressed both of them descended on the meal like locusts finally ashley pushed her stone platter away from her phew i think ive had enough for a last supper that wasnt too bad her words seemed to have a devastating effect on ben this wont be your last meal ash i promise you we are getting out of here she smiled at him realizing he had misinterpreted her words i meant this was your last supper here before you left not mine oh bens face was sullen she laughed at his serious expression i just thought i know she took a deep breath sobering herself she reached a hand out and took his fingers in hers i know ben its sweet sweet her word seemed to wound him he glanced at her fingers entwined in his he spoke without raising his eyes ash youve got to know how i feel about you i want to be more than something sweet she tried to pull back her hand but he held her tight ben she didnt know what to say a part of her wanted to cry out that she loved him but another part was frightened to give in after scott after the miscarriage that part refused to be hurt again or to trust again she had barely survived it the first time jason had kept her going and now her son was missing too many emotions warred within her to think clearly how could she put this all into words she didnt have to he released her hand and pulled away his words were a strained whisper i guess wed better get going then im sure harry and the others are waiting he turned away his shoulders slumped she opened her mouth to say something anything to console him to tell him not to give up on her but was that fair she closed her mouth as ashley entered umbos chamber she saw harry huddled with the three other hunters who would be joining bens team he seemed amazingly bright and chipper for someone whod been working all night the room was crowded with other members of the tribe moamba stood in conversation with trugula no other village elders were present not even sinjari and for that ashley was thankful we did it harry said beaming as he crossed to join them you fixed the axle ben asked excitement in his voice come see youre not gonna believe it he waved them over to where michaelson was hunched beside one of the plastic sleds ashley noticed there were now four fluorescent sleds hooked to the aluminum transport the scavengers had retrieved all the stray sleds even villanuevas she looked at her dead friends yellow sled and a chill passed through her it seemed like a bad omen she studied michaelsons work with a final tug on a rope he secured the last of the boards in place just like a little train harry said it was denniss idea he lifted the large sled up careful of the motor look this little alteration makes this the most valuable vehicle on the planet ben whistled his appreciation fine piece of work ashley squeezed up to see she glanced at the front axle it glittered in the feeble light in that what i think it is you bet said harry a pure diamond axle will it hold ben asked eyeing a dubiously harry shrugged i ran the axle through some stress tests it seemed okay besides what other choice do we have we use it or we drag our way along on the plastic sleds ben fingered the diamond all right mate we travel in style ashley stepped back as harry lowered the sled so so youre all ready to go then for some reason this bothered her she had been anticipating this but suddenly to be faced with the reality that ben would be leaving her and possibly killed seemed too much tears threatened to well sensing her anxiety ben stepped to her and held her close i guess we shouldnt wait every minute may matter ashley just nodded afraid to speak fearful she would break down harry called the other tribesmen to him and barked final orders waving his hands and pointing at the various sleds it seemed he would take the lead being the most familiar with the motorized sled ben would take up the caboose helping to steady the three nervous hunters who were not accustomed to the concept of transportation ashley stepped out of the way trying not to get underfoot as packs were stowed and instructions explained moamba stepped next to her and placed a hand on her shoulder she glanced at him and he gave her a reassuring squeeze once everything was ready ben returned to her he seemed rejuvenated by the activity but there was still a sadness in his blue eyes i promise ill find out about jason and i will be back with moambas hand on her shoulder steadying her she felt capable of speaking i know you will ben i trust you and for the first time she realized she did trusted him with her life trusted him with her sons safety tears welled up and rolled down her face he leaned over and kissed her on the cheek then turned and crossed to his sled ashley took a step forward she could not let him leave without knowing how she truly felt she called to him her words catching in her throat ben i i drowned out by the roaring of the ignited sleds motor her words were lost harry revved the engine and the sled slid smoothly into the wormhole dragging the train of riders behind it she watched ben disappear into the tunnel riding villanuevas yellow sled ashley clutched her arms around her chest a coldness creeping into her stomach i love you ben she whispered book five return to alpha thirtyone linda crawled between the boulder and the floor too tired to acknowledge her nagging claustrophobic unease in such a tight space the miles of stone above her were of less concern at the moment than her stinging eyes sore muscles and miserable situation this was the second day since she and jason had been captured by khalid and the pace he set was exhausting minimal rest stops no lunch break just a brief breakfast and a cold dinner of ration bars it was up to her and jason to keep pace with him he had warned her that he wasnt going to stop and wait for them if he was to punch in the code on jasons belt of explosives every two hours then they had better keep up so the entire day was spent trying to keep abreast of khalid with a final heave linda cleared the boulder and pushed to her feet the tunnel here was wider the choking smoke had by now faded to a mild annoyance which made breathing easier yet it was this continuing dispersal of the smoke that drove khalids savage pace if the smoke should dissipate completely before they had tracked their way home then they truly would be lost there was another reason to race the smoke so far not a single predator had blocked their trail upward linda had voiced her opinion that the acrid fumes were probably acting as a repellent khalid had merely nodded at her assessment and with an oddly worried expression he had set an even harder pace as linda stretched her back and adjusted her handkerchief over her nose her headlamp speared the darkness ahead khalid had halted several yards down the tunnel leaning over something on the floor jasons upper arm was clutched in his grip what now jason turned to her come look squeezing next to jason she saw what had attracted khalid a halfyardtall metal canister stood in the center of the tunnel with thick cables leading from it and trailing forward into the darkness a meshed dish like a miniature satellite receiver topped the canister what is it she asked its one of those special radio things of dr dr blakelys jason stammered over the dead mans name the cables should lead us to the base then we did it linda said we made it khalid continued down the tunnel following the cables linda jason spoke up from beside her taking her hand as they followed khalid i dont think hes gonna let me go free she squeezed his hand jason he will once youre no longer needed as a hostage hell let you go the boy remained silent a moment then spoke when we reach the base when we get there his voice trailed off what is it jason if you get a chance to escape take it leave me behind she stopped pulling him to a halt im not going to leave you with him well find a way out of this mess hes gonna kill me anyway i can tell jason honey i wont let its in his eyes he interrupted he looks looks at me as if im not really here like im already dead linda knelt and cupped his face in her hands i promise you well get through this together jason shook his head dislodging her hands hes gonna let me die he then turned and marched down the tunnel she watched his back disappear around a bend like hell she thought pushing to her feet she followed him determined to keep that animal from harming jason she caught up with the boy and put an arm around his shoulder they both remained silent as they continued through the tunnel following khalid and the snaking cable after thirty minutes of hiking the tunnel seemed to be brightening around them jason glanced up at her she clicked off her helmet lamp no longer needing the illumination as they passed around a corner in the tunnel lamps could be seen attached to the walls they were still lit that meant the generators were still active from jasons account she figured the base would have been demolished and sunk in darkness maybe there was a chance that the base had been retaken already maybe reinforcements had arrived as she passed down the illuminated passageway she could see where khalid had stopped at the mouth of the tunnel alpha base he said to her without looking back she hurried beside him holding her breath hoping she glanced out and her heart sank the tunnel exited out the west wall of the cavern atop a slight rise the view of alpha cavern was spread out below the base a mere mile away or what was left of the base the place was a ruin lights still flickered here and there but poles were toppled throughout the camp every building still standing was scarred by fires or explosions and several smoldering red glows suggested some fires were still active a haze of smudged clouds hovered over the base as if trying to mask the damage even from here bodies looking like tossed rag dolls could be seen dotting the empty alleys between collapsed buildings worst of all nothing absolutely nothing moved the base was dead linda tried to keep jason from seeing but he wiggled free and just stared silently at the carnage below the elevators still intact khalid said we can proceed jason tugged at lindas arm she glanced down at him having to tear her eyes away from the devastation he had lifted up his shirt and pointed to the led readout on his belt the number thirty glowed on the panel thirty minutes until the plastique would be triggered she nodded khalid its time to reset jasons timer he glanced at her his eyes cold later she looked at jason he just stared back at her in resignation bringing up the rear behind the roaring transport sled all ben could see ahead of him was the hairy bottom of the mimiswee hunter on the next sled the exposed hunter went by the name of nobcobi harry had introduced the tiny warrior as denniss blood brother the hunter had insisted on accompanying the party since dennis could not come nobcobi would lose serious iljann points if he should be denied a place in the party it was an obligation of blood brothers still from the way nobcobi clutched his sled and shook with every bump he was probably wishing iljann or no iljann that he had stayed behind the other two hunters ahead of him didnt seem to be faring any better ben reached a hand forward and gave nobcobis leg a pat of reassurance but his touch caused the hunter to squeak in panic and almost lose his grip easy there buddy he shouted over the noise of the engine trying to sound as calm as possible which is difficult when yelling youre doing great just a little longer ben glanced at his watch they had been traveling for just shy of an hour if he was estimating their speed correctly that meant another three hours they should be topside by midday not bad ben laid his forehead on his arm closing his eyes letting the rocking motion and the persistent thrum of the engine lull him if only the mimiswee hunters could relax he thought about nobcobi who got suckered into this raw deal without even opening his eyes ben could picture the hunter clutching his sled like a drowning man bobbing in the surf the nobcobi he pictured then turned to him and spoke i can go just as fast on my own this this is mad well we cant he thought in answer were not built as compact as you i hate this oh quit your whining ben thought suddenly nobcobis eyes grew so large they looked almost entirely white you really are a herihuti another voice suddenly intruded on his conversation a familiar voice very good benny boy youre learning moambas voice faded away wait what did ben opened his eyes to find nobcobi staring back at him his eyes wide herihuti he said then turned forward ben pondered the implications he had done it just like moamba had contacted him he had contacted nobcobi even his head throbbed with the familiar ache from a mental conversation so how come he had done it so easily he had never been able to do anything like that before moambas disembodied voice again spoke to him the hunters are accustomed to the suggestions of the herihuti their minds are trained to accept our contact your own people are not so trained moambas voice faded away again bloody hell thought ben enough of this bullshit this vulcan mindmeld crap wasnt going to get that statue out of blakelys safe just then the timbre of the engine changed again harry was slowing down whats up he yelled harry answered were reaching the halfway point ben checked his watch another hour had passed so why stop the engine needs to cool its redhot i built this baby for speed not to haul cargo this is like pulling a uhaul with an indy racer suddenly the train dragged out of the wormhole and into a chamber the size of a twocar garage a second wormhole opening was on the far wall whats this ben asked rolling free of his sled he groaned as he stood shrugging out of his pack harry stood a few feet away rolling his head from side to side moamba told me there was a resting place halfway up for religious travelers i thought it would be a good spot to stretch our legs drain our lizards and let the engine cool nobcobi and the other two hunters were already off their sleds and standing as far from the plastic train as possible the three were deep in animated conversation the gestures they made toward the contraption even without translation were obviously foul ben crossed to harry so hows the gas supply just fine quit worrying how long till the engine cools harry shrugged i dont know half an hour an hour ben nodded but his hands kept clenching and unclenching he paced the narrow space as long as they were moving it wasnt so bad this stop was agonizing relax harry finally said were making good time i know i know ben searched for something to distract him but the chamber was a monotonous uniform room he stared at the trio of hunters what are they talking about mostly bitching harry took a diamond knife from a hide scabbard at his waist and picked at his nails theyre also telling some old folk tales about the great exodus from their original dwellings above down to their present village yeah so why did they leave from what i can tell there was some sort of earthquake and the cavern flooded lots of them died i guess theres some holy site up above that nobcobi wants to visit something about ancient warriors who died in a flash flood their heads are buried in clear stone i dont get that part i think i do ben pictured the cave pearls that his team had discovered with the embedded skulls in the center harry looked at him as if he were nuts yeah whatever anyway after they left the crakan took over their cavern the bastards use it as some sort of mating ground apparently there are several pods of these creatures and once every decade they converge in the big cavern and duke it out for mates something tells me this was the tenth year ben tried to picture herds of those bloody monsters hyped up with territorial and mating aggression alpha base never had a chance harry nodded soberly id better check the sled finally after tinkering with the engine for twenty agonizing minutes harry gave the thumbsup sign after much fidgeting the group of mimiswee climbed astride their sleds and they were under way again the remainder of the trip was uneventful no stalls no problems still it took forever during the trip ben checked his watch at least sixty times at long last harry cut the engine end of the line folks one of the hunters clambered over harry to get to the stone door ahead he manipulated something to the right of the door and the wall of rock swung out into ohnas chamber harry followed the hunter into the small cave hauling the train behind him once in the chamber ben rolled off his sled and crossed in a crouch to the chambers threshold he quickly scanned the immediate environment expecting to see herds of mating beasts but nothing was out there just the still lake gently lapping at the rocky shore below he glanced across the cavern miles away he could see the flickering lights of the distant camp alpha base from here it appeared okay but on closer inspection he realized there were not enough lights the base was partly extinguished the air once so clear now stung his nostrils reeking of old smoke and burning oil it smelled like trouble thirtytwo the first thing that struck jason as they got close to the base was the odor the stench penetrated past the perpetual odor of oily soot jason pinched his nose and concentrated on breathing through his mouth but still felt like he was going to gag linda patted him on the back but wore a sour expression too khalid she called were close enough to the base and jasons timer is down to seven minutes then increase your pace i wont reset it until we reach the camp its not safe to rush like this there could still be more of those monsters around we should go slowly by now the smoky air has probably driven them out of the cavern but it wont last forever we need to strike now before the smoke clears linda took quicker steps jason wed better hurry jason glanced down at the belt of explosives he watched the number blink from six down to five no kidding as they approached the edge of the base the source of the odor became apparent and they all slowed down dont look jason linda said trying to shelter him ignoring her warning jason watched while khalid gave the carcass of the dead beast a wide berth as he crept around it linda followed pulling jason along as they rounded its bulk the cause of death became apparent its stomach had been blown open by some explosive bits of metal and clotted intestines were strewn several yards across the floor jason swallowed hard fighting back the urge to retch he didnt know which was worse the sight or the smell as they hurried around the reeking beast linda suddenly gasped and turned jasons head to her chest but not before he glimpsed the headless torso of one of the base personnel still caught in its dead jaws this time he didnt fight to be free of her embrace once past the remains linda released him patting him on the back he saw khalid had stopped ahead visibly shaken his face blanched linda crossed to him i dont want jason to see any more of this khalid actually nodded were almost where i need to go its down this way he turned and led the way move quietly leading the way khalid traced a path between two collapsed wooden buildings as they followed jason noticed the booted legs of a soldier sticking out from under a jumbled pile of wooden beams and glass he looked away the base was silent around them their footsteps the only noise khalid paused for a moment glancing around him as if to get his bearings then proceeded north across the edge of the base in less than a minute they had reached one of the yardthick natural pillars that connected the distant ceiling to the floor khalid pulled off his pack and opened it he removed a length of climbing rope and tossed it to linda tie the boy here what she dropped the rope refusing he has three minutes left on the timer ill reset it once hes secure but why youre running out of time do it now linda glanced at jasons timer then bent down and picked up the rope im sorry she said as she positioned his back against the stone column tie his hands behind his back first jason saw the worried look in her eyes as she knotted the rope around his wrists he could tell she was on the verge of tears this bothered jason more than being tied up its okay he whispered to her she secured his waist to the column with the rope make it tight youll use up precious seconds if i have to redo it linda pulled the rope snug and tied a rapid knot im done she sat back her head hanging down there she said anger sharpening her voice now reset the timer khalid checked the knots and the tautness of the ropes he then bent down and tapped at the creditcardsized keyboard below the led readout the number now flashed jason had another two hours why are you doing this linda asked two reasons first the boy is slowing us down and i have fifteen charges still to set with your help i can be done in less than two hours the second reason is motivation i wont return to reset his timer again until all fifteen charges are placed this way youll be encouraged to cooperate with the utmost speed ill help you i told you i would theres no need for this his next words were acid your word is shit she remained silent jason saw khalid grab two handkerchiefs and come toward him he tried to shy away but the ropes held him tight khalid shoved the heel of his hand into jasons forehead pinning the back of his skull to the rock column he then balled up one of the handkerchiefs and forced it into jasons mouth before jason could try to spit it out he secured the gag with the second handkerchief by now linda was grabbing at khalids arm leave him alone khalid elbowed her away finishing his knot i dont want this brat screaming as soon as we leave it could draw those creatures back he pointed at jasons belt it now read were wasting time linda knelt by jason he tried to remain calm she touched his cheek ill be back i promise he nodded forcing back the tears that threatened she hugged him tight until khalid pulled at her shoulder now linda stood and with a final squeeze on jasons shoulder she turned and followed khalid jason watched them disappear out of sight behind him then listened as their footsteps faded into the darkness he was alone with his helmet lamp slicing a path forward into the blackness ben led the way across the empty cavern floor heading for the lights of alpha base he was careful to stop frequently and listen even though he could not see them he knew the three mimiswee hunters armed with knives and spears had fanned out to either side watching for any signs of the crakan they moved without lights and were as silent as phantoms the only thing ben could hear was the scrape of harrys boots on the rock behind him ben switched his pistol to his other hand and wiped his palm on his trousers leg the fires had heated up the cavern and the pall of smoke made it difficult to breathe he licked at his cracked lips and removed his canteen flipping the top with his thumb careful to no more than wet his mouth he took a quick swig then whispered to harry i expected lots of those monsters to be still around maybe the heat and the smoke are keeping them away i dont like it this is just too damned easy one thing ive learned when things look fineshit happens harry shrugged be careful what you wish for buddy a noise to the right drew their attention its nobcobi harry said cmon hes found something ben followed harrys bouncing lantern across the uneven floor nobcobi was crouched by a steaming pile of dung he had a fistful of it in front of his nose he turned to harry and spoke in hushed tones harry translated he says its fresh well thats good ben crinkled his nose at the odor id hate to think it had spoiled he estimates its less than an hour old theres other spoor too hes guessing that its a group of at least five of them two of them male he can tell all that from sniffing shit its their job what should we do then circle away from them harry knelt and conversed in whispers with nobcobi the other two hunters stood yards away scanning the periphery ears twitching forward and back finally harry stood and returned to ben the plan is to follow the group they seem to be aiming for the base the crakan travel in tight pods as they march any stragglers they encounter will either join the pod or be killed by them so the wake of this pod should be relatively free of stray beasts yeah ben mumbled kicking at the pile of damp spoor but if they turn back this way we become crakan shit ourselves khalid watched linda closely making sure she set the wires correctly good she was learning this was the ninth charge she had set the last three after he demonstrated with the first two this time her hands hardly shook as he finished his charge he watched as she furtively glanced at her watch he knew it was still another hour before jasons timer ran out and with only six more charges to set they were making good time now push the yellow button on the transceiver he said to her pointing over her shoulder good now its activated and awaiting my signal as they neared the base ben could see the pod of crakan through the darkness their triangular heads and bristled crests outlined by the lights of the camp now just yards away the pod totaled seventwo more had joined the group during the hour of travel to the base led by the larger of the two males the pod of females traveled in a loose array or harem as harry described it the smaller male nicknamed tiny tim trailed them he seemed to be guarding the pods backside and frequently turned and ventured a ways behind the pod he seemed to sense that something was amiss frequently whirling back scenting the air behind the group edgy son of a bitch harry whispered in bens ear as he crouched behind a boulder next to him ben nodded wary of even speaking fearful of attracting the beasts attention the journey had been tense during the trek the pod had encountered a solitary belligerent male it was attacked by the group in a sharklike frenzy and torn to meaty ribbons remembering the sight ben shivered out here in the middle of the open cavern floor there were few places to hide if they should attract the pods attention he shook his head forcing the image from his mind he peeked around the boulder he could see that the pod was just now entering the periphery of the base fading into the shadows of the remaining buildings its clear harry said softly waving to the trio of mimiswee hunters lets go ben stood from his crouch and stepped to follow harry as he rounded the boulder his foot slipped in an unseen hole and he fell as his pistol struck the rocky floor he saw the flash of muzzle fire from its barrel and an explosive shot rang out across the cavern christ ben thought so much for a quiet entrance he watched as a reptilian snout reemerged from the shadows of the base ahead darting back and forth searching tiny tim stepped back out into the light jason squirmed in his ropes as the gunshot echoed across the cavern he chewed at his gag but he couldnt even move his tongue and breathing through his mouth was all but impossible he pulled deeply through his nose panicked that he couldnt get enough air around him shadows danced in the flickering light his first thought was that khalid had shot linda and his heart pounded in his chest then a volley of gunfire from an automatic weapon echoed across the cavern it wasnt khalid he struggled again with his gag maybe he could work free of it call to whoever it was for help more gunfire erupted was it coming closer he listened blood thundered in his ears making it hard to judge more blasts yes he struggled more frantically then a thought occurred to him and he froze what were they firing at ben slammed into the entryway of one of the few concrete buildings still standing nobcobi pounced in behind him breathing hard a quick scan revealed the building to be a dormitorycots lined both walls but ben ignored the room and took a quick peek back out the entryway he saw the tail of one of the crakan disappear around the far corner good luckily it had been one of the slower females that had pursued them a few quick moves and they had lost her but what about harry had he made it to the base volleys of automatic fire flared to the south ben clenched a fist okay at least he was still alive and fighting he considered his options rubbing at his forehead he could try to make it to harry but it would be damned difficult to find him or he could try to get to blakelys office and retrieve the statue that was the wisest plan but he hated leaving harry and the other hunters on their own still what could he do his one pistol would be little help no hed just have to hope harry and the others could manage besides harry knew the base well and knew where ben would be heading he pushed open the door of the building leaned out and took a moment to get his bearings spotting the elevator shaft off to the left and the lake just past a set of trampled tents he centered himself okay he knew roughly where he was blakelys office was less than half a mile away thats if the bridge spanning the gorge that split the camp was still intact if he had to circle around the huge crevice then it would be more like two miles and with those bloody crakan creeping around he wanted the shortest route possible taking a deep breath he waved nobcobi to follow the small hunter clenching a spear longer than his own body followed ben led the way sticking close to shadows and ducking from hiding place to hiding place as ben inched across the base he heard periodic bursts of gunfire he stopped and listened biting his lower lip the shots were getting farther and farther away with all the hiding places available harry should have been able to lose the bastards by now he glanced at nobcobi the hunter leaned casually on his spear shaft his lids halfclosed scratching at his bare backside why was he so freakin calm again five shots rang outeven farther away now then it dawned on ben harry was purposefully firing off rounds drawing the beasts away leaving the way open for ben to get to the office he looked at nobcobi he nudged the mimiswee hunter you knew that didnt ya bub cmon he increased the pace counting on harry to lure the crakan astray now moving quicker ben reached the gorge in two minutes but stopped when he saw the bridge or at least where the bridge used to be goddamn it he muttered cant anything go right all that was left of the bridge was a couple of broken spars jutting a few feet across the gorge leaving a black gap of empty space he eyed the span at least thirty feet much too far to jump they would have to walk he jumped at a loud crash behind him whirling around he turned to see one of the crakan lunge from between two buildings into the cleared area in front of the gorge it was tiny tim and he blocked the only way back to the maze of buildings and tents the creature hissed and stalked forward so you little bastard ben said backing away as he raised his gun you werent fooled by harry he pointed his pistol and fired the creature shied away from the noise and pawed slightly at its neck ben could see the trail of blood oozing from the wound he had hit the target but the bullet hardly seemed to faze the thickskinned beast it stalked toward him nobcobi darted behind ben as he fired the shot went wild but the noise stopped it the crakan paused warily eyeing its prey damn you could almost see the bastard plotting ben backed another step the edge of the gorge was now only a few feet behind him he turned to tell nobcobi to make a run for it while he distracted the beast but no one was behind him nobcobi was already gone then he saw the small hunter balancing on the spar of the bridge a few yards away tying a rope to the remains of a lamppost what was he doing ben turned his attention back to his adversary the beast just cocked its head back and forth staring at the pistol as if weighing its danger bens foot skidded on the slippery rock as he backed another step he risked a quick glance over his shoulder nobcobi had backed off the bridge and stood an arms length away from ben what are you before ben could finish nobcobi ran toward the damaged bridge my god thought ben hes gonna try to jump it it was bloody suicide he watched as nobcobi raced down the single thin spar as if he were running on solid ground at the last moment the small hunter brought his long spear forward and jammed the blunt end into the spar and vaulted upward flying across the empty air he landed in a roll on the far side of the gorge ben noticed for the first time the loop of rope wrapped around nobcobis waist the length of climbing rope now trailed across the gorge to where the tiny hunter had secured it to the lamppost a roar drew his attention back around tiny tim stared across the gorge at his escaped prey obviously angered at his loss now those black eyes fixed back on ben he could almost see the smile spread on its lips exposing the full length of its yellowed teeth it stepped toward him ben whose gun was still vaguely pointing at the beasts head realized his chances of a head shot were poor a kill shot beyond his skill he lowered his aim toward an easier target its belly if he had guessed nobcobis intentions correctly ben needed only a few seconds of breathing room he pulled the trigger the shot dug into tiny tims flank causing the beast to back up a few steps ben didnt wait he swung around and ran toward the damaged bridge just as he had anticipated nobcobi had pulled up the slack in the rope and had secured his end around a post on the far side ben now had a rope bridge across the gorge behind him he heard a roar it was coming his feet almost slipped as the traction changed from rock to wood as he reached the broken bridge his arms out for balance he darted down the spar and leaped off the end he dove for the rope stretching his arms out as far as he could grimacing he caught the rope with one hand wrenching his shoulder as his weight swung down he flailed for a second his grip slipping slightly then he swung a second hand on the rope he hung there a second breathing heavily shaken the rope jerked in bens grip what the hell he craned his neck around tiny tim rammed the lamppost to which nobcobi had secured the rope if the post went so would that end of his rope bridge ben glanced down at the black pit below him he scrambled hand over hand across the bridge but the jostling of the rope made his progress jerky and slow he wasnt going to make it and as the rope went limp in his grip he realized for once in his life he was right thirtythree linda realized two things as she crouched in the semidemolished latrine first there was no way that she and khalid could complete all the explosive charges before jasons time ran out with only twenty minutes left they still had three more charges to set second she had also come to realize that khalid had never intended to free jason anyway she stared at the cold figure of khalid as he peered out the broken door of the building the stench of pine disinfectant was thick in the narrow space since the gunfire began he had made no move to complete the charges instead he sought the nearest shelter and decided to lay low she slid next to khalid jasons timer is running out he nodded i know but the gunfire is between us and the boy a small pocket of resistance obviously withstood the initial onslaught and whatever theyre shooting at id just as soon avoid right you bastard she thought a convenient excuse the asshole never planned to return for jason by now she had recognized a pattern to khalids charges he was circling the camp setting charges at the base of the largest colonnades that ran from floor to ceiling he meant to blow up a majority of them and bring the roof down drop the volcano on top of the caverns she also noted that his route was circuitous ending near the elevator he obviously meant to complete the series of charges then hop on the elevator and escape leaving jason to be a human bomb of course the gunfire had put a crimp in his finetuned plans suddenly a roar of rage erupted from across the base one of those creatures it sounded pissed she noticed khalid flinch with each roar these things seemed to unnerve him in more ways than simple fear even now he mumbled something low in arabic it sounded like a prayer even though she enjoyed seeing the icy khalid finally shaken up it had left him paralyzed afraid to leave this hiding place and time was running out we need to get going linda said firmly khalid whirled on her his eyes dark before he could curse her she spoke up the gunfire is heading this way khalid listen she pointed out the door whatever theyre firing at is being driven this way toward us he clenched his fists not in anger but with fear and frustration we need to keep moving fear cracked his normally steady voice then lets go a loud snap echoed across the gorge as tiny tim rammed loose the mooring of the rope bridge as ben began to plummet he tightened his grip on the limp rope he prayed nobcobi had the remaining mooring securely rigged wincing he watched the far wall race toward him this was going to hurt but he had to hold his grip if the collision should jar him loose from the rope he would be nothing more than a messy splat on the floor of the gorge he twisted around to catch the brunt of the collision with his legs but it was little use when he hit it felt like he had jumped off a tenstory building his left hip smashed into the wall almost blinding him with pain but he ignored it concentrating on one thing keeping his grip on the rope willing his ten fingers to clench tight he bounced off the wall and swung back this time his legs did bear the brunt of the impact and he came to a stop hanging fifteen feet from the lip of the gorge across the chasm tiny tim bellowed its rage at him it stalked back and forth by the damaged bridge searching for a way across ben squinted at its piercing cries of rage shut the fuck up he screamed back at it tiny tim tensed at his outburst and crouched low just across the gorge ben knew it could see him for a moment he thought the crakan might suicidally leap at him but instead it hissed a final time and darted back into the maze of buildings good riddance sighing in relief ben hung there resting he could feel blood running down the inside of his pants leg as he clutched the rope he needed to finish the climb before he weakened any further twisting a leg in the rope he risked freeing a hand to snap the rope into the rappelling harness around his waist with a modicum of a safety net now he made a steady ascent to the lip once there nobcobi helped him over the edge ben rolled to his back on the hard floor his breathing raspy the hunter fingered bens bloodsoaked trousers leg he said something in his guttural language his voice sounding concerned its just a gash ill live he pushed himself up by the way mate thanks for the rescue i was sure we were gonna be monster chow nobcobi wrinkled his brow in confusion oh never mind ben tried to stand but his injured hip protested it wasnt broken but it still hurt like hell hopping he headed away from the gorge cmon we still need to get to that safe nobcobi followed but after a few yards he grabbed bens arm and pointed to the droplets of blood from his gash that dripped as he walked i told you its nothing blakely has a firstaid kit in his office ben turned to leave but the little hunter persisted pulling him back he pantomimed sniffing at the bloody trail then imitated a far approximation of a crakans throaty growl you think im leaving a trail ben studied the line of droplets youre right i guest its best if we dont leave such an obvious invitation ben stripped out of his bloody trousers and wrung them out standing in his shorts he examined his wound a jagged slash across his upper thigh it would leave an ugly scar but nothing worse frowning he used the last dregs of his canteen to wash the wound then secured a handkerchief around his upper thigh to stanch the flow of blood there ben said slipping back into his trousers are you happy the hunter had that bored look on his face again apparently content fine lets go ben led the way sneaking from shadow to shadow he had enough of those stinking crakan and didnt want to run into any others the way was clear within five minutes he found himself at the door to blakelys office the glass door to the administration office was smashed but otherwise the concreteblock building was intact stepping gingerly across the threshold careful of the glass ben entered the reception area something large had trashed the room a thick yellow substance reeking of ammonia smeared the walls looks like some bloody alley cat sprayed the place ben muttered as he examined the wreckage of desk and files pushing through the debris he reached the undamaged metal door that led to the offices he tried the knob locked goddamn it he struck the door bruising his fist he rattled the doorknob a voice called from behind the door hello is someone out there by god someone was alive he pounded on the door open up its ben brust from the exploration team a pause then meekly is it safe for the moment now open up he heard the deadbolt releasing the door pulled open from within a small blond woman with straggly hair stood before him a smart business suit was in shambles on her thin form sandy ben recognized blakelys secretary are you all right she ran to him and hugged him thank god youre here nobcobi stepped up to ben and mumbled something pointing back out the door sandy stared at the small naked hunter her eyes wide her fingers digging into bens arm she gave a small whimper and backed away ben waved nobcobi outside so as not to scare her any further he pushed sandy down the hallway toward blakelys office once inside he crossed to the safe where blakely stored the diamond figurine the ohna idol of the mimiswee he didnt know the combination but there were enough blasting caps and explosives on the base that it shouldnt be hard to open harry knew where those supplies were and how to use them so where was harry now sandy huddled on a sofa what what was that creature hes a friend one of the cliff dwellers how i mean when he sat down next to her its a long story but trust me hes a friend he wont harm you she hugged her arms around her chest and shivered how did you get left behind he asked why didnt you evacuate with the others she stared at him as if he were crazy there was no evacuation they attacked so suddenly there was no time everyones dead what but what about reinforcements from above we lost radio communications almost immediately on the day following the attack i heard the elevator motor and took a chance and ran to look her face paled as she related the story the elevator was packed with soldiers but they didnt know she turned to him her eyes tearing up they didnt know the noise drew those creatures scores of them when the elevator opened the men were overwhelmed torn to pieces she placed her face in her hands since then no ones tried to come down ben nodded with mcmurdo on the backass side of the world its no wonder itll probably take them at least a week to stage a fullscale assault until then were on our own sandys sobbing worsened he patted her hand well make it until then with her voice full of tears she said they all ran out i was all alone i couldnt do anything what about blakely she shook her head the last time i saw him he was running out of here with that boy jason bens heart skipped a beat do you know if they made it to safety i dont know what happened i locked myself in here but the screaming the screaming went on for days then nothing nothing at all that was the worst the silence she looked up at him shaking i thought i was the last one left well youre not he stood up what was he going to tell ashley he paced the floor and glanced at his watch fourteen hours had elapsed he still had to blow the safe and return to the mimiswee village that didnt leave him room to thoroughly search the entire base with those beasts around he stopped in front of the safe and clenched his fist where in bloody hell was harry he turned to sandy i dont suppose you happen to know the combination to blakelys safe she nodded and told him finally maybe his luck was turning he twirled the dial as she instructed and swung open the heavy door for a moment he didnt think it was in there until he realized the statue had been wrapped in brown paper and twine he picked it up and ripped the paper off holding it up to the filtered light ben ran a finger across the statues thick belly hopefully she would bring him luck just then nobcobi came rushing in a panicked look on his face somehow ben knew his luck had just run short again tears of frustration ran down jasons face he still couldnt believe it at first he had thought he had imagined it but the accent was clear ben he had heard him talking to someone followed by a loud knocking from only a little distance away he couldnt make out the words clearly but it had to be ben jason had tried to call to him but the gag stifled all but a soft moan that barely reached his own ears finally he had heard a door slam shut followed by silence he strained to listen for any evidence that ben was still around nothing he must have gone into the building jason struggled with his bonds if only he could free a hand and pull the gag off he had to find some way to call to ben when he exited the building if he should fail he glanced at the led readout on his belt the number glowed on the screen and as he watched it dissolved into the number he needed help fast he struggled again with the ropes but it was no use he slumped against the restraints he needed another plan as he hung from the pillar an idea suddenly struck him maybe he shifted his hips if he could reach his left hand to his jacket pocket he squeezed his eyes closed as he stretched and contorted his body straining in his bonds he felt his fingers close on the familiar plastic box careful not to drop it he struggled to free it from his pocket but it caught in the fabric he stopped and took a deep breath dont rush with more concentration he slowly worked it free of his jacket sighing in relief it had been the only thing that khalid had let him keep from his gym bag he prayed the batteries still worked as he flipped on his nintendo game boy a familiar jingle bounced from the toy he twisted the volume control to its highest the music was not particularly loud but with luck the oddity of the sound would attract ben when he left the building he waited please ben hurry what if the batteries should die out too soon what if he was wrong and ben had already left what if the timer on his belt reached zero before ben heard him his mind spun with awful misgivings but one worry he had not considered until he saw the black snout angle around the corner to his right what if the noise attracted something other than ben jason watched as it hissed softly at him its nostrils flaring open and closed he thumbed off his nintendo and froze the creature stalked fully into view bloody wounds oozed from its belly and neck but it seemed unaffected by the injuries as it slowly slunk in his direction thirtyfour ashley was sure her son was fine he had to be she put down her pen all day she had been working in umbos chamber trying to keep her hands busy and her mind distracted cataloging measuring recording notes in her logbook she glanced at her watch it was already late evening ben should be heading back by now what if he didnt have any word of jason or worse what if he never came back how much longer could she wait before this tension drove her mad sighing she sat back and stared across the chamber at the dozing figure of moamba seated with his eyes closed he was her only guard the others had been sent away his word was obeyed without question she eyed the black wormhole through which ben had disappeared she could make a break for it if moamba was truly napping then perhaps she shook her head it was a long crawl they would surely catch her besides she couldnt abandon michaelson even if by some miracle she did manage to escape hed be killed in her place suddenly moambas eyes snapped open and he stared at her he struggled to his feet but his hours of sitting seemed to cramp him ashley crossed over and helped him up he eyed the opening to the chamber that led to the village what is it she asked he placed a hand over her mouth for silence then waved for her to follow using his staff as a crutch he hobbled through the entrance and pulled her into a shadowed alcove just across the tunnel what was going on but she did not have long to wait the soft scrape of leather on stone could be heard approaching down the tunnel someone was coming but who she squinted down the feebly lit tunnel until moamba pulled her back into the shadows she waited holding her breath from the sound of the approaching footsteps more than one person approached pressing farther back into the dark alcove the party slipped past her hiding place and entered umbos chamber she swallowed back a hiss as she recognized the bony physique of one of them it was sinjari the other two were the exact opposite of sinjari where he was tall and bony they were hunched and thick with muscle but there was no question who was the boss here a mere frown from sinjari would cause the offending party to cringe and there was a lot of cringing from the gesturing and sharp commands it was apparent sinjari was giving orders that were only reluctantly being obeyed finally with a bark from their boss the two bullnecked brutes ducked their heads and crept into the wormhole that led to alpha cavern what was going on ashley could not understand a word that was being spoken but moamba apparently did she could feel him tensing beside her actually quivering with suppressed emotion his tension was contagious she found herself clenching her fists sinjari was up to something nefarious something meant to harm her group suddenly moamba burst from the alcove startling her she darted after him as he hobbled into umbos chamber sinjari swung around with his mouth open stunned and wideeyed moamba crossed to stand almost toetotoe with sinjari he stamped his staff so hard splinters flew from its tip sinjari took a step back obviously flabbergasted by the sudden appearance of his nemesis ashley stood to the side as heated words flowed from moamba now it was sinjaris turn to cringe he seemed to fold himself inward as moambas words assailed him but where sinjaris lackeys had fear in their eyes sinjaris pupils were slitted with menace from ashleys vantage she could see his hand edging toward the knife at his belt she opened her mouth to warn moamba but words caught in her throat how could she warn him she couldnt speak a word of their language she watched as sinjaris fingers closed on the knife moamba was a prominent leader surely sinjari wouldnt dare without warning sinjari lashed out driving the long diamond dagger into moambas chest the knife cut moambas angry tirade the old mimiswee looked down at the hilt protruding from his chest as if analyzing an intriguing bug he coughed once a dribble of blood appearing on his lips ashley frozen with shock finally screamed as sinjari yanked the dagger free then plunged it a second time into moambas chest the old man stumbled backward pulling himself off the blade sinjari raised the dagger again meaning to strike at moambas throat but by now ashley was upon him she snapped a boot heel into the attackers ribs knocking him aside as he stumbled to catch his balance she positioned herself in front of moamba the old man had by now slumped to the floor blood flowed from between his fingers as he clutched his chest sinjari turned to her get the fuck away you bastard she screamed he rubbed his bruised rib with one hand while toying with the blade with the other his smile was all teeth and no warmth he had the blade she didnt she eyed the fallen staff that moamba had dropped sinjari didnt give her a chance to formulate a plan he lunged at her but years of karate training and four older brothers had honed her reflexes she twisted to the side grabbing sinjaris wrist as his lunge missed her pivoting on her foot she used her hip and sinjaris momentum to flip the bastard to the floor the snap of cracking bone brought a smile to her lips his knife skittered uselessly across the rock in two steps she had the dagger in hand now lets see what the bastard thinks with the tables turned she thought sinjari had already scrabbled away cradling his left arm he backed from her to the other side of the chamber obviously giving up the fight while keeping a wary eye on sinjari she crossed to moamba who now lay sprawled on his back his chest heaving in gurgling breaths he seemed to be staring blindly at the ceiling in shock he needed immediate help but how she jumped as sinjari suddenly stood up she pointed the knife at him but he didnt approach he slinked instead toward the wormhole with a final sneer at her he darted into the wormhole and disappeared just as he vanished she heard the sound of many feet approaching down the tunnel thank god help was coming she turned just as the first of the warriors burst into the chamber spears pointing forward a keening wail arose from them as they spotted the bloody figure of moamba sprawled across the floor almost in unison the angry and accusing eyes of the hunters turned on her she looked down at the bloody dagger still in her hand damn calm down ben said as he grabbed nobcobis waving hands he had been trying to make sense of nobcobis frantic gestures and guttural words but was making no headway his efforts had only succeeded in frustrating both of them ben glanced toward sandy she had backed away into a far corner of blakelys office cringing no help there he released nobcobis hands if only harry would come he knew their language suddenly nobcobi reached over and touched bens forehead with a single finger then touched his own ben stared at him blankly the tiny hunter repeated the gesture irritation starting to crinkle his eyes in another moment ben understood nobcobi wanted him to communicate with his herihuti skills the hunter couldnt initiate the contact himself since he wasnt of the proper blood but ben could like back in the wormhole ben nodded his understanding and gestured for nobcobi to sit on the couch nobcobi eyed the leather sofa suspiciously and instead just sat crosslegged on the floor ben shrugged and did the same facing the mimiswee hunter closing his eyes ben willed his breathing to slow striving to calm his agitated mind he pictured relaxing on the back porch of his fathers sheep station with a warm beer and a lazy day ahead suddenly sandy burst out what are you doing frowning ben held up a hand but kept his eyes closed its okay sandy i need you to be quiet for a minute but shhh just relax his words dreamy were directed at both her and himself relax he could hear her grumble under her breath but he ignored her and sipped his tepid fosters from a dusty bottle while tipping back his chair in the corner of the porch he thought of nobcobi picturing the little fellows flatnosed face and spindly neck suddenly the hunter appeared next to ben seated on another chair nobcobi stared slackjawed around him he stood up and leaned on the porch railing gawking up at the wide sky not a cloud from horizon to horizon he seemed to cower a bit then turned his back on the view to face ben its its so big he shuddered ben felt a little sorry thrusting the poor man into such a foreign landscape but moamba had done the same with him besides he missed the ranch dont worry nobcobi its not the size that counts what never mind bad joke ben took another swig of his beer hell if it didnt taste bloody real now what were you trying to tell me nobcobi took a nervous swallow one eye darting behind him i heard a strange noise in the cave like nothing i had heard before what did it sound like nobcobi scrunched up his face and repeated the sound he heard it sounded like a tune or something and it sounded familiar do that again ben concentrated as he listened eyes closed where had he heard that his eyes sprang open and he sat up straight christ its that damned jingle from jasons nintendo game hed heard the infuriating thing a thousand times during the trek here where did you hear that ben blurted i went to look to see what was making that sound but i almost ran into that crakan thats been hounding us the smart one he was following the sound too blast ben pushed out of the dream scattering it into colored shreds until he was facing nobcobi again in blakelys office he shoved to his feet nobcobi followed sandy stay here ben said as he slammed another clip in his gun lock the door if we come knocking open the door in a hurry she nodded and followed him down the hall whats going on i dont have time to explain he pushed through the door to the reception area lock it and be quiet he heard the door slam behind him and a deadbolt click he turned to nobcobi now show me where that sound was coming from the hunter stared at him blankly hell this was not the time for another communication gap ben imitated the tune and pretended to look around then shrugged nobcobi nodded and pointed out the door taking the lead ben clenched his pistol in a whiteknuckled grip and followed if he was too late he shook his head he wouldnt be he followed nobcobi back outside just as they turned the corner harry suddenly appeared before them startled ben came within a hair of plugging the man with a bullet you made it harry said winded and sweating through his tattered fatigues lets get the statue and get out of here the other hunters are still leading that pod of crakan on a wild goose chase but they cant keep it up much longer we need to ben held up a hand i got it already great but weve got a new problem we need to hurry ben motioned nobcobi ahead as he gave harry a thumbnail account of the situation harry followed so you think thats ashleys kid ben nodded shit bad time to be playing a video game nobcobi signaled them to be quiet and waved harry next to him he whispered something in his ear harry grimaced and backed next to ben in a hushed voice he translated this is where nobcobi spotted tiny tim the music came from just around the next collapsed building ben nodded this time he made sure he placed each foot on solid rock before proceeding he didnt want to repeat the previous blunder that had attracted the pods attention the group crept silently edging past a demolished mess tent its pots and pans strewn across the rocky floor after a minute of creeping the nowfamiliar sound of claw on rock and snuffling of something large could be heard from up ahead nobcobi who was a few yards in front of ben and harry peered around the edge of a pile of shredded lumber into the clearing beyond suddenly he popped back flattening himself against the corner he signaled them to freeze ben watched as the beasts thick tail swung into view ahead sweeping aside a few stray pots their clattering was painfully loud in the silence of the dead camp the tail then disappeared from view nobcobi waved them slowly forward ben crept up first and inched just enough around the corner to peer into the clearing ahead its back was to him tail slashing back and forth he could see its head flicking from left to right as it examined something in front of it snorting loudly then it shuffled to the side to get another vantage in which to examine its prey ben suppressed a gasp as the large creature moved it revealed its intended target jason was roped to one of the columns the boys eyes wide with terror but the crakan just circled around the column snorting and snuffling obviously baffled as to why its prey wasnt running like a cat ben thought it wasnt used to a meal just sitting there ben slipped back around and allowed harry a peek before speaking he whispered in harrys ear i need you to lure the bastard away like you did the others give me a chance to free jason and get him to safety well meet back at blakelys office harry nodded but be careful ben warned this bastards a tricky one harry huddled a moment with nobcobi then the two slipped away to circle east a bit to draw its attention away from bens hiding place ben waited as they maneuvered into position holding his breath praying that he wouldnt all of a sudden hear a scream from jason the creature wouldnt wait forever eventually the novelty would wear thin and it would attack tensed muscles quivering with anticipation ben jumped at the sudden eruption of clanking pots and pans from just east of his position harry and nobcobi it was about time he risked peeking around the corner to see the commotions effect on the crakan it stood there frozen its ears cocked back to listen then slowly swung its head in the direction of the noise it took a few steps toward the sound then stopped and glanced back at jason strapped to the pillar it wasnt going to take the bait at least not before nailing its easy prey it took a step back toward jason goddamn you ben raised his pistol before ben could shoot harry jumped into the clearing with two dented pots in his hands he hollered at it hey there big fellow how about a little action to punctuate his statement he slammed the pots together the voice and clank got its attention with a roar it swung back in harrys direction the quickness of the beast seemed to catch harry off guard he stumbled a step backward almost falling ben clenched his teeth move it soldier harry seemed to hear his silent command and dashed back into the alley the fleeing man was too much temptation for the monster it scrabbled after harry disappearing down the alley ben didnt wait as soon as the tip of its tail vanished he dashed into the clearing toward the boy tears trailed down jasons sootblackened features the boy still stared in the direction of the disappearing beast thank god he seemed otherwise unharmed ben ran toward him the scuffing of bens boots on rock drew jasons attention a fleeting look of terror crossed his features before he seemed to recognize ben then fresh tears flowed ben reached him in seconds he hugged him hard in the ropes pulling the gag free wondering who the hell had bound and gagged the boy but now wasnt the time for questions jason shook with sobs youre okay now son youre safe but jason kept on sobbing trying to get words out between choking sobs i tried to tried to call you with my game he dropped the toy still held in his hands and it clattered to the stone you did good ben crouched down pulled out a knife and attacked the ropes my my mom is she okay shes fine shes somewhere safe suddenly jason jerked in the loosening ropes ben could barely get the boys hands untied with him squirming so much he finally succeeded stay still for a sec let me get that last rope from around you i need to see jason seemed frantic what jason lifted up his untucked shirt for the first time ben noticed the glowing led readout on jasons belt buckle the number glowed back at him jason looked down then moaned whats that its a bomb he said a desperate look in his eyes what the hell are you talking about jason pointed out the gray squares of plastique hooked to the belt khalid put it on me to control linda its set to go off in six minutes then lets get it off you he reached for the boy with the knife jason backed away if its removed itll go off only the secret code will release it who knows the code khalid and hes out there somewhere setting other bombs the goddamn bastard if i get my hands on him well theres got to be a way to disarm it maybe harry hes a demolitions expert ben covered his face with his hands bloody hell how was he going to get him back here in time they werent supposed to rendezvous back at blakelys office for another half hour he clenched his fists and pressed them against his temple goddamn it man think ben stared as the led number dissolved from a to a ashley plopped down on the pillow in her small cave once again she was confined to her cell three guards stood at the threshold diamond blades glinting in the fungal glow she had tried through both pantomime and repeating sinjaris name to communicate her innocence in the attack on moamba but it was futile her only witness moamba was near death a commotion at the entrance to her cell drew her attention she watched as michaelson was shoved past the guards he stumbled on his weak ankle but caught his balance fuckers took my guns he said as he crossed over to her all of them whats going on sorry it was my fault she said standing up her muscles still tense with frustration i was at the wrong place at the wrong time she told him the story of sinjaris attack on moamba and the result of her interference i was caught with a smoking gun so to speak moamba was found stabbed in the chest with me standing over him the murder weapon in my hand can you blame them whats going to happen she shrugged i dont know i think everyones more concerned about moamba at the moment do you think the old guy has any chance of surviving ashley shook her head doubtful he lost a lot of blood and with his mental abilities if he was able hed be blowing the whistle on sinjari himselftelepathically on all wavelengths for him to be remaining so silent hes got to be nearly braindead and if he dies i dont think either one of us has much chance of living regardless of whether or not ben makes the deadline michaelson glanced at his watch ben has less than eight hours sighing she said now im hoping he doesnt return as angry as those tribesmen are i think even if he returns with the statue theyll just execute him along with us itd be best if he just stays away he wont i know she sat back down on a pillow and waved michaelson to do the same if only there was a way to warn him to tell harry and ben not to come back theres no way come hell or high water ben will return for you she smacked her knee with a fist then ive got to find some way to let the village know about sinjari some way to communicate but they wont even try to listen their judgment is too clouded with anger maybe harry will return with ben before moamba dies he could translate your story even if he did do you think theyd believe us sinjari is one of their elders it would be his word against mine then well need evidence what do you think the bastard was up to anyway no good thats for sure i think he means to interfere with bens mission thwart it in some way if we could prove that then that would go a long way to support your claim but how she asked exasperated catch him redhanded when he returns the only easy route back to the village from alpha cavern is through that wormhole if he went up that way hell sneak back that way and how do you propose to catch him locked up in this cell he shrugged hey i dont have all the answers she shook her head at the uselessness of their reverie still this all depends on moamba surviving until ben and harry return if he should a keening wail erupted from the guards at the door a cry that also echoed from the village around them piercing the stone walls like paper the pitch so high it caused the hairs to stand on ashleys arms michaelson covered his ears eyes squinting at the noise as suddenly as it started the wailing ceased the sudden silence felt huge and empty as if something vital had been removed from the air ashley saw one of the guards look in her direction under his bony brow tears were in his eyes and something else toohatred what was that all about michaelson asked we just ran out of time moambas dead ben was just starting to stand when it hit like an explosion between his ears he stumbled back to his knees at first he thought some bomb must have detonated like the one attached to jasons waist but when he pried his eyes open jason was just staring at him with a quizzical look are you okay the boy asked seemingly unaware of what had just transpired ben nodded i think so then the world went black what the hell he struggled but seemed to be floating in a space without stars nothing to push against nothing to fight he was not unconscious just surrounded by an infinite blackness then a single dull ember appeared glowing in the darkness ahead as he concentrated on this landmark like some distant beacon the glow intensified to a bright flame it spoke vibrating with each word in his grandfathers voice ben ben you must hurry by now ben could recognize one of moambas callings but now was not the time what is it whats wrong is ashley okay weak tired the flame died again to only a feeble flicker must hurry it flickered bright for a heartbeat danger then it faded first back to a dull glow then to nothing and in the darkness ben felt an emptiness somehow he knew that moamba had not just broken contact but was gone gone for good as the world reappeared around him he found tears trailing down his cheek ben whats wrong jason was shaking his shoulder he pushed off the stone floor where he had collapsed moamba was dead he knew this as sure as he knew his fathers name im okay he answered the boy you fainted dont worry im fine he patted the boys knee while pondering the meaning of moambas final urgent message he had wanted ben to return immediately not to waste any more time but what was the hurry ben still had seven hours before his deadline something must be up a new danger jason looked at him with concern but didnt speak ben glanced at the timer on the boys belt the number five still glowed on the panel hurry moamba had urged no kidding he needed a plan a way to contact harry get him back here to defuse the bomb then it dawned on him hell why didnt he think of this earlier he did have a means of contacting harry well at least nobcobi who could then tell harry to get his butt back here moambas calling reminded him he could do the same he had never tried it at such a distance and it was doubtful that nobcobi was in a relaxed trance state susceptible to his calling but it was possible moamba had done it to him before he had to try jason i know this is gonna seem bloody bonkers but im gonna need to concentrate i need you to stay quiet okay but what shhh later ben sat down crosslegged closing his eyes and breathing deeply he again pictured his childhood home outside perth the orange dust the roos in the distance home he sat in a creaking chair on the porch again not bothering with a beer this time instead he concentrated fiercely on nobcobis image visualizing the hunter sitting next to him he filled in the details of the hunters features the scar across his cheek the graying patch of fur at the top of his head as he concentrated the image flickered into reality for a heartbeat nobcobis surprised face turned to him then winked back out damn it ben concentrated again cmon nobcobi you saw me there for a second you know what i want he pressed forward again cmon listen to me nothing he persisted for what seemed like several wasted minutes minutes he didnt have just before he was ready to scream in frustration and give up nobcobi appeared he seemed winded what do you want he growled at ben i almost tripped and fell with that first call youre supposed to enough i need harry back here now well were heading back that way that crakan must have it in for you it gave up chasing us and turned back your way are you cleared out of there yet no weve got a problem i need harry and you to forget about tiny tim and meet me back at the office run as fast as you can you better do the same that crakan is coming your way fast hurry but nobcobi had already vanished ben pushed back out of his dream state and found jason staring at him what are you doing its a long story he said scrambling up weve got company coming with a relieved sigh he noticed jasons led readout showed a time moved oddly in the dreaming place it seemed like he was there a lot longer than a mere moment can you run jason shifted from foot to foot obviously full of nervous energy oh yeah then come on ben grabbed his hand and hurried away just as he made out the sound of tiny tim scrabbling toward them from the other direction he increased the pace to a vigorous run the office was barely a hundred yards away he reached it with jason in tow in less than a minute the readout on the belt changed from to just as he pushed through into the trashed reception area now just bloody hurry harry ben crossed to the door leading to the buildings offices and knocked its ben he called he heard the deadbolt being released the door swung open sandys worried face peered out she spotted jason and her eyes widened you found the boy she rushed out and scooped him up in a hug as if he were some sort of life preserver then a voice behind him so whats the big rush harry stumbled into the reception area nobcobi stepped carefully in behind him ben noticed jasons eyes widen with surprise at his first glimpse of the mimiswee ben grabbed harrys shoulder and pulled him forward jasons rigged with explosives we only have a couple minutes before it blows i need you to defuse it what the hell harry said crossing to jason let me see at bens words sandy had released jason as if he carried the plague and backed away into the hallway jason pointed to the belt but kept looking over harrys shoulder at nobcobi as harry knelt down beside him the number glowed red gingerly harry fingered the device having jason spin around so he could examine the entire belt hmmm was all he said well ben asked ive seen this work before all readymade the triggering device is housed in this little tin box even if we had time and tools i cant get to it without significant risk without the code this baby is gonna blow goddamn it ben blurted then were screwed harry shrugged and reached up for the clasp of the belt triggering an alarmed dont from jason harry ignored him and yanked it open the belt merely parted and fell free from his waist harry stood up holding the belt away from him as if it were some snake jason tumbled away it was supposed to explode if you took it off who told you that harry asked khalid he was lying theres no circuit around the belt jason stood there trembling then i i could have taken that off anytime ben noticed the boy seemed more disturbed by this fact than by the fact that he had been about to be blown up harry nodded yep now if you dont mindhe pointed at the number glowing on the beltthis things still going to explode ben snatched the belt from harry everyone to the back of the building im gonna toss this baby as far as i can then run like hell harry herded everyone into the hall as ben headed for the door from behind him harry called dont throw like a girl theres a shitload of plastic hooked to that belt just get everyone to the far side of the building ben dashed out the door he sprinted several feet away from the building to get a clear path to lob the belt as he raised his arm the beast pounced at him from a mere ten feet away the wounded crakan leaped in front of him head low hissing with cold menace it blocked the entire way forward ben scrambled for his pistol but his hand came back empty he had left the gun in the building ben backed up a few steps tiny tim opened its jaws wide and howled at him in triumph fuck you ben whipped the belt toward the open maw then spun on his heel and ran for the safety of the building he risked a glance over his shoulder and saw the beast paw at its mouth trying to dislodge the belt bastard you just bit off more than you can chew ben flew through the demolished front door and dived for the hallway just as he reached the threshold the explosion ripped the world apart behind him the force of the explosion grabbed him and threw him down the hall he did his best to roll when he hit but something snapped as he collided with the hallway floor debris rained upon him as he lay sprawled in the hallway a choking smoke quickly followed jason appeared at his side ben are you okay in answer he just groaned harry knelt down let me take a look at him ben pushed to his hands and knees coughing smoke from his throat pain flared at the base of his neck his shoulder felt dislocated but hed live ben glanced up to jasons concerned face when we get out of this im buying you a pair of suspenders no more belts when the explosion occurred khalid saw lindas spirit die it was in her eyes she had been fumbling with the last timer obviously trying not to look at her watch constantly as jasons time ran low in her hurry she had crossed two wires wrong and almost mistakenly activated the detonator he had been correcting her mistake when the explosion roared from across the base as the echo faded around them linda just looked at khalid there just wasnt enough time khalid said though truthfully hed never intended to rescue the boy khalid studied her expecting her to rage against him to cry and scream but no she just stared at him a cold deadness in her eyes a woman who had given up good he didnt need her to fall apart on him now she was learning expediency the desert sun burned those who moved slowly he shook his head lets finish up here she turned and stared across the base to the cloud of smoke from the explosion it didnt work she said dully he put down the tiny screwdriver what she pointed her arm leaden the column jason was tied to its still intact he straightened up and stared she was right it seemed totally undamaged how was that possible he studied the drifting smoke something was wrong the explosion had occurred slightly west of the column the boy must have gotten free of the ropes moved away from the column his words seemed to ignite a moment of hope in her bearing but then she sagged seeming to realize that free of the column or not the explosion had occurred lets go khalid ordered she didnt argue as she was led away thirtyfive ben sat on the leather sofa in blakelys office nursing his aching shoulder he needed to keep moving this sitting around was making his shoulder throb harry had painfully yanked it back in place earlier jason sat next to him now kicking the sofa with his heel still tense the boy had been through a hell of a lot he had finally related the events that led to bens discovery of him sandy sat on a chair behind blakelys desk twirling a strand of hair between her fingers dark circles were etched beneath her eyes poor dr blakely she mumbled ben nodded he regretted all the foul thoughts he had harbored for the leader of this bloody mission he didnt deserve to die like that harry finally reappeared at the office door ive got everything ready ben lets get movin it was about time moambas message of danger still burned fiercely in bens mind this waiting was agonizing but harry had insisted that ben rest for a few minutes while he organized a quicker way for ben to get back to ashley pushing off the sofa ben felt a twinge of protest from his shoulder show me what youre talking about ben said wincing its just outside the office cmon harry led the way after telling jason to stay put ben followed harry down the scorched hall the entrance was demolished the door hanging askew on its hinges harry waved to the two mimiswee hunters who had led the crakan on a wild goose chase they had returned not even looking tired from the hours of catandmousing harry patted his fellow hunters on the shoulders then proceeded outside ill leave with the boy just as soon as you take off harry said well take the elevator to safety but you need to hurry i know watch your back though and protect that boy theres still a madman setting other bombs around here and i dont want jason falling within his clutches again ben saw the shallow crater from the explosion for the first time almost two yards in diameter the surface rock looked burned he noticed there was no carcass of tiny tim ben smiled grimly the beast had probably been blown to tiny pieces he turned to harry now what are you hiding up your sleeve harry wore a shiteating grin come see harry led the way to the side of the building he pointed proudly my masterpiece leaning on the wall was a black motorcycle trimmed in chrome ben whistled in appreciation i retrieved it from my dormitory after reconnoitering the area figured it would be a quick way back to the wormhole this baby will outrace any damned crakan bloody grand idea ben patted the seat is it gassed and ready yep then lets get the show on the road i dont know where that damned khalid is or what hes planning next but i dont think we should wait what about the woman hes holding hostage the biologist harry asked should we look for her ben closed his eyes and clenched his fists he pictured lindas nervous smile he hated his next words no he said his voice strained its too risky for all we know she may be dead already just get that boy to the elevator and out of here harry nodded then lets move within minutes harry had everything ready ben straddled the bike a pilfered rifle strapped under his left thigh his backpack was cleared of everything but the paperwrapped statue of ohna one of the mimiswee huntersben couldnt remember his namereluctantly climbed behind him on the bike sighing ben called to harry and pointed to the tiny hunter i can return the statue on my own its not safe to travel alone theres sure to be other pods now go jason stood by the side of the bike obviously nervous about seeing ben leave ben winked at him ill be back and itll be your mom on the back of this hog the next time you see me this generated a small smile but his eyes still had a worried look to them be careful ben always ben engaged the throttle and the bike roared raising an involuntary smile to his lips the smile turned to a grimace as the grip of his passenger tightened to the point of cutting off circulation to his lower half ben patted the squeezing arm easy there buddy the grip loosened but only slightly with a final wave ben slipped the bike forward proceeding at a moderate pace there was too much scattered debris to proceed faster than a man could run but after a few minutes getting accustomed to the cycles handling he increased his speed a wide grin on his face he flew past a field of flattened tents heading east to detour around the chasm since the bridge was out he tried his best to ignore some of the human debris on the path like roadkill he thought dourly his smile faded to a grim line thankfully within a few minutes he had cleared the base and sped toward the north wall he breathed deeply the cleaner air appreciating the abating stench of smoke and rotting flesh as he raced toward the distant dwellings following the rough manmade track he searched for any sign of the crakan ahead nothing but he was well aware that the darkness beyond his headlamp could hold herds of those monsters he held his breath as he sped along his palms sweaty on the bikes handles he kept searching straining to pierce the black curtain around the bike something howled from a distance away but otherwise no sign of the beasts ever appeared thankfully he reached the north wall without encountering a single crakan almost too easy he cut the engine the small hunter was off the bike in a heartbeat backing away as if from some foul creature using his flashlight ben grabbed his rifle and followed his agile partner up the levels of dwellings to ohnas chamber the little hunter was first to the chamber practically flying into its security ben followed close behind as he reached the entrance to the dwelling the hunter just steps ahead of him suddenly fell back into bens arms what the hell the hilt of a dagger protruded from his small chest the hunter stiffened in his arms then jerked into a violent convulsion ben couldnt hold him any longer and dropped him to the ground poison ben flashed his light forward two hunched mimiswee tribesmen stood before him thick with muscle and damned familiar the silaris the poisoned ones ben backed a step away from the threshold giving himself room to raise his rifle just as he shouldered the weapon something slammed into the back of his head he collapsed to his knees a spray of lights dancing across his vision he fell forward across the entryway his rifle falling from limp fingers pain squeezed his vision to a tiny dot but it was enough to see the scrawny physique of sinjari step over him he wiped bens blood from his staff leaned over and stared into bens eyes he smiled in triumph as bens world faded to black im telling you ashley said pacing the dimensions of the cell that damned sinjari meant for everything to happen the way it did he plotted the whole thing michaelson studied the guards at the threshold to their prison cell from the way those guys keep eyeballing us i dont think theyre gonna be in any mood to listen to reason even if we could speak their tongue ashley glanced over to the four mimiswee guards you know what the worst thing about this situation is its that these people will always view us as murderers and im to blame ive been an anthropologist for close to a decade and this is how i handle first contact with a new tribe ashley quit kicking yourself the situations extraordinary and it was sinjari that screwed it up not you ashley spoke between gritted teeth if only there was some damned way to correct it if we could the sudden prattling of the guards interrupted ashleys words she took a step forward to see who the guards were addressing and recognized the scarred face of trugula the leader of the hunters and a good friend of moambas this didnt bode well trugula snapped at the guards his fellow hunters they moved aside for their elder he stalked into the chamber his knuckles white on his staff stopping in front of ashley he just stared at her his eyes wounded he seemed to be weighing her judging her ashley knew she should not waste this moment maybe trugula would listen she turned to michaelson and grabbed his shoulders what the michaelson began hush she said to him im gonna try to make him understand this may be our last chance to win an ally she turned michaelson so he faced her then she craned her head toward trugula she pointed to the major moamba she again grabbed michaelsons shoulders and repeated moamba then she took a step back and pointed to herself sinjari she pantomimed his mincing gait and pointed to herself again sinjari trugula just stared blankly at her ashley rolled her eyes but proceeded to imitate sinjari stepping in front of michaelson she pretended to remove a knife from an imaginary scabbard then pantomimed plunging the knife into michaelsons chest twice then she stepped back and fingered her chest sinjari she said fiercely trugulas eyes narrowed his wounded face tightening with rage ashley stepped away did he understand if he did did he believe her she had just accused one of his fellow elders sinjari trugula hissed sinjari he stepped toward ashley she resisted the urge to step away knowing instinctively that she needed to stand her ground to proclaim the truth she stared him in the eyes never flinching as he stopped toetotoe with her he stared for what seemed like several minutes then spoke obviously struggling with his words he pointed to his head moamba wise he grabbed ashleys shoulder moamba trust you she nodded encouraging him harrys obviously been working with him michaelson mumbled the leader of the hunters turned to the major blood brother he clenched his arms around his chest trust he then turned back to ashley trugula trugula trust you did she hear right understand correctly he believed her in her relief she reached over and hugged trugula tears coming to her eyes trugula broke free of her embrace dan ger here go now trugula tried to tug her toward the entrance wait she resisted pulling her arm free of his grip if you trust us then you could tell the others theres no need to run he just stared back at her in confusion he didnt understand he glanced at the doorway then back at her he sighed in frustration trugula trust you he waved as if to encompass the entire village around them no trust ashley realized he meant to help them escape from here to run from her accusers he didnt believe her innocence would be accepted by his people the villagers were too suspicious of the strangers go now trugula repeated ashley stood still no michaelson stepped next to her i think wed better accept his help if i run itll be as good as admitting my guilt i cant leave these people thinking were just coldblooded murderers but ashley the risk she shook her head you mentioned a plan earlier a way to prove my innocence i thought it was a pipe dream but with trugulas help it might work might those are long odds when youre gambling with all our lives she stared him in the eyes i have to try lindas legs felt heavy she stumbled after khalid on autopilot one leg following the other she stared at khalids back as he weaved his way toward the distant elevator she knew she should hate him despise him but she was numb she had failed jason she had promised him shed be back she pictured his eyes as she bound him to the column he had known he was going to die somehow she should have been able to stop it but her fear had broken her fear of khalid fear of death through her own inaction she had sealed his fate a single tear rolled down her cheek fear had always ruled her life whether it was her cloying claustrophobia or some other anxiety fear had been her constant companion finally her crippling weakness had resulted in the death of a boy with jasons death her fear was vanquished now all she had left was her guilt khalid had stopped ahead listen do you hear something linda heard nothing she didnt answer him finding words too difficult to form khalid pointed there linda looked to where he pointed across the length of a football field spotlights still speared the darkness above highlighting the towering elevator shaft something moved up there it was an elevator cage descending toward the floor someone was coming as she watched she could make out rifles and other weapons bristling through the bars of the cage like some armed porcupine reinforcements were arriving khalids eyes narrowed to black slits so damn close just a few more minutes linda allowed a smile to come to her lips enjoying khalids consternation i guess youre not leaving that way khalid glared at her slipped out of his backpack and began rummaging through it he removed a transmitter from his pack it was different from the one that controlled the bombs she had helped set whatre you doing get down he raised the transmitter and pressed the button a green light flashed on the device khalid grabbed her in his arms and leaped behind a partially collapsed building an explosion rocketed from ahead of them blowing debris and smoke their way after the worst of the smoke billowed past them khalid climbed off of her and checked his handiwork she followed to see what he had done a smoldering crater now existed where the supports for the elevator had stood she stared up only one spotlight was still intact illuminating the ghastly scene in slow motion she saw the remainder of the tower start to collapse the cage hurtled toward the cavern floor uncontrolled even with her ears echoing with the blast she could hear the screaming she swung back behind the damaged wall closing her eyes for what seemed like years she waited then she heard it the booming crash as the cage hit the floor she listened the screaming had stopped khalid stepped next to her he lit a cigarette his hand trembling slightly im glad i set those explosives the night before the team set out i knew from the start this mission might end this way but i thought with planning he shrugged what are we going to do now we cant leave he puffed a cloud of smoke toward the distant roof i must try to contact my superiors apprise them of the situation we can try blakelys communications center see if i can raise anyone then what he shrugged then we die thirtysix that bloody sinjari it all came back in a flood ben pushed himself up wincing the back of his head throbbed with every movement the echoes of the explosion that jarred him back to consciousness still reverberated across the cavern groaning ben stood shakily he peered back toward the distant glowing base what happened but he knew the answer khalid should he head back to the base harry and the others could be in trouble fingering the tender spot at the back of his head he glanced at his watch time was running out he had been knocked out for almost an hour he needed to get to ashley free her first though he had to know what was going on he sat on the floor of the cave and closed his eyes letting his mind drift he pictured nobcobi and called to him the answer was almost immediate nobcobis image coalesced out of the darkness his facial whiskers were burned what happened ben said is jason okay nobcobi nodded out of breath cage thing destroyed harry and my brother went to look for your enemy to try to stop him i took the boy and woman to the office place theyre safe ill guard them harry says you must hurry i know bring help ben broke contact and pushed to his feet he needed to get that statue back before bloody hell he realized something was missing his rifle still lay on the floor where he had dropped it he patted his back and searched the tiny chamber his pack was gone and so was the statue it contained sinjari the bastard hadnt finished him off because hed found what he needed to thwart the mission without the statue ashley would die sneaky little bugger ben stared around the chamber his eye settling on the aluminum transport sled with the diamond axle he grabbed a knife from his belt and sliced the train of plastic sleds still attached to the gaspowered sled maybe ashley could tell trugula was perturbed by her demands but he had finally acquiesced and agreed to bring her and michaelson to umbos chamber to reach the chamber trugula had to elbow the other hunters out of his way several of whom gave their leader a look as if he had gone mad he managed through bullying and what sounded like threats to gain them access michaelson paced the room eyeing the male statue of umbo with a mild look of distaste on his features its only a guess he said i dont like that youre putting your life in jeopardy based on my supposition your reasonings sound sinjari will surely try to make it back to the village through here we just need to wait for him confront him what if hes already back she sighed i dont think he is he wouldve made himself known his voice would be raised loudly against us by now ashley glanced around the small chamber it seemed crowded with the six mimiswee guards and trugula other hunters guarded the way here but eventually word would spread and others would come and investigate she just hoped they could capture sinjari before a circus erupted a crowd could get ugly before she could prove her innocence as if confirming her thoughts a commotion could be heard brewing out in the tunnel voices were raised suddenly an explosion of bodies burst into the chamber several figures still wrestling rolled into the room michaelson yanked her behind him even trugula stepped in front of her blocking the way to her she watched as the hunters tangled with other puglike mimiswee but the few hunters were quickly overwhelmed by the score of attackers and to make matters worse a single jab by an attackers spear or dagger sent the mildly injured into convulsions soon only she michaelson and trugula were still standing at least ten of the short muscular attackers surrounded them silaris trugula said and spat in their direction the offenders made no move toward them seeming nervous about attacking one of the elders a noise behind them drew everyones attention to the wormhole as she watched sinjari slipped out of the tunnel followed by two ugly mimiswee ashley recognized them as the two who were with sinjari before she also recognized the resemblance between them and the attackers blocking the exit they were sinjaris men his clan sinjari smiled showing all his teeth he didnt have to say a word he just fingered a dagger and stepped toward ashley groaning ashley realized shed led them all into a trap ben willed harrys sled to faster speeds the rock walls a blur around him going downhill with the throttle fully open had increased the speed to fifty miles an hour on turns he banked to the ceiling he squinted forward needing to pay close attention ready to brake as soon as he saw the exit to fly out of the wormhole at this speed was certain death he shifted the rifle from under his hip where it chafed cmon the exit shouldnt be too far ahead he thought maybe if he concentrated used his herihuti powers hed get an inkling of how far he had to go he relaxed his eyes and willed his heart to slow even before hed achieved the proper state someone reached him someone was calling to him an image coalesced in front of him superimposed over the sight ahead like some wispy ghost a scarred face trugula the figure blinked a few times then spoke hurry i know i got that message already ben said then see with my eyes for just a few seconds the tunnel vanished and he was in umbos chamber he saw gasping his heart clenched and the link shattered ben prayed for more speed rage fueling him forward michaelson tried to block sinjaris approach toward ashley but a quick flip of the elders wrist had five of the silaris dragging him back ashley glanced over to trugula he struggled futilely in the clutches of two of the silaris no aid there either sinjari stepped toward her he no help he weak ashley was flabbergasted at his words you speak english he nodded i learn my enemy best way he scrunched his brows together pondering his next words to know them she offered he smiled at her as if she were a small child no to kill them raising the dagger to her chin he leered at her poison that right word he motioned toward the dead hunters she nodded he pricked his own finger then waved as if it were nothing i lead silaris poison not kill us we strong we lead what about borada i thought he was your leader borada he made a foul sound with his mouth no smart i lead borada ashley realized that this coup had been in the works long before her team appeared their arrival had almost screwed up sinjaris plan but hed turned it to his own ends now i lead i say kill all you and any others come here ashley shook her head you wont win this trugulas hunters wont allow it a sly look came to his eyes he pointed to trugula bad he help you others kill moamba he then tapped his chest with the dagger i find out he slashed the dagger through the air i stop so trugula was going to be pinned as an accessory to the crime a coconspirator dead men tell no tales she glanced at him but his eyes were half closed sinjari noticed it too he poked the wounded hunter with a finger getting his attention they spoke back and forth for a few minutes angry words finally sinjari turned his back on him and faced ashley again he pointed a thumb toward trugula no smart he call help but nobody there moamba dead he sneered at her now you he raised the poisoned dagger and stepped toward her she tried to back away but was blocked by the silaris behind her just as sinjari grabbed ashleys throat with a bony hand a noise erupted from the wormhole sinjari twisted his neck around to look ashley jumped as the transport sled blasted out of the wormhole and flew across the chamber colliding into several of the silaris knocking them off their feet the distraction was enough to allow ben to crawl from the wormhole he was standing before anyone was even aware he had appeared he raised the rifle to his shoulder and pointed it at sinjari mate i suggest you let the lady go sinjari hissed at him and plunged the dagger toward her chest ben fired ashley saw the left side of sinjaris head fly away his body stood there for half a second dagger still poised then crumpled to the floor a couple silaris rushed toward ben he swung his rifle and in two shots two bodies lay on the floor any others suddenly from behind the group of silaris as if by magic a troop of hunters appeared bristling with long spears meet a few of my friends ben said with a smile i placed a quick call before arriving this bloody herihuti means of communication could put the phone company out of business the silaris without their leader put up little fight and were roughly herded away ashley rushed over to ben and wrapped him in her arms youre okay i didnt know didnt know what sinjari had done up there she squeezed him and muffled against his chest said the words she had held so long in her chest i love you ay what was that he said pulling back to look her square in the face i i love you he slipped back into her embrace oh that i knew you did i was just wondering when youd figure it out shut up she reached up and kissed him ben then moved his lips to her ear you know theres someone up top whos waiting for a big hug and kiss too she pulled back from him her hands clenched on his shoulders do you mean he nodded jasons fine just a bit shook up like the rest of us tears blurred her vision as ben smiled down at her he then pulled her into a tight embrace in his arms she felt the strength of family shed never experienced before still in his arms ashley watched borada stalk into the chamber confusion evident on his features crossing to the scarred figure he spoke heatedly to trugula who answered with repeated gestures boradas eyes grew wide i leave you for a second ben whispered and see how much trouble you get into once trugula finished the leader stared with disgust at sinjaris body then turned to ashley and ben he bent his head solemnly in their direction as apology or thanks she wasnt sure ben broke free of her embrace i forgot he crossed to sinjaris body and fingered open the pouch on the dead mans belt he reached inside and pulled out the diamond statue ohna ben held the figure up for all to see then crossed over and placed the female statue on the pedestal next to the male figure they make a nice couple dont you think thirtyseven jason sat on a soiled chair in the demolished reception room of blakelys office he had his cracked nintendo game boy in his lap and was trying to tape it together harry and his companion creatures were outside somewhere patrolling keeping an eye on things ever since the explosion of the elevator harry wanted the area watched closely jason knew he was supposed to stay with sandy back in blakelys office but she was giving him the creeps all she did was stare off into space fiddling with her hair she didnt even say a word when he got up he thought about how ben had saved him and hoped desperately that he would return soon with his mom then a soft scritchscritching noise from outside froze him in the chair it was probably harry or one of the others wasnt it the noise came again it sounded like a bunch of boards was being shifted around he quietly stood up and took a step toward the hallway toward safety when he heard the noise once more his curiosity got the better of him he took a step toward the decimated entrance to the building hed just take a peek it might be important or nothing at all holding his breath to avoid any detection of his position he snuck around an overturned desk to get a clear view out the building he stared waiting for the sound to repeat so he could tell where it was coming from afraid even to blink in case he should miss something nothing was out there besides the crater from the explosion and piles of debris strewn around the edge by the blast nothing moved he started to straighten from where he crouched probably just then he heard and saw it at the same time a muzzle protruding from under a pile of tumbled lumber and bricks about twenty yards away it was easy to miss camouflaged well with the black rock and scorched debris if it hadnt moved hed have overlooked it it moved again shifting the debris until a black eye swung clear it seemed to be staring straight at him jason knew it was the beast whod been sniffing him when he was tied up the one ben called tiny tim jason froze afraid to draw its attention further he watched as it dropped its head back to the floor obviously still dazed groggy recovering from the explosion jason needed to warn someone that it had survived then a new sound intruded a voice a familiar voice female crying he watched as linda ran into view her eyes glued to the crater her face was smudged her hair in stringy tangles tears swelled in her eyes khalid stepped into view behind her smoking a cigarette its done he heard khalid say the boys gone linda stumbled to the craters far edge and began walking around it jason realized she was going to cross within a yard of the buried monster jason dashed from the building and ran to the craters edge he called across the hole to her linda get back run linda jumped at the sight of him her hands fluttering around her cheeks like scared birds jason his words and sudden appearance seemed to shock her her foot slipped and she tripped into the crater watch out with a roar the beast reacted erupting from the pile of debris like some bloody jackinthebox it reared up a white bone protruded from its side where its arm had been its entire flank was charred it lunged at linda who cowered on the crater floor no jason screamed khalid reacted first in panic firing madly at the beast the beast swung toward khalid drawn by the noise of the gun yelling khalid pawed at his pocket his eyes so wide they bulged he barely seemed to react when the monster snatched him up only a weak groan escaped his lips as he was yanked upward his waist trapped in the beasts jaws the mans weight however proved too much for the beast in its weakened state it collapsed back into the pile of debris with a crash still clutching khalid in its jaws linda scuttled on her hands and knees to the far side of the crater her face a mask of horror as the beast crept away dragging the egyptian with it khalid thrashed in its teeth his arms still free he had the pistol in his hand but wasnt using it instead he was trying to free something from his pocket with a fierce yank and a yell of triumph blood flowing from his lips he pulled his hand free jason recognized the object khalid had showed it to him before a radio transmitter for setting off bombs linda spotted it too dont she screamed khalid smiled painfully blood flowed freely from his lips he raised his hand no linda screamed before khalid could press the detonator the monster spasmed jarring khalid and knocking the transmitter from his hands it bounced a few feet away khalid scrabbled for the device it was just out of reach jason watched as the creature weakening went limp khalids eyes squinted in agony as he struggled to inch himself from the clenched jaws and reach the transmitter his fingers brushed the edge of the device on his second attempt jason did not wait he dashed forward linda called get back he ignored her and snatched the transmitter seconds before khalids hand reached the same spot khalid swore at him bloody spittle flying from his mouth jason danced back give it to me boy no jason backed another step away out of khalids reach then die khalid raised his other hand the pistol still in his grip almost pointblank range the last thing jason saw was the flash of muzzle fire ashley stood and stretched her legs in ohnas chamber she gave harrys aluminum transport a kick with her toe four hours riding piggyback on top of ben from the mimiswee village she worked a kink out of her lower back with a knuckle damn cmon ben called from outside its clear lets go ashley crawled from the tiny chamber into alpha cavern she had wondered if she would ever see this place again bonetired she smiled finally however when she spotted the means of transport from here her smile sank a motorcycle ashley clambered down the cliff to ben i have to hand it to harry he said he builds mean machines she nodded climbing behind ben on the cycle it was unfortunate that harrys brother dennis had to be left back with the mimiswee but his injured ankle compromised their speed he was coming up with the band of mimiswee hunters on foot i dont care if we have to get there by mule she said i need to see jason i know its bugging me that i cant reach nobcobi hang on within moments they were racing through darkness toward the distant glow of the base ashley pressed herself against bens back leaning her cheek on his shoulder she hugged him tighter she could almost hear his heartbeat keep an eye out for any of those crakan ben yelled above the engine noise those nasties are creeping all over the cavern you just keep this bike aiming straight toward the base i dont care what gets in the way run over it she watched the surroundings for any flash of movement as they traveled nothing but darkness soon the blackness faded to a dusky twilight as they approached the base as night was beaten back by the camp lights a growing stench filled the air she crinkled her nose my god youll get used to it she prayed she never would when ashley saw the devastation and destruction she closed her eyes how did jason survive this almost there ben shouted suddenly to the right a reptilian head sprang up behind an overturned car its muzzle bloody ben saw it and gunned the bike the cycle shot forward leaving the beast bellowing far behind over there ben said finally pointing she had already recognized it though scarred with burns blakelys office still stood intact ben slowed the bike to a crawl and edged around a corner of the building the sight that came into view stopped ashleys heart cold no she flew off the cycle the hulking carcass of one of the predators lay sprawled just yards from the building khalid lay limp in its jaws his pallor pale his eyes staring blindly upward this was not the sight that had panicked her harry was hunched over a small figure that lay twisted on the rock no she prayed not after so much ben caught up to her pulling her back wait he said she resisted his restraint pushing his arm away she crossed over to harry standing up he moved aside for her ben stood next to her its not jason ash ben said placing a hand on her shoulder thats what i was trying to tell you i knew from your face what you were thinking she stared down at the dead mimiswee hunter a bullet hole in his chest who is it ben knelt down next to the dead man placing his hand on his shoulder no wonder i couldnt reach him its nobcobi ben lifted his eyes to harry what happened with tears threatening harry explained id gone to check for survivors from the elevator explosion the mimiswee were left to guard the building while i was away khalid and linda returned he continued to relate how the crakan attacked and how khalid attempted to blow the place up as a final act before he died the hunters were watching waiting for the best time to intervene when jason grabbed the transmitter khalid tried to kill him but nobcobi knocked the boy to the side and took the bullet instead ashley knelt next to ben he saved my boys life yes harry said jason got a good knock on the head blacked out for a few seconds but hes fine linda took him mom ashley whirled to face the building jason stood in the blasted opening a bandage wrapped over his forehead jason she stood up and ran to him they collapsed into each others arms oh honey im so sorry she hugged him hard to her chest i love you mom she just held him rocking him in her arms ben pointed to the large carcass i thought i had killed that bloody beast apparently it had a hide as thick as yours harry said linda then stepped through the doorway a smile on her face jason saw her and wiggled out of ashleys arms he wiped at his nose and straightened his bandage obviously embarrassed at such a childish display of motherly attention ashley smiled was he already that old harry suddenly called out look he jabbed a finger toward the roof she stood up and joined the others staring at where harry pointed lights pirouetting downward in the feeble glow of a few remaining spotlights ballooning parachutes drifted downward as she watched more and more chutes flared open from the top of the skeletal elevator shaft the chutists each had a halogen light which they waved to and fro as they descended within minutes there seemed to be hundreds of them drifting in all directions to cover the entire base like fireflies on a warm spring night who are they jason asked i believe thats the cavalry coming over the hill harry said ben snorted about bloody time epilogue mount erebus antarctica ben crawled into bed sighing what a day he snuggled next to ashley she moaned in her sleep and rolled onto her side he placed his hand on her belly she was already showing four months along and not a sign that she was ready to cut back on her cultural study of the mimiswee knowing her she would wait until her water broke before finally putting pen and paper down he smiled in the darkness and lay back with an arm propping his head staring at the ceiling alpha base had almost been put back together again the sonic repellents that linda had developed were succeeding in keeping the crakan away her team of biologists had also made another discovery the erosion of the mimiswees ring of protective fungus had not been due to the imbalance of umbo and ohna as moamba had claimed but rather to the introduction of and competition from a modern fungus carried here by humans so sinjari had been right after allhumans were to blame at least indirectly ben let out a rattling sigh and stretched bonetired as herihuti his responsibilities with the tribe seemed endless no wonder moamba had wanted to pass the baton on to him still in memory of the old man he felt an obligation to carry on the position at least until the tiny mimiswee offspring gifted with herihuti blood grew to maturity ben had overseen the hatching of the child another of his duties the child who had been named tushama by moamba before his death was a girl the first female herihuti of the tribe her gender had shocked the community but ben didnt care male or female here was his replacement ben wiggled deeper under the blankets he really shouldnt complain the job did have its perks in his spare time he could explore the vast trails of caverns the hunters who traveled the dark paths showed him sights so wondrous that he sometimes thought he was dreaming even if it was while collecting crakan dung ben closed his eyes morning would come too soon he rolled onto his side and wrapped an arm around ashleys waist as he drifted into slumber something touched his dreams weak and tentative someone calling to him he opened himself up inviting but the contact faded only a passing connection like a warm breeze wafting across a cold cheek then nothing who under his hand he felt the baby move in ashleys belly and ben remembered moambas words blood runs true there are too many folks to thank for the production of this story from pesha rubinstein my literary agent who saw some glimmer in the
