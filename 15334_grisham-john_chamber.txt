ive travelled the world twice over met the famous saints and sinners poets and artists kings and queens old stars and hopeful beginners ive been where noones been before learned secrets from writers and cooks all with one library ticket to the wonderful world of books janice james the chamber by john grisham acknowledgments i was a lawyer once and represented people charged with all sorts of crimes fortunately i never had a client convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death i never had to go to death row never had to do the things the lawyers do in this story since i despise research i did what i normally do when writing a novel i found lawyers with expertise and i befriended them i called them at all hours and picked their brains and it is here that i thank them leonard vincent has been the attorney for the mississippi department of corrections for many years and he opened his office to me he helped me with the law showed me his files took me to death row and toured me around the vast state penitentiary known simply as parchman he told me many stories that somehow found their way into this one leonard and i are still struggling with the perplexities of the death penalty and i suspect we always will thanks also to his staff and to the guards and personnel at parchman jim craig is a man of great compassion and a fine lawyer as the executive director of the mississippi capital defense resource center hes the official attorney for most of the inmates on death row he deftly steered me through the impenetrable maze of post conviction appeals and habeas corpus warfare the inevitable mistakes are mine not his i went to law school with tom freeland and guy gillespie and i thank them for their ready assistance marc smirnoff is a friend and the editor of the oxford american and as usual worked on the manuscript before i sent it to new york thanks also to robert warren and william ballard for their help and as always a very special thanks to my best friend renee who still reads each chapter over my shoulder the decision to bomb the office of the radical jew lawyer was reached with relative ease only three people were involved in the process the first was the man with the money the second was a local operative who knew the territory and the third was a young patriot and zealot with a talent for explosives and an astonishing knack for disappearing without a trail after the bombing he fled the country and hid in northern ireland for six years the lawyers name was marvin kramer a fourthgeneration mississippi jew whose family had prospered as merchants in the delta he lived in an antebellum home in greenville a river town with a small but strong jewish community a pleasant place with a history of little racial discord he practiced law because commerce bored him like most jews of german descent his family had assimilated nicely into the culture of the deep south and viewed themselves as nothing but typical southerners who happened to have a different religion antisemitism rarely surfaced for the most part they blended with the rest of established society and went about their business marvin was different his father sent him up north to brandeis in the late fifties he spent four years there then three years in law school at columbia and when he returned to greenville in the civil rights movement had center stage in mississippi marvin got in the thick of it less than a month after opening his little law office he was arrested along with two of his brandeis classmates for attempting to register black voters his father was furious his family was embarrassed but marvin couldnt have cared less he received his first death threat at the age of twentyfive and started carrying a gun he bought a pistol for his wife a memphis girl and instructed their black maid to keep one in her purse the kramers had twin twoyearold sons the first civil rights lawsuit filed in by the law offices of marvin b kramer and associates there were no associates yet alleged a multitude of discriminatory voting practices by local officials it made headlines around the state and marvin got his picture in the papers he also got his name on a klan list of jews to harass here was a radical jew lawyer with a beard and a bleeding heart educated by jews up north and now marching with and representing negroes in the mississippi delta it would not be tolerated later there were rumors of lawyer kramer using his own money to post bail for freedom riders and civil rights workers he filed lawsuits attacking whitesonly facilities he paid for the reconstruction of a black church bombed by the klan he was actually seen welcoming negroes into his home he made speeches before jewish groups up north and urged them to get involved in the struggle he wrote sweeping letters to newspapers few of which were printed lawyer kramer was marching bravely toward his doom the presence of a nighttime guard patrolling benignly around the flower beds prevented an attack upon the kramer home marvin had been paying the guard for two years he was a former cop and he was heavily armed and the kramers let it be known to all of greenville that they were protected by an expert marksman of course the klan knew about the guard and the klan knew to leave him alone thus the decision was made to bomb marvin kramers office and not his home the actual planning of the operation took very little time and this was principally because so few people were involved in it the man with the money a flamboyant redneck prophet named jeremiah dogan was at the time the imperial wizard for the klan in mississippi his predecessor had been loaded off to prison and jerry dogan was having a wonderful time orchestrating the bombings he was not stupid in fact the fbi later admitted dogan was quite effective as a terrorist because he delegated the dirty work to small autonomous groups of hit men who worked completely independent of one another the fbi had become expert at infiltrating the klan with informants and dogan trusted no one but family and a handful of accomplices he owned the largest used car lot in meridian mississippi and had made plenty of money on all sorts of shady deals he sometimes preached in rural churches the second member of the team was a klansman by the name of sam cayhall from clanton mississippi in ford county three hours north of meridian and an hour south of memphis cayhall was known to the fbi but his connection to dogan was not the fbi considered him to be harmless because he lived in an area of the state with almost no klan activity a few crosses had been burned in ford county recently but no bombings no killings the fbi knew that cayhalls father had been a klansman but on the whole the family appeared to be rather passive dogans recruitment of sam cayhall was a brilliant move the bombing of kramers office began with a phone call on the night of april suspecting with good reason that his phones were tapped jeremiah dogan waited until midnight and drove to a pay phone at a gas station south of meridian he also suspected he was being followed by the fbi and he was correct they watched him but they had no idea where the call was going sam cayhall listened quietly on the other end asked a question or two then hung up he returned to his bed and told his wife nothing she knew better than to ask the next morning he left the house early and drove into the town of clanton he ate his daily breakfast at the coffee shop then placed a call on a pay phone inside the ford county courthouse two days later on april cayhall left clanton at dusk and drove two hours to cleveland mississippi a delta college town an hour from greenville he waited for forty minutes in the parking lot of a busy shopping center but saw no sign of a green pontiac he ate fried chicken in a cheap diner then drove to greenville to scout the law offices of marvin b kramer and associates cayhall had spent a day in greenville two weeks earlier and knew the city fairly well he found kramers office then drove by his stately home then found the synagogue again dogan said the synagogue might be next but first they needed to hit the jew lawyer by eleven cayhall was back in cleveland and the green pontiac was parked not at the shopping center but at a truck stop on highway a secondary site he found the ignition key under the drivers floor mat and took the car for a drive through the rich farm fields of the delta he turned onto a farm road and opened the trunk in a cardboard box covered with newspapers he found fifteen sticks of dynamite three blasting caps and a fuse he drove into town and waited in an allnight cafe at precisely am the third member of the team walked into the crowded truck stop and sat across from sam cayhall his name was rollie wedge a young man of no more than twentytwo but a trusted veteran of the civil rights war he said he was from louisiana now lived somewhere in the mountains where no one could find him and though he never boasted he had told sam cayhall several times that he fully expected to be killed in the struggle for white supremacy his father was a klansman and a demolition contractor and from him rollie had learned how to use explosives sam knew little about rollie wedge and didnt believe much of what he said he never asked dogan where he found the kid they sipped coffee and made small talk for half an hour cayhalls cup shook occasionally from the jitters but rollies was calm and steady his eyes never blinked they had done this together several times now and cayhall marveled at the coolness of one so young he had reported to jeremiah dogan that the kid never got excited not even when they neared their targets and he handled the dynamite wedges car was a rental from the memphis airport he retrieved a small bag from the backseat locked the car and left it at the truck stop the green pontiac with cayhall behind the wheel left cleveland and headed south on highway it was almost am and there was no traffic a few miles south of the village of shaw cayhall turned onto a dark gravel road and stopped rollie instructed him to stay in the car while he inspected the explosives sam did as he was told rollie took his bag with him to the trunk where he inventoried the dynamite the blasting caps and the fuse he left his bag in the trunk closed it and told sam to head to greenville they drove by kramers office for the first time around am the street was deserted and dark and rollie said something to the effect that this would be their easiest job yet too bad we cant bomb his house rollie said softly as they drove by the kramer home yeah too bad sam said nervously but hes got a guard you know yeah i know b ut the guard would be easy yeah i guess but hes got kids in there you know kill em while theyre young rollie said little jew bastards grow up to be big jew bastards cayhall parked the car in an alley behind kramers office he turned off the ignition and both men quietly opened the trunk removed the box and the bag and slid along a row of hedges leading to the rear door sam cayhall jimmied the rear door of the office and they were inside within seconds two weeks earlier sam had presented himself to the receptionist under the ruse of asking for directions then asked to use the rest room in the main hallway between the rest room and what appeared to be kramers office was a narrow closet filled with stacks of old files and other legal rubbish stay by the door and watch the alley wedge whispered coolly and sam did exactly as he was told he preferred to serve as the watchman and avoid handling the explosives rollie quickly sat the box on the floor in the closet and wired the dynamite it was a delicate exercise and sams heart raced each time as he waited his back was always to the explosives just in case something went wrong they were in the office less than five minutes then they were back in the alley strolling nonchalantly to the green pontiac they were becoming invincible it was all so easy they had bombed a real estate office in jackson because the realtor had sold a house to a black couple a jewish realtor they had bombed a small newspaper office because the editor had uttered something neutral on segregation they had demolished a jackson synagogue the largest in the state they drove through the alley in the darkness and as the green pontiac entered a side street its headlights came on in each of the prior bombings wedge had set a fifteenminute fuse one simply lit a match very similar to a firecracker and as part of the exercise the team of bombers enjoyed cruising with the windows down at a point always on the outskirts of town just as the explosion ripped through the target they had heard and felt each of the prior hits at a nice distance as they made their leisurely getaways but tonight would be different sam made a wrong turn somewhere and suddenly they were stopped at a railroad crossing staring at flashing lights as a freighter clicked by in front of them a rather long freight train sam checked his watch more than once rollie said nothing the train passed and sam took another wrong turn they were near the river with a bridge in the distance and the street was lined with rundown houses sam checked his watch again the ground would shake in less than five minutes and he preferred to be easing into the darkness of a lonely highway when that happened rollie fidgeted once as if he was becoming irritated with his driver but he said nothing another turn another new street greenville was not that big a city and if he kept turning sam figured he could work his way back to a familiar street the next wrong turn proved to be the last sam hit the brakes as soon as he realized he had turned the wrong way on a oneway street and when he hit the brakes the engine quit he yanked the gearshift into park and turned the ignition the engine turned perfectly but it just wouldnt start then the smell of gasoline dammit sam said through clenched teeth dammit rollie sat low in his seat and stared through the window dammit its flooded he turned the key again same result dont run the battery down rollie said slowly calmly sam was near panic though he was lost he was reasonably sure they were not far from downtown he breathed deeply and studied the street he glanced at his watch there were no other cars in sight all was quiet it was the perfect setting for a bomb blast he could see the fuse burning along the wooden floor he could feel the jarring of the ground he could hear the roar of ripping wood and sheetrock brick and glass hell sam thought as he tried to calm himself we might get hit with debris youd think dogan would send a decent car he mumbled to himself rollie did not respond just kept his gaze on something outside his window at least fifteen minutes had passed since they had left kramers office and it was time for the fireworks sam wiped rows of sweat from his forehead and once again tried the ignition mercifully the engine started he grinned at rollie who seemed completely indifferent he backed the car a few feet then sped away the first street looked familiar and two blocks later they were on main street what kind of fuse did you use sam finally asked as they turned onto highway less than ten blocks from kramers office rollie shrugged as if it was his business and sam shouldnt ask they slowed as they passed a parked police car then gained speed on the edge of town within minutes greenville was behind them what kind of fuse did you use sam asked again with an edge to his voice i tried something new rollie answered without looking what you wouldnt understand rollie said and sam did a slow burn a timing device he asked a few miles down the road something like that they drove to cleveland in complete silence for a few miles as the lights of greenville slowly disappeared across the flat land sam halfexpected to see a fireball or hear a distant rumble nothing happened wedge even managed to catch a little nap the truck stop cafe was crowded when they arrived as always rollie eased from his seat and closed the passenger door until we meet again he said with a smile through the open window then walked to his rental car sam watched him swagger away and marveled once more at the coolness of rollie wedge it was by now a few minutes after fivethirty and a hint of orange was peeking through the darkness to the east sam pulled the green pontiac onto highway and headed south the horror of the kramer bombing actually began about the time rollie wedge and sam cayhall parted ways in cleveland it started with the alarm clock on a nightstand not far from ruth kramers pillow when it erupted at fivethirty the usual hour ruth knew instantly that she was a very sick woman she had a slight fever a vicious pain in her temples and she was quite nauseous marvin helped her to the bathroom not far away where she stayed for thirty minutes a nasty flu bug had been circulating through greenville for a month and had now found its way into the kramer home the maid woke the twins josh and john now five years old at sixthirty and quickly had them bathed dressed and fed marvin thought it best to take them to nursery school as planned and get them out of the house and he hoped away from the virus he called a doctor friend for a prescription and left the maid twenty dollars to pick up the medication at the pharmacy in an hour he said goodbye to ruth who was lying on the floor of the bathroom with a pillow under her head and an icepack over her face and left the house with the boys not all of his practice was devoted to civil rights litigation there was not enough of that to survive on in mississippi in he handled a few criminal cases and other generic civil matters divorces zoning bankruptcy real estate and despite the fact that his father barely spoke to him and the rest of the kramers barely uttered his name marvin spent a third of his time at the office working on family business on this particular morning he was scheduled to appear in court at am to argue a motion in a lawsuit involving his uncles real estate the twins loved his law office they were not due at nursery school until eight so marvin could work a little before delivering the boys and heading on to court this happened perhaps once a month in fact hardly a day passed without one of the twins begging marvin to take them to his office first and then to nursery school they arrived at the office around seventhirty and once inside the twins went straight for the secretarys desk and the thick stack of typing paper all waiting to be cut and copied and stapled and folded into envelopes the office was a sprawling structure built over time with additions here and there the front door opened into a small foyer where the receptionists desk sat almost under a stairway four chairs for waiting clients hugged the wall magazines were scattered under the chairs to the right and left of the foyer were small offices for lawyers marvin now had three associates working for him a hallway ran directly from the foyer through the center of the downstairs so from the front door the rear of the building could be seen some eighty feet away marvins office was the largest room downstairs and it was the last door on the left next to the cluttered closet just across the hall from the closet was marvins secretarys office her name was helen a shapely young woman marvin had been dreaming about for eighteen months upstairs on the second floor were the cramped offices of another lawyer and two secretaries the third floor had no heat or air conditioning and was used for storage he normally arrived at the office between seventhirty and eight because he enjoyed a quiet hour before the rest of the firm arrived and the phone started ringing as usual he was the first to arrive on friday april he unlocked the front door turned on the light switch and stopped in the foyer he lectured the twins about making a mess on helens desk but they were off down the hallway and didnt hear a word josh already had the scissors and john the stapler by the time marvin stuck his head in for the first time and warned them he smiled to himself then went to his office where he was soon deep in research at about a quarter to eight he would recall later from the hospital marvin climbed the stairs to the third floor to retrieve an old file which he thought at the time had some relevance to the case he was preparing he mumbled something to himself as he bounced up the steps as things evolved the old file saved his life the boys were laughing somewhere down the hall the blast shot upward and horizontally at several thousand feet per second fifteen sticks of dynamite in the center of a wooden framed building will reduce it to splinters and rubble in a matter of seconds it took a full minute for the jagged slivers of wood and other debris to return to earth the ground seemed to shake like a small earthquake and as witnesses would later describe bits of glass sprinkled downtown greenville for what seemed like an eternity josh and john kramer were less than fifteenfeet from the epicenter of the blast and fortunately never knew what hit them they did not suffer their mangled bodies were found under eight feet of rubble by local firemen marvin kramer was thrown first against the ceiling of the third floor then unconscious fell along with the remnants of the roof into the smoking crater in the center of the building he was found twenty minutes later and rushed to the hospital within three hours both legs were amputated at the knees the time of the blast was exactly seven fortysix and this in itself was somewhat fortunate helen marvins secretary was leaving the post office four blocks away and felt the blast another ten minutes and she would have been inside making coffee david lukland a young associate in the law firm lived three blocks away and had just locked his apartment door when he heard and felt the blast another ten minutes and he wouldve been picking through his mail in his secondfloor office a small fire was ignited in the office building next door and though it was quickly contained it added greatly to the excitement the smoke was heavy for a few moments and this sent people scurrying there were two injuries to pedestrians a threefoot section of a twobyfour landed on a sidewalk a hundred yards away bounced once then hit mrs mildred talton square in the face as she stepped away from her parked car and looked in the direction of the explosion she received a broken nose and a nasty laceration but recovered in due course the second injury was very minor but very significant a stranger by the name of sam cayhall was walking slowly toward the kramer office when the ground shook so hard he lost his footing and tripped on a street curb as he struggled to his feet he was hit once in the neck and once in the left cheek by flying glass he ducked behind a tree as shards and pieces rained around him he gaped at the devastation before him then ran away blood dripped from his cheek and puddled on his shirt he was in shock and did not remember much of this later driving the same green pontiac he sped away from downtown and would most likely have made it safely from greenville for the second time had he been thinking and paying attention two cops in a patrol car were speeding into the business district to respond to the bombing call when they met a green pontiac which for some reason refused to move to the shoulder and yield the patrol car had sirens blaring lights flashing horns blowing and cops cursing but the green pontiac just froze in its lane of traffic and wouldnt budge the cops stopped ran to it yanked open the door and found a man with blood all over him handcuffs were slapped around sams wrists he was shoved roughly into the rear seat of the police car and taken to jail the pontiac was impounded the bomb that killed the kramer twins was the crudest of sorts fifteen sticks of dynamite wrapped tightly together with gray duct tape but there was no fuse rollie wedge had used instead a detonating device a timer a cheap windup alarm clock he had removed the minute hand from the clock and drilled a small hole between the numbers seven and eight into the small hole he had inserted a metal pin which when touched by the sweeping hour hand would complete the circuit and detonate the bomb rollie wanted more time than a fifteenminute fuse could provide plus he considered himself an expert and wanted to experiment with new devices perhaps the hour hand was warped a bit perhaps the dial of the clock was not perfectly flat perhaps rollie in his enthusiasm had wound it too tight or not tight enough perhaps the metal pin was not flush with the dial it was after all rollies first effort with a timer or perhaps the timing device worked precisely as planned but whatever the reason or whatever the excuse the bombing campaign of jeremiah dogan and the ku klux klan had now spilled jewish blood in mississippi and for all practical purposes the campaign was over once the bodies were removed the greenville police sealed off the area around the ruins and kept the crowd away within hours the premises were given to an fbi team from jackson and before dark a demolition unit was sifting through the rubble dozens of fbi agents solemnly began the tedious task of picking up every tiny piece examining it showing it to someone else then packing it away to be fitted together on another day an empty cotton warehouse on the edge of town was leased and became the repository for the kramer rubble with time the fbi would confirm what it initially assumed dynamite a timer and a few wires just a basic bomb hooked together by a hack lucky enough not to have killed himself marvin kramer was quickly flown to a fancier hospital in memphis and listed as critical but stable for three days ruth kramer was hospitalized for shock first in greenville then driven in an ambulance to the same hospital in memphis they shared a room mr and mrs kramer and also shared a sufficient quantity of sedatives countless doctors and relatives stood vigil ruth was born and raised in memphis so there were plenty of friends to watch her as the dust was settling around marvins office the neighbors some of them storekeepers and others office clerks swept glass from the sidewalks and whispered to one another as they watched the police and rescue people start the digging a mighty rumor swept downtown greenville that a suspect was already in custody bynoon on the day of the bombing it was common knowledge among the clusters of onlookers that the mans name was sam cayhall from clanton mississippi that he was a member of the klan and that he was somehow injured in the attack one report provided ghastly details of other cayhall bombings with all sorts of gruesome injuries and disfigured corpses all involving poor negroes though another report told of the brilliant heroics of the greenville police in tracking down this madman within seconds of the blast on the news at noon the greenville tv station confirmed what was already known that the two little boys were dead their father was severely injured and that sam cayhall was in custody sam cayhall came within moments of being released on thirty dollars bond by the time he was rushed to the police station he had regained his senses and had apologized sufficiently to the angry cops for not yielding as they wished he was booked on a very minor charge and sent to a holding room to be further processed and released the two arresting officers sped away to inspect the blast a janitor who doubled as the jail medic approached sam with a battered first aid kit and washed the dried blood from his face the bleeding had stopped sam repeated again that hed been in a fight in a bar rough night the medic left and an hour later an assistant jailer appeared in the sliding window of the holding room with more papers the charge was failure to yield to an emergency vehicle the maximum fine was thirty dollars and if sam could post this sum in cash then he would be free to go as soon as the paperwork cleared and the car was released sam paced nervously around the room glancing at his watch softly rubbing the wound to his cheek he would be forced to disappear there was a record of this arrest and it wouldnt be long before these yokels put his name and the bombing together and then well he needed to run away hed leave mississippi maybe team up with rollie wedge and leave for brazil or some place dogan would give them the money hed call dogan as soon as he left greenville his car was sitting at the truck stop in cleveland he would swap vehicles there then head on to memphis and catch a greyhound bus thats what he would do he was an idiot for returning to the scene but he thought if he just kept his cool these clowns would release him half an hour passed before the assistant jailer arrived with another form sam handed him thirty dollars cash and received a receipt he followed the man through a narrow hallway to the front desk of the jail where he was given a summons to appear in greenville municipal court in two weeks wheres the car he asked as he folded the summons theyre bringing it just wait here sam checked his watch and waited for fifteen minutes through a small window in a metal door he watched cars come and go in the parking lot in front of the jail two drunks were dragged to the desk by a husky cop sam fidgeted and waited from somewhere behind him a new voice called slowly mr cayhall he turned and came facetoface with a short man in a badly faded suit a badge was waved under sams nose im detective ivy greenville pd need to ask you a few questions ivy waved at a row of wooden doors along a hallway and sam obediently followed from the moment he first sat across the dirty desk from detective ivy sam cayhall had little to say ivy was in his early forties but gray and heavily wrinkled around the eyes he lit an unfiltered camel offered one to sam then asked how his face got cut sam played with the cigarette but did not light it hed given up smoking years earlier and though he felt the urge to start puffing at this critical moment he just thumped it gently on the table without looking at ivy he said that maybe hed been in a fight ivy sort of grunted with a short smile as if he expected this type of reply and sam knew he was facing a pro he was scared now and his hands began shaking ivy of course noticed all this where was the fight who were you fighting with when did it happen why were you fighting here in greenville when you live three hours away where did you get the car sam said nothing ivy peppered him with questions all unanswerable by sam because the lies would lead to more lies and ivy would have him tied in knots in seconds id like to talk to an attorney sam finally said thats just wonderful sam i think thats exactly what you should do ivy lit another camel and blew thick smoke at the ceiling we had a little bomb blast this morning sam do you know that ivy asked his voice rising slightly in a mocking tone no tragic a local lawyer by the name of kramer got his office blown to bits happened about two hours ago probably the work of kluckers you know we dont have any kluckers around here but mr kramer is a jewish fellow let me guess you know nothing about it right thats right really really sad sam you see mr kramer had two little boys josh and john and as fate would have it they were in the office with their daddy when the bomb went off sam breathed deeply and looked at ivy tell me the rest of it his eyes said and these two little boys twins five years old just cute as can be got blown to bits sam deader than hell sam sam slowly lowered his head until his chin was an inch off his chest he was beaten murder two counts lawyers trials judges juries prison everything hit at once and he closed his eyes their daddy might get lucky hes at the hospital now in surgery the little boys are at the funeral home a real tragedy sam dont suppose you know anything about the bomb do you sam no id like to see a lawyer of course ivy slowly stood and left the room the piece of glass in sams face was extracted by a physician and sent to an fbi lab the report contained no surprises same glass as the front windows of the office building the green pontiac was quickly traced to jeremiah dogan in meridian a fifteenminute fuse was found in the trunk a deliveryman came forward and explained to the police that he had seen the car near mr kramers office around am the fbi made sure the press immediately knew mr sam cayhall was a longtime member of the klan and that he was the prime suspect in several more bombings the case was cracked they felt and they heaped accolades upon the greenville police j edgar hoover himself issued a statement two days after the bombing the kramer twins were laid to rest in a small cemetery at the time jews lived in greenville and with the exception of marvin kramer and six others every one attended the service and they were outnumbered two to one by reporters and photographers from all over the country sam saw the pictures and read the stories in his tiny cell the next morning the assistant jailer larry jack polk was a simpleton who by now was a friend because as he had whispered to sam early on he had cousins who were klansmen and hed always wanted to join but his wife wouldnt stand for it he brought sam fresh coffee and newspapers each morning larry jack had already confessed his admiration for sams bombing skills other than the few bare words needed to keep larry jack manipulated sam said virtually nothing the day after the bombing he had been charged with two counts of capital murder so the gas chamber scenario occupied his thoughts he refused to say a word to ivy and the other police same for the fbi the reporters asked of course but didnt make it past larry jack sam phoned his wife and told her to stay in clanton with the doors locked he sat alone in his cinderblock cell and began a diary if rollie wedge was to be discovered and linked to the bombing then he would have to be found by the cops sam cayhall had taken an oath as a klansman and to him the oath was sacred he would never never squeal on a klansman he fervently hoped jeremiah dogan felt the same about his oath two days after the bombing a shady lawyer with a swirling hairdo named clovis brazelton made his first appearance in greenville he was a secret member of the klan and had become quite notorious around jackson representing all sorts of thugs he wanted to run for governor said his platform would stand for the preservation of the white race that the fbi was satanic that blacks should be protected but not mixed with whites and so on he was sent by jeremiah dogan to defend sam cayhall and more importantly to make sure cayhall kept his mouth shut the fbi was all over dogan because of the green pontiac and he feared an indictment as a coconspirator coconspirators clovis explained to his new client right off the bat are just as guilty as the ones who actually pull the trigger sam listened but said little he had heard of brazelton and did not yet trust him look sam clovis said as if explaining things to a first grader i know who planted the bomb dogan told me if i count correctly that makes four of us me you dogan and wedge now at this point dogan is almost certain that wedge will never be found they havent talked but the kids brilliant and hes probably in another country by now that leaves you and dogan frankly i expect dogan to be charged anytime now but the copsll have a hard time nailing him unless they can prove that yall conspired to blow up the jews office and the only way they can prove this is if you tell them so i take the fall sam asked no you just keep quiet about dogan deny everything well fabricate a story about the car let me worry about that ill get the trial moved to another county maybe up in the hills or some place where they dont have jews get us an allwhite jury and ill hang it up so fast itll make heroes out of both of us just let me handle it you dont think ill be convicted hell no listen sam take my word for it well get us a jury full of patriots your kind of people sam all white all worried about their little children being forced to go to schools with little nigger kids good people sam well pick twelve of em put em in the jury box and explain to em how these stinkin jews have encouraged all this civil rights nonsense trust me sam itll be easy with that clovis leaned across the shaky table patted sam on the arm and said trust me sam ive done it before later that day sam was handcuffed surrounded by greenville city policemen and led to a waiting patrol car between the jail and the car he had his picture taken by a small army of photographers another group of these assertive people were waiting at the courthouse when sam arrived with his entourage he appeared before the municipal judge with his new lawyer the honorable clovis brazelton who waived the preliminary hearing and performed a couple of other quiet and routine legal maneuvers twenty minutes after hed left the jail sam was back clovis promised to return in a few days to start plotting strategy then he wandered outside and performed admirably for the reporters it took a full month for the media frenzy to subside in greenville both sam cayhall and jeremiah dogan were indicted for capital murder on may the local district attorney proclaimed loudly that he would seek the death penalty the name of rollie wedge was never mentioned the police and fbi had no idea he existed clovis now representing both defendants successfully argued for a change of venue and on september the trial began in nettles county two hundred miles from greenville it turned into a circus the klan set up camp on the front lawn of the courthouse and staged noisy rallies almost on the hour they shipped in klansmen from other states even had a list of guest speakers sam cayhall and jeremiah dogan were seized as symbols of white supremacy and their beloved names were called a thousand times by their hooded admirers the press watched and waited the courtroom was filled with reporters and journalists so the less fortunate were forced to wait under the shade trees on the front lawn they watched the klansmen and listened to the speeches and the more they watched and photographed the longer the speeches became inside the courtroom things were going smoothly for cayhall and dogan brazelton worked his magic and seated twelve white patriots as he preferred to call them on the jury then began poking rather significant holes in the prosecutions case most importantly the evidence was circumstantial no one actually saw sam cayhall plant the bomb clovis preached this loudly in his opening statement and it found its mark cayhall was actually employed by dogan whod sent him to greenville on an errand and he just happened to be near the kramer building at a most unfortunate moment clovis almost cried when he thought of those two precious little boys the dynamite fuse in the trunk had probably been left there by its previous owner a mr carson jenkins a dirt contractor from meridian mr carson jenkins testified that he handled dynamite all the time in his line of work and that he evidently had simply left the fuse in the trunk when he sold the car to dogan mr carson jenkins was a sunday school teacher a quiet hardworking saltoftheearth little man who was completely believable he was also a member of the ku klux klan but the fbi didnt know it clovis orchestrated this testimony without a flaw the fact that cayhalls car had been left at the truck stop in cleveland was never discovered by the police or fbi during his first phone call from jail he had instructed his wife to get his son eddie cayhall and drive to cleveland immediately for the car this was a significant piece of luck for the defense but the strongest argument presented by clovis brazelton was simply that no one could prove that his clients conspired to do anything and how in the world can you the jurors of nettles county send these two men to their deaths after four days of trial the jury retired to deliberate clovis guaranteed his clients an acquittal the prosecution was almost certain of one the kluckers smelled victory and increased the tempo on the front lawn there were no acquittals and there were no convictions remarkably two of the jurors boldly dug in their heels and pressed to convict after a day and a half of deliberations the jury reported to the judge that it was hopelessly deadlocked a mistrial was declared and sam cayhall went home for the first time in five months the retrial took place six months later in wilson county another rural area four hours from greenville and a hundred miles from the site of the first trial there were complaints of klan harassment of prospective jurors in the first trial so the judge for reasons that were never made clear changed venue to an area crawling with kluckers and their sympathizers the jury again was allwhite and certainly nonjewish clovis told the same stories with the same punch lines mr carson jenkins told the same lies the prosecution changed strategy a bit to no avail the district attorney dropped the capital charges and pressed for a conviction for murder only no death penalty and the jury could if it so chose find cayhall and dogan guilty of manslaughter a much lighter charge but a conviction nonetheless the second trial had something new marvin kramer sat in a wheelchair by the front row and glared at the jurors for three days ruth had tried to watch the first trial but went home to greenville where she was hospitalized again for emotional problems marvin had been in and out of surgery since the bombing and his doctors would not allow him to watch the show in nettles county for the most part the jurors could not stand to look at him they kept their eyes away from the spectators and for jurors paid remarkable attention to the witnesses however one young lady sharon culpepper mother of twin boys could not help herself she glanced at marvin repeatedly and many times their eyes locked he pleaded with her for justice sharon culpepper was the only one of the twelve who initially voted to convict for two days she was verbally abused and harangued by her peers they called her names and made her cry but she doggedly held on the second trial ended with a jury hung eleven to one the judge declared a mistrial and sent everybody home marvin kramer returned to greenville then to memphis for more surgery clovis brazelton made a spectacle of himself with the press the district attorney made no promises of a new trial sam cayhall went quietly to clanton with a solemn vow to avoid any more dealings with jeremiah dogan and the imperial wizard himself made a triumphant return to meridian where he boasted to his people that the battle for white supremacy had just begun good had defeated evil and on and on the name of rollie wedge had been uttered only once during a lunch break in the second trial dogan whispered to cayhall that a message had been received from the kid the messenger was a stranger who spoke to dogans wife in a hallway outside the courtroom and the message was quite clear and simple wedge was nearby in the woods watching the trial and if dogan or cayhall mentioned his name their homes and families would be bombed to hell and back ruth and marvin kramer separated in he was admitted to a mental hospital later that year and committed suicide in ruth returned to memphis and lived with her parents in spite of their problems they had pressed hard for a third trial in fact the jewish community in greenville was highly agitated and vocal when it became apparent that the district attorney was tired of losing and had lost his enthusiasm for prosecuting cayhall and dogan marvin was buried next to his sons a new park was dedicated to the memory of josh and john kramer and scholarships were established with time the tragedy of their deaths lost some of its horror years passed and greenville talked less and less about the bombing despite pressure from the fbi a third trial did not materialize there was no new evidence the judge would no doubt change venue again a prosecution looked hopeless but still the fbi did not quit with cayhall unwilling and wedge unavailable dogans bombing campaign fizzled he continued to wear his robe and make his speeches and began to fancy himself as a major political force journalists up north were intrigued by his blatant racebaiting and he was always willing to put on his hood and give outrageous interviews he was mildly famous for a brief period and he enjoyed it immensely but by the late s jeremiah dogan was just another thug with a robe in a rapidly declining organization blacks were voting the public schools were desegregated racial barriers were being struck down by federal judges throughout the south civil rights had arrived in mississippi and the klan had proven pitifully inept in keeping negroes where they belonged dogan couldnt draw flies to a crossburning in two significant events occurred in the open but inactive kramer bombing case the first was the election of david mcallister as the district attorney in greenville at twentyseven he became the youngest da in the states history as a teenager he had stood in the crowd and watched the fbi pick through the rubble of marvin kramers office shortly after his election he vowed to bring the terrorists to justice the second event was the indictment of jeremiah dogan for income tax evasion after years of successfully dodging the fbi dogan got sloppy and ran afoul of the irs the investigation took eight months and resulted in an indictment that ran for thirty pages according to it dogan had failed to report over a hundred thousand dollars between and it contained eightysix counts and carried a maximum of twentyeight years in prison dogan was dead guilty and his lawyer not clovis brazelton immediately began exploring the possibility of a plea bargain enter the fbi through a series of heated and angry meetings with dogan and his lawyer a deal was offered by the government whereby dogan would testify against sam cayhall in the kramer case and in return he would serve no time in jail for tax evasion zero days behind bars heavy probation and fines but no jail dogan had not spoken to cayhall in over ten years dogan was not active in the klan anymore there were lots of reasons to consider the deal not the least of which was the issue of remaining a free man or spending a decade or so in prison to prod him along the irs attached all of his assets and planned a nice little fire sale and to help with his decision david mcallister convinced a grand jury in greenville to indict him and his pal cayhall once again for the kramer bombing dogan caved in and jumped at the deal after twelve years of living quietly in ford county sam cayhall once again found himself indicted arrested and facing the certainty of a trial and the possibility of the gas chamber he was forced to mortgage his house and small farm to hire a lawyer clovis brazelton had gone on to bigger things and dogan was no longer an ally much had changed in mississippi since the first two trials blacks had registered to vote in record numbers and these new voters had elected black officials allwhite juries were rare the state had two black trial judges two black sheriffs and black lawyers could be spotted with their white brethren roaming the courthouse hallways officially segregation was over and many white mississippians were beginning to look back and wonder what all the fuss was about why had there been such resistance to basic rights for all people though it had a long way to go mississippi was a far different place in than in and sam cayhall understood this he hired a skilled trial advocate from memphis named benjamin keyes their first tactic was to move to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that it was unfair to try him again after such a delay this proved to be a persuasive argument and it took a decision by the mississippi supreme court to settle the matter by a vote of six to three the court ruled that the prosecution could proceed and proceed it did the third and final trial of sam cayhall began in february of in a chilly little courthouse in lakehead county a hill county in the northeastern corner of the state much could be said about the trial there was a young district attorney david mcallister who performed brilliantly but had the obnoxious habit of spending all his spare time with the press he was handsome and articulate and compassionate and it became very clear that this trial had a purpose mr mcallister had political ambitions on a grand scale there was a jury of eight whites and four blacks there were the glass sample the fuse the fbi reports and all the other photos and exhibits from the first two trials and then there was the testimony of jeremiah dogan who took the stand in a denim workshirt and with a humble countenance solemnly explained to the jury how he conspired with sam cayhall sitting over there to bomb the office of mr kramer sam glared at him intensely and absorbed every word but dogan looked away sams lawyer berated dogan for half a day and forced him to admit that hed cut a deal with the government but the damage was done it was of no benefit to the defense of sam cayhall to raise the issue of rollie wedge because to do so would be to admit that sam in fact had been in greenville with the bomb sam would be forced to admit that he was a coconspirator and under the law he would be just as guilty as the man who planted the dynamite and to present this scenario to the jury sam would be forced to testify something neither he nor his attorney wanted sam could not withstand a rigorous crossexamination because sam would be forced to tell one lie to cover the last and at this point no one would believe a sudden tale of a mysterious new terrorist whod never been mentioned before and who came and went without being seen sam knew the rollie wedge angle was futile and he never mentioned the mans name to his own lawyer at the close of the trial david mcallister stood before the jury in a packed courtroom and presented his closing argument he talked of being a youngster in greenville and having jewish friends he didnt know they were different he knew some of the kramers fine folks who worked hard and gave back to the town he also played with little black kids and learned they made wonderful friends he never understood why they went to one school and he went to another he told a gripping story of feeling the earth shake on the morning of april and running in the direction of downtown where smoke was drifting upward for three hours he stood behind the police barricades and waited he saw the firemen scurry about when they found marvin kramer he saw them huddle in the debris when they found the boys tears dripped down his cheeks when the little bodies covered in white sheets were carried slowly to an ambulance it was a splendid performance and when mcallister finished the courtroom was silent several of the jurors dabbed at their eyes on february sam cayhall was convicted on two counts of capital murder and one count of attempted murder two days later the same jury in the same courtroom returned with a sentencing verdict of death he was transported to the state penitentiary at parchman to begin waiting for his appointment with the gas chamber on february he first set foot on death row the law firm of kravitz bane had almost three hundred lawyers peacefully coexisting under the same roof in chicago two hundred and eightysix to be exact though it was difficult for anyone to keep score because at any given moment there were a dozen or so leaving for a multitude of reasons and there were always two dozen or so shiny fresh new recruits trained and polished and just itching for combat and though it was huge kravitz bane had failed to play the expansion game as quickly as others had failed to gobble up weaker firms in other cities had been slow to raid clients from its competitors and thus had to suffer the distinction of being only the third largest firm in chicago it had offices in six cities but much to the embarrassment of the younger partners there was no london address on the letterhead though it had mellowed some kravitz bane was still known as a vicious litigation firm it had tamer departments for real estate tax and antitrust but its money was made in litigation when the firm recruited it sought the brightest thirdyear students with the highest marks in mock trials and debate it wanted young men a token female here and there who could be instantly trained in the slashandattack style perfected long ago by kravitz bane litigators there was a nice though small unit for plaintiffs personal injury work good stuff from which they took percent and allowed their clients the remainder there was a sizable section for whitecollar criminal defense but the whitecollar defendant needed a sizable net worth to strap on kravitz bane then there were the two largest sections one for commercial litigation and one for insurance defense with the exception of the plaintiffs work and as a percentage of gross it was almost insignificant the firms money was earned by billable hours two hundred bucks per hour for insurance work more if the traffic could stand it three hundred bucks for criminal defense four hundred for a big bank even five hundred dollars an hour for a rich corporate client with lazy inhouse lawyers who were asleep at the wheel kravitz bane printed money by the hour and built a dynasty in chicago its offices were fashionable but not plush they filled the top floors of fittingly the thirdtallest building downtown like most large firms it made so much money it felt obligated to establish a small pro bono section to fulfill its moral responsibility to society it was quite proud of the fact that it had a fulltime pro bono partner an eccentric dogooder named e garner goodman who had a spacious office with two secretaries on the sixtyfirst floor he shared a paralegal with a litigation partner the firms goldembossed brochure made much of the fact that its lawyers were encouraged to pursue pro bono projects the brochure proclaimed that last year kravitz bane lawyers donated almost sixty thousand hours of their precious time to clients who couldnt pay housing project kids death row inmates illegal aliens drug addicts and of course the firm was deeply concerned with the plight of the homeless the brochure even had a photograph of two young lawyers jackets off sleeves rolled up ties loosened about the neck sweat in the armpits eyes filled with compassion as they performed some menial chore in the midst of a group of minority children in what appeared to be an urban landfill lawyers saving society adam hall had one of the brochures in his thin file as he eased slowly along the hallway on floor sixtyone headed in the general direction of the office of e garner goodman he nodded and spoke to another young lawyer one hed never seen before at the firm christmas party name tags were distributed at the door some of the partners barely knew each other some of the associates saw each other once or twice a year he opened a door and entered a small room where a secretary stopped typing and almost smiled he asked for mr goodman and she nodded properly to a row of chairs where he was to wait he was five minutes early for a am appointment as if it mattered this was pro bono now forget the clock forget billable hours forget performance bonuses in defiance of the rest of the firm goodman allowed no clocks on his walls adam flipped through his file he chuckled at the brochure he read again his own little resume college at pepperdine law school at michigan editor of the law review case note on cruel and unusual punishment comments on recent death penalty cases a rather short resume but then he was only twentysix hed been employed at kravitz bane for all of nine months now he read and made notes from two lengthy us supreme court decisions dealing with executions in california he checked his watch and read some more the secretary eventually offered coffee which he politely declined the office of e garner goodman was a stunning study in disorganization it was large but cramped with sagging bookshelves on every wall and stacks of dusty files covering the floor little piles of papers of all sorts and sizes covered the desk in the center of the office refuse rubbish and lost letters covered the rug under the desk if not for the closed wooden blinds the large window could have provided a splendid view of lake michigan but it was obvious mr goodman spent no time at his window he was an old man with a neat gray beard and bushy gray hair his white shirt was painfully starched a green paisley bow tie his trademark was tied precisely under his chin adam entered the room and cautiously weaved around the piles of papers goodman did not stand but offered his hand with a cold greeting adam handed the file to goodman and sat in the only empty chair in the room he waited nervously while the file was studied the beard was gently stroked the bow tie was tinkered with why do you want to do pro bono work goodman mumbled after a long silence he did not look up from the file classical guitar music drifted softly from recessed speakers in the ceiling adam shifted uncomfortably uh different reasons let me guess you want to serve humanity give something back to your community or perhaps you feel guilty because you spend so much time here in this sweatshop billing by the hour that you want to cleanse your soul get your hands dirty do some honest work and help other people goodmans beady blue eyes darted at adam from above the blackframed reading spectacles perched on the tip of his rather pointed nose any of the above not really goodman continued scanning the file so youve been assigned to emmitt wycoff he was reading a letter from wycoff adams supervising partner yes sir hes a fine lawyer i dont particularly care for him but hes got a great criminal mind you know probably one of our top three whitecollar boys pretty abrasive though dont you think hes okay how long have you been under him since i started nine months ago so youve been here for nine months yes sir what do you think of it goodman closed the file and stared at adam he slowly removed the reading glasses and stuck one stem in his mouth i like it so far its challenging of course why did you pick kravitz bane i mean surely with your credentials you couldve gone anywhere why here criminal litigation thats what i want and this firm has a reputation how many offers did you have come on im just being curious several and where were they dc mainly one in denver i didnt interview with new york firms how much money did we offer you adam shifted again goodman was after all a partner surely he knew what the firm was paying new associates sixty or so what are we paying you this amused the old man and he smiled for the first time they pay me four hundred thousand dollars a year to give away their time so they can pat themselves on the back and preach about lawyers and about social responsibility four hundred thousand can you believe it adam had heard the rumors youre not complaining are you no im the luckiest lawyer in town mr hall i get paid a truckload of money for doing work i enjoy and i punch no clock and dont worry about billing its a lawyers dream thats why i still bust my ass sixty hours a week im almost seventy you know the legend around the firm was that goodman as a younger man succumbed to the pressure and almost killed himself with liquor and pills he dried out for a year while his wife took the kids and left him then he convinced the partners he was worth saving he just needed an office where life did not revolve around a clock what kind of work are you doing for emmitt wycoff goodman asked lot of research right now hes defending a bunch of defense contractors and that takes most of my time i argued a motion in court last week adam said this with a touch of pride rookies were usually kept chained to their desks for the first twelve months a real motion goodman asked in awe yes sir in a real courtroom yes sir before a real judge you got it who won judge ruled for the prosecution but it was close i really tied him in knots goodman smiled at this but the game was quickly over he opened the file again wycoff sends along a pretty strong letter of recommendation thats out of character for him he recognizes talent adam said with a smile i assume this is a rather significant request mr hall just what is it you have in mind adam stopped smiling and cleared his throat he was suddenly nervous and decided to recross his legs its uh well its a death penalty case a death penalty case goodman repeated yes sir why im opposed to the death penalty arent we all mr hall ive written books about it ive handled two dozen of these damned things why do you want to get involved ive read your books i just want to help goodman closed the file again and leaned on his desk two pieces of paper slid off and fluttered to the floor youre too young and youre too green you might be surprised look mr hall this is not the same as counseling winos at a soup kitchen this is life and death this is high pressure stuff son its not a lot of fun adam nodded but said nothing his eyes were locked onto goodmans and he refused to blink a phone rang somewhere in the distance but they both ignored it any particular case or do you have a new client for kravitz bane goodman asked the cayhall case adam said slowly goodman shook his head and tugged at the edges of his bow tie sam cayhall just fired us the fifth circuit ruled last week that he does indeed have the right to terminate our representation ive read the opinion i know what the fifth circuit said the man needs a lawyer no he doesnt hell be dead in three months with or without one frankly im relieved to have him out of my life he needs a lawyer adam repeated hes representing himself and hes pretty damned good to be perfectly honest types his own motions and briefs handles his own research i hear hes been giving advice to some of his buddies on death row just the white ones though ive studied his entire file e garner goodman twirled his spectacles slowly and thought about this thats a half a ton of paper whyd you do it im intrigued by the case ive watched it for years read everything about the man you asked me earlier why i chose kravitz bane well the truth is that i wanted to work on the cayhall case and i think this firm has handled it pro bono for what eight years now seven but it seems like twenty mr cayhall is not the most pleasant man to deal with understandable isnt it i mean hes been in solitary for almost ten years dont lecture me about prison life mr hall have you ever seen the inside of a prison no well i have ive been to death row in six states ive been cursed by sam cayhall when he was chained to his chair hes not a nice man hes an incorrigible racist who hates just about everybody and hed hate you if you met him i dont think so youre a lawyer mr hall he hates lawyers worse than he hates blacks and jews hes been facing death for almost ten years and hes convinced hes the victim of a lawyer conspiracy hell he tried to fire us for two years this firm spent in excess of two million dollars in billable time trying to keep him alive and he was more concerned with firing us i lost count of the number of times he refused to meet with us after we traveled all the way to parchman hes crazy mr hall find yourself another project how about abused kids or something no thanks my interest is in death penalty cases and im somewhat obsessed with the story of sam cayhall goodman carefully returned the spectacles to the tip of his nose then slowly swung his feet onto the corner of the desk he folded his hands across the starched shirt why may i ask are you so obsessed with sam cayhall well its a fascinating case dont you think the klan the civil rights movement the bombings the tortured locale the backdrop is such a rich period in american history seems ancient but it was only twentyfive years ago its a riveting story a ceiling fan spun slowly above him a minute passed goodman lowered his feet to the floor and rested on his elbows mr hall i appreciate your interest in pro bono and i assure you theres much to do but you need to find another project this is not a mock trial competition and im not a law student sam cayhall has effectively terminated our services mr hall you dont seem to realize this i want the chance to meet with him for what i think i can convince him to allow me to represent him oh really adam took a deep breath then stood and walked deftly around the stacks of files to the window another deep breath goodman watched and waited i have a secret for you mr goodman no one else knows but emmitt wycoff and i was sort of forced to tell him you must keep it confidential okay im listening do i have your word yes you have my word goodman said slowly biting a stem adam peeked through a slit in the blinds and watched a sailboat on lake michigan he spoke quietly im related to sam cayhall goodman did not flinch i see related how he had a son eddie cayhall and eddie cayhall left mississippi in disgrace after his father was arrested for the bombing he fled to california changed his name and tried to forget his past but he was tormented by his familys legacy he committed suicide shortly after his father was convicted in goodman now sat with his rear on the edge of his chair eddie cayhall was my father goodman hesitated slightly sam cayhall is your grandfather yes i didnt know it until i was almost seventeen my aunt told me after we buried my father wow you promised not to tell of course goodman moved his butt to the edge of his desk and placed his feet in the chair he stared at the blinds does sam know no i was born in ford county mississippi a town called clanton not memphis i was always told i was born in memphis my name then was alan cayhall but i didnt know this until much later i was three years old when we left mississippi and my parents never talked about the place my mother believes that there was no contact between eddie and sam from the day we left until she wrote him in prison and told him his son was dead he did not write back damn damn damn goodman mumbled to himself theres a lot to it mr goodman its a pretty sick family not your fault according to my mother sams father was an active klansman took part in lynchings and all that so i come from pretty weak stock your father was different my father killed himself ill spare you the details but i found his body and i cleaned up the mess before my mother and sister returned home and you were seventeen almost seventeen it was nine years ago after my aunt eddies sister told me the truth i became fascinated with the sordid history of sam cayhall ive spent hours in libraries digging up old newspaper and magazine stories there are quite a lot of materials ive read the transcripts of all three trials ive studied the appellate decisions in law school i began studying this firms representation of sam cayhall you and wallace tyner have done exemplary work im glad you approve ive read hundreds of books and thousands of articles on the eighth amendment and death penalty litigation youve written four books i believe and a number of articles i know im just a rookie but my research is impeccable and you think sam will trust you as his lawyer i dont know but hes my grandfather like it or not and i have to go see him theres been no contact none i was three when we left and i certainly dont remember him ive started a thousand times to write him but it never happened i cant tell you why its understandable nothings understandable mr goodman i do not understand how or why im standing here in this office at this moment i always wanted to be a pilot but i went to law school because i felt a vague calling to help society someone needed me and i suppose i felt that someone was my demented grandfather i had four job offers and i picked this firm because it had the guts to represent him for free you shouldve told someone up front about this before we hired you i know but nobody asked if my grandfather was a client of this firm you shouldve said something they wont fire me will they i doubt it where have you been for the past nine months here working ninety hours a week sleeping on my desk eating in the library cramming for the bar exam you know the usual rookie boot camp you guys designed for us silly isnt it im tough adam opened a slit in the blinds for a better view of the lake goodman watched him why dont you open these blinds adam asked its a great view ive seen it before id kill for a view like this my little cubbyhole is a mile from any window work hard bill even harder and one day this will all be yours not me leaving us mr hall probably eventually but thats another secret okay i plan to hit it hard for a couple of years then move on maybe open my own office one where life does not revolve around a clock i want to do public interest work you know sort of like you so after nine months youre already disillusioned with kravitz bane no but i can see it coming i dont want to spend my career representing wealthy crooks and wayward corporations then youre certainly in the wrong place adam left the window and walked to the edge of the desk he looked down at goodman i am in the wrong place and i want a transfer wycoff will agree to send me to our little office in memphis for the next few months so i can work on the cayhall case sort of a leave of absence with full pay of course anything else thats about it itll work im just a lowly rookie expendable around here no one will miss me hell there are plenty of young cutthroats just eager to work eighteen hours a day and bill twenty goodmans face relaxed and a warm smile appeared he shook his head as if this impressed him you planned this didnt you i mean you picked this firm because it represented sam cayhall and because it has an office in memphis adam nodded without a smile things have worked out i didnt know how or when this moment would arrive but yes i sort of planned it dont ask me what happens next hell be dead in three months if not sooner but i have to do something mr goodman if the firm wont allow me to handle the case then ill probably resign and try it on my own goodman shook his head and jumped to his feet dont do that mr hall well work something out ill need to present this to daniel rosen the managing partner i think hell approve he has a horrible reputation well deserved but i can talk to him hell do it if you and wycoff recommend it wont he of course are you hungry goodman was reaching for his jacket a little lets go out for a sandwich the lunch crowd at the corner deli had not arrived the partner and the rookie took a small table in the front window overlooking the sidewalk traffic was slow and hundreds of pedestrians scurried along just a few feet away the waiter delivered a greasy reuben for goodman and a bowl of chicken soup for adam how many inmates are on death row in mississippi goodman asked fortyeight as of last month twentyfive black twentythree white the last execution was two years ago willie parris sam cayhall will probably be next barring a small miracle goodman chewed quickly on a large bite he wiped his mouth with the paper napkin a large miracle i would say theres not much left to do legally there are the usual assortment of last ditch motions lets save the strategy talks for later i dont suppose youve ever been to parchman no since i learned the truth ive been tempted to return to mississippi but it hasnt happened its a massive farm in the middle of the mississippi delta not too far from greenville ironically something like seventeen thousand acres probably the hottest place in the world it sits on highway just like a little hamlet off to the west lots of buildings and houses the front part is administration and its not enclosed by fencing there are about thirty different camps scattered around the farm all fenced and secured each camp is completely separate some are miles apart you drive past various camps all enclosed by chain link and barbed wire all with hundreds of prisoners hanging around doing nothing they wear different colors depending on their classification it seemed as if they were all young black kids just loitering about some playing basketball some just sitting on the porches of the buildings an occasional white face you drive in your car alone and very slowly down a gravel road past the camps and the barbed wire until you come to a seemingly innocuous little building with a flat roof it has tall fences around it with guards watching from the towers its a fairly modern facility it has an official name of some sort but everyone refers to it simply as the row sounds like a wonderful place i thought it would be a dungeon you know dark and cold with water dripping from above but its just a little flat building out in the middle of a cotton field actually its not as bad as death rows in other states id like to see the row youre not ready to see it its a horrible place filled with depressing people waiting to die i was sixty years old before i saw it and i didnt sleep for a week afterward he took a sip of coffee i cant imagine how youll feel when you go there the row is bad enough when youre representing a complete stranger he is a complete stranger how do you intend to tell him i dont know ill think of something im sure itll just happen goodman shook his head this is bizarre the whole family is bizarre i remember now that sam had two children seems like one is a daughter its been a long time tyner did most of the work you know his daughter is my aunt lee cayhall booth but she tries to forget her maiden name she married into old memphis money her husband owns a bank or two and they tell no one about her father wheres your mother portland she remarried a few years ago and we talk about twice a year dysfunctional would be a mild term howd you afford pepperdine life insurance my father had trouble keeping a job but he was wise enough to carry life insurance the waiting period had expired years before he killed himself sam never talked about his family and his family never talks about him his wife my grandmother died a few years before he was convicted i didnt know this of course most of my genealogical research has been extracted from my mother whos done a great job of forgetting the past i dont know how it works in normal families mr goodman but my family seldom gets together and when two or more of us happen to meet the last thing we discuss is the past there are many dark secrets goodman was nibbling on a chip and listening closely you mentioned a sister yes i have a sister carmen shes twentythree a bright and beautiful girl in graduate school at berkeley she was born in la so she didnt go through the name change like the rest of us we keep in touch she knows yes she knows my aunt lee told me first just after my fathers funeral then typically my mother asked me to tell carmen she was only fourteen at the time shes never expressed any interest in sam cayhall frankly the rest of the family wishes he would quietly just go away theyre about to get their wish but it wont be quietly will it mr goodman no it never is for one brief but terrible moment sam cayhall will be the most talked about man in the country well see the same old footage from the bomb blast and the trials with the klan marching around the courthouses the same old debate about the death penalty will erupt the press will descend upon parchman then theyll kill him and two days later itll all be forgotten happens every time adam stirred his soup and carefully picked out a sliver of chicken he examined it for a second then returned it to the broth he was not hungry goodman finished another chip and touched the corners of his mouth with the napkin i dont suppose mr hall that youre thinking you can keep this quiet i had given it some thought forget it my mother begged me not to do it my sister wouldnt discuss it and my aunt in memphis is rigid with the remote possibility that well all be identified as cayhalls and forever ruined the possibility is not remote when the press finishes with you theyll have old blackandwhites of you sitting on your granddaddys knee itll make great print mr hall just think of it the forgotten grandson charging in at the last moment making a heroic effort to save his wretched old grandfather as the clock ticks down i sort of like it myself not bad really itll bring a lot of attention to our beloved little law firm which brings up another unpleasant issue i dont think so there are no cowards at kravitz bane adam we have survived and prospered in the rough and tumble world of chicago law were known as the meanest bastards in town we have the thickest skins dont worry about the firm so youll agree to it goodman placed his napkin on the table and took another sip of coffee oh its a wonderful idea assuming your gramps will agree to it if you can sign him up or resign him i should say then were back in business youll be the front man we can feed you what you need from up here ill always be in your shadow itll work then theyll kill him and youll never get over it ive watched three of my clients die mr hall including one in mississippi youll never be the same adam nodded and smiled and looked at the pedestrians on the sidewalk goodman continued well be around to support you when they kill him you wont have to bear it alone its not hopeless is it almost well talk strategy later first ill meet with daniel rosen hell probably want a long conference with you second youll have to see sam and have a little reunion so to speak thats the hard part third if he agrees to it then well get to work thanks dont thank me adam i doubt if well be on speaking terms when this is over thanks anyway the meeting was organized quickly e garner goodman made the first phone call and within an hour the necessary participants had been summoned within four hours they were present in a small seldom used conference room next to daniel rosens office it was rosens turf and this disturbed adam more than a little by legend daniel rosen was a monster though two heart attacks had knocked off some of the edge and mellowed him a bit for thirty years he had been a ruthless litigator the meanest nastiest and without a doubt one of the most effective courtroom brawlers in chicago before the heart attacks he was known for his brutal work schedule ninetyhour weeks midnight orgies of work with clerks and paralegals digging and fetching several wives had left him as many as four secretaries at a time labored furiously to keep pace daniel rosen had been the heart and soul of kravitz bane but no longer his doctor restricted him to fifty hours a week in the office and prohibited any trial work now rosen at the age of sixtyfive and getting heavy had been unanimously selected by his beloved colleagues to graze the gentler pastures of law office management he had the responsibility of overseeing the rather cumbersome bureaucracy that ran kravitz bane it was an honor the other partners had explained feebly when they bestowed it upon him so far the honor had been a disaster banished from the battlefield he desperately loved and needed rosen went about the business of managing the firm in a manner very similar to the preparation of an expensive lawsuit he crossexamined secretaries and clerks over the most trivial of matters he confronted other partners and harangued them for hours over vague issues of firm policy confined to the prison of his office he called for young associates to come visit him then picked fights to gauge their mettle under pressure he deliberately took the seat directly across the small conference table from adam and held a thin file as if it possessed a deadly secret e garner goodman sat low in the seat next to adam twiddling his bow tie and scratching his beard when he telephoned rosen with adams request and broke the news of adams lineage rosen had reacted with predictable foolishness emmitt wycoff stood at one end of the room with a matchboxsized cellular phone stuck to his ear he was almost fifty looked much older and lived each day in a fixed state of panic and telephones rosen carefully opened the file in front of adam and removed a yellow legal pad why didnt you tell us about your grandfather when we interviewed you last year he began with clipped words and a fierce stare because you didnt ask me adam answered goodman had advised him the meeting might get rough but he and wycoff would prevail dont be a wise ass rosen growled come on daniel goodman said and rolled his eyes at wycoff who shook his head and glanced at the ceiling you dont think mr hall that you shouldve informed us that you were related to one of our clients certainly you believe we have a right to know this dont you mr hall his mocking tone was one usually reserved for witnesses who were lying and trapped you guys asked me about everything else adam replied very much under control remember the security check the fingerprints there was even talk of a polygraph yes mr hall but you knew things we didnt and your grandfather was a client of this firm when you applied for employment and you damned sure shouldve told us rosens voice was rich and moved high and low with the dramatic flair of a fine actor his eyes never left adam not your typical grandfather adam said quietly hes still your grandfather and you knew he was a client when you applied for a job here then i apologize adam said this firm has thousands of clients all well heeled and paying through the nose for our services i never dreamed one insignificant little pro bono case would cause any grief youre deceitful mr hall you deliberately selected this firm because it at the time represented your grandfather and now suddenly here you are begging for the file it puts us in an awkward position what awkward position emmitt wycoff asked folding the phone and stuffing it in a pocket look daniel were talking about a man on death row he needs a lawyer dammit his own grandson rosen asked who cares if its his own grandson the man has one foot in the grave and he needs a lawyer he fired us remember rosen shot back yeah and he can always rehire us its worth a try lighten up listen emmitt its my job to worry about the image of this firm and the idea of sending one of our new associates down to mississippi to have his ass kicked and his client executed does not appeal to me frankly i think mr hall should be terminated by kravitz bane oh wonderful daniel wycoff said typical hardnose response to a delicate issue then wholl represent cayhall think about him for a moment the man needs a lawyer adam may be his only chance god help him rosen mumbled e garner goodman decided to speak he locked his hands together on the table and glared at rosen the image of this firm do you honestly think were viewed as a bunch of underpaid social workers dedicated to helping people or how about a bunch of nuns working in the projects wycoff added helpfully with a sneer how could this possibly hurt the image of our firm goodman asked the concept of retreat had never entered rosens mind very simple garner we do not send our rookies to death row we may abuse them try to kill them expect them to work twenty hours a day but we do not send them into battle until they are ready you know how dense death penalty litigation is hell you wrote the books how can you expect mr hall here to be effective ill supervise everything he does goodman answered hes really quite good wycoff added again hes memorized the entire file you know daniel itll work goodman said trust me daniel ive been through enough of these things ill keep my finger on it and ill set aside a few hours to help wycoff added ill even fly down if necessary goodman jerked and stared at wycoff you pro bono sure i have a conscience adam ignored the banter and stared at daniel rosen go ahead and fire me he wanted to say go ahead mr rosen terminate me so i can go bury my grandfather then get on with the rest of my life and if hes executed rosen asked in the direction of goodman weve lost them before daniel you know that three since ive run pro bono what are his chances quite slim right now hes holding on by virtue of a stay granted by the fifth circuit the stay should be lifted any day now and a new execution date will be set probably late summer not long then right weve handled his appeals for seven years and theyve run their course of all the people on death row howd we come to represent this asshole rosen demanded its a very long story and at this moment its completely irrelevant rosen made what appeared to be serious notes on his legal pad you dont think for a moment youll keep this quiet do you maybe maybe hell just before they kill him theyll make him a celebrity the media will surround him like a pack of wolves youll be discovered mr hall so so itll make great copy mr hall cant you see the headlines longlost grandson returns to save gramps knock it off daniel goodman said but he continued the press will eat it up dont you see mr hall theyll expose you and talk about how crazy your family is but we love the press dont we mr rosen adam asked coolly were trial lawyers arent we supposed to perform for the cameras youve never a very good point goodman interrupted daniel perhaps you shouldnt advise this young man to ignore the press we can tell stories about some of your stunts yes please daniel lecture the kid about everything else but lay off the media crap wycoff said with a nasty grin you wrote the book for a brief moment rosen appeared to be embarrassed adam watched him closely i rather like the scenario myself goodman said twirling his bow tie and studying the bookshelves behind rosen theres a lot to be said for it actually could be great for us poor little pro bono folks think of it this young lawyer down there fighting like crazy to save a rather famous death row killer and hes our lawyer kravitz bane sure therell be a ton of press but what will it hurt its a wonderful idea if you ask me wycoff added just as his miniphone buzzed somewhere deep in a pocket he stuck it to his jaw and turned away from the meeting what if he dies dont we look bad rosen asked goodman hes supposed to die okay thats why hes on death row goodman explained wycoff stopped his mumbling and slid the phone into a pocket i gotta go he said moving toward the door nervous now in a hurry where are we i still dont like it rosen said daniel daniel always a hard ass wycoff said as he stopped at the end of the table and leaned on it with both hands you know its a good idea youre just pissed because he didnt tell us up front thats true he deceived us and now hes using us adam took a deep breath and shook his head get a grip daniel his interview was a year ago in the past its gone man forget about it we have more pressing matters at hand hes bright he works very hard smooth on his feet meticulous research were lucky to have him so his familys messed up surely were not going to terminate every lawyer here with a dysfunctional family wycoff grinned at adam plus all the secretaries think hes cute i say we send him south for a few months then get him back here as soon as possible i need him gotta run he disappeared and closed the door behind him the room was silent as rosen scribbled on his pad then gave it up and closed the file adam almost felt sorry for him here was this great warrior the legendary charlie hustle of chicago law a great barrister who for thirty years swayed juries and terrified opponents and intimidated judges now sitting here as a pencil pusher trying desperately to agonize over the question of assigning a rookie to a pro bono project adam saw the humor the irony and the pity ill agree to it mr hall rosen said with much drama in his low voice almost a whisper as if terribly frustrated by all this but i promise you this when the cayhall matter is over and you return to chicago ill recommend your termination from kravitz bane probably wont be necessary adam said quickly you presented yourself to us under false pretenses rosen continued i said i was sorry wont happen again plus youre a smart ass so are you mr rosen show me a trial lawyer whos not a smart ass real cute enjoy the cayhall case mr hall because itll be your last bit of work for this firm you want me to enjoy an execution relax daniel goodman said softly just relax no ones getting fired around here rosen pointed an angry finger at goodman i swear ill recommend his termination fine all you can do is recommend daniel ill take it to the committee and well just have a huge brawl okay i cant wait rosen snarled as he jumped to his feet ill start lobbying now ill have my votes by the end of the week good day he stormed from the room and slammed the door they sat in silence next to each other just staring across the table over the backs of the empty chairs to the rows of thick law books lined neatly on the wall listening to the echo of the slamming door thanks adam finally said hes not a bad guy really goodman said charming a real prince ive known him a long time hes suffering now really frustrated and depressed were not sure what to do with him what about retirement its been considered but no partner has ever been forced into retirement for obvious reasons its a precedent wed like to avoid is he serious about firing me dont worry adam it wont happen i promise you were wrong in not disclosing it but its a minor sin and a perfectly understandable one youre young scared naive and you want to help dont worry about rosen i doubt if hell be in this position three months from now deep down i think he adores me its quite obvious adam took a deep breath and walked around the table goodman uncapped his pen and began making notes theres not much time adam he said i know when can you leave tomorrow ill pack tonight its a tenhour drive the file weighs a hundred pounds its down in printing right now ill ship it tomorrow tell me about our office in memphis i talked to them about an hour ago managing partner is baker cooley and hes expecting you theyll have a small office and a secretary for you and theyll help if they can theyre not much when it comes to litigation how many lawyers twelve its a little boutique firm we swallowed ten years ago and no one remembers exactly why good boys though good lawyers its the remnants of an old firm that prospered with the cotton and grain traders down there and i think thats the connection to chicago anyway it looks nice on the letterhead have you been to memphis i was born there remember oh yes ive been once i visited my aunt there a few years ago its an old river town pretty laid back youll enjoy it adam sat across the table from goodman how can i possibly enjoy the next few months good point you should go to the row as quickly as possible ill be there the day after tomorrow good ill call the warden his name is phillip naifeh lebanese oddly enough there are quite a few of them in the mississippi delta anyway hes an old friend and ill tell him youre coming the warden is your friend yes we go back several years to maynard tole a nasty little boy who was my first casualty in this war he was executed in i believe and the warden and i became friends hes opposed to the death penalty if you can believe it i dont believe it he hates executions youre about to learn something adam the death penalty may be very popular in our country but the people who are forced to impose it are not supporters youre about to meet these people the guards who get close to the inmates the administrators who must plan for an efficient killing the prison employees who rehearse for a month beforehand its a strange little corner of the world and a very depressing one i cant wait ill talk to the warden and get permission for the visit theyll usually give you a couple of hours of course it may take five minutes if sam doesnt want a lawyer hell talk to me dont you think i believe so i cannot imagine how the man will react but hell talk it may take a couple of visits to sign him up but you can do it when did you last see him couple of years ago wallace tyner and i went down youll need to touch base with tyner he was the point man on this case for the past six years adam nodded and moved to the next thought hed been picking tyners brain for the past nine months what do we file first well talk about it later tyner and i are meeting early in the morning to review the case everythings on hold though until we hear from you we cant move if we dont represent him adam was thinking of the newspaper photos the black and whites from when sam was arrested and the magazine photos in color from the third trial in and the footage hed pieced together into a thirtyminute video about sam cayhall what does he look like goodman left his pen on the table and fiddled with his bow tie average height thin but then you seldom see a fat one on the row nerves and lean food he chainsmokes which is common because theres not much else to do and theyre dying anyway some weird brand montclair i believe in a blue pack his hair is gray and oily as i recall these guys dont get a shower every day sort of long in the back but that was two years ago he hasnt lost much of it gray beard hes fairly wrinkled but then hes pushing seventy plus the heavy smoking youll notice the white guys on the row look worse than the black ones theyre confined for twentythree hours a day so they sort of bleach out real pale fair almost sicklylooking sam has blue eyes nice features i suspect that at one time sam cayhall was a handsome fellow after my father died and i learned the truth about sam i had a lot of questions for my mother she didnt have many answers but she did tell me once that there was little physical resemblance between sam and my father nor between you and sam if thats what youre getting at yeah i guess he hasnt seen you since you were a toddler adam he will not recognize you it wont be that easy youll have to tell him adam stared blankly at the table youre right what will he say beats me i expect hell be too shocked to say much but hes a very intelligent man not educated but well read and articulate hell think of something to say it may take a few minutes you sound as if you almost like him i dont hes a horrible racist and bigot and hes shown no remorse for his actions youre convinced hes guilty goodman grunted and smiled to himself then thought of a response three trials had been held to determine the guilt or innocence of sam cayhall for nine years now the case had been batted around the appellate courts and reviewed by many judges countless newspaper and magazine articles had investigated the bombing and those behind it the jury thought so i guess thats all that matters but what about you what do you think youve read the file adam youve researched the case for a long time theres no doubt sam took part in the bombing but there are a lot of buts there always are he had no history of handling explosives true but he was a klan terrorist and they were bombing like hell sam gets arrested and the bombing stops but in one of the bombings before kramer a witness claims he saw two people in the green pontiac true but the witness was not allowed to testify at trial and the witness had just left a bar at three in the morning but another witness a truck driver claims he saw sam and another man talking in a coffee shop in cleveland a few hours before the kramer bombing true but the truck driver said nothing for three years and was not allowed to testify at the last trial too remote so who was sams accomplice i doubt if well ever know keep in mind adam this is a man who went to trial three times yet never testified he said virtually nothing to the police very little to his defense lawyers not a word to his juries and hes told us nothing new in the past seven years do you think he acted alone no he had help sams carrying dark secrets adam hell never tell he took an oath as a klansman and he has this really warped romantic notion of a sacred vow he can never violate his father was a klansman too you know yeah i know dont remind me sorry anyway its too late in the game to fish around for new evidence if he in fact had an accomplice he shouldve talked long ago maybe he shouldve talked to the fbi maybe he shouldve cut a deal with the district attorney i dont know but when youre indicted on two counts of capital murder and facing death you start talking you talk adam you save your ass and let your buddy worry about his and if there was no accomplice there was goodman took his pen and wrote a name on a piece of paper he slid it across the table to adam who looked at it and said wyn lettner the name is familiar lettner was the fbi agent in charge of the kramer case hes now retired and living on a trout river in the ozarks he loves to tell war stories about the klan and the civil rights days in mississippi and hell talk to me oh sure hes a big beer drinker and he gets about half loaded and tells these incredible stories he wont divulge anything confidential but he knows more about the kramer bombing than anyone ive always suspected he knows more than hes told adam folded the paper and placed it in his pocket he glanced at his watch it was almost pm i need to run i have to pack and all ill ship the file down tomorrow you need to call me as soon as you talk to sam i will can i say something sure on behalf of my family such as it is my mother who refuses to discuss sam my sister who only whispers his name my aunt in memphis who has disowned the name cayhall and on behalf of my late father i would like to say thanks to you and to this firm for what youve done i admire you greatly youre welcome and i admire you now get your ass down to mississippi the apartment was a onebedroom loft somewhere above the third floor of a turnofthecentury warehouse just off the loop in a section of downtown known for crime but said to be safe until dark the warehouse had been purchased in the mideighties by an s l swinger who spent a bundle sanitizing and modernizing he chopped it into sixty units hired a slick realtor and marketed it as yuppie starter condos he made money as the place filled overnight with eager young bankers and brokers adam hated the place he had three weeks left on a sixmonth lease but there was no place to go he would be forced to renew for another six months because kravitz bane expected eighteen hours a day and thered been no time to search for another apartment nor had there been much time to purchase furniture evidently a fine leather sofa without arms of any kind sat alone on the wooden floor and faced an ancient brick wall two bean bags yellow and blue were nearby in the unlikely event a crowd materialized to the left was a tiny kitchen area with a snack bar and three wicker stools and to the right of the sofa was the bedroom with the unmade bed and clothes on the floor seven hundred square feet for thirteen hundred bucks a month adams salary as a blue chip prospect nine months earlier had begun at sixty thousand a year and was now at sixtytwo from his gross pay of slightly over five thousand a month fifteen hundred was withheld for state and federal income taxes another six hundred never reached his fingers but went instead into a kravitz bane retirement fund guaranteed to relieve the pressure at age fiftyfive if they didnt kill him first after rent utilities four hundred a month for a leased saab and incidentals such as frozen food and some nice clothes adam found himself with about seven hundred dollars to play with some of this remainder was spent on women but the ones he knew were also fresh from college with new jobs and new credit cards and generally insistent on paying their own way this was fine with adam thanks to his fathers faith in life insurance he had no student loans even though there were things he wanted to buy he doggedly plowed five hundred a month into mutual funds with no immediate prospect of a wife and family his goal was to work hard save hard and retire at forty against the brick wall was an aluminum table with a television on it adam sat on the sofa nude except for boxer shorts holding the remote control but for the colorless radiation from the screen the loft was dark it was after midnight the video was one hed pieced together over the years the adventures of a klan bomber he called it it started with a brief news report filed by a local crew in jackson mississippi on march the morning after a synagogue was leveled by a bomb blast it was the fourth known attack against jewish targets in the past two months the reporter said as a backhoe roared behind her with a bucket full of debris the fbi had few clues she said and even fewer words for the press the klans campaign of terror continues she declared gravely and signed off the kramer bombing was next and the story started with sirens screaming and police pushing people away from the scene a local reporter and his cameraman were on the spot quickly enough to capture the initial bedlam people were seen running to the remains of marvins office a heavy cloud of gray dust hung above the small oak trees on the front lawn the trees were battered and leafless but standing the cloud was still and showed no signs of dissipating off camera voices yelled about a fire and the camera rocked along and stopped in front of the building next door where thick smoke poured from a damaged wall the reporter breathless and panting into the microphone jabbered incoherently about the entire shocking scene he pointed over here then over there as the camera jerked in belated response the police pushed him away but he was too excited to care glorious pandemonium had erupted in the sleepy town of greenville and this was his grand moment thirty minutes later from a different angle his voice was somewhat calmer as he described the frantic removal of marvin kramer from the rubble the police extended their barricades and inched the crowd backward as the fire and rescue people lifted his body and worked the stretcher through the wreckage the camera followed the ambulance as it sped away then an hour later and from still another angle the reporter was quite composed and somber as the two stretchers with the covered little bodies were delicately handled by the firemen the video cut from the footage of the bombing scene to the front of the jail and for the first time there was a glimpse of sam cayhall he was handcuffed and ushered quickly into a waiting car as always adam pushed a button and replayed the brief scene with the shot of sam it was twentythree years ago sam was fortysix years old his hair was dark and cut close the fashion of the times there was a small bandage under his left eye away from the camera he walked quickly stride for stride with the deputies because people were watching and taking pictures and yelling questions he turned only once to their voices and as always adam froze the tape and stared for the millionth time into the face of his grandfather the picture was black and white and not clear but their eyes always met nineteen sixtyseven if sam was fortysix then eddie was twentyfour and adam was almost three he was known as alan then alan cayhall soon to be a resident of a distant state where a judge would sign a decree giving him a new name he had often watched this video and wondered where he was at the precise moment the kramer boys were killed am april his family lived at that time in a small house in the town of clanton and he was probably still asleep not far from his mothers watch he was almost three and the kramer twins were only five the video continued with more quick shots of sam being led to and from various cars jails and courthouses he was always handcuffed and he developed the habit of staring at the ground just a few feet in front of him his face bore no expression he never looked at the reporters never acknowledged their inquiries never said a word he moved quickly darting out of doors and into waiting cars the spectacle of his first two trials was amply recorded by daily television news reports over the years adam had been able to retrieve most of the footage and had carefully edited the material there was the loud and blustering face of clovis brazelton sams lawyer holding forth for the press at every opportunity but the clips of brazelton had been edited quite heavily with time adam despised the man there were clear sweeping shots of the courthouse lawns with the crowds of silent onlookers and the heavily armed state police and the robed klansmen with their coneheads and sinister masks there were brief glimpses of sam always in a hurry always shielding himself from the cameras by ducking along behind a beefy deputy after the second trial and the second hung jury marvin kramer stopped his wheelchair on the sidewalk in front of the wilson county courthouse and with tears in his eyes bitterly condemned sam cayhall and the ku klux klan and the hidebound justice system in mississippi as the cameras rolled a pitiful incident unfolded marvin suddenly spotted two klansmen in white robes not far away and began screaming at them one of them yelled back but his reply was lost in the heat of the moment adam had tried everything to retrieve the klansmans words from the air but with no luck the reply would be forever unintelligible a couple of years earlier while in law school at michigan adam had found one of the local reporters who was standing there at the moment holding a microphone not far from marvins face according to the reporter the reply from across the lawn had something to do with their desire to blow off the rest of marvins limbs something this crude and cruel appeared to be true because marvin went berserk he screamed obscenities at the muckers who were easing away and he spun the metal wheels of his chair lunging in their direction he was yelling and cursing and crying his wife and a few friends tried to restrain him but he broke free his hands furiously working the wheels he rolled about twenty feet with his wife in chase with the cameras recording it all until the sidewalk ended and the grass began the wheelchair flipped and marvin sprawled onto the lawn the quilt around his amputated legs flung free as he rolled hard next to a tree his wife and friends were on him immediately and for a moment or two he disappeared into a small huddle on the ground but he could still be heard as the camera backed away and shot quickly at the two klansmen one doubled over with laughter and one frozen in place an odd wailing erupted from the small crowd on the ground marvin was moaning but in the shrill highpitched howl of a wounded madman it was a sick sound and after a few miserable seconds of it the video cut to the next scene adam had tears in his eyes the first time he watched marvin roll on the ground howling and groaning and though the images and sounds still tightened his throat he had stopped crying long ago this video was his creation no one had seen it but him and hed watched it so many times that tears were no longer possible technology improved immensely from to and the footage from sams third and last trial was much sharper and clearer it was february of in a pretty little town with a busy square and a quaint courthouse of red brick the air was bitterly cold and perhaps this kept away the crowds of onlookers and demonstrators one report from the first day of the trial had a brief shot of three behooded klansmen huddled around a portable heater rubbing their hands and looking more like mardi gras revelers than serious hoodlums they were watched by a dozen or so state troopers all in blue jackets because the civil rights movement was viewed by this time as more of a historical event than a continuing struggle the third trial of sam cayhall attracted more media than the first two here was an admitted klansman a real live terrorist from the distant era of freedom riders and church bombings here was a relic from those infamous days whod been tracked down and was now being hauled to justice the analogy to nazi war criminals was made more than once sam was not in custody during his last trial he was a free man and his freedom made it even more difficult to catch him on camera there were quick shots of him darting into various doors of the courthouse sam had aged gracefully in the thirteen years since trial number two the hair was still short and neat but half gray now he appeared a bit heavier but fit he moved deftly along sidewalks and in and out of automobiles as the media gave chase one camera caught him as he stepped from a side door of the courthouse and adam stopped the tape just as sam stared directly into the camera much of the footage of the third and final trial centered around a cocky young prosecutor named david mcallister a handsome man who wore dark suits and a quick smile with perfect teeth there was little doubt that david mcallister held grand political ambitions he had the looks the hair the chin the rich voice the smooth words the ability to attract cameras in eight short years after the trial david mcallister was elected governor of the state of mississippi to no ones surprise the widest planks in his platform had been more jails longer sentences and an unwavering affinity for the death penalty adam despised him too but he knew that in a matter of weeks maybe days he would be sitting in the governors office in jackson mississippi begging for a pardon the video ended with sam in handcuffs once again being led from the courthouse after the jury condemned him to death his face was expressionless his lawyer appeared to be in shock and uttered a few unremarkable comments the reporter signed off with the news that sam would be transported to death row in a matter of days adam pushed the rewind button and stared at the blank screen behind the armless sofa were three cardboard boxes which contained the rest of the story the bulky transcripts of all three trials which adam had purchased while at pepperdine copies of the briefs and motions and other documents from the appellate warfare that had been raging since sams conviction a thick and carefully indexed binder with neat copies of hundreds of newspaper and magazine stories about sams adventures as a klansman death penalty materials and research notes from law school he knew more about his grandfather than anyone alive yet adam knew he had not scratched the surface he pushed another button and watched the video again the funeral for eddie cayhall occurred less than a month after sam was sentenced to die it was held in a small chapel in santa monica and attended by few friends and even fewer family members adam sat on a front pew between his mother and sister they held hands and stared at the closed casket just inches away as always his mother was stiff and stoic her eyes watered occasionally and she was forced to dab them with a tissue she and eddie had separated and reconciled so many times the children had lost track of whose clothes were where though their marriage had never been violent it had been lived in a continual state of divorce threats of divorce plans for divorce solemn chats with the kids about divorce negotiations for divorce filings for divorce retreat from divorce vows to avoid divorce during the third trial of sam cayhall adams mother quietly moved her possessions back into their small house and stayed with eddie as much as possible eddie stopped going to work and withdrew once again into his dark little world adam quizzed his mother but she explained in a few short words that dad was simply having another bad time the curtains were drawn the shades were pulled the lights were unplugged the voices were lowered the television was turned off as the family endured another of eddies bad times three weeks after the verdict he was dead he shot himself in adams bedroom on a day when he knew adam would be the first one home he left a note on the floor with instructions for adam to hurry and clean up the mess before the girls got home another note was found in the kitchen carmen was fourteen at the time three years younger than adam she had been conceived in mississippi but born in california after her parents hasty migration westward by the time she was born eddie had legally transformed his little family from cayhalls to halls alan had become adam they lived in east la in a threeroom apartment with dirty sheets on the windows adam remembered the sheets with the holes in them it was the first of many temporary residences next to carmen on the front pew was a mysterious woman known as aunt lee she had just been introduced to adam and carmen as eddies sister his only sibling as children they were taught not to ask questions about family but occasionally lees name would surface she lived in memphis had at one point married into a wealthy memphis family had a child and had nothing to do with eddie because of some ancient feud the kids adam especially had longed to meet a relative and since aunt lee was the only one ever mentioned they fantasized about her they wanted to meet her but eddie always refused because she was not a nice person he said but their mother whispered that lee was indeed a good person and that one day she would take them to memphis to meet her lee instead made the trip to california and together they buried eddie hall she stayed for two weeks after the funeral and became acquainted with her niece and nephew they loved her because she was pretty and cool wore blue jeans and tee shirts and walked barefoot on the beach she took them shopping and to the movies and they went for long walks by the shore of the ocean she made all sorts of excuses for not visiting sooner she wanted to she promised but eddie wouldnt allow it he didnt want to see her because they had fought in the past and it was aunt lee who sat with adam on the end of a pier watching the sun sink into the pacific and finally talked of her father sam cayhall as the waves rocked gently beneath them lee explained to young adam that he had a brief prior life as a toddler in a small town in mississippi she held his hand and at times patted his knee while she unveiled the forlorn history of their family she laid out the barest details of sams klan activities and of the kramer bombing and of the trials that eventually sent him to death row in mississippi there were gaps in her oral history large enough to fill libraries but she covered the high spots with a great deal of finesse for an insecure sixteenyearold whod just lost his father adam took the whole thing rather well he asked a few questions as a cool wind found the coast and they huddled together but for the most part he just listened not in shock or anger but with enormous fascination this awful tale was oddly satisfying there was a family out there perhaps he wasnt so abnormal after all perhaps there were aunts and uncles and cousins with lives to share and stories to tell perhaps there were old homes built by real ancestors and land and farms upon which they settled he had a history after all but lee was wise and quick enough to recognize this interest she explained that the cayhalls were a strange and secret breed who kept to themselves and shunned outsiders they were not friendly and warm people who gathered for christmas and reunited on the fourth of july she lived just an hour away from clanton yet never saw them the visits to the pier at dusk became a ritual for the next week they would stop at the market and buy a sack of red grapes then spit seeds into the ocean until well past dark lee told stories of her childhood in mississippi with her little brother eddie they lived on a small farm fifteen minutes from clanton with ponds to fish in and ponies to ride sam was a decent father not overbearing but certainly not affectionate her mother was a weak woman who disliked sam but doted on her children she lost a baby a newborn when lee was six and eddie was almost four and she stayed in her bedroom for almost a year sam hired a black woman to care for eddie and lee her mother died of cancer and it was the last time the cayhalls gathered eddie sneaked into town for the funeral but tried to avoid everyone three years later sam was arrested for the last time and convicted lee had little to say about her own life she left home in a hurry at the age of eighteen the week after high school graduation and went straight to nashville to get famous as a recording artist somehow she met phelps booth a graduate student at vanderbilt whose family owned banks they were eventually married and settled into what appeared to be a miserable existence in memphis they had one son walt who evidently was quite rebellious and now lived in amsterdam these were the only details adam couldnt tell if lee had transformed herself into something other than a cayhall but he suspected she had who could blame her lee left as quietly as she had come without a hug or a farewell she eased from their home before dawn and was gone she called two days later and talked to adam and carmen she encouraged them to write which they eagerly did but the calls and letters from her became further apart the promise of a new relationship slowly faded their mother made excuses she said lee was a good person but she was nonetheless a cayhall and thus given to a certain amount of gloom and weirdness adam was crushed the summer after his graduation from pepperdine adam and a friend drove across the country to key west they stopped in memphis and spent two nights with aunt lee she lived alone in a spacious modern condo on a bluff overlooking the river and they sat for hours on the patio just the three of them eating homemade pizza drinking beer watching barges and talking about almost everything family was never mentioned adam was excited about law school and lee was full of questions about his future she was vibrant and fun and talkative the perfect hostess and aunt when they hugged goodbye her eyes watered and she begged him to come again adam and his friend avoided mississippi they drove eastward instead through tennessee and the smoky mountains at one point according to adams calculations they were within a hundred miles of parchman and death row and sam cayhall that was four years ago in the summer of and he already had collected a large box full of materials about his grandfather his video was almost complete their conversation on the phone last night had been brief adam said he would be living in memphis for a few months and would like to see her lee invited him to her condo the same one on the bluff where she had four bedrooms and a parttime maid he would live with her she insisted then he said he would be working in the memphis office working on sams case as a matter of fact there was silence on the other end then a weak offer to come on down anyway and they would talk about it adam pushed her doorbell at a few minutes after nine and glanced at his black saab convertible the development was nothing but a single row of twenty units all stacked tightly together with redtiled roofs a broad brick wall with heavy iron grating along the top protected those inside from the dangers of downtown memphis an armed guard worked the only gate if not for the view of the river on the other side the condos would be virtually worthless lee opened the door and they pecked each other on the cheeks welcome she said looking at the parking lot then locking the door behind him are you tired not really its a tenhour drive but it took me twelve i was not in a hurry are you hungry no i stopped a few hours ago he followed her into the den where they faced each other and tried to think of something appropriate to say she was almost fifty and had aged a lot in the past four years the hair was now an equal mixture of gray and brunette and much longer she pulled it tightly into a ponytail her soft blue eyes were red and worried and surrounded by more wrinkles she wore an oversized cotton buttondown and faded jeans lee was still cool its good to see you she said with a nice sle mi are you sure of course im sure lets sit on the patio she took his hand and led him through the glass doors onto a wooden deck where baskets of ferns and bougainvillea hung from wooden beams the river was below them they sat in white wicker rockers hows carmen she asked as she poured iced tea from a ceramic pitcher fine still in grad school at berkeley we talk once a week shes dating a guy pretty serious whats she studying now i forget psychology wants to get her doctorate then maybe teach the tea was strong on lemon and short on sugar adam sipped it slowly the air was still muggy and hot its almost ten oclock he said why is it so hot welcome to memphis dear well roast through september i couldnt stand it you get used to it sort oј we drink lots of tea and stay inside hows your mother still in portland now married to a man who made a fortune in timber ive met him once hes probably sixtyfive but could pass for seventy shes fortyseven and looks forty a beautiful couple they jet here and there st barts southern france milan all the places where the rich need to be seen shes very happy her kids are grown eddies dead her past is tucked neatly away and she has plenty of money her life is very much in order youre too harsh im too easy she really doesnt want me around because im a painful link to my father and his pathetic family your mother loves you adam boy thats good to hear how do you know so much i just know didnt realize you and mom were so close were not settle down adam take it easy im sorry im wired thats all i need a stronger drink relax lets have some fun while youre here its not a fun visit aunt lee just call me lee okay okay im going to see sam tomorrow she carefully placed her glass on the table then stood and left the patio she returned with a bottle of jack daniels and poured a generous shot into both glasses she took a long drink and stared at the river in the distance why she finally asked why not because hes my grandfather because hes about to die because im a lawyer and he needs help he doesnt even know you he will tomorrow so youll tell him yes of course im going to tell him can you believe it im actually going to tell a deep dark nasty cayhall secret what about that lee held her glass with both hands and slowly shook her head hell die she mumbled without looking at adam not yet but its nice to know youre concerned i am concerned oh really when did you last see him dont start this adam you dont understand fine fair enough explain it to me then im listening i want to understand cant we talk about something else dear im not ready for this no we can talk about this later i promise im just not ready for it right now i thought wed just gossip and laugh for a while im sorry lee im sick of gossip and secrets i have no past because my father conveniently erased it i want to know about it lee i want to know how bad it really is its awful she whispered almost to herself okay im a big boy now i can handle it my father checked out on me before he had to face it so im afraid theres no one but you give me some time there is no time ill be facetoface with him tomorrow adam took a long drink and wiped his lips with his sleeve twentythree years ago newsweek said sams father was also a klansman was he yes my grandfather and several uncles and cousins as well the whole damned bunch newsweek also said that it was common knowledge in ford county that sam cayhall shot and killed a black man in the early fifties and was never arrested for it never served a day in jail is this true why does it matter now adam that was years before you were born so it really happened yes it happened and you knew about it i saw it you saw it adam closed his eyes in disbelief he breathed heavily and sunk lower into the rocker the horn from a tugboat caught his attention and he followed it downriver until it passed under a bridge the bourbon was beginning to soothe lets talk about something else lee said softly even when i was a little kid he said still watching the river i loved history i was fascinated by the way people lived years ago the pioneers the wagon trains the gold rush cowboys and indians the settling of the west there was a kid in the fourth grade who claimed his greatgreatgrandfather had robbed trains and buried the money in mexico he wanted to form a gang and run away to find the money we knew he was lying but it was great fun playing along i often wondered about my ancestors and i remember being puzzled because i didnt seem to have any what would eddie say he told me they were all dead said more time is wasted on family history than anything else every time i asked questions about my family mother would pull me aside and tell me to stop because it might upset him and he might go off into one of his dark moods and stay in his bedroom for a month i spent most of my childhood walking on eggshells around my father as i grew older i began to realize he was a very strange man very unhappy but i never dreamed he would kill himself she rattled her ice and took the last sip theres a lot to it adam so when will you tell me lee gently took the pitcher and refilled their glasses adam poured bourbon into both several minutes passed as they sipped and watched the traffic on riverside drive have you been to death row he finally asked still staring at the lights along the river no she said barely audible hes been there for almost ten years and youve never gone to see him i wrote him a letter once shortly after his last trial six months later he wrote me back and told me not to come said he didnt want me to see him on death row i wrote him two more letters neither of which he answered im sorry dont be sorry im carrying a lot of guilt adam and its not easy to talk about just give me some time i may be in memphis for a while i want you to stay here well need each other she hesitated and stirred the drink with an index finger i mean he is going to die isnt he its likely when two or three months his appeals are virtually exhausted theres not much left then why are you getting involved i dont know maybe its because we have a fighting chance ill work my tail off for the next few months and pray for a miracle ill be praying too she said as she took another sip can we talk about something he asked suddenly looking at her sure do you live here alone i mean its a fair question if im going to be staying here i live alone my husband lives in our house in the country does he live alone just curious sometimes he likes young girls early twenties usually employees at his banks im expected to call before i go to the house and hes expected to call before he comes here thats nice and convenient who negotiated that agreement we just sort of worked it out over time we havent lived together in fifteen years some marriage it works quite well actually i take his money and i ask no questions about his private life we do the required little social numbers together and hes happy are you happy most of the time if he cheats why dont you sue for divorce and clean him out ill represent you a divorce wouldnt work phelps comes from a very proper stiff old family of miserably rich people old memphis society some of these families have intermarried for decades in fact phelps was expected to marry a fifth cousin but instead he fell under my charms his family was viciously opposed to it and a divorce now would be a painful admission that his family was right plus these people are proud bluebloods and a nasty divorce would humiliate them i love the independence of taking his money and living as i choose did you ever love him of course we were madly in love when we married we eloped by the way it was and the idea of a large wedding with his family of aristocrats and my family of rednecks was not appealing his mother would not speak to me and my father was burning crosses at that time phelps did not know my father was a klansman and of course i desperately wanted to keep it quiet did he find out as soon as daddy was arrested for the bombing i told him he in turn told his father and the word was spread slowly and carefully through the booth family these people are quite proficient at keeping secrets its the only thing they have in common with us cayhalls so only a few know youre sams daughter very few id like to keep it that way youre ashamed of hell yes im ashamed of my father who wouldnt be her words were suddenly sharp and bitter i hope you dont have some romanticized image of this poor old man suffering on death row about to be unjustly crucified for his sins i dont think he should die neither do but hes damned sure killed enough people the kramer twins their father your father and god knows who else he should stay in prison for the rest of his life you have no sympathy for him occasionally if im having a good day and the sun is shining then i might think of him and remember a small pleasant event from my childhood but those moments are very rare adam he has caused much misery in my life and in the lives of those around him he taught us to hate everybody he was mean to our mother his whole damned family is mean so lets just kill him then i didnt say that adam and youre being unfair i think about him all the time i pray for him every day ive asked these walls a million times why and how my father became such a horrible person why cant he be some nice old man right now sitting on the front porch with a pipe and a cane maybe a little bourbon in a glass for his stomach of course why did my father have to be a klansman who killed innocent children and ruined his own family maybe he didnt intend to kill them theyre dead arent they the jury said he did it they were blown to bits and buried side by side in the same neat little grave who cares if he intended to kill them he was there adam it could be very important lee jumped to her feet and grabbed his hand come here she insisted they stepped a few feet to the edge of the patio she pointed to the memphis skyline several blocks away you see that flat building facing the river there the nearest to us just over there three or four blocks away yes he answered slowly the top floor is the fifteenth okay now from the right count down six levels do you follow yes adam nodded and counted obediently the building was a showy highrise now count four windows to the left theres a light on do you see it yes guess who lives there how would i know ruth kramer ruth kramer the mother thats her do you know her we met once by accident she knew i was lee booth wife of the infamous phelps booth but that was all it was a glitzy fundraiser for the ballet or something ive always avoided her if possible this must be a small town it can be tiny if you could ask her about sam what would she say adam stared at the lights in the distance i dont know ive read that shes still bitter bitter she lost her entire family shes never remarried do you think she cares if my father intended to kill her children of course not she just knows theyre dead adam dead for twentythree years now she knows they were killed by a bomb planted by my father and if hed been home with his family instead of riding around at night with his idiot buddies little josh and john would not be dead they instead would be twentyeight years old probably very well educated and married with perhaps a baby or two for ruth and marvin to play with she doesnt care who the bomb was intended for adam only that it was placed there and it exploded her babies are dead thats all that matters lee stepped backward and sat in her rocker she rattled her ice again and took a drink dont get me wrong adam im opposed to the death penalty im probably the only fiftyyearold white woman in the country whose father is on death row its barbaric immoral discriminatory cruel uncivilized i subscribe to all the above but dont forget the victims okay they have the right to want retribution theyve earned it does ruth kramer want retribution by all accounts yes she doesnt say much to the press anymore but shes active with victims groups years ago she was quoted as saying she would be in the witness room when sam cayhall was executed not exactly a forgiving spirit i dont recall my father asking for forgiveness adam turned and sat on the ledge with his back to the river he glanced at the buildings downtown then studied his feet lee took another long drink well aunt lee what are we going to do please drop the aunt okay lee im here im not leaving ill visit sam tomorrow and when i leave i intend to be his lawyer do you intend to keep it quiet the fact that im really a cayhall i dont plan to tell anyone but ill be surprised if its a secret much longer when it comes to death row inmates sams a famous one the press will start some serious digging pretty soon lee folded her feet under her and stared at the river will it harm you she asked softly of course not im a lawyer lawyers defend child molesters and assassins and drug dealers and rapists and terrorists we are not popular people how can i be harmed by the fact that hes my grandfather your firm knows i told them yesterday they were not exactly delighted but they came around i hid it from them actually when they hired me and i was wrong to do so but i think things are okay what if he says no then well be safe wont we no one will ever know and youll be protected ill go back to chicago and wait for cnn to cover the carnival of the execution and im sure ill drive down one cool day in the fall and put some flowers on his grave probably look at the tombstone and ask myself again why he did it and how he became such a lowlife and why was i born into such a wretched family you know the questions weve been asking for many years ill invite you to come with me itll be sort of a little family reunion you know just us cayhalls slithering through the cemetery with a cheapo bouquet of flowers and thick sunglasses so no one will discover us stop it she said and adam saw the tears they were flowing and were almost to her chin when she wiped them with her fingers im sorry he said then turned to watch another barge inch north through the shadows of the river im sorry lee so after twentythree years he was finally returning to the state of his birth he didnt particularly feel welcome and though he wasnt particularly afraid of anything he drove a cautious fiftyfive and refused to pass anyone the road narrowed and sunk onto the flat plain of the mississippi delta and for a mile adam watched as a levee snaked its way to the right and finally disappeared he eased through the hamlet of walls the first town of any size along and followed the traffic south through his considerable research he knew that this highway had for decades served as the principal conduit for hundreds of thousands of poor delta blacks journeying north to memphis and st louis and chicago and detroit places where they sought jobs and decent housing it was in these towns and farms these ramshackle shotgun houses and dusty country stores and colorful juke joints along highway where the blues was born and spread northward the music found a home in memphis where it was blended with gospel and country and together they spawned rock and roll he listened to an old muddy waters cassette as he entered the infamous county of tunica said to be the poorest in the nation the music did little to calm him he had refused breakfast at lees said he wasnt hungry but in fact had a knot in his stomach the knot grew with each mile just north of the town of tunica the fields grew vast and ran to the horizon in all directions the soybeans and cotton were knee high a small army of green and red tractors with plows behind them crisscrossed the endless neat rows of leafy foliage though it was not yet nine oclock the weather was already hot and sticky the ground was dry and clouds of dust smoldered behind each plow an occasional crop duster dropped from nowhere and acrobatically skimmed the tops of the fields then soared upward traffic was heavy and slow and sometimes forced almost to a standstill as a monstrous john deere of some variety inched along as if the highway were deserted adam was patient he was not expected until ten and it wouldnt matter if he arrived late at clarksdale he left highway and headed southeast on through the tiny settlements of mattson and dublin and tutwiler through more soybean fields he passed cotton gins now idle but waiting for the harvest he passed clusters of impoverished row houses and dirty mobile homes all for some reason situated close to the highway he passed an occasional fine home always at a distance always sitting majestically under heavy oaks and elms and usually with a fenced swimming pool to one side there was no doubt who owned these fields a road sign declared the state penitentiary to be five miles ahead and adam instinctively slowed his car a moment later he ran up on a large tractor puttering casually down the road and instead of passing he chose to follow the operator an old white man with a dirty cap motioned for him to come around adam waved and stayed behind the plow at twenty miles per hour there was no other traffic in sight a random dirt clod flung from a rear tractor tire and landed just inches in front of the saab he slowed a bit more the operator twisted in his seat and again waved for adam to come around his mouth moved and his face was angry as if this were his highway and he didnt appreciate idiots following his tractor adam smiled and waved again but stayed behind him minutes later he saw the prison there were no tall chainlink fences along the road there were no lines of glistening razor wire to prevent escape there were no watchtowers with armed guards there were no gangs of inmates howling at the passersby instead adam saw an entrance to the right and the words mississippi state penitentiary spanning from an arch above it next to the entrance were several buildings all facing the highway and apparently unguarded adam waved once again at the tractor operator then eased from the highway he took a deep breath and studied the entrance a female in uniform stepped from a guardhouse under the arch and stared at him adam drove slowly to her and lowered his window mornin she said she had a gun on her hip and a clipboard in her hand another guard watched from inside what can we do for you im a lawyer here to see a client on death row adam said weakly very much aware of his shrill and nervous voice just calm down he told himself we aint got nobody on death row sir im sorry aint no such place as death row we got a bunch of em in the maximum security unit thats msu for short but you can look all over this place and you wont find no death row okay name she said studying the clipboard adam hall and your client sam cayhall he halfexpected some sort of response to this but the guard didnt care she flipped a sheet and said stay right here the entrance became a driveway with shade trees and small buildings on each side this wasnt a prison this was a pleasant little street in a small town where any minute now a group of kids would appear on bicycles and roller skates to the right was a quaint structure with a front porch and flower beds a sign said this was the visitors center as if souvenirs and lemonade were on sale for eager tourists a white pickup with three young blacks in it and mississippi department of corrections stenciled on the door passed by without slowing a bit adam caught a glimpse of the guard standing behind his car she was writing something on the clipboard as she approached his window where bouts in illinois she asked chicago got any cameras guns or tape recorders no she reached inside and placed a card on his dash then she returned to her clipboard and said got a note here that youre supposed to see lucas mann whos that hes the prison attorney i didnt know i was supposed to see him she held a piece of paper three feet from his face says so right here take the third left just up there then wind around to the back of that red brick building she was pointing what does he want she snorted and shrugged at the same time and walked to the guardhouse shaking her head dumbass lawyers adam gently pressed the accelerator and eased by the visitors center and down the shaded drive on both sides were neat white frame houses where he learned later prison guards and other employees lived with their families he followed her instructions and parked in front of an aging brick building two trustees in blue prison pants with white stripes down the legs swept the front steps adam avoided eye contact and went inside he found the unmarked office of lucas mann with little trouble a secretary smiled at him and opened another door to a large office where mr mann was standing behind his desk and talking on the phone just have a seat the secretary whispered as she closed the door behind him mann smiled and waved awkwardly as he listened to the phone adam sat his briefcase in a chair and stood behind it the office was large and clean two long windows faced the highway and provided plenty of light on the wall to the left was a large framed photo of a familiar face a handsome young man with an earnest smile and strong chin it was david mcallister governor of the state of mississippi adam suspected identical photos were hung in every state government office and also plastered in every hallway closet and toilet under the states domain lucas mann stretched the phone cord and walked to a window his back to the desk and adam he certainly didnt appear to be a lawyer he was in his midfifties with flowing dark gray hair which he somehow pulled and kept situated on the back of his neck his dress was the hippest of fraternity chic severely starched khaki workshirt with two pockets and a mixed salad tie still tied but hanging loose top button unbuttoned to reveal a gray cotton tee shirt brown chinos likewise starched to the crunch with a perfect oneinch cuff falling just enough to allow a peek at white socks loafers shined immaculately it was obvious lucas knew how to dress and also obvious he was engaged in a different practice of law if hed had a small earring in his left lobe he would have been the perfect aging hippie who in his later years was yielding to conformity the office was neatly furnished with government handmedowns a worn wooden desk that seemed impeccably organized three metal chairs with vinyl cushions a row of mismatched file cabinets along one wall adam stood behind a chair and tried to calm himself could this meeting be required of all visiting attorneys surely not there were five thousand inmates in parchman garner goodman had not mentioned a visit with lucas mann the name was vaguely familiar somewhere deep in one of his boxes of court files and newspaper clippings he had seen the name of lucas mann and he desperately tried to remember if he was a good guy or a bad one what exactly was his role in death penalty litigation adam knew for certain that the enemy was the states attorney general but he couldnt fit lucas into the scenario mann suddenly hung up the phone and shoved a hand at adam nice to meet you mr hall please have a seat he said softly in a pleasant drawl as he waved at a chair thanks for stopping by adam took a seat sure a pleasure to meet you he replied nervously whats up a couple of things first i just wanted to meet you and say hello ive been the attorney here for twelve years i do most of the civil litigation that this place spews forth you know all kinds of crazy litigation filed by our guests prisoners rights damage suits that kind of stuff we get sued every day it seems by statute i also play a small role in the death cases and i understand youre here to visit sam thats correct has he hired you not exactly i didnt think so this presents a small problem you see youre not supposed to visit an inmate unless you actually represent him and i know that sam has successfully terminated kravitz bane so i cant see him adam asked almost with a trace of relief youre not supposed to i had a long talk yesterday with garner goodman he and i go back a few years to the maynard tole execution are you familiar with that one vaguely nineteen eightysix it was my second execution he said as if hed personally pulled the switch he sat on the edge of his desk and looked down at adam the starch crackled gently in his chinos his right leg swung from the desk ive had four you know sam could be the fifth anyway garner represented maynard tole and we got to know each other hes a fine gentleman and fierce advocate thanks adam said because he could think of nothing else i hate them personally youre opposed to the death penalty most of the time i go through stages actually every time we kill someone here i think the whole worlds gone crazy then invariably ill review one of these cases and remember how brutal and horrible some of these crimes were my first execution was teddy doyle meeks a drifter who raped mutilated and killed a little boy there was not much sadness here when he was gassed but hey listen i could tell war stories forever maybe well have time for it later okay sure adam said without commitment he could not envision a moment when he wanted to hear stories about violent murderers and their executions i told garner that i didnt think you should be permitted to visit sam he listened for a while then he explained rather vaguely i must say that perhaps yours was a special situation and that you should be allowed at least one visit he wouldnt say what was so special about it know what i mean lucas rubbed his chin when he said this as if he had almost solved the puzzle our policy is rather strict especially for msu but the warden will do whatever i ask he said this very slowly and the words hung in the air i uh really need to see him adam said his voice almost cracking well he needs a lawyer frankly im glad youre here weve never executed one unless his lawyer was present theres all sorts of legal maneuvering up to the very last minute and ill just feel better if sam has a lawyer he walked around the desk and took a seat on the other side he opened a file and studied a piece of paper adam waited and tried to breathe normally we do a fair amount of background on our death inmates lucas said still looking at the file the statement had the tone of a solemn warning especially when the appeals have run and the execution is looming do you know anything about sams family the knot suddenly felt like a basketball in adams stomach he managed to shrug and shake his head at the same time as if to say he knew nothing do you plan to talk to sams family again no response just the same inept shrug of the shoulders very heavy shoulders at this moment i mean normally in these cases theres quite a lot of contact with the condemned mans family as the execution gets closer youll probably want to contact these folks sam has a daughter in memphis a mrs lee booth i have an address if you want it lucas watched him suspiciously adam could not move dont suppose you know her do you adam shook his head but said nothing sam had one son eddie cayhall but the poor guy committed suicide in lived in california eddie left two children a son born in clanton mississippi on may which oddly enough is your birthday according to my martindalehubbell law directory says you were born in memphis on the same day eddie also left a daughter who was born in california these are sams grandchildren ill try and contact them if you eddie cayhall was my father adam blurted out and he took a deep breath he sank lower in the chair and stared at the top of the desk his heart pounded furiously but at least he was breathing again his shoulders were suddenly lighter he even managed a very small smile manns face was expressionless he thought for a long minute then said with a hint of satisfaction i sort of figured that he immediately started flipping papers as if the file possessed many other surprises sams been a very lonely man on death row and ive often wondered about his family he gets some mail but almost none from his family virtually no visitors not that he wants any but its a bit unusual for such a noted inmate to be ignored by his family especially a white one i dont pry you understand of course not lucas ignored this we have to make preparations for the execution mr hall for example we have to know what to do with the body funeral arrangements and all thats where the family comes in after i talked to garner yesterday i asked some of our people in jackson to track down the family it was really quite easy they also checked your paperwork and immediately discovered that the state of tennessee has no record of the birth of adam hall on may one thing sort of led to another it wasnt difficult im not hiding anymore when did you learn about sam nine years ago my aunt lee booth told me after we buried my father have you had any contact with sam no lucas closed the file and reclined in his squeaky chair so sam has no idea who you are or why youre here thats right wow he whistled at the ceiling adam relaxed a bit and sat up in his chair the cat was now out of the bag and had it not been for lee and her fears of being discovered he would have felt completely at ease how long can i see him today he asked well mr hall just call me adam okay sure adam we really have two sets of rules for the row excuse me but i was told by a guard at the gate that there was no death row not officially youll never hear the guards or other personnel refer to it as anything but maximum security or msu or unit anyway when a mans time is about up on the row we relax the rules quite a bit normally a visit with the lawyer is limited to an hour a day but in sams case you can have all the time you need i suspect youll have a lot to talk about so theres no time limit no you can stay all day if you like we try to make things easy in the last days you can come and go as you please as long as theres no security risk ive been to death row in five other states and believe me we treat them the best hell in louisiana they take the poor guy out of his unit and place him in whats called the death house for three days before they kill him talk about cruel we dont do that sam will be treated special until the big day the big day yeah its four weeks from today you know august lucas reached for some papers on the corner of his desk then handed them to adam this came down this morning the fifth circuit lifted the stay late yesterday afternoon the mississippi supreme court just set a new execution date for august adam held the papers without looking at them four weeks he said stunned afraid so i took a copy of it to sam about an hour ago so hes in a foul mood four weeks adam repeated almost to himself he glanced at the courts opinion the case was styled state of mississippi v sam cayhall i guess id better go see him dont you think he said without thinking yeah look adam im not one of the bad guys okay lucas slowly eased to his feet and walked to the edge of his desk where he gently placed his rear he folded his arms and looked down at adam im just doing my job okay ill be involved because i have to watch this place and make sure things are done legally by the book i wont enjoy it but itll get crazy and quite stressful and everybody will be ringing my phone the warden his assistants the attorney generals office the governor you and a hundred others so ill be in the middle of it though i dont want to its the most unpleasant thing about this job i just want you to realize that im here if you need me okay ill always be fair and truthful with you youre assuming sam will allow me to represent him yes im assuming this what are the chances of the execution taking place in four weeks fiftyfifty you never know what the courts will do at the last minute well start preparing in a week or so we have a rather long checklist of things to do to get ready for it sort of a blueprint for death something like that dont think we enjoy it i guess everybody here is just doing their job right its the law of this state if our society wants to kill criminals then someone has to do it adam placed the court opinion in his briefcase and stood in front of lucas thanks i guess for the hospitality dont mention it after you visit with sam ill need to know what happened ill send you a copy of our representation agreement if he signs it thats all i need they shook hands and adam headed for the door one other thing lucas said when they bring sam into the visiting room ask the guards to remove the handcuffs ill make sure they do itll mean a lot to sam thanks good luck the temperature had risen at least ten degrees when adam left the building and walked past the same two trustees sweeping the same dirt in the same languid motions he stopped on the front steps and for a moment watched a gang of inmates gather litter along the highway less than a hundred yards away an armed guard on a horse in a ditch watched them traffic zipped along without slowing adam wondered what manner of criminals were these who were allowed to work outside the fences and so close to a highway no one seemed to care about it but him he walked the short distance to his car and was sweating by the time he opened the door and started the engine he followed the drive through the parking lot behind manns office then turned left onto the main prison road again he was passing neat little white homes with flowers and trees in the front yard what a civilized little community an arrow on a road sign pointed left to unit he turned very slowly and within seconds was on a dirt road that led quickly to some serious fencing and razor wire the row at parchman had been built in and officially labeled the maximum security unit or simply msu an obligatory plaque on a wall inside listed the date the name of the governor then the names of various important and longforgotten officials who were instrumental in its construction and of course the names of the architect and contractor it was state of the art for that period a singlestory flat roof building of red brick stretching in two long rectangles from the center adam parked in the dirt lot between two other cars and stared at it no bars were visible from the outside no guards patrolled around it if not for the fences and barbed wire it could almost pass for an elementary school in the suburbs inside a caged yard at the end of one wing a solitary inmate dribbled a basketball on a grassless court and flipped it against a crooked backboard the fence in front of adam was at least twelve feet high and crowned at the top with thick strands of barbed wire and a menacing roll of shiny razor wire it ran straight and true to the corner where it joined a watchtower where guards looked down the fence encompassed the row on all four sides with remarkable symmetry and in each corner an identical tower stood high above with a glassenclosed guard station at the top just beyond the fence the crops started and seemed to run forever the row was literally in the middle of a cotton field adam stepped from his car felt suddenly claustrophobic and squeezed the handle of his thin briefcase as he glared through the chain link at the hot flat little building where they killed people he slowly removed his jacket and noticed his shirt was already spotted and sticking to his chest the knot in his stomach had returned with a vengeance his first few steps toward the guard station were slow and awkward primarily because his legs were unsteady and his knees were shivering his fancy tasseled loafers were dusty by the time he stopped under the watchtower and looked up a red bucket the type one might use to wash a car was being lowered on a rope by an earnest woman in a uniform put your keys in the bucket she explained efficiently leaning over the railing the barbed wire on the top of the fence was five feet below her adam quickly did as she instructed he carefully laid his keys in the bucket where they joined a dozen other key rings she jerked it back and he watched it rise for a few seconds then stop she tied the rope somehow and the little red bucket hung innocently in the air a nice breeze would have moved it gently but at the moment in this stifling vacuum there was scarcely enough air to breathe the winds had died years ago the guard was finished with him someone somewhere pushed a button or pulled a lever adam had no idea who did it but a humming noise kicked in and the first of two bulky chainlink gates began to slide a few feet so he could enter he walked fifteen feet along the dirt drive then stopped as the first gate closed behind him he was in the process of learning the first basic rule of prison security every protected entrance has either two locked doors or gates when the first gate stopped behind him and locked itself into place the second one dutifully snatched itself free and rolled along the fence as this was happening a very stocky guard with arms as big as adams legs appeared at the main door of the unit and began to amble along the brick path to the entrance he had a hard belly and a thick neck and he sort of waited for adam as adam waited for the gates to secure everything he eased forward an enormous black hand and said sergeant packer adam shook it and immediately noticed the shiny black cowboy boots on sergeant packers feet adam hall he said trying to manage the hand here to see sam packer stated as a fact yes sir adam said wondering if everyone here referred to him simply as sam your first visit here they began a slow walk toward the front of the building yeah adam said looking at the open windows along the nearest tier are all death row inmates here he asked yep got fortyseven as of today lost one last week they were almost to the main door lost one yeah the big court reversed had to move him in with the general population i have to frisk you they were at the door and adam glanced around nervously to see just exactly where it was that packer wished to conduct the frisk just spread your legs a little packer said already taking the briefcase and placing it on the concrete the fancy tasseled loafers were now stuck in place though he was dizzy and momentarily without the use of all his faculties adam could not at this horrible moment remember anyone ever asking him to spread his legs even just a little but packer was a pro he patted expertly around the socks moved up quite delicately to the knees which were more than a little wobbly then around the waist in no time flat adams first frisk was mercifully finished just seconds after it started when sergeant packer made a rather cursory pass under both arms as if adam might be wearing a shoulder harness with a small pistol inside it packer deftly stuck his massive right hand into the briefcase then handed it back to adam not a good day to see sam he said so ive heard adam replied slinging his jacket once again over his shoulder he faced the iron door as if it was now time to enter the row this way packer mumbled as he stepped down onto the grass and headed around the corner adam obediently followed along yet another little redbrick trail until they came to a plain nondescript door with weeds growing beside it the door was not marked or labeled whats this adam asked he vaguely recalled goodmans description of this place but at the moment all details were fuzzy conference room packer produced a key and unlocked the door adam glanced around before he entered and tried to gather his bearings the door was next to the central section of the unit and it occurred to adam that perhaps the guards and their administrators didnt want the lawyers underfoot and poking around thus the outside entrance he took a deep breath and stepped inside there were no other lawyers visiting their clients and this was particularly comforting to adam this meeting could become tumultuous and perhaps emotional and he preferred to do it in private at least for the moment the room was empty it was large enough for several lawyers to visit and counsel probably thirty feet long and twelve feet wide with a concrete floor and bright fluorescent lighting the wall on the far end was red brick with three windows high at the top just like the exterior of the units tiers it was immediately obvious that the conference room had been added as an afterthought the air conditioner a small window unit was snarling angrily and producing much less than it should the room was divided neatly by a solid wall of brick and metal the lawyers had their side and the clients had theirs the partition was made of brick for the first three feet then a small counter provided the lawyers a place to sit their mandatory legal pads and take their pages of mandatory notes a bright green screen of thick metal grating sat solidly on the counter and ran up to the ceiling adam walked slowly to the end of the room sidestepping a varied assortment of chairs green and gray government throwaways folding types narrow cafeteria seats im gonna lock this door packer said as he stepped outside well get sam the door slammed and adam was alone he quickly picked out a place at the end of the room just in case another lawyer arrived at which time the other lawyer would undoubtedly take a position far to the other end and they could plot strategy with some measure of privacy he pulled a chair to the wooden counter placed his jacket on another chair removed his legal pad unscrewed his pen and began chewing his fingernails he tried to stop the chewing but he couldnt his stomach flipped violently and his heels twitched out of control he looked through the screen and studied the inmates portion of the room the same wooden counter the same array of old chairs in the center of the screen before him was a slit four inches by ten and it would be through this little hole that he would come facetoface with sam cayhall he waited nervously telling himself to be calm take it easy relax he could handle this he scribbled something on the legal pad but honestly couldnt read it he rolled up his sleeves he looked around the room for hidden microphones and cameras but the place was so simple and modest he couldnt imagine anyone trying to eavesdrop if sergeant packer was any indication the staff was laidback almost indifferent he studied the empty chairs on both sides of the screen and wondered how many desperate people in the last hours of their lives had met here with their attorneys and listened for words of hope how many urgent pleas had passed through this screen as the clock ticked steadily away how many lawyers had sat where he was now sitting and told their clients that there was nothing left to do that the execution would proceed it was a somber thought and it calmed adam quite a bit he was not the first to be here and he would not be the last he was a lawyer well trained blessed with a quick mind and arriving here with the formidable resources of kravitz bane behind him he could do his job his legs slowly became still and he quit chewing his fingernails a door bolt clicked and he jumped through his skin it opened slowly and a young white guard stepped into the inmates side behind him in a bright red jumpsuit hands cuffed behind was sam cayhall he glowered around the room squinting through the screen until his eyes focused on adam a guard pulled at his elbow and led him to a spot directly across from the lawyer he was thin pale and six inches shorter than both guards but they seemed to give him plenty of room who are you he hissed at adam who at the moment had a fingernail between his teeth one guard pulled a chair behind sam and the other guard sat him in it he stared at adam the guards backed away and were about to leave when adam said could you remove the handcuffs please no sir we cant adam swallowed hard just take them off okay were gonna be here for a while he said mustering a degree of forcefulness the guards looked at each other as if this request had never been heard a key was quickly produced and the handcuffs were removed sam was not impressed he glared at adam through the opening in the screen as the guards made their noisy departure the door slammed and the deadbolt clicked they were alone the cayhall version of a family reunion the air conditioner rattled and spewed and for a long minute it made the only sounds though he tried valiantly adam was unable to look sam in the eyes for more than two seconds he busied himself with important note taking on the legal pad and as he numbered each line he could feel the heat of sams stare finally adam stuck a business card through the opening my name is adam hall im a lawyer with kravitz bane chicago and memphis sam patiently took the card and examined it front and back adam watched every move his fingers were wrinkled and stained brown with cigarette smoke his face was pallid the only color coming from the salt and pepper stubble of five days growth his hair was long gray and oily and slicked back severely adam decided quickly that he looked nothing like the frozen images from the video nor did he resemble the last known photos of himself those from the trial he was quite an old man now with pasty delicate skin and layers of tiny wrinkles around his eyes deep burrows of age and misery cut through his forehead the only attractive feature was the set of piercing indigo eyes that lifted themselves from the card you jew boys never quit do you he said in a pleasant even tone there was no hint of anger im not jewish adam said successfully returning the stare then how can you work for kravitz bane he asked as he set the card aside his words were soft slow and delivered with the patience of a man whod spent nine and a half years alone in a sixbynine cell were an equal opportunity employer thats nice all proper and legal i presume in full compliance with all civil rights decisions and federal dogooder laws of course how many partners are in kravitz bane now adam shrugged the number varied from year to year around a hundred and fifty a hundred and fifty partners and how many are women adam hesitated as he tried to count i really dont know probably a dozen a dozen sam repeated barely moving his lips his hands were folded and still and his eyes did not blink so less than ten percent of your partners are women how many nigger partners do you have could we refer to them as blacks oh sure but of course that too is an antiquated term they now want to be called africanamericans surely youre politically correct enough to know this adam nodded but said nothing how many africanamerican partners do you have four i believe less than three percent my my kravitz bane that great bastion of civil justice and liberal political action does in fact discriminate against africanamericans and femaleamericans i just dont know what to say adam scratched something illegible on his pad he could argue of course that almost a third of the associates were female and that the firm made diligent efforts to sign the top black law students he could explain how they had been sued for reverse discrimination by two white males whose job offers disappeared at the last moment how many jewishamerican partners do you have eighty percent i dont know it really doesnt matter to me well it certainly matters to me i was always embarrassed to be represented by such blatant bigots a lot of people would find it appropriate sam carefully reached into the only visible pocket of his jumpsuit and removed a blue pack of montclairs and a disposable lighter the jumpsuit was unbuttoned halfway down the chest and a thick matting of gray hair showed through the gap the fabric was a very light cotton adam could not imagine life in this place with no air conditioning he lit the cigarette and exhaled toward the ceiling i thought i was through with you people they didnt send me down here i volunteered why i dont know you need a lawyer and why are you so nervous adam jerked his fingernails from his teeth and stopped tapping his feet im not nervous sure you are ive seen lots of lawyers around this place and ive never seen one as nervous as you whats the matter kid you afraid im coming through the screen after you adam grunted and tried to smile dont be silly im not nervous how old are you twentysix you look twentytwo when did you finish law school last year just great the jewish bastards have sent a greenhorn to save me ive known for a long time that they secretly wanted me dead now this proves it i killed some jews now they want to kill me i was right all along you admit you killed the kramer kids what the hell kind of question is that the jury said i did for nine years the appeals courts have said the jury was right thats all that matters who the hell are you asking me questions like that you need a lawyer mr cayhall im here to help i need a lot of things boy but i damned sure dont need an eager little tenderfoot like you to give me advice youre dangerous son and youre too ignorant to know it again the words came deliberately and without emotion he held the cigarette between the index and middle finger of his right hand and casually flipped ashes in an organized pile in a plastic bowl his eyes blinked occasionally his face showed neither feeling nor sentiment adam took meaningless notes then tried again to stare through the slit into sams eyes look mr cayhall im a lawyer and i have a strong moral conviction against the death penalty i am well educated well trained well read on eighth amendment issues and i can be of assistance to you thats why im here free of charge free of charge sam repeated how generous do you realize son that i get at least three offers a week now from lawyers who want to represent me for free big lawyers famous lawyers rich lawyers some real slimy snakes theyre all perfectly willing to sit where youre now sitting file all the last minute motions and appeals do the interviews chase the cameras hold my hand in the last hours watch them gas me then do yet another press conference then sign a book deal a movie deal maybe a television miniseries deal about the life and times of sam cayhall a real klan murderer you see son im famous and what i did is now legendary and since theyre about to kill me then im about to become even more famous thus the lawyers want me im worth a lot of money a sick country right adam was shaking his head i dont want any of that i promise ill put it in writing ill sign a complete confidentiality agreement sam chuckled right and whos going to enforce it after im gone your family adam said forget my family sam said firmly my motives are pure mr cayhall my firm has represented you for seven years so i know almost everything about your file ive also done quite a lot of research into your background join the club ive had my underwear examined by a hundred halfass reporters there are many people who know much about me it seems and all this combined knowledge is of absolutely no benefit to me right now i have four weeks do you know this i have a copy of the opinion four weeks and they gas me so lets get to work you have my word that i will never talk to the press unless you authorize it that ill never repeat anything you tell me and that i will not sign any book or movie deal i swear it sam lit another cigarette and stared at something on the counter he gently rubbed his right temple with his right thumb the cigarette just inches from his hair for a long time the only sound was the gurgling of the overworked window unit sam smoked and contemplated adam doodled on his pad and was quite proud that his feet were motionless and his stomach was not aching the silence was awkward and he figured correctly that sam could sit and smoke and think in utter silence for days are you familiar with barroni sam asked quietly barroni yes barroni came down last week from the ninth circuit california case adam racked his brain for a trace of barroni i might have seen it you might have seen it youre well trained well read etc and you might have seen barroni what kind of halfass lawyer are you im not a halfass lawyer right right what about texas v eekes surely youve read that one when did it come down within six weeks what court fifth circuit eighth amendment dont be stupid sam grunted in genuine disgust do you think id spend my time reading freedom of speech cases this is my ass sitting over here boy these are my wrists and ankles that will be strapped down this is my nose the poison will hit no i dont remember eekes what do you read all the important cases have you read barefoot of course tell me about barefoot what is this a pop quiz this is whatever i want it to be where was barefoot from sam asked i dont remember but the full name was barefoot v estelle a landmark case in in which the supreme court held that death row inmates cannot hold back valid claims on appeal so they can save them for later more or less my my you have read it does it ever strike you as odd how the same court can change its mind whenever it wants to think about it for two centuries the us supreme court allowed legal executions said they were constitutional covered nicely by the eighth amendment then in the us supreme court read the same unchanged constitution and outlawed the death penalty then in the us supreme court said executions were in fact constitutional after all same bunch of turkeys wearing the same black robes in the same building in washington now the us supreme court is changing the rules again with the same constitution the reagan boys are tired of reading too many appeals so they declare certain avenues to be closed seems odd to me seems odd to a lot of people what about dulaney sam asked taking a long drag there was little or no ventilation in the room and a cloud was forming above them wheres it from louisiana surely youve read it im sure i have in fact ive probably read more cases than you but i dont always bother to memorize them unless i plan to use them use them where motions and appeals so youve handled death cases before how many this is the first why am i not comforted by this those jewishamerican lawyers at kravitz bane sent you down here to experiment on me right get yourself a little handson training so you can stick it on your resume i told you they didnt send me down here how about garner goodman is he still alive yes hes your age then he doesnt have long does he and tyner mr tyners doing well ill tell him you asked oh please do tell him i really miss him both of them actually hell it took me almost two years to fire them they worked their butts off for you tell them to send me a bill sam chuckled to himself his first smile of the meeting he methodically stubbed out the cigarette in the bowl and lit another fact is mr hall i hate lawyers thats the american way lawyers chased me indicted me prosecuted me persecuted me screwed me then sent me to this place since ive been here theyve hounded me screwed me some more lied to me and now theyre back in the form of you a rookie zealot without a clue of how to find the damned courthouse you might be surprised itll be a helluva surprise son if you know your ass from a hole in the ground youll be the first clown from kravitz bane to possess such information theyve kept you out of the gas chamber for the past seven years and im supposed to be thankful there are fifteen residents of the row with more seniority than me why should i be next ive been here for nine and a half years treemonts been here for fourteen years of course hes an africanamerican and that always helps they have more rights you know its much harder to execute one of them because whatever they did was someone elses fault thats not true how the hell do you know whats true a year ago you were still in school still wearing faded blue jeans all day long still drinking beer at happy hours with your idealistic little buddies you havent lived son dont tell me whats true so youre in favor of swift executions for africanamericans not a bad idea really in fact most of these punks deserve the gas im sure thats a minority opinion on death row you could say that and you of course are different and dont belong here no i dont belong here im a political prisoner sent here by an egomaniac who used me for his own political purposes can we discuss your guilt or innocence no but i didnt do what the jury said i did so you had an accomplice someone else planted the bomb sam rubbed the deep burrows in his forehead with his middle finger as if he was flipping the bird but he wasnt he was suddenly in a deep and prolonged trance the conference room was much cooler than his cell the conversation was aimless but at least it was conversation with someone other than a guard or the invisible inmate next door he would take his time make it last as long as possible adam studied his notes and pondered what to say next they had been chatting for twenty minutes sparring really with no clear direction he was determined to confront their familys history before he left he just didnt know how to do it minutes passed neither looked at the other sam lit another montclair why do you smoke so much adam finally said id rather die of lung cancer its a common desire on death row how many packs a day three or four another minute passed sam slowly finished the cigarette and kindly asked whered you go to school law school at michigan undergrad at pepperdine wheres that california is that where you grew up yeah how many states have the death penalty thirtyeight most of them dont use it though it seems to be popular only in the deep south texas florida and california you know our esteemed legislature has changed the law here now we can die by lethal injection its more humane aint that nice doesnt apply to me though since my conviction was years ago ill get to sniff the gas maybe not youre twentysix yeah born in thats right sam removed another cigarette from the pack and tapped the filter on the counter where memphis adam replied without looking at him you dont understand son this state needs an execution and i happen to be the nearest victim louisiana texas and florida are killing them like flies and the lawabiding people of this state cant understand why our little chamber is not being used the more violent crime we have the more people beg for executions makes em feel better like the system is working hard to eliminate murderers the politicians openly campaign with promises of more prisons and tougher sentences and more executions thats why those clowns in jackson voted for lethal injection its supposed to be more humane less objectionable thus easier to implement you follow adam nodded his head slightly its time for an execution and my number is up thats why theyre pushing like hell you cant stop it we can certainly try i want the opportunity sam finally lit the cigarette he inhaled deeply then whistled the smoke through a small opening in his lips he leaned forward slightly on his elbows and peered through the hole in the screen what part of california are you from southern la adam glanced at the piercing eyes then looked away your family still there a wicked pain shot through adams chest and for a second his heart froze sam puffed his cigarette and never blinked my fathers dead he said with a shaky voice and sank a few inches in his chair a long minute passed as sam sat poised on the edge of his seat finally he said and your mother she lives in portland remarried wheres your sister he asked adam closed his eyes and dropped his head shes in college he mumbled i believe her name is carmen right sam asked softly adam nodded howd you know he asked through gritted teeth sam backed away from the screen and sank into the folding metal chair he dropped his current cigarette on the floor without looking at it why did you come here he asked his voice much firmer and tougher howd you know it was me the voice you sound like your father whyd you come here eddie sent me their eyes met briefly then sam looked away he slowly leaned forward and planted both elbows on both knees his gaze was fixed on something on the floor he grew perfectly still then he placed his right hand over his eyes phillip naifeh was sixtythree years old and nineteen months away from retirement nineteen months and four days he had served as superintendent of the state department of corrections for twentyseven years and in doing so had survived six governors an army of state legislators a thousand prisoners lawsuits countless intrusions by the federal courts and more executions than he cared to remember the warden as he preferred to be called although the title was officially nonexistent under the terminology of the mississippi code was a fullblooded lebanese whose parents had immigrated in the twenties and settled in the delta they had prospered with a small grocery store in clarksdale where his mother had become somewhat famous for her homemade lebanese desserts he was educated in the public schools went off to college returned to the state and for reasons long forgotten had become involved in criminal justice he hated the death penalty he understood societys yearning for it and long ago he had memorized all the sterile reasons for its necessity it was a deterrent it removed killers it was the ultimate punishment it was biblical it satisfied the publics need for retribution it relieved the anguish of the victims family if pressed he could make these arguments as persuasively as any prosecutor he actually believed one or two of them but the burden of the actual killing was his and he despised this horrible aspect of his job it was phillip naifeh who walked with the condemned man from his cell to the isolation room as it was called to suffer the last hour before death it was phillip naifeh who led him next door to the chamber room and supervised the strapping of the legs arms and head any last words he had uttered twentytwo times in twentyseven years it was left to him to tell the guards to lock the chamber door and it was left to him to nod to the executioner to pull the levers to mix the deadly gas he had actually watched the faces of the first two as they died then decided it was best to watch the faces of the witnesses in the small room behind the chamber he had to select the witnesses he had to do a hundred things listed in a manual of how to legally kill death row inmates including the pronouncing of death the removal of the body from the chamber the spraying of it to remove the gas from the clothing and on and on he had once testified before a legislative committee in jackson and given his opinions about the death penalty he had a better idea he had explained to deaf ears and his plan would keep condemned killers in the maximum security unit in solitary confinement where they couldnt kill couldnt escape and would never be eligible for parole they would eventually die on death row but not at the hands of the state this testimony made headlines and almost got him fired nineteen months and four days he thought to himself as he gently ran his fingers through his thick gray hair and slowly read the latest opinion from the fifth circuit lucas mann sat across the desk and waited four weeks naifeh said putting the opinion aside how many appeals are left he asked in a gentle drawl the usual assortment of last ditch efforts mann replied when did this come down early this morning sam will appeal it to the supreme court where it will probably be ignored this should take a week or so whats your opinion counselor the meritorious issues have all been presented at this point id give it a fifty percent chance of happening in four weeks thats a lot something tells me this one might go off in the interminable workings of death penalty roulette a percent chance was close to a certainty the process would have to be started the manual would have to be consulted after years of endless appeals and delays the last four weeks would be over in the blink of an eye have you talked to sam the warden asked briefly i took him a copy of the opinion this morning garner goodman called me yesterday said they were sending down one of their young associates to talk to sam did you take care of it i talked to garner and i talked to the associate his name is adam hall and hes meeting with sam as we speak should be interesting sams his grandfather his what you heard me sam cayhall is adam halls paternal grandfather we were doing a routine background on adam hall yesterday and noticed a few gray spots i called the fbi in jackson and within two hours they had plenty of circumstantial evidence i confronted him this morning and he confessed i dont think hes trying to hide it but he has a different name its a long story they havent seen each other since adam was a toddler his father fled the state after sam was arrested for the bombing moved out west changed names drifted around in and out of work sounds like a real loser killed himself in anyway adam here goes to college and makes perfect grades goes to law school at michigan a top ten school and is the editor of the law review takes a job with our pals at kravitz bane and he shows up this morning for the reunion with his grandfather naifeh now raked both hands through his hair and shook his head how wonderful as if we needed more publicity more idiotic reporters asking more asinine questions theyre meeting now i am assuming sam will agree to allow the kid to represent him i certainly hope so weve never executed an inmate without a lawyer we should do some lawyers without the inmates naifeh said with a forced smile his hatred for lawyers was legendary and lucas didnt mind he understood he had once estimated that phillip naifeh had been named as a defendant in more lawsuits than anyone else in the history of the state he had earned the right to hate lawyers i retire in nineteen months he said as if lucas had never heard this whos next after sam lucas thought a minute and tried to catalog the voluminous appeals of fortyseven inmates no one really the pizza man came close four months ago but he got his stay itll probably expire in a year or so but there are other problems with his case i cant see another execution for a couple of years the pizza man forgive me malcolm friar killed three pizza delivery boys in a week at trial he claimed robbery was not the motive said he was just hungry naifeh raised both hands and nodded okay okay i remember hes the nearest after sam probably its hard to say i know naifeh gently pushed away from his desk and walked to a window his shoes were somewhere under the desk he thrust his hands in his pockets pressed his toes into the carpet and thought deeply for a while he had been hospitalized after the last execution a mild heart flutter as his doctor preferred to call it hed spent a week in a hospital bed watching his little flutter on a monitor and promised his wife he would never suffer through another execution if he could somehow survive sam then he could retire at full pension he turned and stared at his friend lucas mann im not doing this one lucas im passing the buck to another man one of my subordinates a younger man a good man a man who can be trusted a man whos never seen one of these shows a man whos just itching to get blood on his hands not nugent thats the man retired colonel george nugent my trusted assistant hes a nut yes but hes our nut lucas hes a fanatic for details discipline organization hell hes the perfect choice ill give him the manual tell him what i want and hell do a marvelous job of killing sam cayhall hell be perfect george nugent was an assistant superintendent at parchman he had made a name for himself by implementing a most successful boot camp for first offenders it was a brutal sixweek ordeal in which nugent strutted and swaggered around in black boots cursing like a drill instructor and threatening gang rape for the slightest infraction the first offenders rarely came back to parchman nugents crazy phillip its a matter of time before he hurts someone right now you understand were going to let him hurt sam just the way it should be done by the book heaven knows how much nugent loves a book to go by hes the perfect choice lucas itll be a flawless execution it really mattered little to lucas mann he shrugged and said youre the boss thanks naifeh said just watch nugent okay ill watch him on this end and you watch the legal stuff well get through it this will be the biggest one yet lucas said i know ill have to pace myself im an old man lucas gathered his file from the desk and headed for the door ill call you after the kid leaves hes supposed to check in with me before he goes id like to meet him naifeh said hes a nice kid some family huh the nice kid and his condemned grandfather had spent fifteen minutes in silence the only sound in the room the uneasy rattling of the overworked ac unit at one point adam had walked to the wall and waved his hand before the dusty vents there was a trace of cool air he leaned on the counter with his arms folded and stared at the door as far away from sam as possible he was leaning and staring when the door opened and the head of sergeant packer appeared just checking to see if things were okay he said glancing first at adam then down the room and through the screen at sam who was leaning forward in his chair with a hand over his face were fine adam said without conviction good good packer said and hurriedly closed the door it locked and adam slowly made his way back to his chair he pulled it close to the screen and rested on his elbows sam ignored him for a minute or two then wiped his eyes with a sleeve and sat up they looked at each other we need to talk adam said quietly sam nodded but said nothing he wiped his eyes again this time with the other sleeve he removed a cigarette and put it between his lips his hand shook as he flicked the lighter he puffed quickly so youre really alan he said in a low husky voice at one time i guess i didnt know it until my father died you were born in correct my first grandson adam nodded and glanced away you disappeared in something like that i dont remember it you know my earliest memories are from california i heard eddie went to california and that there was another child someone told me later her name was carmen i would hear bits and pieces over the years knew yall were somewhere in southern california but he did a good job of disappearing we moved around a lot when i was a kid i think he had trouble keeping a job you didnt know about me no the family was never mentioned i found out about it after his funeral who told you lee sam closed his eyes tightly for a moment then puffed again how is she okay i guess whyd you go to work for kravitz bane its a good firm did you know they represented me yes so youve been planning this for about five years but why i dont know you must have a reason the reason is obvious youre my grandfather okay like it or not youre who you are and im who i am and im here now so what are we going to do about it i think you should leave im not leaving sam ive been preparing for this a long time preparing for what you need legal representation you need help thats why im here im beyond help theyre determined to gas me okay for lots of reasons you dont need to get involved in it why not well for one its hopeless youre gonna get hurt if you bust your ass and youre unsuccessful second your true identity will be revealed itll be very embarrassing life for you will be much better if you remain adam hall i am adam hall and i dont plan to change it im also your grandson and we cant change that can we so whats the big deal itll be embarrassing for your family eddie did a great job of protecting you dont blow it my covers already blown my firm knows it i told lucas mann and that jerkll tell everybody dont trust him for a minute look sam you dont understand i dont care if he tells i dont care if the world knows that im your grandson im tired of these dirty little family secrets im a big boy now i can think for myself plus im a lawyer and my skin is getting thick i can handle it sam relaxed a bit in his chair and looked at the floor with a pleasant little smirk the kind grown men often give to little boys who are acting bigger than their years he grunted at something and very slowly nodded his head you just dont understand kid he said again now in the measured patient tone so explain it to me adam said it would take forever we have four weeks you can do a lot of talking in four weeks just exactly what is it that you want to hear adam leaned even closer on his elbows pen and pad ready his eyes were inches from the slit in the screen first i want to talk about the case appeals strategies the trials the bombing who was with you that night no one was with me that night we can talk about it later were talking about it now i was alone do you hear me okay second i want to know about my family why why not why keep it buried i want to know about your father and his father and your brothers and cousins i may dislike these people when its all over but i have the right to know about them ive been deprived of this information all of my life and i want to know its nothing remarkable oh really well sam i think its pretty remarkable that youve made it here to death row this is a pretty exclusive society throw in the fact that youre white middle class almost seventy years old and it becomes even more remarkable i want to know how and why you got here what made you do those things how many klansmen were in my family and why how many other people were killed along the way and you think ill just spill my guts with all this yeah i think so youll come around im your grandson sam the only living breathing relative who gives a damn about you anymore youll talk sam youll talk to me well since ill be so talkative what else will we discuss eddie sam took a deep breath and closed his eyes you dont want much do you he said softly adam scribbled something meaningless on his pad it was now time for the ritual of another cigarette and sam performed it with even more patience and care another blast of blue smoke joined the fog well above their heads his hands were steady again when we get finished with eddie who do you want to talk about i dont know that should keep us busy for four weeks when do we talk about you anytime adam reached into his briefcase and removed a thin file he slid a sheet of paper and a pen through the opening this is an agreement for legal representation sign at the bottom without touching it sam read it from a distance so i sign up again with kravitz bane sort of what do you mean sort of says right here i agree to let those jews represent me again it took me forever to fire them and hell i wasnt even paying them the agreement is with me sam okay youll never see those guys unless you want to i dont want to fine i happen to work for the firm and so the agreement must be with the firm its easy ah the optimism of youth everythings easy here i sit less than a hundred feet from the gas chamber clock ticking away on the wall over there getting louder and louder and everythings easy just sign the damned paper sam and then what and then we go to work legally i cant do anything for you until we have that agreement you sign it we go to work and whats the first bit of work youd like to do walk through the kramer bombing very slowly step by step its been done a thousand times well do it again i have a thick notebook full of questions theyve all been asked yeah sam but they havent been answered have they sam stuck the filter between his lips and they havent been asked by me have they you think im lying are you no but you havent told the whole story have you what difference does it make counselor youve read bateman yeah ive memorized bateman and there are a number of soft spots in it typical lawyer if theres new evidence then there are ways to present it all were doing sam is trying to create enough confusion to make some judge somewhere give it a second thought then a third thought then he grants a stay so he can learn more i know how the game is played son adam okay its adam yeah and just call me gramps i suppose you plan to appeal to the governor yes sam inched forward in his chair and moved close to the screen with the index finger of his right hand he began pointing at a spot somewhere in the center of adams nose his face was suddenly harsh his eyes narrow you listen to me adam he growled finger pointing back and forth if i sign this piece of paper you are never to talk to that bastard never do you understand adam watched the finger but said nothing sam decided to continue he is a bogus son of a bitch he is vile sleazy thoroughly corrupt and completely able to mask it all with a pretty smile and a clean haircut he is the only reason im sitting here on death row if you contact him in any way then youre finished as my lawyer so im your lawyer the finger dropped and sam relaxed a bit oh i may give you a shot let you practice on me you know adam the legal profession is really screwed up if i was a free man just trying to make a living minding my own business paying my taxes obeying the laws and such then i couldnt find a lawyer whod take the time to spit on me unless i had money but here i am a convicted killer condemned to die not a penny to my name and ive got lawyers all over the country begging to represent me big rich lawyers with long names preceded with initials and followed by numerals famous lawyers with their own jets and television shows can you explain this of course not nor do i care about it its a sick profession youve gotten yourself in most lawyers are honest and hardworking sure and most of my pals here on death row would be ministers and missionaries if they hadnt been wrongly convicted the governor might be our last chance then they might as well gas me now that pompous assll probably want to witness my execution then hell hold a press conference and replay every detail for the world hes a spineless little worm whos made it this far because of me and if he can milk me for a few more sound bites then hell do it stay away from him we can discuss it later were discussing it now i believe youll give me your word before i sign this paper any more conditions yeah i want something added here so that if i decide to fire you again then you and your firm wont fight me that should be easy let me see it the agreement was passed through the slit again and adam printed a neat paragraph at the bottom he handed it back to sam who read it slowly and laid it on the counter you didnt sign it adam said im still thinking can i ask some questions while youre thinking you can ask them where did you learn to handle explosives here and there there were at least five bombings before kramer all with the same type all very basic dynamite caps fuses kramer of course was different because a timing device was used who taught you how to make bombs have you ever lit a firecracker sure same principle a match to the fuse run like crazy and boom the timing device is a bit more complicated who taught you how to wire one my mother when do you plan to return here tomorrow good heres what well do i need some time to think about this i dont want to talk right now and i damned sure dont want to answer a bunch of questions let me look over this document make some changes and well meet again tomorrow thats wasting time ive wasted almost ten years here whats another day they may not allow me to return if i dont officially represent you this visit is a favor a great bunch of guys arent they tell them youre my lawyer for the next twentyfour hours theyll let you in we have a lot of ground to cover sam id like to get started i need to think okay when you spend over nine years alone in a cell you become real good at thinking and analyzing but you cant do it fast understand it takes longer to sort things out and place them in order im sort of spinnin right now you know youve hit me kinda hard okay ill be better tomorrow we can talk then i promise sure adam placed the cap on his pen and stuck it in his pocket he slid the file into the briefcase and relaxed in his seat ill be staying in memphis for the next couple of months memphis i thought you lived in chicago we have a small office in memphis ill be working out of there the numbers on the card feel free to call anytime what happens when this thing is over i dont know i may go back to chicago are you married no is carmen no whats she like adam folded his hands behind his head and examined the thin fog above them shes very smart very pretty looks a lot like her mother evelyn was a beautiful girl shes still beautiful i always thought eddie was lucky to get her i didnt like her family though and she certainly didnt like eddies adam thought to himself sams chin dropped almost to his chest he rubbed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose this family business will take some work wont it he said without looking yep i may not be able to talk about some things yes you will you owe it to me sam and you owe it to yourself you dont know what youre talking about and you wouldnt want to know all of it try me im sick of secrets why do you want to know so much so i can try and make some sense of it thatll be a waste of time ill have to decide that wont i sam placed his hands on his knees and slowly stood he took a deep breath and looked down at adam through the screen id like to go now their eyes met through the narrow diamonds in the partition sure adam said can i bring you anything no just come back i promise packer closed the door and locked it and together they stepped from the narrow shadow outside the conference room into the blinding midday sun adam closed his eyes and stopped for a second then fished through his pockets in a desperate search for sunglasses packer waited patiently his eyes sensibly covered with a pair of thick imitation raybans his face shielded by the wide brim of an official parchman cap the air was suffocating and almost visible sweat immediately covered adams arms and face as he finally found the sunglasses in his briefcase and put them on he squinted and grimaced and once able to actually see he followed packer along the brick trail and baked grass in front of the unit sam okay packer asked his hands were in his pockets and he was in no hurry i guess you hungry no adam replied as he glanced at his watch it was almost one oclock he wasnt sure if packer was offering prison food or something else but he was taking no chances too bad todays wednesday and that means turnip greens and corn bread mighty good thanks adam was certain that somewhere deep in his genes he was supposed to crave turnip greens and corn bread todays menu should make his mouth drool and his stomach yearn but he considered himself a californian and to his knowledge had never seen turnip greens maybe next week he said hardly believing he was being offered lunch on the row they were at the first of the double gates as it opened packer without removing his hands from his pockets said when you coming back tomorrow that soon yeah im going to be around for a while well nice to meet you he grinned broadly and walked away as adam walked through the second gate the red bucket began its descent it stopped three feet from the ground and he rattled through the selection at the bottom until he found his keys he never looked up at the guard a white minivan with official markings on the door and along the sides was waiting by adams car the drivers window came down and lucas mann leaned out are you in a hurry adam glanced at his watch again not really good hop in i need to talk to you well take a quick tour of the place adam didnt want a quick tour of the place but he was planning to stop by manns office anyway he opened the passengers door and threw his coat and briefcase on a rear seat thankfully the air was at full throttle lucas cool and still impeccably starched looked odd sitting behind the wheel of a minivan he eased away from msu and headed for the main drive howd it go he asked adam tried to recall sams exact description of lucas mann something to the effect that he could not be trusted okay i guess he replied carefully vague are you going to represent him i think so he wants to dwell on it tonight and he wants to see me tomorrow no problem but you need to sign him up tomorrow we need some type of written authorization from him ill get it tomorrow where are we going they turned left and headed away from the front of the prison they passed the last of the neat white houses with shade trees and flower beds and now they were driving through fields of cotton and beans that stretched forever nowhere in particular just thought you might want to see some of our farm we need to cover a few things im listening the decision of the fifth circuit hit the wire at midmorning and weve already had at least three phone calls from reporters they smell blood of course and they want to know if this might be the end for sam i know some of these people dealt with them before on other executions a few are nice guys most are obnoxious jerks but anyway theyre all asking about sam and whether or not he has a lawyer will he represent himself to the very end you know that kind of crap in a field to the right was a large group of inmates in white pants and without shirts they were working the rows and sweating profusely their backs and chests drenched and glistening under the scorching sun a guard on a horse watched them with a rifle what are these guys doing adam asked chopping cotton are they required to no all volunteers its either that or sit in a cell all day they wear white sam wears red i saw a gang by the highway in blue its part of the classification system white means these guys are low risk what were their crimes everything drugs murder repeat offenders you name it but theyve behaved since theyve been here so they wear white and theyre allowed to work the minivan turned at an intersection and the fences and razor wire returned to the left was a series of modern barracks built on two levels and branching in all directions from a central hub if not for the barbed wire and guard towers the unit could pass for a badly designed college dormitory whats that adam asked pointing unit how many units are there im not sure we keep building and tearing down around thirty it looks new oh yes weve been in trouble with the federal courts for almost twenty years so weve been doing lots of building its no secret that the real superintendent of this place has been a federal judge can the reporters wait until tomorrow i need to see what sam has on his mind id hate to talk to them now and then things go badly tomorrow i think i can put them off a day but they wont wait long they passed the last guard tower and unit disappeared they drove at least two miles before the gleaming razor wire of another compound peeked above the fields i talked to the warden this morning after you got here lucas said he said hed like to meet you youll like him he hates executions you know he was hoping to retire in a couple of years without going through another but now it looks doubtful let me guess hes just doing his job right were all doing our jobs here thats my point i get the impression that everybody here wants to pat me on the back and speak to me in sad voices about whats about to happen to poor old sam nobody wants to kill him but youre all just doing your jobs there are plenty of people who want sam dead the governor and the attorney general im sure youre familiar with the governor but the ag is the one youd better watch he of course wants to be governor one day for some reason weve elected in this state a whole crop of these young terribly ambitious politicians who just cant seem to sit still his names roxburgh right thats him he loves cameras and i expect a press conference from him this afternoon if he holds true to form hell take full credit for the victory in the fifth circuit and promise a diligent effort to execute sam in four weeks his office handles these things you know and then it wouldnt surprise me if the governor himself doesnt appear on the evening news with a comment or two my point is this adam there will be enormous pressure from above to make sure there are no more stays they want sam dead for their own political gain theyll milk it for all they can get adam watched the next camp as they drove by on a concrete slab between two buildings a game of basketball was in full force with at least a dozen players on each side all were black next to the court a row of barbells was being pumped and jerked around by some heavy lifters adam noticed a few whites lucas turned onto another road theres another reason he continued louisiana is killing them right and left texas has executed six already this year florida five we havent had an execution in over two years were dragging our feet some people say its time to show these other states that were just as serious about good government as they are just last week in jackson a legislative committee held hearings on the issue there were all sorts of angry statements by our leaders about the endless delays in these matters not surprisingly it was decided that the federal courts are to blame theres lots of pressure to kill somebody and sam happens to be next whos after sam nobody really it could be two years before we get this close again the buzzards are circling why are you telling me this im not the enemy okay im the attorney for the prison not the state of mississippi and youve never been here before i thought youd want to know these things thanks adam said though the information was unsolicited it was certainly useful ill help in any way i can the roofs of buildings could be seen on the horizon is that the front of the prison adam asked yes id like to leave now the memphis office of kravitz bane occupied two floors of a building called brinkley plaza a s edifice on the corner of main and monroe in downtown main street was also known as the midamerica mall cars and trucks had been banished when the city attempted to revitalize its downtown and converted asphalt into tiles fountains and decorative trees only pedestrian traffic was permitted on the mall the building itself had been revitalized and renewed tastefully its main lobby was marble and bronze the k b offices were large and richly decorated with antiques and oakpaneled walls and persian rugs adam was escorted by an attractive young secretary to the corner office of baker cooley the managing partner they introduced themselves shook hands and admired the secretary as she left the room and closed the door cooley leered a bit too long and seemed to hold his breath until the door was completely closed and the glimpse was over welcome south cooley said finally exhaling and sitting in his posh burgundy leather swivel chair thanks i guess youve talked to garner goodman yesterday twice he gave me the score weve got a nice little conference room at the end of this hall with a phone computer plenty of room its yours for the uh duration adam nodded and glanced around the office cooley was in his early fifties a neat man with an organized desk and a clean room his words and hands were quick and he bore the gray hair and dark circles of a frazzled accountant what kind of work goes on here adam asked not much litigation and certainly no criminal work he answered quickly as if criminals were not allowed to set their dirty feet on the thick carpeting and fancy rugs of this establishment adam remembered goodmans description of the memphis branch a boutique firm of twelve good lawyers whose acquisition years earlier by kravitz bane was now a mystery but the additional address looked nice on the letterhead mostly corporate stuff cooley continued we represent some old banks and we do a lot of bond work for local governmental units exhilarating work adam thought the firm itself dates back a hundred and forty years the oldest in memphis by the way been around since the civil war it split up and spun off a few times then merged with the big boys in chicago cooley delivered this brief chronicle with pride as if the pedigree had a damned thing to do with practicing law in how many lawyers adam asked trying to fill in the gaps of a conversation that had started slow and was going nowhere a dozen eleven paralegals nine clerks seventeen secretaries miscellaneous support staff of ten not a bad operation for this part of the country nothing like chicago though youre right about that adam thought im looking forward to visiting here i hope i wont be in the way not at all im afraid we wont be much help though were the corporate types you know office practitioners lots of paperwork and all i havent seen a courtroom in twenty years ill be fine mr goodman and those guys up there will help me cooley jumped to his feet and rubbed his hands as if he wasnt sure what else to do with them well uh darlene will be your secretary shes actually in a pool but ive sort of assigned her to you shell give you a key give you the scoop on parking security phones copiers the works all state of the art really good stuff if you need a paralegal just let me know well steal one from one of the other guys and no that wont be necessary thanks well then lets go look at your office adam followed cooley down the quiet and empty hallway and smiled to himself as he thought of the offices in chicago there the halls were always filled with harried lawyers and busy secretaries phones rang incessantly and copiers and faxes and intercoms beeped and buzzed and gave the place the atmosphere of an arcade it was a madhouse for ten hours a day solitude was found only in the alcoves of the libraries or maybe in the corners of the building where the partners worked this place was as quiet as a funeral parlor cooley pushed open a door and flipped on a switch hows this he asked waving his arm in a broad circle the room was more than adequate a long narrow office with a beautiful polished table in the center and five chairs on each side at one end a makeshift workplace with a phone computer and executives chair had been arranged adam walked along the table glancing at the bookshelves filled with neat but unused law books he peeked through the curtains of the window nice view he said looking three floors below at the pigeons and people on the mall hope its adequate cooley said its very nice itll work just fine ill keep to myself and stay out of your way nonsense if you need anything just give me a call cooley was walking slowly toward adam there is one thing though he said with his eyebrows suddenly serious adam faced him what is it got a call a couple of hours ago from a reporter here in memphis dont know the guy but he said hes been following the cayhall case for years wanted to know if our firm was still handling the case you know i suggested he contact the boys in chicago we of course have nothing to do with it he pulled a scrap of paper from his shirt pocket and handed it to adam it had a name and a phone number ill take care of it adam said cooley took a step closer and crossed his arms on his chest look adam were not trial lawyers you know we do the corporate work moneys great were very low key and we avoid publicity you know adam nodded slowly but said nothing weve never touched a criminal case certainly nothing as huge as this you dont want any of the dirt to rub off on you right i didnt say that not at all no its just that things are different down here this is not chicago our biggest clients happen to be some rather staid and proper old bankers been with us for years and well were just concerned about our image you know what i mean no sure you do we dont deal with criminals and well were very sensitive about the image we project here in memphis you dont deal with criminals never but you represent big banks come on adam you know where im coming from this area of our practice is changing rapidly deregulation mergers failures a real dynamic sector of the law competition is fierce among the big law firms and we dont want to lose clients hell everybody wants banks and you dont want your clients tainted by mine look adam youre from chicago lets keep this matter where it belongs okay its a chicago case handled by you guys up there memphis has nothing to do with it okay this office is part of kravitz bane yeah and this office has nothing to gain by being connected to scum like sam cayhall sam cayhall is my grandfather shit cooleys knees buckled and his arms dropped from his chest youre lying adam took a step toward him im not lying and if you object to my presence here then you need to call chicago this is awful cooley said as he retreated and headed for the door call chicago i might do that he said almost to himself as he opened the door and disappeared mumbling something else welcome to memphis adam said as he sat in his new chair and stared at the blank computer screen he placed the scrap of paper on the table and looked at the name and phone number a sharp hunger pain hit and he realized he hadnt eaten in hours it was almost four he was suddenly weak and tired and hungry he gently placed both feet on the table next to the phone and closed his eyes the day was a blur from the anxiety of driving to parchman and seeing the front gate of the prison from the unexpected meeting with lucas mann to the horror of stepping onto the row to the fear of confronting sam and now the warden wanted to meet him the press wanted to inquire the memphis branch of his firm wanted it all hushed up all this in less than eight hours what could he expect tomorrow they sat next to each other on the deep cushioned sofa with a bowl of microwave popcorn between them their bare feet were on the coffee table amid a half dozen empty cartons of chinese food and two bottles of wine they peered over their toes and watched the television adam held the remote control the room was dark he slowly ate popcorn lee hadnt moved in a long time her eyes were wet but she said nothing the video started for the second time adam pushed the pause button as sam first appeared in handcuffs being rushed from the jail to a hearing where were you when you heard he was arrested he asked without looking at her here in memphis she said quietly but with a strong voice we had been married for a few years i was at home phelps called and said there had been a bombing in greenville at least two people were dead might be the klan he told me to watch the news at noon but i was afraid to a few hours later my mother called and told me they had arrested daddy for the bombing she said he was in jail in greenville howd you react i dont know stunned scared eddie got on the phone and told me that he and mother had been instructed by sam to sneak over to cleveland and retrieve his car i remember eddie kept saying that hed finally done it hed finally done it hed killed someone else eddie was crying and i started crying and i remember it was horrible they got the car yeah no one ever knew it it never came out during any of the trials we were scared the cops would find out about it and make eddie and my mother testify but it never happened where was i let me see you guys lived in a little white house in clanton and im sure you were there with evelyn i dont think she was working at the time but im not sure what kind of work was my father doing i dont remember at one time he worked as a manager in an auto parts store in clanton but he was always changing jobs the video continued with clips of sam being escorted to and from the jail and the courthouse then there was the report that he had been formally indicted for the murders he paused it did any one of you visit sam in jail no not while he was in greenville his bond was very high a half a million dollars i think it was a half a million and at first the family tried to raise the money to bail him out mother of course wanted me to convince phelps to write a check phelps of course said no he wanted no part of it we fought bitterly but i couldnt really blame him daddy stayed in jail i remember one of his brothers trying to borrow against some land but it didnt work eddie didnt want to go to jail to see him and mother wasnt able im not sure sam wanted us there when did we leave clanton lee leaned forward and took her wineglass from the table she sipped and thought for a moment hed been in jail about a month i believe i drove down one day to see mother and she told me eddie was talking about leaving i didnt believe it she said he was embarrassed and humiliated and couldnt face people around town hed just lost his job and he wouldnt leave the house i called him and talked to evelyn eddie wouldnt get on the phone she said he was depressed and disgraced and all that and i remember telling her that we all felt that way i asked her if they were leaving and she distinctly said no about a week later mother called again and said you guys had packed and left in the middle of the night the landlord was calling and wanting rent and no one had seen eddie the house was empty i wish i remembered some of this you were only three adam the last time i saw you you were playing by the garage of the little white house you were so cute and sweet gee thanks several weeks passed then one day eddie called me and told me to tell mother that you guys were in texas and doing okay texas yeah evelyn told me much later that yall sort of drifted westward she was pregnant and anxious to settle down some place he called again and said yall were in california that was the last call for many years years yeah i tried to convince him to come home but he was adamant swore hed never return and i guess he meant it where were my mothers parents i dont know they were not from ford county seems like they lived in georgia maybe florida ive never met them he pushed the button again and the video continued the first trial started in nettles county the camera panned the courthouse lawn with the group of klansmen and rows of policemen and swarms of onlookers this is incredible lee said he stopped it again did you go to the trial once i sneaked in the courthouse and listened to the closing arguments he forbade us to watch any of his three trials mother was not able her blood pressure was out of control and she was taking lots of medication she was practically bedridden did sam know you were there no i sat in the back of the courtroom with a scarf over my head he never saw me what was phelps doing hiding in his office tending to his business praying no one would find out sam cayhall was his fatherinlaw our first separation occurred not long after this trial what do you remember from the trial from the courtroom i remember thinking that sam got himself a good jury his kind of people i dont know how his lawyer did it but they picked twelve of the biggest rednecks they could find i watched the jurors react to the prosecutor and i watched them listen carefully to sams lawyer clovis brazelton he was quite an orator and they hung on every word i was shocked when the jury couldnt agree on a verdict and a mistrial was declared i was convinced he would be acquitted i think he was shocked too the video continued with reactions to the mistrial with generous comments from clovis brazelton with another shot of sam leaving the courthouse then the second trial began with its similarities to the first how long have you worked on this she asked seven years i was a freshman at pepperdine when the idea hit its been a challenge he fastforwarded through the pathetic scene of marvin kramer spilling from his wheelchair after the second trial and stopped with the smiling face of a local anchorwoman as she chattered on about the opening of the third trial of the legendary sam cayhall it was now sam was a free man for thirteen years adam said what did he do he kept to himself farmed a little tried to make ends meet he never talked to me about the bombing or any of his klan activities but he enjoyed the attention in clanton he was somewhat of a local legend down there and he was sort of smug about it mothers health declined and he stayed at home and took care of her he never thought about leaving not seriously he was convinced his legal problems were over hed had two trials and walked away from both of them no jury in mississippi was going to convict a klansman in the late sixties he thought he was invincible he stayed close to clanton avoided the klan and lived a peaceful life i thought hed spend his golden years growing tomatoes and fishing for bream did he ever ask about my father she finished her wine and placed the glass on the table it had never occurred to lee that she would one day be asked to recall in detail so much of this sad little history she had worked so hard to forget it i remember during the first year he was back home he would occasionally ask me if id heard from my brother of course i hadnt we knew you guys were somewhere in california and we hoped you were okay sams a very proud and stubborn person adam he would never consider chasing you guys down and begging eddie to come home if eddie was ashamed of his family then sam felt like he should stay in california she paused and sunk lower into the sofa mother was diagnosed with cancer in and i hired a private investigator to find eddie he worked for six months charged me a bunch of money and found nothing i was nine years old fourth grade that was in salem oregon yeah evelyn told me later that you guys spent time in oregon we moved all the time every year was a different school until i was in the eighth grade then we settled in santa monica you were elusive eddie mustve hired a good lawyer because any trace of cayhall was eliminated the investigator even used some people out there but nothing when did she die nineteen seventyseven we were actually sitting in the front of the church about to start the funeral when eddie slid in a side door and sat behind me dont ask how he knew about mothers death he simply appeared in clanton then disappeared again never said a word to sam drove a rental car so no one could check his plates i drove to memphis the next day and there he was waiting in my driveway we drank coffee for two hours and talked about everything he had school pictures of you and carmen everything was just wonderful in sunny southern california good job nice house in the suburbs evelyn was selling real estate the american dream said he would never return to mississippi not even for sams funeral after swearing me to secrecy he told me about the new names and he gave me his phone number not his address just his phone number any breach of secrecy he threatened and he would simply disappear again he told me not to call him though unless it was an emergency i told him i wanted to see you and carmen and he said that it might happen one day at times he was the same old eddie and at times he was another person we hugged and waved goodbye and i never saw him again adam flipped the remote and the video moved the clear modern images of the third and final trial moved by quickly and there was sam suddenly thirteen years older with a new lawyer as they darted through a side door of the lakehead county courthouse did you go to the third trial no he told me to stay away adam paused the video at what point did sam realize they were coming after him again its hard to say there was a small story in the memphis paper one day about this new district attorney in greenville who wanted to reopen the kramer case it was not a big story just a couple of paragraphs in the middle of the paper i remember reading it with horror i read it ten times and stared at it for an hour after all these years the name sam cayhall was once again in the paper i couldnt believe it i called him and of course he had read it too he said not to worry about two weeks later there was another story a little larger this time with david mcallisters face in the middle of it i called daddy he said everything was okay thats how it got started rather quietly then it just steamrolled the kramer family supported the idea then the naacp got involved one day it became obvious that mcallister was determined to push for a new trial and that it was not going to go away sam was sickened by it and he was scared but he tried to act brave hed won twice he said he could do it again did you call eddie yeah once it was obvious there would be a new indictment i called him and broke the news he didnt say much didnt say much at all it was a brief conversation and i promised to keep him posted i dont think he took it very well it wasnt long before it became a national story and im sure eddie followed it in the media they watched the remaining segments of the third trial in silence mcallisters toothsome face was everywhere and more than once adam wished hed done a bit more editing sam was led away for the last time in handcuffs and the screen went blank has anyone else seen this lee asked no youre the first how did you collect it all it took time a little money a lot of effort its incredible when i was a junior in high school we had this goofy teacher of political science he allowed us to haul in newspapers and magazines and debate the issues of the day someone brought a front page story from the la times about the upcoming trial of sam cayhall in mississippi we kicked it around pretty good then we watched it closely as it took place everyone including myself was quite pleased when he was found guilty but there was a huge debate over the death penalty a few weeks later my father was dead and you finally told me the truth i was horrified that my friends would find out did they of course not im a cayhall a master at keeping secrets it wont be a secret much longer no it wont there was a long pause as they stared at the blank screen adam finally pushed the power button and the television went off he tossed the remote control on the table im sorry lee if this will embarrass you i mean it i wish there was some way to avoid it you dont understand i know and you cant explain it right are you afraid of phelps and his family i despise phelps and his family but you enjoy their money ive earned their money okay ive put up with him for twentyseven years are you afraid your little clubs will ostracize you that theyll kick you out of the country clubs stop it adam im sorry he said its been a weird day im coming out of the closet lee im confronting my past and i guess i expect everyone to be as bold im sorry what does he look like a very old man lots of wrinkles and pale skin hes too old to be locked up in a cage i remember talking to him a few days before his last trial i asked him why he didnt just run away vanish into the night and hide in some place like south america and you know what what he said he thought about it mother had been dead for several years eddie was gone he had read books about mengele and eichmann and other nazi war criminals who disappeared in south america he even mentioned sao paulo said it was a city of twenty million and filled with refugees of all sorts he had a friend another klansman i think who could fix the paperwork and help him hide he gave it a lot of thought i wish he had maybe my father would still be with us two days before he went to parchman i saw him in the jail in greenville it was our last visit i asked him why he hadnt run he said he never dreamed he would get the death penalty i couldnt believe that for years hed been a free man and couldve easily run away it was a big mistake he said not running a mistake that would cost him his life adam placed the popcorn bowl on the table and slowly leaned toward her his head rested on her shoulder she took his hand im sorry youre in the middle of this she whispered he looked so pitiful sitting there in a red death row jumpsuit clyde packer poured a generous serving of a strong brew into a cup with his name on it and began filling out the mornings paperwork he had worked the row for twentyone years the last seven as the shift commander for eight hours each morning he would be one of four tier sergeants in charge of fourteen condemned men two guards and two trustees he completed his forms and checked a clipboard there was a note to call the warden another note said that f m dempsey was low on heart pills and wanted to see the doctor they all wanted to see the doctor he sipped the steaming coffee as he left the office for his morning inspection he checked the uniforms of two guards at the front door and told the young white one to get a haircut msu was not a bad place to work as a general rule death row inmates were quiet and well behaved they spent twentythree hours a day alone in their cells separated from each other and thus unable to instigate trouble they spent sixteen hours a day sleeping they were fed in their cells they were allowed an hour of outdoor recreation per day their hour out as they called it and they could have this time alone if they chose everyone had either a television or a radio or both and after breakfast the four tiers came to life with music and news and soap operas and quiet conversations through the bars the inmates could not see their neighbors next door but they conversed with little trouble arguments erupted occasionally over the volume of someones music but these little spats were quickly settled by the guards the inmates had certain rights and then they had certain privileges the removal of a television or a radio was devastating the row bred an odd camaraderie among those sentenced there half were white half were black and all had been convicted of brutal killings but there was little concern about past deeds and criminal records and generally no real interest in skin color out in the general prison population gangs of all varieties did an effective job of classifying inmates usually on the basis of race on the row however a man was judged by the way he handled his confinement whether they liked each other or not they were all locked together in this tiny corner of the world all waiting to die it was a ragtag little fraternity of misfits drifters outright thugs and coldblooded killers and the death of one could mean the death of all the news of sams new death sentence was whispered along the tiers and through the bars when it made the noon news yesterday the row became noticeably quieter every inmate suddenly wanted to talk to his lawyer there was a renewed interest in all matters legal and packer had noticed several of them plowing through their court files with televisions off and radios down he eased through a heavy door took along drink and walked slowly and quietly along tier a fourteen identical cells six feet wide and nine feet deep faced the hallway the front of each cell was a wall of iron bars so that at no time did an inmate have complete privacy anything he happened to be doing sleeping using the toilet was subject to observation by the guards they were all in bed as packer slowed in front of each little room and looked for a head under the sheets the cell lights were off and the tier was dark the hall man an inmate with special privileges would wake them or rackemup at five breakfast would be served at six eggs toast jam sometimes bacon coffee and fruit juice in a few minutes the row would slowly come to life as fortyseven men shook off their sleep and resumed the interminable process of dying it happened slowly one day at a time as another miserable sunrise brought another blanket of heat into their private little pockets of hell and it happened quickly as it had the day before when a court somewhere rejected a plea or a motion or an appeal and said that an execution must happen soon packer sipped coffee and counted heads and shuffled quietly along through his morning ritual generally msu ran smoothly when routines were unbroken and schedules were followed there were lots of rules in the manual but they were fair and easy to follow everyone knew them but an execution had its own handbook with a different policy and fluctuating guidelines that generally upset the tranquility of the row packer had great respect for phillip naifeh but damned if he didnt rewrite the book before and after each execution there was great pressure to do it all properly and constitutionally and compassionately no two killings had been the same packer hated executions he believed in the death penalty because he was a religious man and when god said an eye for an eye then god meant it he preferred however that they be carried out somewhere else by other people fortunately they had been so rare in mississippi that his job proceeded smoothly with little interference hed been through fifteen in twentyone years but only four since he spoke quietly to a guard at the end of the tier the sun was beginning to peek through the open windows above the tier walkway the day would be hot and suffocating it would also be much quieter there would be fewer complaints about the food fewer demands to see the doctor a scattering of gripes about this and that but on the whole they would be a docile and preoccupied group it had been at least a year and maybe longer since a stay had been withdrawn this close to an execution packer smiled to himself as he searched for a head under the sheets this day would indeed be a quiet one during the first few months of sams career on the row packer had ignored him the official handbook prohibited anything other than necessary contact with inmates and packer had found sam an easy person to leave alone he was a klansman he hated blacks he said little he was bitter and surly at least in the early days but the routine of doing nothing for eight hours a day gradually softens the edges and with time they reached a level of communication that consisted of a handful of short words and grunts after nine and a half years of seeing each other every day sam could on occasion actually grin at packer there were two types of killers on the row packer had decided after years of study there were the coldblooded killers who would do it again if given the chance and there were those who simply made mistakes and would never dream of shedding more blood those in the first group should be gassed quickly those in the second group caused great discomfort for packer because their executions served no purpose society would not suffer or even notice if these men were released from prison sam was a solid member of the second group he could be returned to his home where he would soon die a lonesome death no packer did not want sam cayhall executed he shuffled back along tier a sipping his coffee and looking at the dark cells his tier was the nearest to the isolation room which was next door to the chamber room sam was in number six on tier a literally less than ninety feet from the gas chamber he had requested a move a few years back because of some silly squabble with cecil duff then his nextdoor neighbor sam was now sitting in the dark on the edge of his bed packer stopped walked to the bars mornin sam he said softly mornin sam replied squinting at packer sam then stood in the center of his room and faced the door he was wearing a dingy white tee shirt and baggy boxer shorts the usual attire for inmates on the row because it was so hot the rules required the bright red coveralls to be worn outside the cell but inside they wore as little as possible its gonna be a hot one packer said the usual early morning greeting wait till august sam said the standard reply to the usual early morning greeting you okay packer asked never felt better your lawyer said he was coming back today yeah thats what he said i guess i need lots of lawyers huh packer sure looks that way packer took a sip of coffee and glanced down the tier the windows behind him were to the south and a trickle of sunlight was making its way through see you later sam he said and eased away he checked the remaining cells and found all his boys the doors clicked behind him as he left tier a and returned to the front the one light in thecell was above the stainless steel sink made of stainless steel so it couldnt be chipped and then used as a weapon or suicide device under the sink was a stainless steel toilet sam turned on his light and brushed his teeth it was almost fivethirty sleep had been difficult he lit a cigarette and sat on the edge of his bed studying his feet and staring at the painted concrete floor that somehow retained heat in the summer and cold in the winter his only shoes a pair of rubber shower shoes which he loathed were under the bed he owned one pair of wool socks which he slept in during the winter his remaining assets consisted of a black and white television a radio a typewriter six tee shirts with holes five pairs of plain white boxer shorts a toothbrush comb nail clippers an oscillating fan and a twelvemonth wall calendar his most valuable asset was a collection of law books he had gathered and memorized over the years they were also placed neatly on the cheap wooden shelves across from his bunk in a cardboard box on the floor between the shelves and the door was an accumulation of bulky files the chronological legal history of state of mississippi v sam cayhall it too had been committed to memory his balance sheet was lean and short and other than the death warrant there were no liabilities the poverty had bothered him at first but those concerns were dispelled years ago family legend held that his greatgrandfather had been a wealthy man with acreage and slaves but no modern cayhall was worth much he had known condemned men who had agonized over their wills as if their heirs would brawl over their old televisions and dirty magazines he was considering preparing his own last will and testament and leaving his wool socks and dirty underwear to the state of mississippi or perhaps the naacp to his right was j b gullitt an illiterate white kid whod raped and killed a homecoming queen three years earlier gullitt had come within days of execution before sam intervened with a crafty motion sam pointed out several unresolved issues and explained to the fifth circuit that gullitt had no lawyer a stay was immediately granted and gullitt became a friend for life to his left was hank henshaw the reputed leader of alongforgotten band of thugs known as the redneck mafia hank and his motley gang had hijacked an eighteenwheeler one night planning only to steal its cargo the driver produced a gun and was killed in the ensuing shootout hanks family was paying good lawyers and thus he was not expected to die for many years the three neighbors referred to their little section of msu as rhodesia sam flipped the cigarette into the toilet and reclined on his bed the day before the kramer bombing he had stopped at eddies house in clanton he couldnt remember why except that he did deliver some fresh spinach from his garden and he had played with little alan now adam for a few minutes in the front yard it was april and warm he remembered and his grandson was barefoot he remembered the chubby little feet with a bandaid around one toe he had cut it on a rock alan had explained with great pride the kid loved bandaids always had one on a finger or a knee evelyn held the spinach and shook her head as he proudly showed his grandfather a whole box of assorted adhesives that was the last time he had seen alan the bombing took place the next day and sam spent the next ten months in jail by the time the second trial was over and he was released eddie and his family were gone he had too much pride to give chase there had been rumors and gossip of their whereabouts lee said they were in california but she couldnt find them years later she talked to eddie and learned of the second child a girl named carmen there were voices at the end of the tier then the flush of a toilet then a radio death row was creaking to life sam combed his oily hair lit another montclair and studied the calendar on the wall today was july he had twentyseven days he sat on the edge of his bed and studied his feet some more j b gullitt turned on his television to catch the news and as sam puffed and scratched his ankles he listened to the nbc affiliate in jackson after the rundown of local shootings robberies and killings the anchorman delivered the hot news that an execution was materializing up at parchman the fifth circuit he reported eagerly had lifted the stay for sam cayhall parchmans most famous inmate and the date was now set for august authorities believe that cayhalls appeals have been exhausted the voice said and the execution could take place sam turned on his television as usual the audio preceded the picture by a good ten seconds and he listened as the attorney general himself predicted justice for mr cayhall after all these many years a grainy face formed on the screen with words spewing forth and then there was roxburgh smiling and frowning at the same time deep in thought as he relished for the cameras the scenario of finally hauling mr cayhall into the gas chamber back to the anchorperson a local kid with a peach fuzz mustache who wrapped up the story by blitzing through sams horrible crime while over his shoulder in the background was a crude illustration of a klansman in a mask and pointed hood a gun a burning cross and the letters kkk finished the depiction the kid repeated the date august as if his viewers should circle their calendars and plan to take the day off then they were on to the weather he turned off the television and walked to the bars did you hear it sam gullitt called out from next door yep its gonna get crazy man yep look on the bright side man whats that youve only got four weeks of it gullitt chuckled as he hit this punch line but he didnt laugh long sam pulled some papers from the file and sat on the edge of his bed there were no chairs in the cell he read through adams agreement of representation a twopage document with a page and a half of language on all margins sam had made neat precise notes with a pencil and he had added paragraphs on the backs of the sheets another idea hit him and he found room to add it with a cigarette in his right fingers he held the document with his left and read it again and again finally sam reached to his shelves and carefully took down his ancient royal portable typewriter he balanced it perfectly on his knees he inserted a sheet of paper and began typing at ten minutes after six the doors on the north end of tier a clicked and opened and two guards entered the hallway one pushed a cart with fourteen trays stacked neatly in slots they stopped at cell number one and slid the metal tray through a narrow opening in the door the occupant of number one was a skinny cuban who was waiting at the bars shirtless in his drooping briefs he grabbed the tray like a starving refugee and without a word took it to the edge of his bed this mornings menu was two scrambled eggs four pieces of toasted white bread a fat slice of bacon two scrawny containers of grape jelly a small bottle of prepackaged orange juice and a large styrofoam cup of coffee the food was warm and filling and had the distinction of being approved by the federal courts they moved to the next cell where the inmate was waiting they were always waiting always standing by the door like hungry dogs youre eleven minutes late the inmate said quietly as he took his tray the guards did not look at him sue us one said ive got my rights your rights are a pain in the ass dont talk to me that way ill sue you for it youre abusive the guards rolled away to the next door with no further response just part of the daily ritual sam was not waiting at the door he was busy at work in his little law office when breakfast arrived i figured youd be typing a guard said as they stopped in front of number six sam slowly placed the typewriter on the bed love letters he said as he stood well whatever youre typing sam youd better hurry the cooks already talking about your last meal tell him i want microwave pizza hell probably screw that up maybe ill just go for hot dogs and beans sam took his tray through the opening its your call sam last guy wanted steak and shrimp can you imagine steak and shrimp around this place did he get it no he lost his appetite and they filled him full of valium instead not a bad way to go quiet j b gullitt yelled from the next cell the guards eased the cart a few feet down the tier and stopped in front of jb who was gripping the bars with both hands they kept their distance well well arent we frisky this morning one said why cant you assholes just serve the food in silence i mean do you think we want to wake up each morning and start the day by listening to your cute little comments just give me the food man gee jb were awful sorry we just figured you guys were lonely you figured wrong jb took his tray and turned away touchy touchy a guard said as they moved away in the direction of someone else to torment sam sat his food on the bed and mixed a packet of sugar in his coffee his daily routine did not include scrambled eggs and bacon he would save the toast and jelly and eat it throughout the morning he would carefully sip the coffee rationing it until ten oclock his hour of exercise and sunshine he balanced the typewriter on his knees and began pecking away sams version of the law was finished by ninethirty he was proud of it one of his better efforts in recent months he munched on a piece of toast as he proofed the document for the last time the typing was neat but outdated the result of an ancient machine the language was effusive and repetitive flowery and filled with words never uttered by humble laymen sam was almost fluent in legalese and could hold his own with any lawyer a door at the end of the hallway banged open then shut heavy footsteps clicked along properly and packer appeared your lawyers here sam he said removing a set of handcuffs from his belt sam stood and pulled up his boxer shorts what time is it a little after ninethirty what difference does it make im supposed to get my hour out at ten you wanna go outside or you wanna see your lawyer sam thought about this as he slipped into his red jumpsuit and slid his feet into his rubber sandals dressing was a swift procedure on death row can i make it up later well see i want my hour out you know i know sam lets go its real important to me i know sam its real important to everyone well try and make it up later okay sam combed his hair with great deliberation then rinsed his hands with cold water packer waited patiently he wanted to say something to j b gullitt something about the mood he was in this morning but gullitt was already asleep again most of them were asleep the average inmate on death row made it through breakfast and an hour or so of television before stretching out for the morning nap though his study was by no means scientific packer estimated they slept fifteen to sixteen hours a day and they could sleep in the heat the sweat the cold and amid the noise of loud televisions and radios the noise was much lower this morning the fans hummed and whined but there was no yelling back and forth sam approached the bars turned his back to packer and extended both hands through the narrow slot in the door packer applied the handcuffs and sam walked to his bed and picked up the document packer nodded to a guard at the end of the hall and sams door opened electronically then it closed leg chains were optional in these situations and with a younger prisoner perhaps one with an attitude and a bit more stamina packer probably would have used them but this was just sam he was an old man how far could he run how much damage could he do with his feet packer gently placed his hand around sams skinny bicep and led him along the hall they stopped at the tier door a row of more bars waited for it to open and close and left tier a another guard followed behind as they came to an iron door which packer unlocked with a key from his belt they walked through it and there was adam sitting alone on the other side of the green grating packer removed the handcuffs and left the room adam read it slowly the first time during the second reading he took a few notes and was amused at some of the language hed seen worse work from trained lawyers and hed seen much better work sam was suffering the same affliction that hit most firstyear law students he used six words when one would suffice his latin was dreadful entire paragraphs were useless but on the whole not bad for a nonlawyer the twopage agreement was now four typed neatly with perfect margins and only two typos and one misspelled word you do pretty good work adam said as he placed the document on the counter sam puffed a cigarette and stared at him through the opening its basically the same agreement i handed you yesterday its basically a helluva lot different sam said correcting him adam glanced at his notes then said you seem to be concerned about five areas the governor books movies termination and who gets to witness the execution im concerned about a lot of things those happen to be nonnegotiable i promised yesterday i would have nothing to do with books and movies good moving right along the termination language is fine you want the right to terminate my representation and that of kravitz bane at any time and for any reason without a fight it took me a long time to fire those jewish bastards last time i dont want to go through it again thats reasonable i dont care whether you think its reasonable okay its in the agreement and its nonnegotiable fair enough and you want to deal with no one but me thats correct no one at kravitz bane touches my file that place is crawling with jews and they dont get involved okay same for niggers and women look sam can we lay off the slurs how about we refer to them as blacks ooops sorry how about we do the right thing and call them africanamericans and jewishamericans and femaleamericans you and ill be irishamericans and also whitemaleamericans if you need help from your firm try to stick with germanamericans or italianamericans since youre in chicago maybe use a few polishamericans gee thatll be nice wont it well be real proper and multicultural and politically correct wont we whatever i feel better already adam made a check mark by his notes ill agree to it damned right you will if you want an agreement just keep the minorities out of my life youre assuming theyre anxious to jump in im not assuming anything i have four weeks to live and id rather spend my time with people i trust adam read again a paragraph on page three of sams draft the language gave sam the sole authority to select two witnesses at his execution i dont understand this clause about the witnesses adam said its very simple if we get to that point there will be about fifteen witnesses since im the guest of honor i get to select two the statute once youve had a chance to review it lists a few who must be present the warden a lebaneseamerican by the way has some discretion in picking the rest they usually conduct a lottery with the press to choose which of the vultures are allowed to gawk at it then why do you want this clause because the lawyer is always one of the two chosen by the gassee thats me and you dont want me to witness the execution thats correct youre assuming ill want to witness it im not assuming anything its just a fact that the lawyers cant wait to see their poor clients gassed once it becomes inevitable then they cant wait to get in front of the cameras and cry and carry on and rail against injustice and you think ill do that no i dont think youll do that then why this clause sam leaned forward with his elbows on the counter his nose was an inch from the screen because you will not witness the execution okay its a deal he said casually and flipped to another page were not going to get that far sam atta boy thats what i want to hear of course we may need the governor sam snorted in disgust and relaxed in his chair he crossed his right leg on his left knee and glared at adam the agreement is very plain indeed it was almost an entire page was dedicated to a venomous attack on david mcallister sam forgot about the law and used words like scurrilous and egotistical and narcissistic and mentioned more than once the insatiable appetite for publicity so you have a problem with the governor adam said sam snorted i dont think this is a good idea sam i really dont care what you think the governor could save your life oh really hes the only reason im here on death row waiting to die in the gas chamber why in hell would he want to save my life i didnt say he wanted to i said that he could lets keep our options open sam smirked for a long minute as he lit a cigarette he blinked and rolled his eyes as if this kid was the dumbest human hed encountered in decades then he leaned forward on his left elbow and pointed at adam with a crooked right finger if you think david mcallister will grant me a last minute pardon then youre a fool but let me tell you what he will do hell use you and me to suck out all the publicity imaginable hell invite you to his office at the state capitol and before you get there hell tip off the media hell listen with remarkable sincerity hell profess grave reservations about whether i should die hell schedule another meeting closer to the execution and after you leave hell hold a couple of interviews and divulge everything youve just told him hell rehash the kramer bombing hell talk about civil rights and all that radical nigger crap hell probably even cry the closer i get to the gas chamber the bigger the media circus will become hell try every way in the world to get in the middle of it hell meet with you every day if we allow it hell take us to the wire he can do this without us and he will mark my word adam an hour before i die hell hold a press conference somewhere probably here maybe at the governors mansion and hell stand there in the glare of a hundred cameras and deny me clemency and the bastard will have tears in his eyes it wont hurt to talk to him fine go talk to him and after you do ill invoke paragraph two and your assll go back to chicago he might like me we could be friends oh hell love you youre sams grandson what a great story more reporters more cameras more journalists more interviews hed love to make your acquaintance so he can string you along hell you might get him reelected adam flipped another page made some more notes and stalled for a while in an effort to move away from the governor whered you learn to write like this he asked same place you did i was taught by the same learned souls who provided your instruction dead judges honorable justices windy lawyers tedious professors ive read the same garbage youve read not bad adam said scanning another paragraph im delighted you think so i understand you have quite a little practice here practice whats a practice why do lawyers practice why cant they just work like everyone else do plumbers practice do truck drivers practice no they simply work but not lawyers hell no theyre special and they practice with all their damned practicing youd think theyd know what the hell they were doing youd think theyd eventually become good at something do you like anyone thats an idiotic question why is it idiotic because youre sitting on that side of the wall and you can walk out that door and drive away and tonight you can have dinner in a nice restaurant and sleep in a soft bed lifes a bit different on this side im treated like an animal i have a cage i have a death sentence which allows the state of mississippi to kill me in four weeks and so yes son its hard to be loving and compassionate its hard to like people these days thats why your question is foolish are you saying you were loving and compassionate before you arrived here sam stared through the opening and puffed on the cigarette another stupid question why its irrelevant counselor youre a lawyer not a shrink im your grandson therefore im allowed to ask questions about your past ask them they might not be answered why not the past is gone son its history we cant undo whats been done nor can we explain it all but i dont have a past then you are indeed a lucky person im not so sure look if you expect me to fill in the gaps then im afraid youve got the wrong person okay who else should i talk to i dont know its not important maybe its important to me well to be honest im not too concerned about you right now believe it or not im much more worried about me me and my future me and my neck theres a big clock ticking somewhere ticking rather loudly wouldnt you say for some strange reason dont ask me why but i can hear the damned thing and it makes me real anxious i find it very difficult to worry about the problems of others why did you become a klansman because my father was in the klan why did he become a klansman because his father was in the klan great three generations four i think colonel jacob cayhall fought with nathan bedford forrest in the war and family legend has it that he was one of the early members of the klan he was my greatgrandfather youre proud of this is that a question yes its not a matter of pride sam nodded at the counter are you going to sign that agreement yes then do it adam signed at the bottom of the back page and handed it to sam youre asking questions that are very confidential as my lawyer you cannot breathe a word i understand the relationship sam signed his name next to adams then studied the signatures when did you become a hall a month before my fourth birthday it was a family affair we were all converted at the same time of course i dont remember why did he stick with hall why not make a clean break and go with miller or green or something is that a question no he was running sam and he was burning bridges as he went i guess four generations was enough for him sam placed the contract in a chair beside him and methodically lit another cigarette he exhaled at the ceiling and stared at adam look adam he said slowly his voice suddenly much softer lets lay off the family stuff for a while okay maybe well get around to it later right now i need to know whats about to happen to me what are my chances you know stuff like that how do you stop the clock what do you file next depends on several things sam depends on how much you tell me about the bombing i dont follow if there are new facts then we present them there are ways believe me well find a judge wholl listen what kind of new facts adam flipped to a clean page on his pad and scribbled the date in the margin who delivered the green pontiac to cleveland on the night before the bombing i dont know one of dogans men you dont know his name no come on sam i swear i dont know who did it i never saw the man the car was delivered to a parking lot i found it i was supposed to leave it where i found it i never saw the man who delivered it why wasnt he discovered during the trials how am i supposed to know he was just a minor accomplice i guess they were after me why bother with a gopher i dont know kramer was bombing number six right i think so sam leaned forward again with his face almost touching the screen his voice was low his words carefully chosen as if someone might be listening somewhere you think so it was a long time ago okay he closed his eyes and thought for a moment yeah number six the fbi said it was number six then that settles it theyre always right was the same green pontiac used in one or all of the prior bombings yes in a couple as i remember we used more than one car all supplied by dogan yes he was a car dealer i know did the same man deliver the pontiac for the prior bombings i never saw or met anyone delivering the cars for the bombings dogan didnt work that way he was extremely careful and his plans were detailed i dont know this for a fact but im certain that the man delivering the cars didnt have a clue as to who i was did the cars come with the dynamite yes always dogan had enough guns and explosives for a small war feds never found his arsenal either whered you learn about explosives kkk boot camp and the basic training manual probably hereditary wasnt it no it wasnt im serious howd you learn to detonate explosives its very basic and simple any fool could pick it up in thirty minutes then with a bit of practice youre an expert practice helps its not much more difficult than lighting a firecracker you strike a match any match will do and you place it at the end of along fuse until the fuse lights then you run like hell if youre lucky it wont blow up for about fifteen minutes and this is something that is just sort of absorbed by all klansmen most of the ones i knew could handle it do you still know any klansmen no theyve abandoned me adam watched his face carefully the fierce blue eyes were steady the wrinkles didnt move there was no emotion no feeling or sorrow or anger sam returned the stare without blinking adam returned to his notepad on march the hirsch temple in jackson was bombed did you do it get right to the point dont you its an easy question sam twisted the filter between his lips and thought for a second why is it important just answer the damned question adam snapped its too late to play games ive never been asked that question before well i guess todays your big day a simple yes or no will do yes did you use the green pontiac i think so who was with you what makes you think someone was with me because a witness said he saw a green pontiac speed by a few minutes before the explosion and he said two people were in the car he even made a tentative identification of you as the driver ah yes our little friend bascar i read about him in the newspapers he was near the corner of fortification and state streets when you and your pal rushed by of course he was and hed just left a bar at three in the morning drunk as a goat and stupid as hell to begin with bascar as im sure you know never made it near a courtroom never placed his hand on a bible and swore to tell the truth never faced a crossexamination never came forward until after i was under arrest in greenville and half the world had seen pictures of the green pontiac his tentative identification occurred only after my face had been plastered all over the papers so hes lying no hes probably just ignorant keep in mind adam that i was never charged with that bombing bascar was never put under pressure he never gave sworn testimony his story was revealed i believe when a reporter with a memphis newspaper dug through the honkytonks and whorehouses long enough to find someone like bascar lets try it this way did you or did you not have someone with you when you bombed the hirsch temple synagogue on march sams gaze fell a few inches below the opening then to the counter then to the floor he pushed away slightly from the partition and relaxed in his chair predictably the blue package of montclairs was produced from the front pocket and he took forever selecting one then thumping it on the filter then inserting it just so between his moist lips the striking of the match was another brief ceremony but one that was finally accomplished and a fresh fog of smoke lifted toward the ceiling adam watched and waited until it was obvious no quick answer was forthcoming the delay in itself was an admission he tapped his pen nervously on the legal pad he took quick breaths and noticed an increase in his heartbeat his empty stomach was suddenly jittery could this be the break if there had been an accomplice then perhaps they had worked as a team and perhaps sam had not actually planted the dynamite that killed the kramers perhaps this fact could be presented to a sympathetic judge somewhere who would listen and grant a stay perhaps maybe could it be no sam said ever so softly but firmly as he looked at adam through the opening i dont believe you there was no accomplice i dont believe you sam sam shrugged casually as if he couldnt care less he crossed his legs and wrapped his fingers around a knee adam took a deep breath scribbled something routinely as if hed been expecting this and flipped to a clean page what time did you arrive in cleveland on the night of april which time the first time i left clanton around six drove two hours to cleveland so i got there around eight whered you go to a shopping center whyd you go there to get the car the green pontiac yes but it wasnt there so i drove to greenville to look around a bit had you been there before yes a couple of weeks earlier i had scouted the place i even went in the jews office to get a good look that was pretty stupid wasnt it i mean his secretary identified you at trial as the man who came in asking for directions and wanting to use the rest room very stupid but then i wasnt supposed to get caught she was never supposed to see my face again he bit the filter and sucked hard a very bad move of course its awfully easy to sit here now and secondguess everything how long did you stay in greenville an hour or so then i drove back to cleveland to get the car dogan always had detailed plans with several alternates the car was parked in spot b near a truck stop where were the keys under the mat what did you do took it for a drive drove out of town out through some cotton fields i found a lonely spot and parked the car i popped the trunk to check the dynamite how many sticks fifteen i believe i was using between twelve and twenty depending on the building twenty for the synagogue because it was new and modern and built with concrete and stone but the jews office was an old wooden structure and i knew fifteen would level it what else was in the trunk the usual a cardboard box of dynamite two blasting caps a fifteenminute fuse is that all yes are you sure of course im sure what about the timing device the detonator oh yeah i forgot about that it was in another smaller box describe it for me why youve read the trial transcripts the fbi expert did a wonderful job of reconstructing my little bomb youve read this havent you many times and youve seen the photos they used at trial the ones of the fragments and pieces of the timer youve seen all this havent you ive seen it where did dogan get the clock i never asked you could buy one in any drugstore it was just a cheap windup alarm clock nothing fancy was this your first job with a timing device you know it was the other bombs were detonated by fuses why are you asking me these questions because i want to hear your answers ive read everything but i want to hear it from you why did you want to delay the kramer bomb because i was tired of lighting fuses and running like hell i wanted a longer break between planting the bomb and feeling it go off what time did you plant it around am what time was it supposed to go off around five what went wrong it didnt go off at five it went off a few minutes before eight and there were people in the building by then and some of these people got killed and thats why im sitting here in a red monkey suit wondering what the gasll smell like dogan testified that the selection of marvin kramer as a target was a joint effort between the both of you that kramer had been on a klan hit list for two years that the use of a timing device was something you suggested as a way to kill kramer because his routine was predictable that you acted alone sam listened patiently and puffed on his cigarette his eyes narrowed to tiny slits and he nodded at the floor then he almost smiled well im afraid dogan went crazy didnt he feds hounded him for years and he finally caved in he was not a strong man you know he took a deep breath and looked at adam but some of its true not much but some did you intend to kill him no we werent killing people just blowing up buildings what about the pinder home in vicksburg was that one of yours sam nodded slowly the bomb went off at four in the morning while the entire pinder family was sound asleep six people miraculously only one minor injury it wasnt a miracle the bomb was placed in the garage if id wanted to kill anyone id have put it by a bedroom window half the house collapsed yeah and i couldve used a clock and wiped out a bunch of jews as they ate their bagels or whatever why didnt you as i said we werent trying to kill people what were you trying to do intimidate retaliate keep the damned jews from financing the civil rights movement we were trying to keep the africans where they belonged in their own schools and churches and neighborhoods and rest rooms away from our women and children jews like marvin kramer were promoting an interracial society and stirring up the africans son of a bitch needed to be kept in line you guys really showed him didnt you he got what he deserved im sorry about the little boys your compassion is overwhelming listen adam and listen good i did not intend to hurt anyone the bomb was set to go off at am three hours before he usually arrived for work the only reason his kids were there was because his wife had the flu but you feel no remorse because marvin lost both legs not really no remorse because he killed himself he pulled the trigger not me youre a sick man sam yeah and im about to get a lot sicker when i sniff the gas adam shook his head in disgust but held his tongue they could argue later about race and hatred not that he at this moment expected to make any progress with sam on these topics but he was determined to try now however they needed to discuss facts after you inspected the dynamite what did you do drove back to the truck stop drank coffee why maybe i was thirsty very funny sam just try and answer the questions i was waiting for what i needed to kill a couple of hours by then it was around midnight and i wanted to spend as little time in greenville as possible so i killed time in cleveland did you talk to anyone in the cafe no was it crowded i really dont remember did you sit alone yes at a table yes sam managed a slight grin because he knew what was coming a truck driver by the name of tommy farris said he saw a man who greatly resembled you in the truck stop that night and that this man drank coffee for a long time with a younger man i never met mr farris but i believe he had a lapse of memory for three years not a word to anyone as i recall until another reporter flushed him out and he got his name in the paper its amazing how these mystery witnesses pop up years after the trials why didnt farris testify in your last trial dont ask me i suppose it was because he had nothing to say the fact that i drank coffee alone or with someone seven hours before the bombing was hardly relevant plus the coffee drinking took place in cleveland and had nothing to do with whether or not i committed the crime so farris was lying i dont know what farris was doing dont really care i was alone thats all that matters what time did you leave cleveland around three i think and you drove straight to greenville yes and i drove by the kramers house saw the guard sitting on the porch drove by his office killed some more time and around four or so i parked behind his office slipped through the rear door planted the bomb in a closet in the hallway walked back to my car and drove away what time did you leave greenville i had planned to leave after the bomb went off but as you know it was several months before i actually made it out of town where did you go when you left kramers office i found a little coffee shop on the highway a half mile or so from kramers office whyd you go there to drink coffee what time was it i dont know around fourthirty or so was it crowded a handful of people just your runofthemill allnight diner with a fat cook in a dirty tee shirt and a waitress who smacked her chewing gum did you talk to anybody i spoke to the waitress when i ordered my coffee maybe had a doughnut and you were having a nice cup of coffee just minding your own business waiting for the bomb to go off yeah i always liked to hear the bombs go off and watch the people react so youd done this before a couple of times in february of that year i bombed the real estate office in jackson jews had sold a house to some niggers in a white section and i had just sat down in a diner not three blocks away when the bomb went off i was using a fuse then so i had to hustle away and park real fast and find a table the girl had just sat my coffee down when the ground shook and everybody froze i really liked that it was four in the morning and the place was packed with truckers and deliverymen even had a few cops over in a corner and of course they ran to their cars and sped away with lights blazing my table shook so hard that coffee spilled from my cup and that gave you a real thrill yes it did but the other jobs were too risky i didnt have the time to find a cafe or diner so i just sort of rode around for a few minutes waiting for the fun id check my watch closely so i always knew about when it would hit if i was in the car i liked to be on the edge of town you know sam paused and took a long puff from his cigarette his words were slow and careful his eyes danced a bit as he talked about his adventures but his words were measured i did watch the pinder bombing he added and howd you do that they lived in a big house in the suburbs lots of trees sort of in a valley i parked on the side of a hill about a mile away and i was sitting under a tree when it went off how peaceful it really was full moon cool night i had a great view of the street and i could see almost all of the roof it was so calm and peaceful everyone was asleep then boom blew that roof to hell and back what was mr pinders sin just overall general jewishness loved niggers always embraced the radical africans when they came down from the north and agitated everybody he loved to march and boycott with the africans we suspected he was financing a lot of their activities adam made notes and tried to absorb all of this it was hard to digest because it was almost impossible to believe perhaps the death penalty was not such a bad idea after all back to greenville where was this coffee shop located dont remember what was it called it was twentythree years ago and it was not the kind of place youd want to remember was it on highway i think so what are you gonna do spend your time digging for the fat cook and the tacky waitress are you doubting my story yes im doubting your story why because you cant tell me where you learned to make a bomb with a timing detonator in the garage behind my house in clanton out from clanton its not that difficult who taught you i taught myself i had a drawing a little booklet with diagrams and such steps one two three it was no big deal how many times did you practice with such a device before kramer once where when in the woods not far from my house i took two sticks of dynamite and the necessary paraphernalia and i went to a little creek bed deep in the woods it worked perfectly of course and you did all this study and research in your garage thats what i said your own little laboratory call it whatever you want well the fbi conducted a thorough search of your house garage and premises while you were in custody they didnt find a trace of evidence of explosives maybe theyre stupid maybe i was real careful and didnt leave a trail or maybe the bomb was planted by someone with experience in explosives nope sorry how long did you stay in the coffee shop in greenville a helluva long time five oclock came and went then it was almost six i left a few minutes before six and drove by kramers office the place looked fine some of the early risers were out and about and i didnt want to be seen i crossed the river and drove to lake village arkansas then returned to greenville it was seven by then sun was up and people were moving around no explosion i parked the car on a side street and walked around for a while the damned thing wouldnt go off i couldnt go in after it you know i walked and walked listening hard hoping the ground would shake nothing happened did you see marvin kramer and his sons go into the building no i turned a corner and saw his car parked and i thought dammit i went blank i couldnt think but then i thought what the hell hes just a jew and hes done many evil things then i thought about secretaries and other people who might work in there so i walked around the block again i remember looking at my watch when it was twenty minutes before eight and i had this thought that maybe i should make an anonymous phone call to the office and tell kramer that there was a bomb in the closet and if he didnt believe me then he could go look at it then he could haul ass why didnt you i didnt have a dime id left all my change as a tip for the waitress and i didnt want to walk into a store and ask for change i have to tell you i was real nervous my hands were shaking and i didnt want to act suspicious in front of anybody i was a stranger right that was my bomb in there right i was in a small town where everybody knows everyone and they damned sure remember strangers when theres a crime i remember walking down the sidewalk just across the street from kramers and in front of a barbershop there was a newspaper rack and this man was fumbling in his pocket for change i almost asked him for a dime so i could make a quick call but i was too nervous why were you nervous sam you just said you didnt care if kramer got hurt this was your sixth bombing right yeah but the others were easy light the fuse hit the door and wait a few minutes i kept thinking about that cute little secretary in kramers office the one whod shown me to the rest room the same one who later testified at trial and i kept thinking about the other people who worked in his office because when i went in that day i saw people everywhere it was almost eight oclock and i knew the place opened in a few minutes i knew a lot of people were about to get killed my mind stopped working i remember standing beside a phone booth a block away staring at my watch then staring at the phone telling myself that i had to make the call i finally stepped inside and looked up the number but by the time i closed the book id forgotten it so i looked it up again and i started to dial when i remembered i didnt have a dime so i made up my mind to go into the barbershop to get some change my legs were heavy and i was sweatin like hell i walked to the barbershop and i stopped at the plate glass window and looked in it was packed they were lined up against the wall talking and reading papers and there was a row of chairs all filled with men talking at the same time i remember a couple of them looked at me then one or two more began to stare so i walked away where did you go im not sure there was an office next door to kramers and i remember seeing a car park in front of it i thought maybe it was a secretary or someone about to go into kramers and i think i was walking toward the car when the bomb went off so you were across the street i think so i remember rocking on my hands and knees in the street as glass and debris fell all around me but i dont remember much after that there was a slight knock on the door from the outside then sergeant packer appeared with a large styrofoam cup a paper napkin a stir stick and creamer thought you might need a little coffee sorry to butt in he placed the cup and accessories on the counter thanks adam said packer quickly turned and headed for the door ill take two sugars one cream sam said from the other side yes sir packer snapped without slowing he was gone good service around here adam said wonderful just wonderful sam of course was not served coffee he knew this immediately but adam did not and so after waiting a few minutes sam said drink it he himself lit another cigarette and paced around a bit behind his chair while adam stirred the sugar with the plastic stick it was almost eleven and sam had missed his hour out and he had no confidence that packer would find the time to make it up he paced and squatted a few times performed a half dozen deep bends knees cracking and joints popping as he rose and sank unsteadily during the first few months of his first year on the row he had grown quite disciplined with his exercise at one point he was doing a hundred pushups and a hundred situps in his cell each day every day his weight fell to a perfect one hundred and sixty pounds as the lowfat diet took its course his stomach was flat and hard he had never been so healthy not long afterward however came the realization that the row would be his final home and that the state would one day kill him here whats the benefit of good health and tight biceps when one is locked up twentythree hours a day waiting to die the exercise slowly stopped the smoking intensified among his comrades sam was considered a lucky man primarily because he had outside money a younger brother donnie lived in north carolina and once a month shipped to sam a cardboard box packed neatly with ten cartons of montclair cigarettes sam averaged between three and four packs a day he wanted to kill himself before the state got around to it and he preferred to go by way of some protracted illness or affliction some disease that would require expensive treatment which the state of mississippi would be constitutionally bound to provide it looked as though he would lose the race the federal judge who had assumed control of parchman through a prisoners rights suit had issued sweeping orders overhauling fundamental correction procedures he had carefully defined the rights of prisoners and he had set forth minor details such as the square footage of each cell on the row and the amount of money each inmate could possess twenty dollars was the maximum it was referred to as dust and it always came from the outside death row inmates were not allowed to work and earn money the lucky ones received a few dollars a month from relatives and friends they could spend it in a canteen located in the middle of msu soft drinks were known as bottleups candy and snacks were zuzus and whamwhams real cigarettes in packages were tightlegs and readyrolls the majority of the inmates received nothing from the outside they traded swapped and bartered and gathered enough coins to purchase loose leaf tobacco which they rolled into thin papers and smoked slowly sam was indeed a lucky man he took his seat and lit another one why didnt you testify at trial his lawyer asked through the screen which trial good point the first two trials didnt need to brazelton picked good juries all white good sympathetic people who understood things i knew i wouldnt be convicted by those people there was no need to testify and the last trial thats a little more complicated keyes and i discussed it many times he at first thought it might help because i could explain to the jury what my intentions were nobody was supposed to get hurt etc the bomb was supposed to go off at am but we knew the crossexamination would be brutal the judge had already ruled that the other bombings could be discussed to show certain things i would be forced to admit that i did in fact plant the bomb all fifteen sticks which of course was more than enough to kill people so why didnt you testify dogan that lying bastard told the jury that our plan was to kill the jew he was a very effective witness i mean think about it here was the former imperial wizard of the mississippi klan testifying for the prosecution against one of his own men it was stout stuff the jury ate it up why did dogan lie jerry dogan went crazy adam i mean really crazy the feds pursued him for fifteen years bugged his phones followed his wife around town harassed his kinfolks threatened his children knocked on his door at all hours of the night his life was miserable someone was always watching and listening then he got sloppy and the irs stepped in they along with the fbi told him he was looking at thirty years dogan cracked under the pressure after my trial i heard he was sent away for a while you know to an institution he got some treatment returned home and died not long after dogans dead sam froze in midpuff smoke leaked from his mouth and curled upward past his nose and in front of his eyes which at the moment were staring in disbelief through the opening and into those of his grandson you dont know about dogan he asked adams memory blitzed through the countless articles and stories which hed collected and indexed he shook his head no what happened to dogan i thought you knew everything sam said thought youd memorized everything about me i know a lot about you sam i really dont care about jeremiah dogan he burned in a house fire he and his wife they were asleep one night when a gas line somehow began leaking propane neighbors said it was like a bomb going off when did this happen exactly one year to the day after he testified against me adam tried to write this down but his pen wouldnt move he studied sams face for a clue exactly a year yep thats a nice coincidence i was in here of course but i heard bits and pieces of it cops ruled it accidental in fact i think there was a lawsuit against the propane company so you dont think he was murdered sure i think he was murdered okay who did it in fact the fbi came here and asked me some questions can you believe it the feds poking their noses around here a couple of kids from up north just couldnt wait to visit death row and flash their badges and meet a real live klan terrorist they were so damned scared they were afraid of their shadows they asked me stupid questions for an hour then left never heard from anybody again who would murder dogan sam bit the filter and extracted the last mouthful of smoke from the cigarette he stubbed it in the ashtray while exhaling through the screen adam waved at the smoke with exaggerated motions but sam ignored him lots of people he mumbled adam made a note in the margin to talk about dogan later he would do the research first then spring it again in some future conversation just for the sake of argument he said still writing it seems as though you shouldve testified to counter dogan i almost did sam said with a trace of regret the last night of the trial me and keyes and his associate i forget her name stayed up until midnight discussing whether or not i should take the stand but think about it adam i wouldve been forced to admit that i planted the bomb that it had a timing device set to go off later that i had been involved in other bombings and that i was across the street from the building when it blew plus the prosecution had clearly proven that marvin kramer was a target i mean hell they played those fbi phone tapes to the jury you shouldve heard it they rigged up these huge speakers in the courtroom and they set the tape player on a table in front of the jury like it was some kind of alive bomb and there was dogan on the phone to wayne graves his voice was scratchy but very audible talking about bombing marvin kramer for this and for that and bragging about how he would send his group as he called me to greenville to take care of matters the voices on that tape sounded like ghosts from hell and the jury hung on every word very effective and then of course there was dogans own testimony i wouldve looked ridiculous at that moment trying to testify and convince the jury that i really wasnt a bad guy mcallister wouldve eaten me alive so we decided i shouldnt take the stand looking back it was a bad move i shouldve talked but on the advice of your attorney you didnt look adam if youre thinking about attacking keyes on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel then forget it i paid keyes good money mortgaged everything i had and he did a good job a long time ago goodman and tyner considered going after keyes but they found nothing wrong with his representation forget it the cayhall file at kravitz bane had at least two inches of research and memos on the issue of benjamin keyes representation ineffective assistance of trial counsel was a standard argument in death penalty appeals but it had not been used in sams case goodman and tyner had discussed it at length bouncing long memos back and forth between their offices on the sixtyfirst and sixtysixth floors in chicago the final memo declared that keyes had done such a good job at trial that there was nothing to attack the file also included a threepage letter from sam expressly forbidding any attack on keyes he would not sign any petition doing so he promised the last memo however had been written seven years earlier at a time when death was a distant possibility things were different now issues had to be resurrected or even fabricated it was time to grasp at straws where is keyes now adam asked last i heard he took a job in washington he wrote me about five years ago said he wasnt practicing anymore he took it pretty hard when we lost i dont think either one of us expected it you didnt expect to be convicted not really i had already beaten it twice you know and my jury the third time had eight whites or angloamericans i should say as bad as the trial went i dont think i ever really believed theyd convict me what about keyes oh he was worried we damned sure didnt take it lightly we spent months preparing for the trial he neglected his other clients even his family for weeks while we were getting ready mcallister was popping off in the papers every day it seemed and the more he talked the more we worked they released the list of potential jurors four hundred of them and we spent days investigating those people his pretrial preparation was impeccable we were not naive lee told me you considered disappearing oh she did yeah she told me last night he tapped the next cigarette on the counter and admired it for a moment as if it might be his last yeah i thought about it almost thirteen years passed before mcallister came after me i was a free man hell i was fortyseven years old when the second trial ended and i returned home fortyseven years old and i had been cleared by two juries and all this was behind me i was happy life was normal i farmed and ran a sawmill drank coffee in town and voted in every election the feds watched me for a few months but i guess they became convinced id given up bombing from time to time a pesky reporter or journalist would show up in clanton and ask questions but nobody spoke to them they were always from up north dumb as hell rude and ignorant and they never stayed long one came to the house one day and wouldnt leave instead of getting the shotgun i just turned the dogs loose on him and they chewed his ass up never came back he chuckled to himself and lit the cigarette not in my wildest dreams did i envision this if id had the slightest inkling the faintest clue that this might happen to me then i would have been gone years ago i was completely free you understand no restrictions i wouldve gone to south america changed my name disappeared two or three times then settled in some place like sao paulo or rio like mengele something like that they never caught him you know they never caught a bunch of those guys id be living right now in a nice little house speaking portuguese and laughing at fools like david mcallister sam shook his head and closed his eyes and dreamed of what might have been why didnt you leave when mcallister started making noises because i was foolish it happened slowly it was like a bad dream coming to life in small segments first mcallister got elected with all his promises then a few months later dogan got nailed by the irs i started hearing rumors and reading little things in the newspapers but i simply refused to believe it could happen before i knew it the fbi was following me and i couldnt run adam looked at his watch and was suddenly tired they had been talking for more than two hours and he needed fresh air and sunshine his head ached from the cigarette smoke and the room was growing warmer by the moment he screwed the cap on his pen and slid the legal pad into his briefcase id better go he said in the direction of the screen ill probably come back tomorrow for another round ill be here lucas mann has given me the green light to visit anytime i want a helluva guy isnt he hes okay just doing his job sos naifeh and nugent and all those other white folks white folks yeah its slang for the authorities nobody really wants to kill me but theyre just doing their jobs theres this little moron with nine fingers whos the official executioner the guy who mixes the gas and inserts the canister ask him what hes doing as they strap me in and hell say just doing my job the prison chaplain and the prison doctor and the prison psychiatrist along with the guards wholl escort me in and the medics wholl carry me out well theyre nice folks nothing really against me but theyre just doing their jobs it wont get that far sam is that a promise no but think positive yeah positive thinkings real popular around here me and the boys are big on motivational shows along with travel programs and home shopping the africans prefer soul train lees worried about you sam she wanted me to tell you shes thinking about you and praying for you sam bit his bottom lip and looked at the floor he nodded slowly but said nothing ill be staying with her for the next month or so shes still married to that guy sort of she wants to see you no why not sam carefully eased from his chair and knocked on the door behind him he turned and looked at adam through the screen they watched each other until a guard opened the door and took sam away the kid left an hour ago with authorization though i havent seen it in writing lucas mann explained to phillip naifeh who was standing in his window watching a litter gang along the highway naifeh had a headache a backache and was in the middle of a generally awful day which had included three early phone calls from the governor and two from roxburgh the attorney general sam of course had been the reason for the calls so hes got himself a lawyer naifeh said while gently pressing a fist in the center of his lower back yeah and i really like this kid he stopped by when he left and looked like hed been run over by a truck i think he and his grandfather are having a rough time of it itll get worse for the grandfather itll get worse for all of us do you know what the governor asked me wanted to know if he could have a copy of our manual on how to carry out executions i told him no that in fact he could not have a copy he said he was the governor of this state and he felt as though he should have a copy i tried to explain that it wasnt really a manual as such just a looseleaf little book in a black binder that gets heavily revised each time we gas someone whats it called he wanted to know i said its called nothing actually no official name because thankfully its not used that much but that on further thought i myself have referred to it as the little black book he pushed a little harder i got a little madder we hung up and fifteen minutes later his lawyer that little hunchback fart with eyeglasses pinching his nose larramore larramore called me and said that according to this code section and that code section he the governor has a right to a copy of the manual i put him on hold pulled the code sections made him wait ten minutes then we read the law together and of course as usual hes lying and bluffing and figuring im an imbecile no such language in my copy of the code i hung up on him ten minutes later the governor called back all sugar and spice told me to forget the little black book that hes very concerned about sams constitutional rights and all and just wants me to keep him posted as this thing unfolds a real charmer naifeh shifted weight on his feet and changed fists in his back while staring at the window then half an hour later roxburgh calls and guess what he wants to know wants to know if ive talked to the governor you see roxburgh thinks he and i are real tight old political pals you know and therefore we can trust each other and so he tells me confidentially of course buddy to buddy that he thinks the governor might try to exploit this execution for his own political gain nonsense lucas hooted yeah i told roxburgh that i just couldnt believe he would think such a thing about our governor i was real serious and he got real serious and we promised each other that wed watch the governor real close and if we saw any sign that he was trying to manipulate this situation then wed call each other real quick roxburgh said there were some things he could do to neutralize the governor if he got out of line i didnt dare ask what or how but he seemed sure of himself so whos the bigger fool probably roxburgh but its a tough call naifeh stretched carefully and walked to his desk his shoes were off and his shirttail was out he was in obvious pain both have insatiable appetites for publicity theyre like two little boys scared to death that one will get a bigger piece of candy i hate em both everybody hates them except the voters there was a sharp knock on the door three solid raps delivered at precise intervals must be nugent naifeh said and his pain suddenly intensified come in the door opened quickly and retired colonel george nugent marched into the room pausing only slightly to close the door and moved officially toward lucas mann who did not stand but shook hands anyway mr mann nugent greeted him crisply then stepped forward and shook hands across the desk with naifeh have a seat george naifeh said waving at an empty chair next to mann naifeh wanted to order him to cut the military crap but he knew it would do no good yes sir nugent answered as he lowered himself into the seat without bending his back though the only uniforms at parchman were worn by guards and inmates nugent had managed to fashion one for himself his shirt and pants were dark olive perfectly matched and perfectly ironed with precise folds and creases and they miraculously survived each day without the slightest wrinkling the pants stopped a few inches above the ankles where they disappeared into a pair of black leather combat boots shined and buffed at least twice a day to a state of perpetual sparkle there had once been a weak rumor that a secretary or maybe a trustee had seen a spot of mud on one of the soles but the rumor had not been confirmed the top button was left open to form an exact triangle which revealed a gray tee shirt the pockets and sleeves were bare and unadorned free of his medals and ribbons and naifeh had long suspected that this caused the colonel no small amount of humiliation the haircut was strict military with bare skin above the ears and a thin layer of gray sprouts on top nugent was fiftytwo had served his country for thirtyfour years first as a buck private in korea and later as a captain of some variety in vietnam where he fought the war from behind a desk hed been wounded in a jeep wreck and sent home with another ribbon for two years now nugent had served admirably as an assistant superintendent a trusted loyal and dependable underling of naifehs he loved details and regulations and rules he devoured manuals and was constantly writing new procedures and directives and modifications for the warden to ponder he was a significant pain in the wardens ass but he was needed nonetheless it was no secret that the colonel wanted naifehs job in a couple of years george me and lucas have been talking about the cayhall matter dont know how much you know about the appeals but the fifth circuit lifted the stay and were looking at an execution in four weeks yes sir nugent snapped absorbing and itemizing every word i read about it in todays paper good lucas here is of the opinion that this one might come down you know right lucas theres a good chance better than fiftyfifty lucas said this without looking at nugent how long have you been here george two years one month the warden calculated something while rubbing his temples did you miss the parris execution yes sir by a few weeks he answered with a trace of disappointment so you havent been through one no sir well theyre awful george just awful worst part of this job by far frankly im just not up to it i was hoping id retire before it wont get that far sam nugents back though painfully stiff already seemed to straighten even more he nodded quickly eyes dancing in all directions naifeh delicately sat in his seat grimacing as he eased onto the soft leather since im just not up to it george lucas and i were thinking that maybe youd do a good job with this one the colonel couldnt suppress a smile then it quickly disappeared and was replaced with a most serious scowl im sure i can handle it sir im sure you can too naifeh pointed to a black binder on the corner of his desk we have a manual of sorts there it is the collected wisdom of two dozen visits to the gas chamber over the past thirty years nugents eyes narrowed and focused on the black book he noticed that the pages were not all even and uniform that an assortment of papers were actually folded and stuffed slovenly throughout the text that the binder itself was worn and shabby within hours he quickly decided the manual would be transformed into a primer worthy of publication that would be his first task the paperwork would be immaculate why dont you read it tonight and lets meet again tomorrow yes sir he said smugly not a word to anyone about this until we talk again understood no sir nugent nodded smartly at lucas mann and left the office cradling the black book like a kid with a new toy the door closed behind him hes a nut lucas said i know well watch him wed better watch him hes so damned gungho he might try to gas sam this weekend naifeh opened a desk drawer and retrieved a bottle of pills he swallowed two without the assistance of water im going home lucas i need to lie down ill probably die before sam does youd better hurry the phone conversation with e garner goodman was brief adam explained with some measure of pride that he and sam had a written agreement on representation and that they had already spent four hours together though little had been accomplished goodman wanted a copy of the agreement and adam explained that there were no copies as of now that the original was safely tucked away in a cell on death row and furthermore there would be copies only if the client decided so goodman promised to review the file and get to work adam gave him lees phone number and promised to check in every day he hung up the phone and stared at two terrifying phone messages beside his computer both were from reporters one from a memphis newspaper and one from a television station in jackson mississippi baker cooley had talked to both reporters in fact a tv crew from jackson had presented itself to the firms receptionist and left only after cooley made threats all this attention had upset the tedious routine of the memphis branch of kravitz bane cooley was not happy about it the other partners had little to say to adam the secretaries were professionally polite but anxious to stay away from his office the reporters knew cooley had warned him gravely they knew about sam and adam the grandsongrandfather angle and while he wasnt sure how they knew it certainly hadnt come from him he hadnt told a soul until of course word was already out and hed been forced to gather the partners and associates together just before lunch and break the news it was almost five oclock adam sat at his desk with the door shut listening to the voices in the hall as clerks and paralegals and other salaried staff made last minute preparations to leave for the day he decided he would have nothing to say to the tv reporter he dialed the number for todd marks at the memphis press a recorded message guided him through the wonders of voice mail and after a couple of minutes mr marks picked up his fivedigit extension and said hurriedly todd marks he sounded like a teenager this is adam hall with kravitz bane i had a note to call you yes mr hall marks gushed instantly friendly and no longer in a hurry thanks for calling i uh well we uh picked up a rumor about your handling of the cayhall case and uh i was just trying to track it down i represent mr cayhall adam said with measured words yes well thats what we heard and uh youre from chicago i am from chicago i see how uh did you get the case my firm has represented sam cayhall for seven years yes right but didnt he terminate your services recently he did and now hes rehired the firm adam could hear keys pecking away as marks gathered his words into a computer i see we heard a rumor just a rumor i guess that sam cayhall is your grandfather whered you hear this well you know we have sources and we have to protect them cant really tell you where it came from you know yeah i know adam took a deep breath and let marks hang for a minute where are you now at the paper and wheres that i dont know the city where are you marks asked downtown in our office im not far away i can be there in ten minutes no not here lets meet somewhere else a quiet little bar some place fine the peabody hotel is on union three blocks from you theres a nice bar off the lobby called mallards ill be there in fifteen minutes just me and you okay sure adam hung up the phone sams agreement contained some loose and ambiguous language that attempted to prevent his lawyer from talking to the press the particular clause had major loopholes that any lawyer could walk through but adam did not wish to push the issue after two visits his grandfather was still nothing but a mystery he didnt like lawyers and would readily fire another even his own grandson mallards was filling up quickly with young weary professionals who needed a couple of stiff ones for the drive to the suburbs few people actually lived in downtown memphis so the bankers and brokers met here and in countless other bars and gulped beer in green bottles and sipped swedish vodka they lined the bar and gathered around the small tables to discuss the direction of the market and debate the future of the prime it was a tony place with authentic brick walls and real hardwood floors a table by the door held trays of chicken wings and livers wrapped with bacon adam spotted a young man in jeans holding a notepad he introduced himself and they went to a table in the corner todd marks was no more than twentyfive he wore wirerimmed glasses and hair to his shoulders he was cordial and seemed a bit nervous they ordered heinekens the notepad was on the table ready for action and adam decided to take control a few ground rules he said first everything i say is off the record you cant quote me on anything agreed marks shrugged as if this was okay but not exactly what he had in mind okay he said i think you call it deep background or something like that thats it ill answer some questions for you but not many im here because i want you to get it right okay fair enough is sam cayhall your grandfather sam cayhall is my client and he has instructed me not to talk to the press thats why you cant quote me im here to confirm or deny thats all okay but is he your grandfather yes marks took a deep breath and savored this incredible fact which no doubt led to an extraordinary story he could see the headlines then he realized he should ask some more questions he carefully took a pen from his pocket whos your father my father is deceased a long pause okay so sam is your mothers father no sam is my fathers father all right why do you have different last names because my father changed his name i hy dont want to answer that i dont want to go into a lot of family background did you grow up in clanton no i was born there but left when i was three years old my parents moved to california thats where i grew up so you were not around sam cayhall no did you know him i met him yesterday marks considered the next question and thankfully the beer arrived they sipped in unison and said nothing he stared at his notepad scribbled something then asked how long have you been with kravitz bane almost a year how long have you worked on the cayhall case a day and a half he took a long drink and watched adam as if he expected an explanation look uh mr hall its adam okay adam there seem to be a lot of gaps here could you help me a bit no all right i read somewhere that cayhall fired kravitz bane recently were you working on the case when this happened i just told you ive been working on the case for a day and a half when did you first go to death row yesterday did he know you were coming i dont want to get into that why not this is a very confidential matter im not going to discuss my visits to death row i will confirm or deny only those things which you can verify elsewhere does sam have other children im not going to discuss family im sure your paper has covered this before but it was a long time ago then look it up another long drink and another long look at the notepad what are the odds of the execution taking place on august its very hard to say i wouldnt want to speculate but all the appeals have run havent they maybe lets say ive got my work cut out for me can the governor grant a pardon yes is that a possibility rather unlikely youll have to ask him will your client do any interviews before the execution i doubt it adam glanced at his watch as if he suddenly had to catch a plane anything else he asked then finished off the beer marks stuck his pen in a shirt pocket can we talk again depends on what on how you handle this if you drag up the family stuff then forget it must be some serious skeletons in the closet no comment adam stood and offered a handshake nice meeting you he said as they shook hands thanks ill give you a call adam walked quickly by the crowd at the bar and disappeared through the hotel lobby from all the silly nitpicking rules imposed upon inmates at the row the one that irritated sam the most was the fiveinch rule this little nugget of regulatory brilliance placed a limit on the volume of legal papers a death row inmate could possess in his cell the documents could be no thicker than five inches when placed on end and squeezed together sams file was not much different from the other inmates and after nine years of appellate warfare the file filled a large cardboard box how in hell was he supposed to research and study and prepare with such limitations as the fiveinch rule packer had entered his cell on several occasions with a yardstick which he waved around like a bandleader then carefully placed against the papers each time sam had been over the limit once being caught according to packers assessment with twentyone inches and each time packer wrote an rvr a rules violation report and some more paperwork went into sams institutional file sam often wondered if his file in the main administration building was thicker than five inches he hoped so and who cared theyd kept him in a cage for nine and a half years for the sole purpose of sustaining his life so they could one day take it what else could they do to him each time packer had given him twentyfour hours to thin his file sam usually mailed a few inches to his brother in north carolina a few times he had reluctantly mailed an inch or two to e garner goodman at the present time he was about twelve inches over and he had a thin file of recent supreme court cases under his mattress and he had two inches next door where hank henshaw watched it on the bookshelf and he had about three inches next door in j b gullitts stack of papers sam reviewed all documents and letters for henshaw and gullitt henshaw had a fine lawyer one purchased with family money gullitt had a fool from a bigshot firm in dc whod never seen a courtroom the threebook rule was another baffling limitation on what inmates could keep in their cells this rule simply said that a death row inmate could possess no more than three books sam owned fifteen six in his cell and nine scattered among his clients on the row he had no time for fiction his collection was solely law books about the death penalty and the eighth amendment he had finished a dinner of boiled pork pinto beans and corn bread and he was reading a case from the ninth circuit in california about an inmate who faced his death so calmly his lawyers decided he must be crazy so they filed a series of motions claiming their client was indeed too crazy to execute the ninth circuit was filled with california liberals opposed to the death penalty and they jumped at this novel argument the execution was stayed sam liked this case he had wished many times that he had the ninth circuit looking down upon him instead of the fifth gullitt next door said gotta kite sam and sam walked to his bars flying a kite was the only method of correspondence for inmates several cells away gullitt handed him the note it was from preacher boy a pathetic white kid seven doors down he had become a country preacher at the age of fourteen a regular hellfireandbrimstoner but that career was cut short and perhaps delayed forever when he was convicted of the rape and murder of a deacons wife he was twentyfour now a resident of the row for three years and had recently made a glorious return to the gospel the note said dear sam i am down here praying for you right now i really believe god will step into this matter and stop this thing but if he dont im asking him to take you quickly no pain or nothing and take you home love randy how wonderful thought sam theyre already praying that i go quickly no pain or nothing he sat on the edge of his bed and wrote a brief message on a scrap of paper dear randy thanks for the prayers i need them i also need one of my books its called bronsteins death penalty review its a green book send it down sam he handed it to jb and waited with his arms through the bars as the kite made its way along the tier it was almost eight oclock still hot and muggy but mercifully growing dark outside the night would lower the temperature to the high seventies and with the fans buzzing away the cells became tolerable sam had received several kites during the day all had expressed sympathy and hope all offered whatever help was available the music had been quieter and the yelling that erupted occasionally when someones rights were being tampered with had not occurred for the second day the row had been a more peaceful place the televisions rattled along all day and into the night but the volume was lower tier a was noticeably calmer got myself a new lawyer sam said quietly as he leaned on his elbows with his hands hanging into the hallway he wore nothing but his boxer shorts he could see gullitts hands and wrists but he could never see his face when they talked in their cells each day as sam was led outside for his hour of exercise he walked slowly along the tier and stared into the eyes of his comrades and they stared at him he had their faces memorized and he knew their voices but it was cruel to live next door to a man for years and have long conversations about life and death while looking only at his hands thats good sam im glad to hear it yeah pretty sharp kid i think who is it gullitts hands were clasped together they didnt move my grandson sam said this just loud enough for gullitt to hear he could be trusted with secrets gullitts fingers moved slightly as he pondered this your grandson yep from chicago big firm thinks we might have a chance you never told me you had a grandson i hadnt seen him in twenty years showed up yesterday and told me he was a lawyer and wanted to take my case wheres he been for the past ten years growing up i guess hes just a kid twentysix i think youre gonna let a twentysixyearold kid take your case this irritated sam a bit i dont exactly have a lot of choices at this moment in my life hell sam you know more law than he does i know but itll be nice to have a real lawyer out there typing up motions and appeals on real computers and filing them in the proper courts you know itll be nice to have somebody who can run to court and argue with judges somebody who can fight with the state on equal footing this seemed to satisfy gullitt because he didnt speak for several minutes his hands were still but then he began rubbing his fingertips together and this of course meant something was bothering him sam waited ive been thinking about something sam all day long this has been eatin at me what is it well for three years now youve been right there and ive been right here you know and youre my best friend in the world youre the only person i can trust you know and i dont know what im gonna do if they walk you down the hall and into the chamber i mean ive always had you right there to look over my legal stuff stuff that ill never understand and youve always given me good advice and told me what to do i cant trust my lawyer in dc he never calls me or writes me and i dont know what the hells going on with my case i mean i dont know if im a year away or five years away and its enough to drive me crazy if it hadnt been for you id be a nut case by now and what if you dont make it by now his hands were jumping and thrusting with all sorts of intensity his words stopped and his hands died down sam lit a cigarette and offered one to gullitt the only person on death row with whom hed share hank henshaw to his left did not smoke they puffed for a moment each blowing clouds of smoke at the row of windows along the top of the hallway sam finally said im not going anywhere jb my lawyer says weve got a good chance do you believe him i think so hes a smart kid that must be weird man having a grandson as your lawyer i cant imagine gullitt was thirtyone childless married and often complained about his wifes jody or free world boyfriend she was a cruel woman who never visited and had once written a short letter with the good news that she was pregnant gullitt pouted for two days before admitting to sam that he had beaten her for years and chased lots of women himself she wrote again a month later and said she was sorry a friend loaned her the money for an abortion she explained and she didnt want a divorce after all gullitt couldnt have been happier its somewhat strange i guess sam said he looks nothing like me but he favors his mother so the dude just came right out and told you he was your longlost grandson no not at first we talked for a while and his voice sounded familiar sounded like his fathers his father is your son right yeah hes dead your son is dead yeah the green book finally arrived from preacher boy with another note about a magnificent dream he had just two nights ago he had recently acquired the rare spiritual gift of dream interpretation and couldnt wait to share it with sam the dream was still revealing itself to him and once he had it all pieced together he would decode it and untangle it and illustrate it for sam it was good news he already knew that much at least hes stopped singing sam said to himself as he finished the note and sat on his bed preacher boy had also been a gospel singer of sorts and a songwriter on top of that and periodically found himself seized with the spirit to the point of serenading the tier at full volume and at all hours of the day and night he was an untrained tenor with little pitch but incredible volume and the complaints came fast and furious when he belted his new tunes into the hallway packer himself usually intervened to stop the racket sam had even threatened to step in legally and speed up the kids execution if the caterwauling didnt stop a sadistic move that he later apologized for the poor kid was just crazy and if sam lived long enough he planned to use an insanity strategy that hed read about from the california case he reclined on his bed and began to read the fan ruffled the pages and circulated the sticky air but within minutes the sheets under him were wet he slept in dampness until the early hours before dawn when the row was almost cool and the sheets were almost dry the auburn house had never been a house or a home but for decades had been a quaint little church of yellow brick and stained glass it sat surrounded by a ugly chainlink fence on a shaded lot a few blocks from downtown memphis graffiti littered the yellow brick and the stained glass windows had been replaced with plywood the congregation had fled east years ago away from the inner city to the safety of the suburbs they took their pews and songbooks and even their steeple a security guard paced along the fence ready to open the gate next door was a crumbling apartment building and a block behind was a deteriorating federal housing project from which the patients of auburn house came they were all young mothers teenagers without exception whose mothers had also been teenagers and whose fathers were generally unknown the average age was fifteen the youngest had been eleven they drifted in from the project with a baby on a hip and sometimes another one trailing behind they came in packs of three and four and made their visits a social event they came alone and scared they gathered in the old sanctuary which was now a waiting room where paperwork was required they waited with their infants while their toddlers played under the seats they chatted with their friends other girls from the project whod walked to auburn house because cars were scarce and they were too young to drive adam parked in a small lot to the side and asked the security guard for directions he examined adam closely then pointed to the front door where two young girls were holding babies and smoking he entered between them nodding and trying to be polite but they only stared inside he found a half dozen of the same mothers sitting in plastic chairs with children swarming at their feet a young lady behind a desk pointed at a door and told him to take the hallway on the left the door to lees tiny office was open and she was talking seriously to a patient she smiled at adam ill be five minutes she said holding something that appeared to be a diaper the patient did not have a child with her but one was due very shortly adam eased along the hallway and found the mens room lee was waiting for him in the hall when he came out they pecked each other on the cheeks what do you think of our little operation she asked what exactly do you do here they walked through the narrow corridor with worn carpet and peeling walls auburn house is a nonprofit organization staffed with volunteers we work with young mothers it must be depressing depends on how you look at it welcome to my office lee waved at her door and they stepped inside the walls were covered with colorful charts one showing a series of babies and the foods they eat another listed in large simple words the most common ailments of newborns another cartoonish illustration hailed the benefits of condoms adam took a seat and assessed the walls all of our kids come from the projects so you can imagine the postnatal instruction they receive at home none of them are married they live with their mothers or aunts or grandmothers auburn house was founded by some nuns twenty years ago to teach these kids how to raise healthy babies adam nodded at the condom poster and to prevent babies yes were not family planners dont want to be but it doesnt hurt to mention birth control maybe you should do more than mention it maybe sixty percent of the babies born in this county last year were out of wedlock and the numbers go up each year and each year there are more cases of battered and abandoned children itll break your heart some of these little fellas dont have a chance who funds it its all private we spend half our time trying to raise money we operate on a very lean budget how many counselors like you a dozen or so some work a few afternoons a week a few saturdays im lucky i can afford to work here fulltime how many hours a week i dont know who keeps up with them i get here around ten and leave after dark and you do this for free yeah you guys call it pro bono i think its different with lawyers we do volunteer work to justify ourselves and the money we make our little contribution to society we still make plenty of money you understand this is a little different its rewarding howd you find this place i dont know it was a long time ago i was a member of a social club a hotteadrinkers club and wed meet once a month for a lovely lunch and discuss ways to raise a few pennies for the less fortunate one day anun spoke to us about auburn house and we adopted it as our beneficiary one thing led to another and youre not paid a dime phelps has plenty of money adam in fact i donate a lot of it to auburn house we have an annual fundraiser now at the peabody black tie and champagne and i make phelps lean on his banker buddies to show up with their wives and fork over the money raised over two hundred thousand last year where does it go some goes to overhead we have two fulltime staffers the building is cheap but it still costs the rest goes for baby supplies medicine and literature theres never enough so you sort of run the place no we pay an administrator im just a counselor adam studied the poster behind her the one with a bulky yellow condom snaking its way harmlessly across the wall he gathered from the latest surveys and studies that these little devices were not being used by teenagers in spite of television campaigns and school slogans and mtv spots by responsible rock stars he could think of nothing worse than sitting in this cramped little room all day discussing diaper rashes with fifteenyearold mothers i admire you for this he said looking at the wall with the baby food poster lee nodded but said nothing her eyes were tired and she was ready to go lets go eat she said where i dont know anywhere i saw sam today spent two hours with him lee sunk in her seat and slowly placed her feet on the desk as usual she was wearing faded jeans and a buttondown im his lawyer he signed the agreement yes he prepared one himself four pages we both signed it and so now its up to me are you scared terrified but i can handle it i talked to a reporter with the memphis press this afternoon theyve heard the rumor that sam cayhall is my grandfather what did you tell him couldnt really deny it could i he wanted to ask all kinds of questions about the family but i told him little im sure hell dig around and find some more what about me i certainly didnt tell him about you but hell start digging im sorry sorry about what sorry that maybe theyll expose your true identity youll be branded as the daughter of sam cayhall murderer racist antisemite terrorist klansman the oldest man ever led to the gas chamber and gassed like an animal theyll run you out of town ive been through worse what being the wife of phelps booth a am laughed at this and lee managed a smile a middleaged lady walked to the open m door and told lee she was leaving for the day lee jumped to her feet and quickly introduced her handsome young nephew adam hall a lawyer from chicago who was visiting for a spell the lady was sufficiently impressed as she backed out of the office and disappeared down the hall you shouldnt have done that adam said why not because my name will be in the paper tomorrow adam hall lawyer from chicago and grandson lees mouth dropped an inch before she caught it she then gave a shrug as if she didnt care but adam saw the fear in her eyes what a stupid mistake she was telling herself who cares she said as she picked up her purse and briefcase lets go find a restaurant they went to a neighborhood bistro an italian family place with small tables and few lights in a converted bungalow they sat in a dark corner and ordered drinks iced tea for her and mineral water for him when the waiter left lee leaned over the table and said adam theres something i need to tell you he nodded but said nothing im an alcoholic his eyes narrowed then froze theyd had drinks together the last two nights its been about ten years now she explained still low over the table the nearest person was fifteen feet away there were a lot of reasons okay some of which you could probably guess i went through recovery came out clean and lasted about a year then rehab again ive been through treatment three times the last was five years ago its not easy but you had a drink last night several drinks i know and the night before and today i emptied all the bottles and threw away the beer theres not a drop in the apartment thats fine with me i hope im not the reason no but i need your help okay youll be living with me for a couple of months and well have some bad times just help me sure lee i wish youd told me when i arrived i dont drink much i can take it or leave it alcoholism is a strange animal sometimes i can watch people drink and it doesnt bother me then ill see a beer commercial and break into a sweat ill see an ad in a magazine for a wine i used to enjoy and the craving is so intense ill become nauseated its an awful struggle the drinks arrived and adam was afraid to touch his mineral water he poured it over the ice and stirred it with a spoon does it run in the family he asked almost certain that it did i dont think so sam would sneak around and drink a little when we were kids but he kept it from us my mothers mother was an alcoholic so my mother never touched the stuff i never saw it in the house howd it happen to you gradually when i left home i couldnt wait to give it a try because it was taboo when eddie and i were growing up then i met phelps and he comes from a family of heavy social drinkers it became an escape and then it became a crutch ill do whatever i can im sorry dont be sorry ive enjoyed having a drink with you but its time to quit okay ive fallen off the wagon three times and it all starts with the idea that i can have a drink or two and keep it under control i went a month one time sipping wine and limiting myself to a glass a day then it was a glass and a half then two then three then rehab im an alcoholic and ill never get over it adam lifted his glass and touched it to hers heres to the wagon well ride it together they gulped their soft drinks the waiter was a student with a quick idea of what they should eat he suggested the chefs baked ravioli because it was simply the best in town and would be on the table in ten minutes they agreed i often wondered what you did with your time but i was afraid to ask adam said i had a job once after walt was born and started school i got bored so phelps found me a job with one of his friends companies big salary nice office i had my own secretary who knew much more about my job than i did i quit after a year i married money adam so im not supposed to work phelps mother was appalled that i would draw a salary what do rich women do all day long carry the burdens of the world they must first make sure hubby is off to work then they must plan the day the servants have to be directed and supervised the shopping is divided into at least two parts morning and afternoon with the morning usually consisting of several rigorous phone calls to fifth avenue for the necessities the afternoon shopping is sometimes actually done in person with the driver waiting in the parking lot of course lunch takes up most of the day because it requires hours to plan and at least two hours to execute its normally a small banquet attended by more of the same harried souls then theres the social responsibility part of being a rich woman at least three times a week she attends tea parties in the homes of her friends where they nibble on imported biscuits and whimper about the plight of abandoned babies or mothers on crack then its back home in a hurry to freshen up for hubbys return from the office wars shell sip her first martini with him by the pool while four people prepare their dinner what about sex hes too tired plus he probably has a mistress this is what happened to phelps i guess although he couldnt complain about the sex i had a baby i got older and hes always had a steady supply of young blondes from his banks you wouldnt believe his office its filled with gorgeous women with impeccable teeth and nails all with short skirts and long legs they sit behind nice desks and talk on the phone and wait for his beck and call he has a small bedroom next to a conference room the mans an animal so you gave up the hard life of a rich woman and moved out yeah i was not a very good rich woman adam i hated it it was fun for a very short while but i didnt fit in not the right blood type believe it or not my family was not known in the social circles of memphis you must be kidding i swear and to be a proper rich woman with a future in this city you have to come from a family of rich fossils preferably with a greatgrandfather who made money in cotton i just didnt fit in but you still play the social game no i still make appearances but only for phelps its important for him to have a wife whos his age but with a touch of gray a mature wife who looks nice in an evening dress and diamonds and can hold her own while gabbing with his boring friends we go out three times a year im sort of an aging trophy wife seems to me like hed want a real trophy wife one of the slinky blondes no his family would be crushed and theres a lot of money in trust phelps walks on eggshells around his family when his parents are gone then hell be ready to come out of the closet i thought his parents hated you of course they do its ironic that theyre the reason were still married a divorce would be scandalous adam laughed and shook his head in bewilderment this is crazy yes but it works im happy hes happy he has his little girls i fool around with whomever i want no questions are asked what about walt she slowly sat her glass of tea on the table and looked away what about him she said without looking you never talk about him i know she said softly still watching something across the room let me guess more skeletons in the closet more secrets she looked at him sadly then gave a slight shrug as if to say what the hell he is after all my first cousin adam said and to my knowledge and barring any further revelations hes the only first cousin i have you wouldnt like him of course not hes part cayhall no hes all booth phelps wanted a son why i dont know and so we had a son phelps of course had little time for him always too busy with the bank he took him to the country club and tried to teach him golf but it didnt work walt never liked sports they went to canada once to hunt pheasants and didnt speak to each other for a week when they came home he wasnt a sissy but he wasnt athletic either phelps was a big prep school jock football rugby boxing all that walt tried to play but the talent just wasnt there phelps drove him even harder and walt rebelled so phelps with the typical heavy hand sent him away to boarding school my son left home at the age of fifteen where did he go to college he spent one year at cornell then dropped out he dropped out yes he went to europe after his freshman year and hes been there ever since adam studied her face and waited for more he sipped his water and was about to speak when the waiter appeared and rapidly placed a large bowl of green salad between them why did he stay in europe he went to amsterdam and fell in love a nice dutch girl a nice dutch boy i see she was suddenly interested in the salad which she served on her plate and began cutting into small pieces adam did likewise and they ate in silence for a while as the bistro filled up and became noisier an attractive couple of tired yuppies sat at the small table next to them and ordered strong drinks adam smeared butter on a roll took a bite then asked how did phelps react she wiped the corners of her mouth the last trip phelps and i took together was to amsterdam to find our son hed been gone for almost two years hed written a few times and called me occasionally but then all correspondence stopped we were worried of course so we flew over and camped out in a hotel until we found him what was he doing working as a waiter in a cafe had an earring in each ear his hair was chopped off weird clothes he was wearing those damned clogs with wool socks spoke perfect dutch we didnt want to make a scene so we asked him to come to our hotel he did it was horrible just horrible phelps handled it like the idiot he is and the damage was irreparable we left and came home phelps made a big production of redoing his will and revoking walts trust hes never come home never i meet him in paris once a year we both arrive alone thats the only rule we stay in a nice hotel and spend a week together roaming the city eating the food visiting the museums its the highlight of my year but he hates memphis id like to meet him lee watched him carefully then her eyes watered bless you if youre serious id love for you to go with me im serious i dont care if hes gay id enjoy meeting my first cousin she took a deep breath and smiled the ravioli arrived on two heaping plates with steam rising in all directions a long loaf of garlic bread was placed along the edge of the table and the waiter was gone does walt know about sam adam asked no ive never had the guts to tell him does he know about me and carmen about eddie about any of our familys glorious history yes a little when he was a little boy i told him he had cousins in california but that they never came to memphis phelps of course told him that his california cousins were of a much lower social class and therefore not worthy of his attention walt was groomed by his father to be a snob adam you must understand this he attended the most prestigious prep schools hung out at the nicest country clubs and his family consisted of a bunch of booth cousins who were all the same theyre all miserable people what do the booths think of having a homosexual in the family they hate him of course and he hates them i like him already hes not a bad kid he wants to study art and paint i send him money all the time does sam know he has a gay grandson i dont think so i dont know who would tell him i probably wont tell him please dont he has enough on his mind the ravioli cooled enough to eat and they enjoyed it in silence the waiter brought more water and tea the couple next to them ordered a bottle of red wine and lee glanced at it more than once adam wiped his mouth and rested for a moment he leaned over the table can i ask you something personal he said quietly all your questions seem to be personal right so can i ask you one more please do well i was just thinking tonight youve told me youre an alcoholic your husbands an animal and your son is gay thats a lot for tine meal but is there anything else i should know lemme see yes phelps is an alcoholic too but he wont admit it anything else hes been sued twice for sexual harassment okay forget about the booths any more surprises from our side of the family we havent scratched the surface adam i was afraid of that a loud thunderstorm rolled across the delta before dawn and sam was awakened by the crack of lightning he heard raindrops dropping hard against the open windows above the hallway then he heard them drip and puddle against the wall under the windows not far from his cell the dampness of his bed was suddenly cool maybe today would not be so hot maybe the rain would linger and shade the sun and maybe the wind would blow away the humidity for a day or two he always had these hopes when it rained but in the summer a thunderstorm usually meant soggy ground which under a glaring sun meant nothing but more suffocating heat he raised his head and watched the rain fall from the windows and gather on the floor the water flickered in the reflected light distant yellow bulb except for this faint light the row was dark and it was silent sam loved the rain especially at night and especially in the summer the state of mississippi in its boundless wisdom had built its prison in the hottest place it could find and it designed its maximum security unit along the same lines as an oven the windows to the outside were small and useless built that way for security reasons of course the planners of this little branch of hell also decided that there would be no ventilation of any sort no chance for a breeze getting in or the dank air getting out and after they built what they considered to be a model penal facility they decided they would not air condition it it would sit proudly beside the soybeans and cotton and absorb the same heat and moisture from the ground and when the land was dry the row would simply bake along with the crops but the state of mississippi could not control the weather and when the rains came and cooled the air sam smiled d to himself and offered a small prayer of thanks a higher being was in control after all the state was helpless when it rained it was a small victory he eased to his feet and stretched his back his bed consisted of a piece of foam six feet by two and a half four inches thick otherwise known as a mattress it rested on a metal frame fastened securely to the floor and wall it was covered with two sheets sometimes they passed out blankets in the winter back pain was common throughout the row but with time the body adjusted and there were few complaints the prison doctor was not considered to be a friend of death row inmates he took two steps and leaned on his elbows through the bars he listened to the wind and thunder and watched the drops bounce along the windowsill and splatter on the floor how nice it would be to step through that wall and walk through the wet grass on the other side to stroll around the prison grounds in the driving rain naked and crazy soaking wet with water dripping from his hair and beard the horror of death row is that you die a little each day the waiting kills you you live in a cage and when you wake up you mark off another day and you tell yourself that you are now one day closer to death sam lit a cigarette and watched the smoke float upward toward the raindrops weird things happen with our absurd judicial system courts rule this way one day and the other way the next the same judges reach different conclusions on familiar issues a court will ignore a wild motion or appeal for years then one day embrace it and grant relief judges die and theyre replaced by judges who think differently presidents come and go and they appoint their pals to the bench the supreme court drifts one way then another at times death would be welcome and if given the choice of death on one hand or life on death row on the other sam would quickly take the gas but there was always hope always the slight glimmering promise that something somewhere in the vast maze of the judicial jungle would strike a chord with someone and his case would be reversed every resident of the row dreamed of the miracle reversal from heaven and their dreams sustained them from one miserable day to the next sam had recently read that there were almost twentyfive hundred inmates sentenced to die in america and last year only sixteen were executed mississippi had executed only four since the year gary gilmore insisted on a firing squad in utah there was safety in those numbers they fortified his resolve to file even more appeals he smoked through the bars as the storm passed and the rain stopped he took his breakfast as the sun rose and at seven oclock he turned on the television for the morning news he had just bitten into a piece of cold toast when suddenly his face appeared on the screen behind a memphis morning anchorperson she eagerly reported the thrilling top story of the day the bizarre case of sam cayhay and his new lawyer seems his new lawyer was his longlost grandson one adam hall a young lawyer from the mammoth chicago firm of kravitz bane the outfit whod represented sam for the past seven years or so the photo of sam was at least ten years old the same one they used every time his name was mentioned on tv or in print the photo of adam was a bit stranger he obviously had not posed for it someone had snapped it outdoors while he wasnt looking she explained with wild eyes that the memphis press was reporting this morning that adam hall had confirmed that he was in fact the grandson of sam cayhall she gave a fleeting sketch of sams crime and twice gave the date of his pending execution more on the story later she promised perhaps maybe as soon as the noon report then she was off on the morning summary of last nights murders sam threw the toast on the floor next to the bookshelves and stared at it an insect found it almost immediately and crawled over and around it a half dozen times before deciding it wasnt worth eating his lawyer had already talked to the press what do they teach these people in law school do they give instruction on media control sam you there it was gullitt yeah im here just saw you on channel four yeah i saw it you pissed im okay take a deep breath sam its okay among men sentenced to die in the gas chamber the expression take a deep breath was used often and considered nothing more than an effort at humor they said it to each other all the time usually when one was angry but when used by the guards it was far from funny it was a constitutional violation it had been mentioned in more than one lawsuit as an example of the cruel treatment dispensed on death row sam agreed with the insect and ignored the rest of his breakfast he sipped coffee and stared at the floor at ninethirty sergeant packer was on the tier looking for sam it was time for his hour of fresh air the rains were far away and the sun was blistering the delta packer had two guards with him and a pair of leg irons sam pointed at the chains and asked what are they for theyre for security sam im just going out to play arent i no sam were taking you to the law library your lawyer wants to meet you there so yall can talk amongst the law books now turn around sam stuck both hands through the opening of his door packer cuffed them loosely then the door opened and sam stepped into the hall the guards dropped to their knees and were securing the leg irons when sam asked packer what about my hour out what about it when do i get it later you said that yesterday and i didnt get my rec time you lied to me yesterday now youre lying to me again ill sue you for this lawsuits take a long time sam they take years i want to talk to the warden and im sure he wants to talk to you too sam now do you want to see your lawyer or not i have a right to my lawyer and i have a right to my rec time get off his ass packer hank henshaw shouted from less than six feet away you lie packer you lie j b gullitt added from the other side down boys packer said coolly well take care of old sam here yeah youd gas him today if you could henshaw yelled the leg irons were in place and sam shuffled into his cell to get a file he clutched it to his chest and waddled down the tier with packer at his side and the guards following give em hell sam henshaw yelled as they walked away there were other shouts of support for sam and catcalls at packer as they left the tier they were cleared through a set of doors and tier a was behind them the warden says you get two hours out this afternoon and two hours a day till its over packer said as they moved slowly through a short hallway till whats over this thang what thang packer and most of the guards referred to an execution as a thang you know what i mean packer said tell the warden hes a real sweetheart and ask him if i get two hours if this thang doesnt go off okay and while youre at it tell him i think hes a lying son of a bitch he already knows they stopped at a wall of bars and waited for the door to open they passed through it and stopped again by two guards at the front door packer made quick notes on a clipboard and they walked outside where a white van was waiting the guards took sam by the arms and lifted him and his chains into the side door packer sat in the front with the driver does this thing have air conditioning sam snapped at the driver whose window was down yep the driver said as they backed away from the front of msu then turn the damned thing on okay knock it off sam packer said without conviction its bad enough to sweat all day in a cage with no air conditioning but its pretty stupid to sit here and suffocate turn the damned thing on ive got my rights take a deep breath sam packer drawled and winked at the driver thatll cost you packer youll wishyou hadnt said that the driver hit a switch and the air started blowing the van was cleared through the double gates and slowly made its way down the dirt road away from the row though he was handcuffed and shackled this brief journey on the outside was refreshing sam stopped the bitching and immediately ignored the others in the van the rains had left puddles in the grassy ditches beside the road and they had washed the cotton plants now more than kneehigh the stalks and leaves were dark green sam remembered picking cotton as a boy then quickly dismissed the thought he had trained his mind to forget the past and on those rare occasions when a childhood memory flashed before him he quickly snuffed it out the van crept along and he was thankful for this he stared at two inmates sitting under a tree watching a buddy lift weights in the sun there was a fence around them but how nice he thought to be outside walking and talking exercising and lounging never giving a thought to the gas chamber never worrying about the last appeal the law library was known as the twig because it was too small to be considered a full branch the main prison law library was deeper into the farm at another camp the twig was used exclusively by death row inmates it was stuck to the rear of an administration building with only one door and no windows sam had been there many times during the past nine years it was a small room with a decent collection of current law books and uptodate reporting services a battered conference table sat in the center with shelves of books lining the four walls every now and then a trustee would volunteer to serve as the librarian but good help was hard to find and the books were seldom where they were supposed to be this irritated sam immensely because he admired neatness and he despised the africans and he was certain that most if not all of the librarians were black though he did not know this for a fact the two guards unshackled sam at the door you got two hours packer said i got as long as i want sam said rubbing his wrists as if the handcuffs had broken them sure sam but when i come after you in two hours ill bet we load your gimpy little ass into the van packer opened the door as the guards took their positions beside it sam entered the library and slammed the door behind him he laid his file on the table and stared at his lawyer adam stood at the far end of the conference table holding a book and waiting for his client hed heard voices outside and he watched sam enter the room without guards or handcuffs he stood there in his red jumpsuit much smaller now without the thick metal screen between them they studied each other for a moment across the table grandson and grandfather lawyer and client stranger and stranger it was an awkward interval in which they sized each other up and neither knew what to do with the other hello sam adam said walking toward him mornin saw us on tv a few hours ago yeah have you seen the paper not yet it comes later adam slid the morning paper across the table and sam stopped it he held it with both hands eased into a chair and raised the paper to within six inches of his nose he read it carefully and studied the pictures of himself and adam todd marks had evidently spent most of the evening digging and making frantic phone calls he had verified that one alan cayhall had been born in clanton in ford county in and the fathers name listed on the birth certificate was one edward s cayhall he checked the birth certificate for edward s cayhall and found that his father was samuel lucas cayhall the same man now on death row he reported that adam hall had confirmed that his fathers name had been changed in california and that his grandfather was sam cayhall he was careful not to attribute direct quotes to adam but he nonetheless violated their agreement there was little doubt the two had talked quoting unnamed sources the story explained how eddie and his family left clanton in after sams arrest and fled to california where eddie later killed himself the trail ended there because marks obviously ran out of time late in the day and could confirm nothing from california the unnamed source or sources didnt mention sams daughter living in memphis so lee was spared the story ran out of steam with a series of nocomments from baker cooley garner goodman phillip naifeh lucas mann and a lawyer with the attorney generals office in jackson marks finished strong though with a sensational recap of the kramer bombing the story was on the front page of the press above the main headline the ancient picture of sam was to the right and next to it was a strange photo of adam from the waist up lee had brought the paper to him hours earlier as he sat on the terrace and watched the early morning river traffic they drank coffee and juice and read and reread the story after much analysis adam had decided that todd marks had placed a photographer across the street from the peabody hotel and when adam left their little meeting yesterday and stepped onto the sidewalk he got his picture taken the suit and tie were definitely worn yesterday did you talk to this clown sam growled as he placed the paper on the table adam sat across from him we met why because he called our office in memphis said hed heard some rumors and i wanted him to get it straight its no big deal our pictures on the front page is no big deal youve been there before and you i didnt exactly pose it was an ambush you see but i think i look rather dashing did you confirm these facts for him i did we agreed it would be background and he could not quote me on anything nor was he supposed to use me as a source he violated our agreement and ripped his ass with me he also planted a photographer so ive spoken for the first and last time to the memphis press sam looked at the paper for a moment he was relaxed and his words were as slow as ever he managed a trace of a smile and you confirmed that you are my grandson yes cant really deny it can i do you want to deny it read the paper sam if i wanted to deny it would it be on the front page this satisfied sam and the smile grew a bit he bit his lip and stared at adam then he methodically removed a fresh pack of cigarettes and adam glanced around for a window after the first one was properly lit sam said stay away from the press theyre ruthless and theyre stupid they lie and they make careless mistakes but im a lawyer sam its inbred i know its hard but try to control yourself i dont want it to happen again adam reached into his briefcase smiled and pulled out some papers i have a wonderful idea how to save your life he rubbed his hands together then removed a pen from his pocket it was time for work im listening well as you might guess ive been doing a lot of research thats what youre paid to do yes and ive come up with a marvelous little theory a new claim which i intend to file on monday the theory is simple mississippi is one of only five states still using the gas chamber right thats right and the mississippi legislature in passed a law giving a condemned man the choice of dying by lethal injection or in the gas chamber but the new law applies only to those convicted after july doesnt apply to you thats correct i think about half the guys on the row will get their choice its years away though one of the reasons the legislature approved lethal injection was to make the killings more humane ive studied the legislative history behind the law and there was a lot of discussion of problems the states had with gas chamber executions the theory is simple make the executions quick and painless and there will be fewer constitutional claims that they are cruel lethal injections raise fewer legal problems thus the killings are easier to carry out our theory then is that since the state has adopted lethal injection it has in effect said that the gas chamber is obsolete and why is it obsolete because its a cruel way to kill people sam puffed on this for a minute and nodded slowly keep going he said we attack the gas chamber as a method of execution do you limit it to mississippi probably i know there were problems with teddy doyle meeks and maynard tole sam snorted and blew smoke across the table problems you could say that how much do you know come on they died within fifty yards of me we sit in our cells all day long and think about death everyone on the row knows what happened to those boys tell me about them sam leaned forward on his elbows and stared absently at the newspaper in front of him meeks was the first execution in mississippi in ten years and they didnt know what they were doing it was id been here for almost two years and until then we were living in a dream world we never thought about the gas chamber and cyanide pellets and last meals we were sentenced to die but hell they werent killing anyone so why worry but meeks woke us up they killed him so they could certainly kill the rest of us what happened to him adam had read a dozen stories about the botched execution of teddy doyle meeks but he wanted to hear it from sam everything went wrong have you seen the chamber not yet theres a little room off to the side where the executioner mixes his solution the sulfuric acid is in a canister which he takes from his little laboratory to a tube running into the bottom of the chamber with meeks the executioner was drunk come on sam i didnt see him okay but everyone knows he was drunk state law designates an official state executioner and the warden and his gang didnt think about it until just a few hours before the execution keep in mind no one thought meeks would die we were all waiting on a last minute stay because hed been through it twice already but there was no stay and they scrambled around at the last minute trying to locate the official state executioner they found him drunk he was a plumber i think anyway his first batch of brew didnt work he placed the canister into the tube pulled a lever and everyone waited for meeks to take a deep breath and die meeks held his breath as long as he could then inhaled nothing happened they waited meeks waited the witnesses waited everybody slowly turned to the executioner who was also waiting and cussing he went back to his little room and fixed up another mix of sulfuric acid then he had to retrieve the old canister from the chute and that took ten minutes the warden and lucas mann and the rest of the goons were standing around waiting and fidgeting and cussing this drunk plumber who finally plugged in the new canister and pulled the lever this time the sulfuric acid landed where it was supposed to in a bowl under the chair where meeks was strapped the executioner pulled the second lever dropping the cyanide pellets which were also under the chair hovering above the sulfuric acid the pellets dropped and sure enough the gas drifted upward to where old meeks was holding his breath again you can see the vapors you know when he finally sucked in a nose full of it he started shaking and jerking and this went on quite a while for some reason theres a metal pole that runs from the top of the chamber to the bottom and its directly behind the chair just about the time meeks got still and everybody thought he was dead his head started banging back and forth striking this pole just beating it like hell his eyes were rolled back his lips were wide open he was foaming at the mouth and there he was beating the back of his head in on this pole it was sick how long did it take to kill him who knows according to the prison doctor death was instant and painless according to some of the eyewitnesses meeks convulsed and heaved and pounded his head for five minutes the meeks execution had provided death penalty abolitionists with much ammunition there was little doubt he had suffered greatly and many accounts were written of his death sams version was remarkably consistent with those of the eyewitnesses who told you about it adam asked a couple of the guards talked about it not to me of course but word spread quickly there was a public outcry which wouldve been even worse if meeks hadnt been such a despicable person everyone hated him and his little victim had suffered greatly so it was hard to feel sympathetic where were you when he was executed in my first cell tier d on the far side away from the chamber they locked everybody down that night every inmate at parchman it happened just after midnight which is sort of amusing because the state has a full day to carry out the execution the death warrant does not specify a certain time just a certain day so these gongho bastards are just itching to do it as soon as possible they plan every execution for one minute after midnight that way if theres a stay then they have the entire day for their lawyers to get it lifted buster moac went down that way they strapped him in at midnight then the phone rang and they took him back to the holding room where he waited and sweated for six hours while the lawyers ran from one court to the next finally as the sun was rising they strapped him in for the last time i guess you know what his last words were adam shook his head i have no idea buster was a friend of mine a class guy naifeh asked him if he had any last words and he said yes as a matter of fact he did have something to say he said the steak theyd cooked for his last meal was a bit too rare naifeh mumbled something to the effect that hed speak to the cook about it then buster asked if the governor had granted a last minute pardon naifeh said no buster then said well tell that son of a bitch hes lost my vote they slammed the door and gassed him sam was obviously amused by this and adam was obliged to offer an awkward laugh he looked at his legal pad while sam lit another cigarette four years after the execution of teddy doyle meeks the appeals of maynard tole reached a dead end and it was time for the chamber to be used again tole was a kravitz bane pro bono project a young lawyer named peter wiesenberg represented tole under the supervision of e garner goodman both wiesenberg and goodman witnessed the execution which in many ways was dreadfully similar to meeks adam had not discussed the tole execution with goodman but hed studied the file and read the eyewitness accounts written by wiesenberg and goodman what about maynard tole adam asked he was an african a militant who killed a bunch of people in a robbery and of course blamed everything on the system always referred to himself as an african warrior he threatened me several times but for the most part he was just selling wolf selling wolf yeah that means a guy is talking bad talking trash its common with the africans theyre all innocent you know every damned one of them theyre here because theyre black and the system is white and even though theyve raped and murdered its someone elses fault always always someone elses fault so you were happy when he went i didnt say that killing is wrong its wrong for the africans to kill its wrong for the angles to kill and its wrong for the people of the state of mississippi to kill death row inmates what i did was wrong so how do you make it right by killing me did tole suffer same as meeks they found them a new executioner and he got it right the first time the gas hit tole and he went into convulsions started banging his head on the pole just like meeks except tole evidently had a harder head because he kept beating the pole with it it went on and on and finally naifeh and the goon squad got real anxious because the boy wouldnt die and things were getting sloppy so they actually made the witnesses leave the witness room it was pretty nasty i read somewhere that it took ten minutes for him to die he fought it hard thats all i know of course the warden and his doctor said death was instant and painless typical they did however make one slight change in their procedure after tole by the time they got to my buddy moac they had designed this cute little head brace made of leather straps and buckles and attached to that damned pole with moac and later with jumbo parris they belted their heads down so tight there was no way they could flop around and whip the pole a nice touch dont you think that makes it easier on naifeh and the witnesses because now they dont have to watch as much suffering you see my point sam its a horrible way to die we attack the method we find witnesses wholl testify about these executions and we try to convince a judge to rule the gas chamber unconstitutional so what do we then ask for lethal injection whats the point seems kind of silly for me to say i prefer not to die in the chamber but what the hell lethal injection will do just fine put me on the gurney and fill me up with drugs ill be dead right i dont get it true but we buy ourselves some time well attack the gas chamber get a temporary stay then pursue it through the higher courts we could jam this thing for years its already been done what do you mean its already been done texas case called larson the same arguments were made with no result the court said gas chambers have been around for fifty years and theyve proven themselves quite efficient at killing humanely yeah but theres one big difference what this aint texas meeks and tole and moac and parris werent gassed in texas and by the way texas has already gone to lethal injection they threw away their gas chamber because they found a better way to kill most gas chamber states have traded them in for better technology sam stood and walked to the other end of the table well when its my time i damned sure want to go with the latest technology he paced along the table back and forth three or four times then stopped its eighteen feet from one end of this room to the other i can walk eighteen feet without hitting bars do you realize what its like spending twentythree hours a day in a cell thats six feet by nine this is freedom man he paced some more puffing as he came and went adam watched the frail figure bounce along the edge of he table with a trail of smoke behind him he had no socks and wore navycolored rubber shower shoes that squeaked when he paced he suddenly stopped yanked a book from a shelf threw it hard on the table and began flipping pages with a flourish after a few minutes of intense searching he found exactly what he was looking for and spent five minutes reading it here it is he mumbled to himself i knew id read this before what is it a case from north carolina the mans name was jimmy old and evidently jimmy did not want to die they had to drag him into the chamber kicking and crying and screaming and it took a while to strap him in they slammed the door and dropped the gas and his chin crashed onto his chest then his head rolled back and began twitching he turned to the witnesses who could see nothing but the whites of his eyeballs and he began salivating his head rocked and swung around forever while his body shook and his mouth foamed it went on and on and one of the witnesses a journalist vomited the warden got fed up with it and closed the black curtains so the witnesses couldnt see anymore they estimate it took fourteen minutes for jimmy old to die sounds cruel to me sam closed the book and placed it carefully onto the shelf he lit a cigarette and studied the ceiling virtually every gas chamber was built long ago by eaton metal products in salt lake city i read somewhere that missouris was built by inmates but our little chamber was built by eaton and theyre all basically the same made of steel octagonal in shape with a series of windows placed here and there so folks can watch the death theres not much room inside the actual chamber just a wooden seat with straps all over it theres a metal bowl directly under the chair and just inches above the bowl is a little bag of cyanide tablets which the executioner controls with a lever he also controls the sulfuric acid which is introduced into the affair by means of the canister the canister makes its way through a tube to the bowl and when the bowl fills with acid he pulls the lever and drops the cyanide pellets this causes the gas which of course causes death which of course is designed to be painless and quick wasnt it designed to replace the electric chair yes back in the twenties and thirties everyone had an electric chair and it was just the most marvelous device ever invented i remember as a boy they had a portable electric chair which they simply loaded into a trailer and took around to the various counties theyd pull up at the local jail bring em out in shackles line em up outside the trailer then run em through it was an efficient way to alleviate overcrowded jails he shook his head in disbelief anyway they of course had no idea what they were doing and there were some horrible stories of people suffering this is capital punishment right not capital torture and it wasnt just mississippi many states were using these old halfass rigged electric chairs with a bunch of jakelegs pulling the switches and there were all sorts of problems theyd strap in sone poor guy pull the switch give him a good jolt but not good enough guy was roasting on the inside but wouldnt die so theyd wait a few minutes and hit him again this might go on for fifteen minutes they wouldnt fasten the electrodes properly and it was not uncommon for flames and sparks to shoot from the eyes and ears i read an account of a guy who received an improper voltage the steam built up in his head and his eyeballs popped out blood ran down his face during an electrocution the skin gets so hot that they cant touch the guy for a while so in the old days they had to let him cool off before they could tell if he was dead there are lots of stories about men who would sit still after the initial jolt then start breathing again so they would of course hit em with another current this might happen four or five times it was awful so this army doctor invented the gas chamber as a more humane way to kill people it is now as you say obsolete because of lethal injection sam had an audience and adam was captivated how many men have died in mississippis chamber he asked itwas first used here in or thereabouts between then and they killed thirtyfive men no women after furman in it sat idle until teddy doyle meeks in theyve used it three times since then so thats a total of thirtynine ill be number forty he began pacing again now much slower its a terribly inefficient way to kill people he said much like a professor in front of a classroom and its dangerous dangerous of course to the poor guy strapped in the chair but also to those outside the chamber these damned things are old and they all leak to some degree the seals and gaskets rot and crumble and the cost of building a chamber that will not leak is prohibitive a small leak could be deadly to the executioner or anyone standing nearby there are always a handful of people naifeh lucas mann maybe a minister the doctor a guard or two standing in the little room just outside the chamber there are two doors to this little room and they are always closed during an execution if any of the gas leaked from the chamber into the room it would probably hit naifeh or lucas mann and theyd croak right there on the floor not a bad idea come to think of it the witnesses are also in a great deal of danger and they dont have a clue theres nothing between them and the chamber except for a row of windows which are old and equally subject to leakage theyre also in a small room with the door closed and if theres a gas leak of any size these gawking fools get gassed too but the real danger comes afterward theres a wire they stick to your ribs and it runs through a hole in the chamber to outside where a doctor monitors the heartbeat once the doctor says the guy is dead they open a valve on top of the chamber and the gas is supposed to evaporate most of it does theyll wait fifteen minutes or so then open the door the cooler air from the outside thats used to evacuate the chamber causes a problem because it mixes with the remaining gas and condenses on everything inside it creates a death trap for anyone going in its extremely dangerous and most of these clowns dont realize how serious it is theres a residue of prussic acid on everything walls windows floor ceiling door and of course the dead guy they spray the chamber and the corpse with ammonia to neutralize the remaining gas then the removal team or whatever its called goes in with oxygen masks theyll wash the inmate a second time with ammonia or chlorine bleach because the poison oozes through the pores in the skin while hes still strapped in the chair they cut his clothes off put them in a bag and burn them in the old days they allowed the guy to wear only a pair of shorts so their job would be easier but now theyre such sweethearts they allow us to wear whatever we want so if i get that far ill have a hell of a time selecting my wardrobe he actually spat on the floor as he thought about this he cursed under his breath and stomped around the far end of the table what happens to the body adam asked somewhat ashamed to tread on such sensitive matters but nonetheless anxious to complete the story sam grunted a time or two then stuck the cigarette in his mouth do you know the extent of my wardrobe no consists of two of these red monkey suits four or five sets of clean underwear and one pair of these cute little rubber shower shoes that look like leftovers from a nigger fire sale i refuse to die in one of these red suits ive thought about exercising my constitutional rights and parading into the chamber buck naked wouldnt that be a sight can you see those goons trying to shove me around and strap me in and trying like hell not to touch my privates and when they get me strapped down ill reach over and take the little heart monitor gizmo and attach it to my testicles wouldnt the doctor love that and id make sure the witnesses saw my bare ass i think thats what ill do what happens to the body adam asked again well once its sufficiently washed and disinfected they dress it in prison garb pull it out of the chair then put it in a body bag they place it on a stretcher which goes into the ambulance which takes it to a funeral home somewhere the family takes over at that point most families sam was now standing with his back to adam talking to a wall and leaning on a bookshelf he was silent for a long time silent and still as he gazed into the corner and thought about the four men hed known who had already gone to the chamber there was an unwritten rule on the row that when your time came you did not go to the chamber in a red prison suit you did not give them the satisfaction of killing you in the clothes theyd forced you to wear maybe his brother the one who sent the monthly supply of cigarettes would help with a shirt and a pair of pants new socks would be nice and anything but the rubber shower shoes hed rather go barefoot than wear those damned things he turned and walked slowly to adams end of the table and took a seat i like this idea he said very quiet and composed its worth a try good lets get to work i want you to find more cases like jimmy old from north carolina lets dig up every wretched and botched gas chamber execution known to man well throw em all in the lawsuit i want you to make a list of people who might testify about the meeks and tole executions maybe even moac and parris sam was already on his feet again pulling books from shelves and mumbling to himself he piled them on the table dozens of them then buried himself among the stacks the rolling wheat fields stretched for miles then grew steeper as the foothills began the majestic mountains lined the farmland in the distance in a sweeping valley above the fields with a view for miles in front and with the mountains as a barrier to the rear the nazi compound lay sprawled over a hundred acres its barbedwire fences were camouflaged with hedgerows and underbrush its firing ranges and combat grounds were likewise screened to prevent detection from the air only two innocuous log cabins sat above the ground and if seen from the outside would appear only to be fishing lodges but below them deep in the hills were two shafts with elevators which dropped into a maze of natural caverns and manmade caves large tunnels wide enough for golf carts ran in all directions and connected a dozen different rooms one room had a printing press two stored weapons and ammunition three large ones were living quarters one was a small library the largest room a cavern forty feet from top to bottom was the central hall where the members gathered for speeches and films and rallies it was a stateoftheart compound with satellite dishes feeding televisions with news from around the world and computers linked to other compounds for the quick flow of information and fax machines cellular phones and every current electronic device in vogue no less than ten newspapers were received into the compound each day and they were taken to a table in a room next to the library where they were first read by a man named roland he lived in the compound most of the time along with several other members who maintained the place when the newspapers arrived from the city usually around nine in the morning roland poured himself a large cup of coffee and started reading it was not a chore he had traveled the world many times spoke four languages and had a voracious appetite for knowledge if a story caught his attention he would mark it and later he would make a copy of it and give it to the computer desk his interests were varied he barely scanned the sports and never looked at the want ads fashion style living fanfare and related sections were browsed with little curiosity he collected stories about groups similar to his aryans nazis the kkk lately hed been flagging many stories from germany and eastern europe and was quite thrilled with the rise of fascism there he spoke fluent german and spent at least one month a year in that great country he watched the politicians with their deep concern about hate crimes and their desire to restrict the rights of groups such as his he watched the supreme court he followed the trials of skinheads in the united states he followed the tribulations of the kkk he normally spent two hours each morning absorbing the latest news and deciding which stories should be kept for future reference it was routine but he enjoyed it immensely this particular morning would be different the first glimpse of trouble was a picture of sam cayhall buried deep in the front section of a san francisco daily the story had but three paragraphs but sufficiently covered the hot news that the oldest man on death row in america would now be represented by his grandson roland read it three times before he believed it then marked the story to be saved after an hour hed read the same story five or six times two papers had the snapshot of young adam hall that appeared on the front page of the memphis paper the day before roland had followed the case of sam cayhall for many years and for several reasons first it was normally the type of case that would interest their computers an aging klan terrorist from the sixties biding his time on death row the cayhall printout was already a foot thick though he was certainly no lawyer roland shared the prevailing opinion that sams appeals had run their course and he was about to die this suited roland just fine but he kept his opinion to himself sam cayhall was a hero to white supremacists and rolands own little band of nazis had already been asked to participate in demonstrations before the execution they had no direct contact with cayhall because he had never answered their letters but he was a symbol and they wanted to make the most of his death rolands last name forchin was of cajun extraction from down around thibodaux he had no social security number never filed tax returns did not exist as far as the government was concerned he had three beautifully forged passports one of which was german and one allegedly issued by the republic of ireland roland crossed borders and cleared immigration with no worries one of rolands other names known only to himself and never divulged to a breathing soul was rollie wedge he had fled the united states in after the kramer bombing and had lived in northern ireland he had also lived in libya munich belfast and lebanon he had returned to the united states briefly in and to observe the two trials of sam cayhall and jeremiah dogan by then he was traveling effortlessly with perfect papers there had been a few other quick trips back to the united states all required because of the cayhall mess but as time passed he worried about it less he had moved to this bunker three years earlier to spread the message of nazism he no longer considered himself a klansman now he was a proud fascist when he finished his morning reading he had found the cayhall story in seven of the ten papers he placed them in a metal basket and decided to see the sun he poured more coffee in his styrofoam cup and rode an elevator eighty feet to a foyer in a log cabin it was a beautiful day cool and sunny not a cloud to be seen he walked upward along a narrow trail toward the mountains and within ten minutes was looking at the valley below him the wheat fields were in the distance roland had been dreaming of cayhalls death for twentythree years they shared a secret a heavy burden which would be lifted only when sam was executed he admired the man greatly unlike jeremiah dogan sam had honored his oath and never talked through three trials several lawyers countless appeals and millions of inquiries sam cayhall had never yielded he was an honorable man and roland wanted him dead oh sure hed been forced to deliver a few threats to cayhall and dogan during the first two trials but that was so long ago dogan cracked under pressure and he talked and testified against sam and dogan died this kid worried him like everyone else roland had lost track of sams son and his family he knew about the daughter in memphis but the son had disappeared and now this this nicelooking welleducated young lawyer from a big rich jewish law firm had popped up from nowhere and was primed to save his grandfather roland knew enough about executions to understand that in the waning hours the lawyers try everything if sam was going to crack he would do it now and he would do it in the presence of his grandson he tossed a rock down the hillside and watched it bounce out of sight hed have to go to memphis saturday was typically just another day of hard labor at kravitz bane in chicago but things were a bit more laidback at the memphis branch adam arrived at the office at nine and found only two other attorneys and one paralegal at work he locked himself in his room and closed the blinds he and sam had worked for two hours yesterday and by the time packer returned to the law library with the handcuffs and the shackles they had managed to cover the table with dozens of law books and legal pads packer had waited impatiently as sam slowly reshelved the books adam reviewed their notes he entered his own research into the computer and revised the petition for the third time he had already faxed a copy of it to garner goodman who in turn had revised it and sent it back goodman was not optimistic about a fair hearing on the suit but at this stage of the proceedings there was nothing to lose if by chance an expedited hearing was held in federal court goodman was ready to testify about the maynard tole execution he and peter wiesenberg had witnessed it in fact wiesenberg had been so sickened by the sight of a living person being gassed that he resigned from the firm and took a job teaching his grandfather had survived the holocaust his grandmother had not goodman promised to contact wiesenberg and felt confident he too would testify by noon adam was tired of the office he unlocked his door and heard no sounds on the floor the other lawyers were gone he left the building he drove west over the river into arkansas past the truck stops and dog track in west memphis and finally through the congestion and into the farm country he passed the hamlets of earle and parkin and wynne where the hills began he stopped for a coke at a country grocery where three old men in faded overalls sat on the porch swatting flies and suffering in the heat he lowered the convertible top and sped away two hours later he stopped again this time in the town of mountain view to get a sandwich and ask directions calico rock was not far up the road he was told just follow the white river it was a lovely road winding through the foothills of the ozarks through heavy woods and across mountain streams the white river snaked its way along to the left and it was dotted with trout fishermen in jon boats calico rock was a small town on a bluff above the river three trout docks lined the east bank near the bridge adam parked by the river and walked to the first one an outfitter called calico marina the building floated on pontoons and was held close to the bank by thick cables a row of empty rental boats was strung together next to the pier the pungent smell of gasoline and oil emanated from a solitary gas pump a sign listed the rates for boats guides gear and fishing licenses adam walked onto the covered dock and admired the river a few feet away a young man with dirty hands emerged from a back room and asked if he could be of assistance he examined adam from top to bottom and apparently decided that he was no fisherman im looking for wyn lettner the name ron was stitched above the shirt pocket and slightly covered with a smudge of grease ron walked back to his room and yelled mr lettner in the direction of a screen door that led to a small shop ron disappeared wyn lettner was a huge man well over six feet tall with a large frame that was quite overloaded garner had described him as a beer drinker and adam remembered this as he glanced at the large stomach he was in his late sixties with thinning gray hair tucked neatly under an evinrude cap there were at least three newspaper photographs of special agent lettner indexed away somewhere in adams files and in each he was the standard gman dark suit white shirt narrow tie military haircut and he was much trimmer in those days yes sir he said loudly as he walked through the screen door wiping crumbs from his lips im wyn lettner he had a deep voice and a pleasant smile adam pushed forward a hand and said im adam hall nice to meet you lettner took his hand and shook it furiously his forearms were massive and his biceps bulged yes sir he boomed what can i do for you thankfully the dock was deserted with the exception of ron who was out of sight but making noises with a tool in his room adam fidgeted a bit and said well im a lawyer and i represent sam cayhall the smile grew and revealed two rows of strong yellow teeth got your work cut out for you dont you he said with a laugh and slapped adam on the back i guess so adam said awkwardly as he waited for another assault id like to talk about sam lettner was suddenly serious he stroked his chin with a beefy hand and studied adam with narrow eyes i saw it in the papers son i know sams your grandfather must be tough on you gonna get tougher too then he smiled again tougher on sam as well his eyes twinkled as if hed just delivered a sidesplitting punch line and he wanted adam to double over with laughter adam missed the humor sam has less than a month you know he said certain that lettner had also read about the execution date a heavy hand was suddenly on adams shoulder and was shoving him in the direction of the shop step in here son well talk about sam you wanna beer no thanks they entered a narrow room with fishing gear hanging from the walls and ceilings with rickety wooden shelves covered with food crackers sardines canned sausages bread pork and beans cupcakes all the necessities for a day on the river a soft drink cooler sat in one corner take a seat lettner said waving to a corner near the cash register adam sat in a shaky wooden chair as lettner fished through an ice chest and found a bottle of beer sure you dont want one maybe later it was almost five oclock he twisted the top drained at least a third of the bottle with the first gulp smacked his lips then sat in a beaten leather captains chair which had no doubt been removed from a customized van are they finally gonna get old sam he asked theyre trying awfully hard whatre the odds not good we have the usual assortment of last minute appeals but the clocks ticking sams not a bad guy lettner said with a trace of remorse then washed it away with another long drink the floor creaked quietly as the dock shifted with the river how long were you in mississippi adam asked five years hoover called me after the three civil rights workers disappeared nineteen sixtyfour we set up a special unit and went to work after kramer the klan sort of ran out of gas and you were in charge of what mr hoover was very specific he told me to infiltrate the klan at all costs he wanted it busted up to be truthful we were slow getting started in mississippi bunch of reasons for it hoover hated the kennedys and they were pushing him hard so he dragged his feet but when those three boys disappeared we got off our asses nineteen sixtyfour was a helluva year in mississippi i was born that year yeah paper said you were born in clanton adam nodded i didnt know it for a long time my parents told me i was born in memphis the door jingled and ron entered the shop he looked at them then studied the crackers and sardines they watched him and waited he glanced at adam as if to say keep talking im not listening what do you want lettner snapped at him he grabbed a can of vienna sausage with his dirty hand and showed it to them lettner nodded and waved at the door ron ambled toward it checking the cupcakes and potato chips as he went hes nosy as hell lettner said after he was gone i talked to garner goodman a few times it was years ago now thats a weird bird hes my boss he gave me your name said youd talk to me talk about what lettner asked then took another drink the kramer case the kramer case is closed the only thing left is sam and his date with the gas chamber do you want him executed voices followed footsteps then the door opened again a man and a boy entered and lettner got to his feet they needed food and supplies and for ten minutes they shopped and talked and decided where the fish were biting lettner was careful to place his beer under the counter while his customers were present adam removed a soft drink from the cooler and left the shop he walked along the edge of the wooden dock next to the river and stopped by the gas pump two teenagers in a boat were casting near the bridge and it struck adam that hed never been fishing in his life his father had not been a man of hobbies and leisure nor had he been able to keep a job at the moment adam could not remember exactly what his father had done with his time the customers left and the door slammed lettner lumbered to the gas pump you like to trout fish he asked admiring the river no never been lets go for a ride i need to check out a spot two miles downriver the fish are supposed to be thick lettner was carrying his ice chest which he dropped carefully into a boat he stepped down from the dock and the boat rocked violently from side to side as he grabbed the motor come on he yelled at adam who was studying the thirtyinch gap between himself and the boat and grab that rope lettner yelled again pointing to a thin cord hooked to a grapple adam unhitched the rope and stepped nervously into the boat which rocked just as his foot touched it he slipped and landed on his head and came within inches of taking a swim lettner howled with laughter as he pulled the starter rope ron of course had watched this and was grinning stupidly on the dock adam was embarrassed but laughed as if it was all very funny lettner gunned the engine the front of the boat jerked upward and they were off adam clutched the handles on both sides as they sped through the water and under the bridge calico rock was soon behind them the river turned and twisted its way through scenic hills and around rocky bluffs lettner navigated with one hand and sipped a fresh beer with the other after a few minutes adam relaxed somewhat and managed to pull a beer from the cooler without losing his balance the bottle was ice cold he held it with his right hand and clutched the boat with his left lettner was humming or singing something behind him the highpitched roar of the motor prevented conversation they passed a small trout dock where a group of cleancut city slickers were counting fish and drinking beer and they passed a flotilla of rubber rafts filled with mangy teenagers smoking something and absorbing the sun they waved at other fishermen who were hard at work the boat slowed finally and lettner maneuvered it carefully through a bend as if he could see the fish below and had to position himself perfectly he turned off the engine you gonna fish or drink beer he asked staring at the water drink beer figures his bottle was suddenly of secondary importance as he took the rod and cast to a spot toward the bank adam watched for a second and when there was no immediate result he reclined and hung his feet over the water the boat was not comfortable how often do you fish he asked every day its part of my job you know part of my service to my customers i have to know where the fish are biting tough job somebody has to do it what brought you to calico rock had a heart attack in so i had to retire from the bureau had a nice pension and all but hell you get bored just sitting around the wife and i found this place and found the marina for sale one mistake led to another and here i am hand me a beer he cast again as adam dispensed the beer he quickly counted fourteen bottles remaining in the ice the boat drifted with the river and lettner grabbed a paddle he fished with one hand sculled the boat with the other and somehow balanced a fresh beer between his knees the life of a fishing guide they slowed under some trees and the sun was mercifully shielded for a while he made the casting look easy he whipped the rod with a smooth wrist action and sent the lure anywhere he wanted but the fish werent biting he cast toward the middle of the river sams not a bad guy hed already said this once do you think he should be executed thats not up to me son the people of the state want the death penalty so its on the books the people said sam was guilty and then said he should be executed so who am i but you have an opinion what good is it my thoughts are completely worthless why do you say sams not a bad guy its a long story we have fourteen beers left lettner laughed and the vast smile returned he gulped from the bottle and looked down the river away from his line sam was of no concern to us you understand he was not active in the really nasty stuff at least not at first when those civil rights workers disappeared we went in with a fury we spread money all over the place and before long we had all sorts of klan informants these people were basically just ignorant rednecks whod never had a dime and we preyed on their craving for money wed have never found those three boys had we not dropped some cash about thirty thousand as i remember it though i didnt deal directly with the informant hell son they were buried in a levee we found them and it made us look good you understand finally wed accomplished something made a bunch of arrests but the convictions were difficult the violence continued they bombed black churches and black homes so damned often we couldnt keep up it was like a war down there it got worse and mr hoover got madder and we spread around more money listen son im not going to tell you anything useful you understand why not some things i can talk about some i cant sam wasnt alone when he bombed the kramer office was he lettner smiled again and studied his line the rod was sitting in his lap anyway by late and early we had a helluva network of informants it really wasnt that difficult wed learn that some guy was in the klan and so wed trail him wed follow him home at night flashing our lights behind him parking in front of his house itd usually scare him to death then wed follow him to work sometimes wed go talk to his boss flash our badges around act like we were about to shoot somebody wed go talk to his parents show them our badges let them see us in our dark suits let them hear our yankee accents and these poor country people would literally crack up right in front of us if the guy went to church wed follow him one sunday then the next day wed go talk to his preacher wed tell him that we had heard a terrible rumor that mr such and such was an active member of the klan and did he know anything about it we acted like it was a crime to be a member of the klan if the guy had teenage children wed follow them on dates sit behind them at the movies catch them parking in the woods it was nothing but pure harassment but it worked finally wed call the poor guy or catch him alone somewhere and offer him some money wed promise to leave him alone and it always worked usually they were nervous wrecks by this time they couldnt wait to cooperate i saw them cry son if you can believe it actually cry when they finally came to the altar and confessed their sins lettner laughed in the direction of his line which was quite inactive adam sipped his beer perhaps if they drank it all it would eventually loosen his tongue had this guy one time ill never forget him we caught him in bed with his black mistress which was not unusual i mean these guys would go out burning crosses and shooting into black homes then sneak around like crazy to meet their black girlfriends never could understand why the black women put up with it anyway he had a little hunting lodge deep in the woods and he used it for a love nest he met her there one afternoon for a quickie and when he was finished and ready to go he opened the front door and we took his picture got her picture too and then we talked to him he was a deacon or an elder in some country church a real pillar you know and we talked to him like he was a dog we ran her off and sat him down inside the little lodge there and before long he was crying as it turned out he was one of our best witnesses but he later went to jail why well it seems that while he was sneaking around with his girlfriend his wife was doing the same thing with a black kid who worked on their farm lady got pregnant baby was half and half so our informant goes to the hospital and kills mother and child he spent fifteen years at parchman good we didnt get a lot of convictions back in those days but harassed them to a point where they were afraid to do much the violence had slowed considerably until dogan decided to go after the jews that caught us off guard i have to admit we had no clue why not because he got smart he learned the hard way that his own people would talk to us so he decided to operate with a small quiet unit unit as in more than one person something like that as in sam and who else lettner snorted and chuckled at once and decided the fish had moved elsewhere he placed his rod and reel in the boat and yanked on the starter cord they were off racing once again downstream adam left his feet over the side and his leather moccasins and bare ankles were soon wet he sipped the beer the sun was finally beginning to disappear behind the hills and he enjoyed the beauty of the river the next stop was a stretch of still water below a bluff with a rope hanging from it lettner cast and reeled all to no effect and assumed the role of interrogator he asked a hundred questions about adam and his family the flight westward the new identities the suicide he explained that while sam was in jail they checked out his family and knew he had a son who had just left town but since eddie appeared to be harmless they did not pursue the investigation instead they spent their time watching sams brothers and cousins he was intrigued by adams youth and how he was raised with virtually no knowledge of kinfolks adam asked a few questions but the answers were vague and immediately twisted into more questions about his past adam was sparring with a man whod spent twentyfive years asking questions the third and final hot spot was not far from calico rock and they fished until it was dark after five beers adam mustered the courage to wet a hook lettner was a patient instructor and within minutes adam had caught an impressive trout for a brief interlude they forgot about sam and the klan and other nightmares from the past and they simply fished they drank and fished mrs lettners first name was irene and she welcomed her husband and his unexpected guest with grace and nonchalance wyn had explained as ron drove them home that irene was accustomed to dropins she certainly seemed to be unruffled as they staggered through the front door and handed her a string of trout the lettner home was a cottage on the river a mile north of town the rear porch was screened to protect it from insects and not far below it was a splendid view of the river they sat in wicker rockers on the porch and opened another round of brew as irene fried the fish putting food on the table was a new experience for adam and he ate the fish hed caught with great gusto it always tastes better wyn assured him as he chomped and drank when you catch it yourself about halfway through the meal wyn switched to scotch adam declined he wanted a simple glass of water but machismo drove him to continue with the beer he couldnt wimp out at this point lettner would certainly chastise him irene sipped wine and told stories about mississippi she had been threatened on several occasions and their children refused to visit them they were both from ohio and their families worried constantly about their safety those were the days she said more than once with a certain longing for excitement she was extremely proud of her husband and his performance during the war for civil rights she left them after dinner and disappeared somewhere in the cottage it was almost ten oclock and adam was ready for sleep wyn rose to his feet while holding onto a wooden beam and excused himself for a visit to the bathroom he returned in due course with two fresh scotches in tall glasses he handed one to adam and returned to his rocker they rocked and sipped in silence for a moment then lettner said so youre convinced sam had some help of course he had some help adam was very much aware that his tongue was thick and his words were slow lettners speech was remarkably articulate and what makes you so certain adam lowered the heavy glass and vowed not to take another drink the fbi searched sams house after the bombing right right sam was in jail in greenville and you guys got a warrant i was there son we went in with a dozen agents and spent three days and found nothing you could say that no trace of dynamite no trace of blasting caps fuses detonators no trace of any device or substance used in any of the bombings correct thats correct so whats your point sam had no knowledge of explosives nor did he have a history of using them no id say he had quite a history of using them kramer was the sixth bombing as i recall those crazy bastards were bombing like hell son and we couldnt stop them you werent there i was in the middle of it we had harassed the klan and infiltrated to a point where they were afraid to move then all of a sudden another war erupted and bombs were falling everywhere we listened where we were supposed to listen we twisted familiar arms until they broke and we were clueless our informants were clueless it was like another branch of the klan had suddenly invaded mississippi without telling the old one did you know about sam his name was in our records as i recall his father had been a klucker and maybe a brother or two so we had their names but they seemed harmless they lived in the northern part of the state in an area not known for serious klan violence they probably burned some crosses maybe shot up a few houses but nothing compared to dogan and his gang we had our hands full with murderers we didnt have time to investigate every possible klucker in the state then how do you explain sams sudden shift to violence cant explain it he was no choirboy okay he had killed before are you sure you heard me he shot and killed one of his black employees in the early fifties never spent a day in jail for it in fact im not sure but i dont think he was ever arrested for it there may have been another killing too another black victim id rather not hear it ask him see if the old bastard has guts enough to admit it to his grandson he took another sip he was a violent man son and he certainly had the capability to plant bombs and kill people dont be naive im not naive im just trying to save his life why he killed two very innocent little boys two children do you realize this he was convicted of the murders but if the killings were wrong then its wrong for the state to kill him i dont buy that crap the death penalty is too good for these people its too clean and sterile they know theyre about to die so they have time to say their prayers and say goodbye what about the victims how much time did they have to prepare so you want sam executed yeah i want em all executed i thought you said he wasnt a bad guy i lied sam cayhall is a coldblooded killer and hes guilty as hell how else can you explain the fact that the bombings stopped as soon as he was in custody maybe they were scared after kramer they who the hell is they sam and his partner and dogan okay ill play along lets assume sam had an accomplice no lets assume sam was the accomplice lets assume the other guy was the explosives expert expert these were very crude bombs son the first five were nothing more than a few sticks wrapped together with a fuse you light the match run like hell and fifteen minutes later boom the kramer bomb was nothing but a halfass rig with an alarm clock wired to it they were lucky it didnt go off while they were playing with it do you think it was deliberately set to go off when it did the jury thought so dogan said they planned to kill marvin kramer then why was sam hanging around why was he close enough to the bomb to get hit with debris youll have to ask sam which im sure youve already done does he claim he had an accomplice no then that settles it if your own client says no what the hell are you digging for because i think my client is lying too bad for your client then if he wants to lie and protect the identity of someone then why should you care why would he lie to me lettner shook his head in frustration then mumbled something and took a drink how the hell am i supposed to know i dont want to know okay i honestly dont care if sams lying or if sams telling the truth but if he wont level with you his lawyer and his own grandson then i say gas him adam took a long drink and stared into the darkness he actually felt silly at times digging around trying to prove his own client was lying to him hed give this another shot then talk about something else you dont believe the witnesses who saw sam with another person no they were pretty shaky as i recall the guy at the truck stop didnt come forward for a long time the other guy had just left a honkytonk they werent credible do you believe dogan the jury did i didnt ask about the jury lettners breathing was finally getting heavy and he appeared to be fading dogan was crazy and dogan was a genius he said the bomb was intended to kill and i believe him keep in mind adam they almost wiped out an entire family in vicksburg i cant remember the name pinder and you keep saying they did this and that im just playing along okay were assuming sam had a buddy with him they planted a bomb at the pinder house in the middle of the night an entire family couldve been killed sam said he placed the bomb in the garage so no one would get hurt sam told you this sam admitted he did it then why in the hell are you asking me about an accomplice sounds like you need to listen to your client son of a bitch is guilty adam listen to him adam took another drink and his eyelids grew heavier he looked at his watch but couldnt see it tell me about the tapes he said yawning what tapes lettner asked yawning the fbi tapes they played at sams trial the ones with dogan talking to wayne graves about bombing kramer we had lots of tapes and they had lots of targets framer was just one of many hell we had a tape with two kluckers talking about bombing a synagogue while a wedding was in progress they wanted to bolt the doors and shoot some gas through the heating ducts so the entire congregation would be wiped out sick bastards man it wasnt dogan just a couple of his idiots talking trash and so we dismissed it wayne graves was a klucker who was also on our payroll and he allowed us to tap his phones he called dogan one night said he was on a pay phone and they got to talking about hitting kramer they also talked about other targets it was very effective at sams trial but the tapes did not help us stop a single bombing nor did they help us identify sam you had no idea sam cayhall was involved none whatsoever if the fool had left greenville when he should have hed probably still be a free man did kramer know he was a target we told him but by then he was accustomed to threats he kept a guard at his house his words were starting to slur a bit and his chin had dropped an inch or two adam excused himself and cautiously made his way to the bathroom as he returned to the porch he heard heavy snoring lettner had slumped in his chair and collapsed with the drink in his hand adam removed it then left in search of a sofa the late morning was warm but seemed downright feverish in the front of the army surplus jeep which lacked air conditioning and other essentials adam sweated and kept his hand on the handle of the door which he hoped would open promptly in the event irenes breakfast came roaring up he had awakened on the floor beside a narrow sofa in a room which he had mistaken for the den but was in fact the washroom beside the kitchen and the sofa was a bench lettner had explained with much laughter that he used to sit on to take off his boots irene had eventually found his body after searching the house and adam apologized profusely until they both asked him to stop she had insisted on a heavy breakfast it was their one day of the week to eat pork a regular tradition around the lettner cottage and adam had sat at the kitchen table guzzling ice water while the bacon fried and irene hummed and wyn read the paper she also scrambled eggs and mixed bloody marys the vodka deadened some of the pain in his head but it also did nothing to calm his stomach as they bounced toward calico rock on the bumpy road adam was terrified that he would be sick though lettner had passed out first he was remarkably healthy this morning no sign of a hangover hed eaten a plate full of grease and biscuits and hed sipped only one bloody mary hed diligently read the paper and commented about this and that and adam figured he was one of those functional alcoholics who got plastered every night but shook it off easily the village was in view the road was suddenly smoother and adams stomach stopped bouncing sorry about last night lettner said what adam asked about sam i was harsh i know hes your grandfather and youre very concerned i lied about something i really dont want sam to be executed hes not a bad guy ill tell him yeah im sure hell be thrilled they entered the town and turned toward the bridge theres something else lettner said we always suspected sam had a partner adam smiled and looked through his window they passed a small church with elderly people standing under a shade tree in their pretty dresses and neat suits why adam asked for the same reasons sam had no history with bombs he had not been involved in klan violence the two witnesses especially the truck driver in cleveland always bothered us the trucker had no reason to lie and he seemed awfully certain of himself sam just didnt seem like the type to start his own bombing campaign so whos the man i honestly dont know they rolled to a stop by the river and adam opened his door just in case lettner leaned on the steering wheel and cocked his head toward adam after the third or fourth bombing i think maybe it was the synagogue in jackson some big jews in new york and washington met with lbj who in turn called in mr hoover who in turn called me i went to dc where i met with mr hoover and the president and they pretty much crawled my ass i returned to mississippi with renewed determination we came down hard on our informants i mean we hurt some people we tried everything but to no avail our sources simply did not know who was doing the bombing only dogan knew and it was obvious he wasnt telling anybody but after the fifth bomb which i think was the newspaper office we got a break lettner opened his door and walked to the front of the jeep adam joined him there and they watched the river ease along through calico rock you wanna beer i keep it cold in the bait shop no please im halfsick now just kidding anyway dogan ran this huge used car lot and one of his employees was an illiterate old black man who washed the cars and swept the floors we had carefully approached the old man earlier but he was hostile but out of the blue he tells one of our agents that he saw dogan and another man putting something in the trunk of a green pontiac a couple of days earlier he said he waited then opened the trunk and saw it was dynamite the next day he heard that there was another bombing he knew the fbi was swarming all around dogan so he figured it was worth mentioning to us dogans helper was a klucker named virgil also an employee so i went to see virgil i knocked on his door at three oclock one morning just beat it like hell you know like we always did in those days and before long he turned on the light and stepped on the porch i had about eight agents with me and we all stuck our badges in virgils face he was scared to death i told him we knew he had delivered the dynamite to jackson the night before and that he was looking at thirty years you could hear his wife crying through the screen door virgil was shaking and ready to cry himself i left him my card with instructions to call me before noon that very day and i threatened him if he told dogan or anybody else i told him wed be watching him around the clock i doubt if virgil went back to sleep his eyes were red and puffy when he found me a few hours later we got to be friends he said the bombings were not the work of dogans usual gang he didnt know much but hed heard enough from dogan to believe that the bomber was a very young man from another state this guy had dropped in from nowhere and was supposed to be very good with explosives dogan picked the targets planned the jobs then called this guy who sneaked into town carried out the bombings then disappeared did you believe him for the most part yes it just made sense it had to be someone new because by then we had riddled the klan with informants we knew virtually every move they made what happened to virgil i spent some time with him gave him some money you know the usual routine they always wanted money i became convinced he had no idea who was planting the bombs he would never admit that hed been involved that hed delivered the cars and dynamite and we didnt press him we werent after him was he involved with kramer no dogan used someone else for that one at times dogan seemed to have a sixth sense about when to mix things up to change routines virgils suspect certainly doesnt sound like sam cayhall does he adam asked no and you had no suspects no come on wyn surely you guys had some idea i swear we did not shortly after we met virgil kramer got bombed and it was all over if sam had a buddy then the buddy left him and the fbi heard nothing afterward not a peep we had sam who looked and smelled extremely guilty and of course you guys were anxious to close the case certainly and the bombings stopped remember there were no bombings after sam got caught dont forget that we had our man mr hoover was happy the jews were happy the president was happy then they couldnt convict him for fourteen years but that was a different story everyone was relieved when the bombings stopped so why didnt dogan squeal on the real bomber when he squealed on sam they had eased down the bank to a point just inches above the water adams car sat nearby lettner cleared his throat and spat into the river would you testify against a terrorist who was not in custody adam thought for a second lettner smiled flashed his big yellow teeth then chuckled as he started for the dock lets have a beer no please i need to go lettner stopped and they shook hands and promised to meet again adam invited him to memphis and lettner invited him back to calico rock for more fishing and drinking at the moment his invitation was not well received adam sent his regards to irene apologized again for passing out in the washroom and thanked him again for the chat he left the small town behind driving gingerly around the curves and hills still careful not to upset his stomach lee was struggling with a pasta dish when he entered her apartment the table was set with china and silver and fresh flowers the recipe was for baked manicotti and things were not going well in the kitchen on more than one occasion in the past week shed confessed to being a lousy cook and now she was proving it pots and pans were scattered along the countertops her seldom used apron was covered with tomato sauce she laughed as they kissed each other on the cheeks and said there was a frozen pizza if matters got worse you look awful she said suddenly staring at his eyes it was a rough night you smell like alcohol i had two bloody marys for breakfast and i need another one now the bars closed she picked up a knife and stepped to a pile of vegetables a zucchini was the next victim what did you do up there got drunk with the fbi man slept on the floor next to his washer and dryer how nice she came within a centimeter of drawing blood she jerked her hand away from the chopping block and examined a finger have you seen the memphis paper no should i yes its over there she nodded to a corner of the snack bar something bad just read it adam took the sunday edition of the memphis press and sat in a chair at the table on the front page of the second section he suddenly encountered his smiling face it was a familiar photo one taken not long ago when he was a secondyear law student at michigan the story covered half the page and his photo was joined by many others sam of course marvin kramer josh and john kramer ruth kramer david mcallister the attorney general steve roxburgh naifeh jeremiah dogan and mr elliot kramer father of marvin todd marks had been busy his narrative began with a succinct history of the case which took an entire column then he moved quickly to the present and recapped the same story hed written two days earlier he found a bit more biographical data on adam college at pepperdine law school at michigan law review editor brief employment history with kravitz bane naifeh had very little to say only that the execution would be carried out according to the law mcallister on the other hand was full of wisdom he had lived with the kramer nightmare for twentythree years he said gravely thinking about it every day of his life since it happened it had been his honor and privilege to prosecute sam cayhall and bring the killer to justice and only the execution could close this awful chapter of mississippis history no he said after much thought the idea of clemency was out of the question just wouldnt be fair to the little kramer boys and on and on steve roxburgh had evidently enjoyed his interview too he stood ready to fight the final efforts by cayhall and his lawyer to thwart the execution he and his staff were prepared to work eighteen hours a day to carry out the wishes of the people this natter had dragged on long enough he was quoted as saying more than once and it was time for justice no he was not worried about the last ditch legal challenges of mr cayhall he had confidence in his skills as a lawyer the peoples lawyer sam cayhall refused to comment marks explained and adam hall couldnt be reached as if adam was eager to talk but simply couldnt be found the comments from the family were both interesting and disheartening elliot kramer now seventyseven and still working was described as spry and healthy in spite of heart trouble he was also very bitter he blamed the klan and sam cayhall not only for killing his two grandsons but also for marvins death hed been waiting twentythree years for sam to be executed and it couldnt come a minute too soon he lashed out at a judicial system that allows a convict to live for almost ten years after the jury gives him a death penalty he was not certain if he would witness the execution it would be up to his doctors he said but he wanted to he wanted to be there and look cayhall in the eyes when they strapped him in ruth kramer was a bit more moderate time had healed many of the wounds she said and she was unsure how she would feel after the execution nothing would bring back her sons she had little to say to todd marks adam folded the paper and placed it beside the chair he suddenly had a knot in his fragile stomach and it came from steve roxburgh and david mcallister as the lawyer expected to save sams life it was frightening to see his enemies so eager for the final battle he was a rookie they were veterans roxburgh in particular had been through it before and he had an experienced staff which included a renowned specialist known as dr death a skilled advocate with a passion for executions adam had nothing but an exhausted file full of unsuccessful appeals and a prayer that a miracle would happen at this moment he felt completely vulnerable and hopeless lee sat next to him with a cup of espresso you look worried she said stroking his arm my buddy at the trout dock was of no help sounds like old man kramer is hellbent adam rubbed his temples and tried to ease the pain i need a painkiller how about a valium wonderful are you real hungry no my stomach is not doing well good dinner has been terminated a slight problem with the recipe its frozen pizza or nothing nothing sounds good to me nothing but a valium adam dropped his keys in the red bucket and watched it ascend to a point twenty feet off the ground where it stopped and spun slowly on the end of the rope he walked to the first gate which jerked before sliding open he walked to the second gate and waited packer emerged from the front door a hundred feet away stretching and yawning as if hed been napping on the row the second gate closed behind him and packer waited nearby good day he said it was almost two the hottest time of the day a morning radio forecaster had merrily predicted the first onehundreddegree day of the year hello sergeant adam said as if they were old friends now they walked along the brick path to the small door with the weeds in front of it packer unlocked it and adam stepped inside ill get sam packer said in no hurry and disappeared the chairs on his side of the metal screen were scattered about two were flipped over as if the lawyers and visitors had been brawling adam pulled one close to the counter at the far end as far as possible from the air conditioner he removed a copy of the petition hed filed at nine that morning by law no claim or issue could be raised in federal court unless it had first been presented and denied in state court the petition attacking the gas chamber had been filed in the mississippi supreme court under the states postconviction relief statutes it was a formality in adams opinion and in the opinion of garner goodman goodman had worked on the claim throughout the weekend in fact hed worked all day saturday while adam was drinking beer and trout fishing with wyn lettner sam arrived as usual hands cuffed behind his back no expression on his face red jumpsuit unbuttoned almost to the waist the gray hair on his pale chest was slick with perspiration like a welltrained animal he turned his back to packer who quickly removed the cuffs then left through the door sam immediately went for the cigarettes and made certain one was lit before he sat down and said welcome back i filed this at nine this morning adam said sliding the petition through the narrow slit in the screen i talked to the clerk with the supreme court in jackson she seemed to think the court will rule on it with due speed sam took the papers and looked at adam you can bet on that theyll deny it with great pleasure the state will be required to respond immediately so weve got the attorney general scrambling right now great we can watch the latest on the evening news hes probably invited the cameras into his office while they prepare their response adam removed his jacket and loosened his tie the room was humid and he was already sweating does the name wyn lettner ring a bell sam tossed the petition onto an empty chair and sucked hard on the filter he released a steady stream of exhaust at the ceiling yes why did you ever meet him sam thought about this for a moment before speaking and as usual spoke with measured words maybe im not sure i knew who he was at the time why i found him over the weekend hes retired now and runs a trout dock on the white river we had a long talk thats nice and what exactly did you accomplish he says he still thinks you had someone working with you did he give you any names no they never had a suspect or so he says but they had an informant one of dogans people who told lettner that the other guy was someone new not one of the usual gang they thought he was from another state and that he was very young thats all lettner knew and you believe this i dont know what i believe what difference does it make now i dont know it could give me something to use as i try to save your life nothing more than that im desperate i guess and im not im grasping for straws sam grasping and filling in holes so my story has holes i think so lettner said he was always doubtful because they found no trace of explosives when they searched your house and you had no history of using them he said you didnt seem to be the type to initiate your own bombing campaign and you believe everything lettner says yeah because it makes sense let me ask you this what if i told you there was someone else what if i gave you his name address phone number blood type and urine analysis what would you do with it start screaming like hell id file motions and appeals by the truckload id get the media stirred up and make a scapegoat out of you id try to sensationalize your innocence and hope someone noticed someone like an appellate judge sam nodded slowly as if this was quite ridiculous and exactly what hed expected it wouldnt work adam he said carefully as if lecturing to a child i have three and a half weeks you know the law theres no way to start screaming john doe did it when john doe has never been mentioned i know but id do it anyway it wont work stop trying to find john doe who is he he doesnt exist yes he does why are you so sure because i want to believe youre innocent sam its very important to me i told you im innocent i planted the bomb but i had no intention of killing anyone but whyd you plant the bomb whyd you bomb the pinder house and the synagogue and the real estate office why were you bombing innocent people sam just puffed and looked at the floor why do you hate sam why does it come so easy why were you taught to hate blacks and jews and catholics and anyone slightly different from you have you ever asked yourself why no dont plan to so its just you right its your character your composition same as your height and blue eyes its something you were born with and cant change it was passed down in the genes from your father and grandfather faithful kluckers all and its something youll proudly take to your grave right it was a way of life it was all i knew then what happened to my father why couldnt you contaminate eddie sam thumped the cigarette onto the floor and leaned forward on his elbows the wrinkles tightened in the corners of his eyes and across his forehead adams face was directly through the slit but he did not look at him instead he stared down at the base of the screen so this is it time for our eddie talk his voice was much softer and his words even slower where did you go wrong with him this of course has not a damned thing to do with the little gas party theyre planning for me does it nothing to do with issues and appeals lawyers and judges motions and stays this is a waste of time dont be a coward sam tell me where you went wrong with eddie did you teach him the word nigger did you teach him to hate little black kids did you try to teach him how to burn crosses or build bombs did you take him to his first lynching what did you do with him sam where did you go wrong eddie didnt know i was in the klan until he was in high school why not surely you werent ashamed of it it was a great source of family pride wasnt it it was not something we talked about why not you were the fourth generation of cayhall klansmen with roots all the way back to the civil war or something like that isnt that what you told me yes then why didnt you sit little eddie down and show him pictures from the family album why didnt you tell him bedtime stories of the heroic cayhalls and how they rode around at night with masks on their brave faces and burned negro shacks you know war stories father to son i repeat it was not something we talked about well when he got older did you try to recruit him no he was different you mean he didnt hate sam jerked forward and coughed the deep scratchy hacking action of a chainsmoker his face reddened as he struggled for breath the coughing grew worse and he spat on the floor he stood and leaned at the waist with both hands on his hips coughing and hacking while shuffling around and trying to stop it finally a break he stood straight and breathed rapidly he swallowed and spat again then relaxed and inhaled slowly the seizure was over and his red face was suddenly pale again he took his seat across from adam and puffed mightily on the cigarette as if some other device or habit was to blame for the coughing he took his time breathing deeply and clearing his throat eddie was a tender child he began hoarsely he got it from his mother he wasnt a sissy in fact he was just as tough as other little boys a long pause another drag of nicotine not far from our house was a nigger family could we just call them blacks sam ive asked you this already forgive me there was an african family on our place the lincolns joe lincoln was his name and hed worked for us for many years had a commonlaw wife and a dozen commonlaw children one of the boys was the same age as eddie and they were inseparable best of friends it was not that unusual in those days you played with whoever lived nearby i even had little african buddies believe it or not when eddie started school he got real upset because he rode one bus and his african pal rode another kids name was quince quince lincoln they couldnt wait to get home from school and go play on the farm i remember eddie was always disturbed because they couldnt go to school together and quince couldnt spend the night in our house and eddie couldnt spend the night with the lincolns he was always asking me questions about why the africans in ford county were so poor and lived in rundown houses and didnt have nice clothes and had so many children in each family he really suffered over it and that made him different as he got older he grew even more sympathetic toward the africans i tried to talk to him of course you did you tried to straighten him out didnt you i tried to explain things to him such as such as the need to keep the races separate theres nothing wrong with separate but equal schools nothing wrong with laws prohibiting miscegenation nothing wrong with keeping the africans in their place wheres their place under control let em run wild and look at whats happened crime drugs aids illegitimate births general breakdown in the moral fabric of society what about nuclear proliferation and killer bees you get my point what about basic rights radical concepts like the right to vote the right to use public rest rooms the right to eat in restaurants and stay in hotels the right not to be discriminated against in housing employment and education you sound like eddie good by the time he was finishing high school he was spouting off like that talking about how badly the africans were being mistreated he left home when he was eighteen did you miss him not at first i guess we were fighting a lot he knew i was in the klan and he hated the sight of me at least he said he did so you thought more of the klan than you did your own son sam stared at the floor adam scribbled on a legal pad the air conditioner rattled and faded and for a moment seemed determined to finally quit he was a sweet kid sam said quietly we used to fish a lot that was our big thing together i had an old boat and wed spend hours on the lake fishing for crappie and bream sometimes bass then he grew up and didnt like me he was ashamed of me and of course it hurt he expected me to change and i expected him to see the light like all the other white kids his age it never happened we drifted apart when he was in high school then it seems like the civil rights crap started and there was no hope after that did he participate in the movement no he wasnt stupid he might have been sympathetic but he kept his mouth shut you just didnt go around talking that trash if you were local there were enough northern jews and radicals to keep things stirred up they didnt need any help what did he do after he left home joined the army it was an easy way out of town away from mississippi he was gone for three years and when he came back he brought a wife they lived in clanton and we barely saw them he talked to his mother occasionally but didnt have much to say to me it was the early sixties by then and the african movement was getting cranked up there were a lot of klan meetings a lot of activity most to the south of us eddie kept his distance he was very quiet never had much to say anyway then i was born you were born around the time those three civil rights workers disappeared eddie had the nerve to ask me if i was involved in it were you hell no i didnt know who did it for almost a year they were kluckers werent they they were klansmen were you happy when those boys were murdered how the hell is that relevant to me and the gas chamber in did eddie know it when you got involved with the bombing no one knew it in ford county we had not been too active as i said most of it was to the south of us around meridian and you couldnt wait to jump in the middle of it they needed help the fibbies had infiltrated so deep hardly anyone could be trusted the civil rights movement was snowballing fast something had to be done im not ashamed of it adam smiled and shook his head eddie was ashamed wasnt he eddie didnt know anything about it until the kramer bombing why did you involve him i didnt yes you did you told your wife to get eddie and drive to cleveland and pick up your car he was an accessory after the fact i was in jail okay i was scared and no one ever knew it was harmless perhaps eddie didnt think so i dont know what eddie thought okay by the time i got out of jail he had disappeared yall were gone i never saw him again until his mothers funeral and then he slipped in and out without a word to anyone he rubbed the wrinkles on his forehead with his left hand then ran it through his oily hair his face was sad and as he glanced through the slit adam saw a trace of moisture in the eyes the last time i saw eddie he was getting in his car outside the church after the funeral service he was in a hurry something told me id never see him again he was there because his mother had died and i knew that would be his last visit home there was no other reason for him to come back i was on the front steps of the church lee was with me and we both watched him drive away there i was burying my wife and at the same time watching my son disappear for the last time did you try to find him no not really lee said she had a phone number but i didnt feel like begging it was obvious he didnt want anything to do with me so i left him alone i often wondered about you and i remember telling your grandmother how nice it would be to see you but i wasnt about to spend a lot of time trying to track yall down it wouldve been hard to find us thats what i heard lee talked to eddie occasionally and she would report to me it sounded like you guys were moving all over california i went to six schools in twelve years but why what was he doing a number of things hed lose his job and wed move because we couldnt pay the rent then mother would find a job and wed move somewhere else then dad would get mad at my school for some vague reason and hed yank me out what kind of work did he do once he worked for the post office until he got fired he threatened to sue them and for a long time he maintained this massive little war against the postal system he couldnt find a lawyer to take his case so he abused them with paperwork he always had a small desk with an old typewriter and boxes filled with his papers and they were his most valuable possessions every time we moved he took great care with his office as he called it he didnt care about anything else there wasnt much but he protected his office with his life i can remember many nights lying in bed trying to sleep and listening to that damned typewriter pecking away at all hours he hated the federal government thats my boy but for different reasons i think the irs came after him one year which i always found odd because he didnt earn enough to pay three dollars in taxes so he declared war on the infernal revenue as he called it and that raged for years the state of california revoked his drivers license one year when he didnt renew and this violated all sorts of civil and human rights mother had to drive him for two years until he surrendered to the bureaucracy he was always writing letters to the governor the president us senators congressmen anyone with an office and staff he would just raise hell about this and that and when they wrote him back hed declare a small victory he saved every letter he got in a fight one time with a nextdoor neighbor something to do with a strange dog peeing on our porch and they were yelling at each other across the hedgerow the madder they got the more powerful their friends became and both were just minutes away from making phone calls to all sorts of hotshots who would instantly inflict punishment on the other dad ran in the house and within seconds returned to the argument with thirteen letters from the governor of the state of california he counted them loudly and waved them under the neighbors nose and the poor guy was crushed end of argument end of dog pissing on our porch of course every one of the letters had asked him in a nice way to get lost though they didnt realize it they were both smiling by the end of this brief story if he couldnt keep a job how did yall survive sam asked staring through the opening i dont know mother always worked she was very resourceful and she sometimes kept two jobs cashier in a grocery store clerk in a pharmacy she could do anything and i remember a couple of pretty good jobs as a secretary at some point dad got a license to sell life insurance and that became a permanent parttime job i guess he was good at it because things improved as i got older he could work his own hours and reported to no one this suited him although he said he hated insurance companies he sued one for canceling a policy or something i really didnt understand it and he lost the case of course he blamed it all on his lawyer who made the mistake of sending eddie a long letter full of strong statements dad typed for three days and when his masterpiece was finished he proudly showed it to mother twentyone pages of mistakes and lies by the lawyer she just shook her head he fought with that poor lawyer for years what kind of father was he i dont know thats a hard question sam why because of the way he died i was mad at him for a long time after his death and i didnt understand how he could decide that he should leave us that we didnt need him anymore that it was time for him to check out and after i learned the truth i was mad at him for lying to me all those years for changing my name and running away it was terribly confusing for a young kid still is are you still angry not really i tend to remember the good things about eddie he was the only father ive had so i dont know how to rate him he didnt smoke drink gamble do drugs chase women beat his kids or any of that he had trouble keeping a job but we never went without food or shelter he and mother were constantly talking about divorce but it didnt work out she moved out several times and then he would move out it was disruptive but carmen and i became accustomed to it he had his dark days or bad times as they were known when he would withdraw to his room and lock the door and pull the shades mother would gather us around her and explain that he was not feeling well and that we should be very quiet no television or radios she was very supportive when he withdrew he would stay in his room for days then suddenly emerge as if nothing happened we learned to live with eddies bad times he looked and dressed normal he was almost always there if we needed him we played baseball in the backyard and rode rides at the carnival he took us to disneyland a couple of times i guess he was a good man a good father who just had this dark strange side that flared up occasionally but you werent close no we werent close he helped me with my homework and science projects and he insisted on perfect report cards we talked about the solar system and the environment but never about girls and sex and cars never about family and ancestors there was no intimacy he was not a warm person there were times when i needed him and he was locked up in his room sam rubbed the corners of his eyes then he leaned forward again on his elbows with his face close to the screen and looked directly at adam what about his death he asked what about it howd it happen adam waited for a long time before answering he could tell this story several ways he could be cruel and hateful and brutally honest and in doing so destroy the old man there was a mighty temptation to do this it needed to be done hed told himself many times before sam needed to suffer he needed to be slapped in the face with the guilt of eddies suicide adam wanted to really hurt the old bastard and make him cry but at the same time he wanted to tell the story quickly glossing over the painful parts and then moving on to something else the poor old man sitting captive on the other side of the screen was suffering enough the government was planning to kill him in less than four weeks adam suspected he knew more about eddies death than he let on he was going through a bad time adam said gazing at the screen but avoiding sam hed been in his room for three weeks which was longer than usual mother kept telling us that he was getting better just a few more days and hed come out we believed her because he always seemed to bounce out of it he picked a day when she was at work and carmen was at a friends house a day when he knew id be the first one home i found him lying on the floor of my bedroom still holding the gun a thirtyeight one shot to the right temple there was a neat circle of blood around his head i sat on the edge of my bed how old were you almost seventeen a junior in high school straight as i realized hed carefully arranged a half dozen towels on the floor then placed himself in the middle of them i checked the pulse in his wrist and he was already stiff coroner said hed been dead three hours there was a note beside him typed neatly on white paper the note was addressed dear adam said he loved me that he was sorry that he wanted me to take care of the girls and that maybe one day i would understand then he directed my attention to a plastic garbage bag also on the floor and said i should place the dirty towels in the garbage bag wipe up the mess then call the police dont touch the gun he said and hurry before the girls get home adam cleared his throat and looked at the floor and so i did exactly what he said and i waited for the police we were alone for fifteen minutes just the two of us he was lying on the floor and i was lying on my bed looking down at him i started crying and crying asking him why and how and what happened and a hundred other questions there was my dad the only dad i would ever have lying there in his faded jeans and dirty socks and favorite ucla sweatshirt from the neck down he couldve been napping but he had a hole in his head and the blood had dried in his hair i hated him for dying and i felt so sorry for him because he was dead i remember asking him why he hadnt talked to me before this i asked him a lot of questions i heard voices and suddenly the room was filled with cops they took me to the den and put a blanket around me and that was the end of my father sam was still on his elbows but one hand was now over his eyes there were just a couple more things adam wanted to say after the funeral lee stayed with us for a while she told me about you and about the cayhalls she filled in a lot of gaps about my father i became fascinated with you and the kramer bombing and i began reading old magazine articles and newspaper stories it took about a year for me to figure out why eddie killed himself when he did hed been hiding in his room during your trial and he killed himself when it was over sam removed his hand and glared at adam with wet eyes so you blame me for his death right adam thats what you really want to say isnt it no i dont blame you entirely then how much eighty percent ninety percent youve had time to do the numbers how much of its my fault i dont know sam why dont you tell me sam wiped his eyes and raised his voice oh what the hell ill claim a hundred percent ill take full responsibility for his death okay is that what you want take whatever you want dont patronize me just add my sons name to my list is that what you want the kramer twins their father then eddie thats four ive killed right anyone else you want to tack on here at the end do it quick old boy because the clock is ticking how many more are out there dead bodies yes dead bodies ive heard the rumors and of course you believe them dont you you seem eager to believe everything bad about me i didnt say i believed them sam jumped to his feet and walked to the end of the room im tired of this conversation he yelled from thirty feet away and im tired of you i almost wish i had those damned jew lawyers harassing me again we can accommodate you adam shot back sam walked slowly back to his chair here i am worried about my ass twentythree days away from the chamber and all you want to do is talk about dead people just keep chirping away old boy and real soon you can start talking about me i want some action i filed a petition this morning fine then leave dammit just get the hell out and stop tormenting me the door on adams side opened and packer entered with two gentlemen behind him they were obviously lawyers dark suits frowns thick bulging briefcases packer pointed to some chairs under the air conditioner and they sat down he looked at adam and paid particular attention to sam who was still standing on the other side everything okay he asked adam adam nodded and sam eased into his chair packer left and the two new lawyers efficiently went about their business of pulling heavy documents from fat files within a minute both jackets were off five minutes passed without a word from sam adam caught a few glimpses from the lawyers on the other end they were in the same room with the most famous inmate on the row the next one to be gassed and they couldnt help but steal curious peeks at sam cayhall and his lawyer then the door opened behind sam and two guards entered with a wiry little black man who was shackled and manacled and cuffed as if he might erupt any moment and kill dozens with his bare hands they led him to a seat across from his lawyers and went about the business of liberating most of his limbs the hands remained cuffed behind his back one of the guards left the room but the other took a position halfway between sam and the black inmate sam glanced down the counter at his comrade a nervous type who evidently was not happy with his lawyers his lawyers did not appear to be thrilled either adam watched them from his side of the screen and within minutes their heads were close together and they were talking in unison through the slit while their client sat militantly on his hands their low voices were audible but their words were indecipherable sam eased forward again on his elbows and motioned for adam to do likewise their faces met ten inches apart with the opening between them thats stockholm turner sam said almost in a whisper stockholm yeah but he goes by stock these rural africans love unusual names he says he has a brother named denmark and one named germany probably does whatd he do adam asked suddenly curious robbed a whiskey store i think shot the owner about two years ago he got a death warrant and it went down to the wire he came within two hours of the chamber what happened his lawyers got a stay and theyve been fighting ever since you can never tell but hell probably be the next after me they both looked toward the end of the room where the conference was raging in full force stock was off his hands and sitting on the edge of his chair and raising hell with his lawyers sam grinned then chuckled then leaned even closer to the screen stocks family is dirt poor and they have little to do with him its not unusual really especially with the africans he seldom gets mail or visitors he was born fifty miles from here but the free world has forgotten about him as his appeals were losing steam stock started worrying about life and death and things in general around here if no one claims your body then the state buries you like a pauper in some cheap grave stock got concerned about what would happen to his body and he started asking all kinds of questions packer and some of the guards picked up on it and they convinced stock that his body would be sent to a crematorium where it would be burned the ashes would be dropped from the air and spread over parchman they told him that since hed be full of gas anyway when they stuck a match to him hed go off like a bomb stock was devastated he had trouble sleeping and lost weight then he started writing letters to his family and friends begging them for a few dollars so he could have a christian burial as he called it the money trickled in and he wrote more letters he wrote to ministers and civil rights groups even his lawyers sent money when his stay was lifted stock had close to four hundred dollars and he was ready to die or so he thought sams eyes were dancing and his voice was light he told the story slowly in a low voice and savored the details adam was amused more by the telling than by the narrative they have a loose rule here that allows almost unlimited visitation for seventytwo hours prior to the execution as long as theres no security risk theyll allow the condemned man to do damned near anything theres a little office up front with a desk and phone and that becomes the visiting room its usually filled with all sorts of people grandmothers nieces nephews cousins aunties especially with these africans hell they run em in here by the busload kinfolks who havent spent five minutes thinking about the inmate suddenly show up to share his last moments it almost becomes a social event they also have this rule its unwritten im sure that allows one final conjugal visit with the wife if theres no wife then the warden in his boundless mercy allows a brief appointment with a girlfriend one last little quickie before lover boy checks out sam glanced along the counter at stock then leaned even closer well ole stock here is one of the more popular residents of the row and he somehow convinced the warden that he had both a wife and a girlfriend and that these ladies would agree to spend a few moments with him before he died at the same time all three of them together the warden allegedly knew something fishy was going on but everyone likes stock and well they were about to kill him anyway so whats the harm so stock here was sitting in the little room with his mother and sisters and cousins and nieces a whole passel of africans most of whom hadnt uttered his name in ten years and he was eating his last meal of steak and potatoes while everybody else was crying and grieving and praying with about four hours to go they emptied the room and sent the family to the chapel stock waited for a few minutes while another van brought his wife and his girlfriend here to the row they arrived with guards and were taken to the little office up front where stock was waiting all wildeyed and ready poor guyd been on the row for twelve years well they brought in a little cot for this liaison and stock and his gals got it on the guards said later that stock had some finelooking women and the guards also said they commented at the time on how young they looked stock was just about to have a go with either his wife or his girlfriend it didnt really matter when the phone rang it was his lawyer and his lawyer was crying and out of breath as he yelled out the great news that the fifth circuit had issued a stay stock hung up on him he had more important matters at hand a few minutes passed then the phone rang again stock grabbed it it was his lawyer again and this time he was much more composed as he explained to stock the legal maneuvering that had saved his life for the moment stock offered his appreciation then asked his lawyer to keep it quiet for another hour adam again glanced to his right and wondered which of the two lawyers had called stock while he was exercising his constitutional right of the last conjugal visit well by this time the attorney generals office had talked to the warden and the execution had been called off or aborted as they like to say made no difference to stock he was proceeding as if he would never see another woman the door to the room cannot be locked from the inside for obvious reasons so naifeh after waiting patiently gently knocked on the door and asked stock to come on out time to go back to your cell stock he said stock said he needed just another five minutes no said naifeh please stock begged and suddenly there were noises again so the warden grinned at the guards who grinned at the warden and for five minutes they studied the floor while the cot rattled and bounced around the little room stock finally opened the door and strutted out like the heavyweight champ of the world the guards said he was happier about his performance than he was about his stay they quickly got rid of the women who as it turned out were not really his wife and girlfriend after all who were they a couple of prostitutes prostitutes adam said a bit too loud and one of the lawyers stared at him sam leaned so close his nose was almost in the slit yeah local whores his brother somehow arranged it for him remember the funeral money he worked so hard to raise youre kidding thats it four hundred bucks spent on whores which at first seems a bit stiff especially for local african whores but it seems they were scared to death about coming to death row which i guess makes sense they took all stocks money he told me later he didnt give a damn how they buried him said it was worth every dime naifeh got embarrassed and he threatened to prohibit the conjugal visits but stocks lawyer that little darkhaired one over there filed a lawsuit and got a ruling that ensures one last quickie i think stocks almost looking forward to his next one sam leaned back in his chair and the smile slowly left his face personally i havent given much thought to my conjugal visit its intended for husband and wife relations only you know thats what the term means but the wardenll probably bend the rules for me what do you think i really havent thought about it im just kidding you know im an old man id settle for a back rub and a stiff drink what about your last meal adam asked still very quietly thats not funny i thought we were kidding probably something gross like boiled pork and rubber peas same crap theyve been feeding me for almost ten years maybe an extra piece of toast id hate to give the cook the opportunity to prepare a meal fit for free world humans sounds delicious oh ill share it with you ive often wondered why they feed you before they kill you they also bring the doctor in and give you a preexecution physical can you believe it gotta make sure youre fit to die and they have a shrink on staff here who examines you before the execution and he must report to the warden in writing that youre mentally sound enough to gas and they have a minister on the payroll wholl pray and meditate with you and make sure your soul is headed in the right direction all paid for by the taxpayers of the state of mississippi and administered by these loving people around here dont forget the conjugal visit you can die with your lust satisfied they think of everything theyre very considerate really concerned about your appetite and health and spiritual wellbeing right at the very last they put a catheter in your penis and a plug up your ass so you wont make a mess this is for their benefit not yours they dont wanna have to clean you afterward so they feed you real good anything you want then they plug you up sick isnt it sick sick sick sick lets talk about something else sam finished the last cigarette and thumped it on the floor in front of the guard no lets stop talking ive had enough for one day fine and no more about eddie okay its really not fair to come in here and hit me with stuff like that im sorry no more about eddie lets try to focus on me the next three weeks okay thats more than enough to keep us busy its a deal sam along highway from the east greenville was growing in an unsightly sprawl with its strip shopping centers filled with video rental and dinky liquor stores and its endless fastfood franchises and driveup motels with free cable and breakfast the river blocked such progress to the west and since was the main corridor it had evidently become the developers favorite territory in the past twentyfive years greenville had grown from a sleepy river town of thirtyfive thousand to a busy river city of sixty thousand it was prosperous and progressive in greenville was the fifthlargest city in the state the streets leading into the central district were shaded and lined with stately old homes the center of the town was pretty and quaint well preserved and apparently unchanged adam thought in stark contrast to the thoughtless chaos along highway he parked on washington street at a few minutes after five as downtown merchants and their customers were busy preparing for the end of the day he removed his tie and left it with his jacket in the car because the temperature was still in the nineties and showed no sign of relenting he walked three blocks and found the park with the lifesized bronze statue of two little boys in the center they were the same size with the same smile and the same eyes one was running while the other one skipped and the sculptor had captured them perfectly josh and john kramer forever five years old frozen in time with copper and tin a brass plate below them said simply josh and john kramer died here on april march april the park was a perfect square half a city block which had once held marvins law office and an old building next to it the land had been in the kramer family for years and marvins father gave it to the city to be used as a memorial sam had done a fine job of leveling the law office and the city had razed the building next to it some money had been spent on kramer park and a lot of thought had gone into it it was completely fenced with ornamental wrought iron and an entrance on each side from the sidewalks perfect rows of oaks and maples followed the fencing lines of manicured shrubs met at precise angles then encircled flower beds of begonias and geraniums a small amphitheater sat in one corner under the trees and across the way a group of black children sailed through the air on wooden swings it was small and colorful a pleasant little garden amid the streets and buildings a teenaged couple argued on a bench as adam walked by a bicycle gang of eightyearolds roared around a fountain an ancient policeman ambled by and actually tipped his hat to adam as he said hello he sat on a bench and stared at josh and john less than thirty feet away never forget the victims lee had admonished they have the right to want retribution theyve earned it he remembered all the gruesome details from the trials the fbi expert who testified about the bomb and the speed at which it ripped through the building the medical examiner who delicately described the little bodies and what exactly killed them the firemen who tried to irescue but were much too late and were left only to retrieve there had been photographs of the building and the boys and the trial judges had used great restraint in allowing just a few of these to go to the jury mcallister typically had wanted to show huge enlarged color pictures of the mangled bodies but they were excluded adam was now sitting on ground which had once been the office of marvin kramer and he closed his eyes and tried to feel the ground shake he saw the footage from his video of smoldering debris and the cloud of dust suspended over the scene he heard the frantic voice of the news reporter the sirens shrieking in the background those bronze boys were not much older than he was when his grandfather killed them they were five and he was almost three and for some reason he kept up with their ages today he was twentysix and they would be twentyeight the guilt hit hard and low in the stomach it made him shudder and sweat the sun hid behind two large oaks to the west and as it flickered through the branches the boys faces gleamed how could sam have done this why was sam cayhall his grandfather and not someone elses when did he decide to participate in the klans holy war against jews what made him change from a harmless crossburner to a fullfledged terrorist adam sat on the bench stared at the statue and hated his grandfather he felt guilty for being in mississippi trying to help the old bastard he found a holiday inn and paid for a room he called lee and reported in then watched the evening news on the jackson channels evidently it had been just another languid summer day in mississippi with little happening sam cayhall and his latest efforts to stay alive were the hot topics each station carried somber comments by the governor and the attorney general about the newest petition for relief filed by the defense this morning and each man was just sick and tired of the endless appeals each would fight valiantly to pursue this matter until justice was realized one station began its own countdown twentythree days until execution the anchorperson rattled off as if reciting the number of shopping days left until christmas the number was plastered under the same overworked photo of sam cayhall adam ate dinner in a small downtown cafe he sat alone in a booth picking at roast beef and peas listening to harmless chatter around him no one mentioned sam at dusk he walked the sidewalks in front of the shops and stores and thought of sam pacing along these same streets on the same concrete waiting for the bomb to go off and wondering what in the world had gone wrong he stopped by a phone booth maybe the same one sam had tried to use to call and warn kramer the park was deserted and dark two gaslight street lamps stood by the front entrance providing the only light adam sat at the base of the statue under the boys under the brass plate with their names and dates of birth and death on this very spot it said they died he sat there for a long time oblivious to the darkness pondering imponderables wasting time with fruitless considerations of what might have been the bomb had defined his life he knew that much it had taken him away from mississippi and deposited him in another world with a new name it had transformed his parents into refugees fleeing their past and hiding from their present it had killed his father in all likelihood though no one could predict what might have happened to eddie cayhall the bomb had played a principal role in adams decision to become a lawyer a calling hed never felt until he learned of sam hed dreamed of flying airplanes and now the bomb had led him back to mississippi for an undertaking laden with agony and little hope the odds were heavy that the bomb would claim its final victim in twentythree days and adam wondered what would happen to him after that what else could the bomb have in store for him for the most part death penalty appeals drag along for years at a snails pace a very old snail no one is in a hurry the issues are complicated the briefs motions petitions etc are thick and burdensome the court dockets are crowded with more pressing matters occasionally though a ruling can come down with stunning speed justice can become terribly efficient especially in the waning days when a date for an execution has been set and the courts are tired of more motions more appeals adam eceived his first dose of quick justice while he was wandering the streets of greenville monday afternoon the mississippi supreme court took one look at his petition for postconviction relief and denied it around pm monday adam was just arriving in greenville and knew nothing about it the denial was certainly no surprise but its speed certainly was the court kept the petition less than eight hours in all fairness the court had dealt with sam cayhall off and on for over ten years in the final days of death cases the courts watch each other closely copies of filings and rulings are faxed along so that the higher courts know whats coming the denial by the mississippi supreme court was routinely faxed to the federal district court in jackson adams next forum it was sent to the honorable f flynn slattery a young federal judge who was new to the bench he had not been involved with the cayhall appeals judge slatterys office attempted to locate adam hall between and pm monday but he was sitting in kramer park slattery called the attorney general steve roxburgh and at eightthirty a brief meeting took place in the judges office the judge happened to be a workaholic and this was his first death case he and his clerk studied the petition until midnight if adam had watched the late news monday he would have learned that his petition had already been denied by the supreme court he was however sound asleep at six tuesday morning he casually picked up the jackson paper and learned that the supreme court had turned him down that the matter was now in federal court assigned to judge slattery and that both the attorney general and the governor were claiming another victory odd he thought since he hadnt yet officially filed anything in federal court he jumped in his car and raced to jackson two hours away at nine he entered the federal courthouse on capitol street in downtown and met briefly with breck jefferson an unsmiling young man fresh from law school and holding the important position of slatterys law clerk adam was told to return at eleven for a meeting with the judge although he arrived at slatterys office at exactly eleven it was obvious a meeting of sorts had been in progress for some time in the center of slatterys huge office was a mahogany conference table long and wide with eight black leather chairs on each side slatterys throne was at one end near his desk and before him on the table were stacks of papers legal pads and other effects the side to his right was crowded with young white men in navy suits all bunched together along the table with another row of eager warriors seated close behind this side belonged to the state with his honor the governor mr david mcallister sitting closest to slattery his honor the attorney general steve roxburgh had been banished to the middle of the table in an obvious losing battle over turf each distinguished public servant had brought to the table his most trusted litigators and thinkers and this squadron of strategists had obviously been meeting with the judge and plotting long before adam arrived breck the clerk swung the door open and greeted adam pleasantly enough then asked him to step inside the room was instantly silent as adam slowly approached the table slattery reluctantly rose from his chair and introduced himself to adam the handshake was cold and fleeting have a seat he said ominously fluttering his left hand at the eight leather chairs on the defense side of the table adam hesitated then picked one directly across from a face he recognized as belonging to roxburgh he placed his briefcase on the table and sat down four empty chairs were to his right in the direction of slattery and three to his left he felt like a lonesome trespasser i assume you know the governor and the attorney general slattery said as if everyone had personally met these two neither adam said shaking his head slightly im david mcallister mr hall nice to meet you the governor said quickly ever the anxious gladhanding politician with an incredibly rapid flash of flawless teeth a pleasure adam said barely moving his lips and im steve roxburgh said the attorney general adam only nodded at him hed seen his face in the newspapers roxburgh took the initiative he began talking and pointing at people these are attorneys from my criminal appeals division kevin laird bart moody morris henry hugh simms and joseph ely these guys handle all death penalty cases they all nodded obediently while maintaining their suspicious frowns adam counted eleven people on the other side of the table mcallister chose not to introduce his band of clones all of whom were suffering from either migraines or hemorrhoids their faces were contorted from pain or perhaps from quite serious deliberation about legal matters at hand hope we havent jumped the gun mr hall slattery said as he slipped a pair of reading glasses on his nose he was in his early forties one of the young reagan appointees when do on expect to officially file your petition here in federal court today adam said nervously still astounded y the speed of it all this was a positive evelopment though hed decided while driving o jackson if sam got any relief it would be in federal court not state when can the state respond the judge sked roxburgh tomorrow morning assuming the petition ere raises the same issues as those raised in e supreme court theyre the same adam said to roxburgh en he turned to slattery i was told to be here t eleven oclock what time did the meeting tart the meeting started when i decided it would tart mr hall slattery said icily do you have a problem with that yes its obvious this conference started some me ago without me whats wrong with that this is my office end ill start meetings whenever i want yeah but its my petition and i was invited here to discuss it seems as though i shouldve been here for the entire meeting you dont trust me mr hall slattery was easing forward on his elbows thoroughly enjoying this i dont trust anybody adam said staring at his honor were trying to accommodate you mr hall your client doesnt have much time and im only trying to move things along i thought youd be pleased that we were able to arrange this meeting with such speed thank you adam said and looked at his legal pad there was a brief silence as the tension eased a bit slattery held a sheet of paper get the petition filed today the state will file its response tomorrow ill consider it over the weekend and issue a ruling on monday in the event i decide to conduct a hearing i need to know from both sides how long it will take to prepare how about you mr hall how long to get ready for a hearing sam had twentytwo days to live any hearing would have to be a hurried concise affair with quick witnesses and he hoped a swift ruling by the court adding to the stress of the moment was the crucial fact that adam had no idea how long it would take to prepare for a hearing because hed never tried such a matter hed participated in a few minor skirmishes in chicago but always with emmitt wycoff close by he was just a rookie dammit he wasnt even certain where the courtroom was located and something told him that the eleven vultures examining him at this precise second knew full well he didnt know what the hell he was doing i can be ready in a week he said with a steady poker face and as much faith as he could muster very well slattery said as if this was fine a good answer adam good boy a week was reasonable then roxburgh whispered something to one of his warlocks and the whole bunch thought it was funny adam ignored them slattery scribbled something with an ink pen then studied it he gave it to breck the clerk who treasured it and raced off to do something who with it his honor looked along the wall of legal infantry to his right then he dropped his gaze upon young adam now mr hall theres something else id like to discuss as you know this execution is scheduled to take place in twentytwo days and i would like to know if this court can expect any additional filings on behalf of mr cayhall i know this is an unusual bequest but were operating here in an unusual situation frankly this is my first involvement with a death penalty case as advanced as this one and i think its best if we all work together here in other words your honor you want to make damned sure there are no stays adam thought for a second it was an unusual request and one that was quite unfair but sam had a constitutional right to file anything at anytime and adam could not be bound by any promises made here he decided to be polite i really cant say your honor not now maybe next week surely youll file the usual gangplank appeals roxburgh said and the smirking bastards around him all looked at adam with wondrous amazement frankly mr roxburgh im not required to discuss my plans with you or with the court for that matter of course not mcallister chimed in for some reason probably just his inability to stay quiet for more than five minutes adam had noticed the lawyer sitting to roxburghs right a methodical sort with steely eyes that seldom left adam he was young but gray cleanshaven and very neat mcallister favored him and had leaned to his right several times as if receiving advice the others from the ags office seemed to accede to his thoughts and movements there was a reference in one of the hundred articles adam had clipped and filed away about an infamous litigator in the ags office known as dr death a clever bird with a penchant for pushing death penalty cases to their conclusion either his first or last name was morris and adam vaguely recalled a morris something or other mentioned moments earlier during roxburghs garbled introduction of his staff adam assumed him to be the nefarious dr death morris henry was his name well hurry up and file them then slattery said with a good dose of frustration i dont want to work around the clock as this thing goes down to the wire no sir adam said in mock sympathy slattery glared at him for a moment then returned to the paperwork in front of him very well gentlemen i suggest you stick by your telephones sunday night and monday morning ill be calling as soon as ive made a decision this meeting is adjourned the conspiracy on the other side broke up in a furry of papers and files snatched from the table end sudden mumbled conversations adam was earest the door he nodded at slattery offered feeble good day your honor and left the ffice he gave a polite grin to the secretary and as into the hallway when someone called his name it was the governor with two flunkies tow can we talk a minute mcallister asked rusting a hand at adams waist they shook r a second what about just five minutes okay adam looked at the governors boys waiting a few feet away alone private and off the record he said sure mcallister said then pointed to a set of double doors they stepped inside a small empty courtroom with the lights off the governors hands were free someone else carried his briefcase and bags he stuck them deep in his pockets and leaned against a railing he was lean and well dressed nice suit fashionable silk tie obligatory white cotton shirt he was under forty and aging remarkably well only a touch of gray tinted his sideburns hows sam he asked feigning deep concern adam snorted looked away then sat his briefcase on the floor oh hes wonderful ill tell him you asked hell be thrilled id heard he was in bad health health youre trying to kill him how can you be worried about his health just heard a rumor he hates your guts okay his health is bad but he can hang on for another three weeks hate is nothing new for sam you know what exactly do you want to talk about just wanted to say hello im sure well get together shortly look governor i have a signed contract with my client that expressly forbids me from talking to you i repeat he hates you youre the reason hes on death row he blames you for everything and if he knew we were talking now hed fire me your own grandfather would fire you yes i truly believe it so if i read in tomorrows paper that you met with me today and we discussed sam cayhall then ill be on my way back to chicago which will probably screw up your execution because sam wont have a lawyer cant kill a man if he doesnt have a lawyer says who just keep it quiet okay you have my word but if we cant talk then how do we discuss the issue of clemency i dont know i havent reached that point yet mcallisters face was always pleasant the comely smile was always in place or just beneath the surface you have thought about clemency havent you yes with three weeks to go ive thought bout clemency every death row inmate dreams f a pardon governor and thats why you cant rant one you pardon one convict and youll have the other fifty pestering you for the same favor fifty families writing letters and calling night and day fifty lawyers pulling strings and trying to get in your office you and i both know t cant be done im not sure he should die he said this while looking away as if a change of heart was under way as if the years had softened his zeal to punish sam adam started to say something then realized the magnitude of these last words he examined the floor for a minute paying particular attention to the governors tasseled loafers the governor was deep in thought im not sure he should die either adam laid how much has he told you about what about the kramer bombing he says hes told me everything but you have doubts yes so do i i always had doubts why lots of reasons jeremiah dogan was a notorious liar and he was scared to death of going to prison the irs had him cold you know and he was convinced that if he went to prison hed be raped and tortured and killed by gangs of blacks he was the imperial wizard you know dogan was also ignorant about a lot of things he was sly and hard to catch when it came to terrorism but he didnt understand the criminal justice system i always thought someone probably the fbi told dogan that sam had to be convicted or theyd ship him off to prison no conviction no deal he was a very eager witness on the stand he desperately wanted the jury to convict sam so he lied i dont know maybe about what have you asked sam if he had an accomplice adam paused for a second and analyzed the question i really cant discuss what sam and i have talked about its confidential of course it is there are a lot of people in this state who secretly do not wish to see sam executed mcallister was now watching adam closely are you one of them i dont know but what if sam didnt plan to kill either marvin kramer or his sons sure sam was there right in the thick of it but what if someone else possessed the intent to murder then sam isnt as guilty as we think right hes certainly not innocent but not guilty enough to be executed either this bothers me mr hall can i call you adam of course i dont suppose sam has mentioned anything about an accomplice i really cant discuss that not now the governor slipped a hand from a pocket and gave adam a business card two phone numbers on the back one is my private office number the other is my home number all phone calls are confidential i swear i play for the cameras sometimes adam it goes with the fob but i can also be trusted adam took the card and looked at the handwritten numbers i couldnt live with myself if i failed to rdon a man who didnt deserve to die mcallister said as he walked to the door give me a call but dont wait too late this things already heating up im getting twenty phone calls a day he winked at adam showed him the sparkling teeth once again and left the room adam sat in a metal chair against the wall and looked at the front of the card it was foldembossed with an official seal twenty calls a day what did that mean did the callers want sam dead or did they want him pardoned a lot of people in this state do not wish to see sam executed hed said as if he was already weighing the votes hed lose against those he might gain the smile from the receptionist in the foyer was not as quick as usual and as adam walked to his office he detected a more somber atmosphere among the staff and the handful of lawyers the chatter was an octave lower things were a bit more urgent chicago had arrived it happened occasionally not necessarily for purposes of inspection but more often than not to service a local client or to conduct bureaucratic little firm meetings no one had ever been fired when chicago arrived no one had ever been cursed or abused but it always provided for a few anxious moments until chicago left and headed back north adam opened his office door and nearly smacked into the worried face of e garner goodman complete with green paisley bow tie white starched shirt bushy gray hair hed been pacing around the room and happened to be near the door when it opened adam stared at him then took his hand and shook it quickly come in come in goodman said closing the door as he invited adam into his own office he hadnt smiled yet what are you doing here adam asked throwing his briefcase on the floor and walking to his desk they faced each other goodman stroked his neat gray beard then adjusted his bow tie theres a bit of an emergency im afraid could be bad news what sit down sit down this might take a minute no im fine what is it it had to be horrible if he needed to take it sitting down goodman tinkered with his bow tie rubbed his beard then said well it happened at nine this morning you see the personnel committee is made up of fifteen partners almost all are younger guys the full committee has several subcommittees of course one for recruiting hiring one for discipline one for disputes and on and on and as you might guess theres one for terminations the termination subcommittee met this morning and guess who was there to orchestrate everything daniel rosen daniel rosen evidently hes been working the termination subcommittee for ten days trying to line up enough votes for your dismissal adam sat in a chair at the table and goodman sat across from him there are seven members of the subcommittee and they met this morning at rosens request there were five members present so they had a quorum rosen of course did not notify me or anyone else termination meetings are strictly confidential for obvious reasons so there was no requirement that he notify anyone not even me no not even you you were the only item on the agenda and the meeting lasted less than an hour rosen had the deck stacked before he went in but he presented his case very forcefully remember he was a courtroom brawler for thirty years they record all termination meetings just in case theres litigation afterward so rosen made a complete record he of course claims that you were deceitful when you applied for employment with kravitz bane that it presents the firm with a conflict of interest and on and on and he had copies of a dozen or so newspaper articles about you and sam and the grandfathergrandson angle his argument was that you had embarrassed the firm he was very prepared i think we underestimated him last monday and so they voted four to one to terminate you bastards i know ive seen rosen in tough spots before and the guy can be brutally persuasive he usually gets his way he cant go to courtrooms anymore so hes picking fights around the office hell be gone in six months thats a small comfort at the moment theres hope word finally filtered to my office around eleven and luckily emmitt wycoff was in we went to rosens office and had a terrible fight then we got on the phone bottom line is this the full personnel committee meets at eight oclock in the morning to review your dismissal you need to be there eight oclock in the morning yeah these guys are busy many have court dates at nine some have depositions all day out of fifteen well be lucky to have a quorum how much is a quorum twothirds ten and if theres no quorum then we might be in trouble trouble what do you call this it could get worse if theres no quorum in the morning then you have the right to request another review in thirty days sam will be dead in thirty days maybe not at any rate i think well have the meeting in the morning emmitt and i have commitments from nine of the members to be there what about the four who voted against me this morning goodman grinned and glanced away guess rosen made sure his votes can be there tomorrow adam suddenly slapped the table with both hands i quit dammit you cant quit youve just been terminated then i wont fight it sonofabitches listen adam sonofabitches goodman retreated for a moment to allow adam to cool he straightened his bow tie and checked the growth of his beard he tapped his fingers on the table then he said look adam were in good shape in the morning okay emmitt thinks so i think so the firms behind you on this we believe in what youre doing and frankly weve enjoyed the publicity thereve been nice stories in the chicago papers the firm certainly appears to be supportive just listen to me we can pull this off tomorrow ill do most of the talking wycoffs twisting arms right now weve got other people twisting arms rosens not stupid mr goodman he wants to win thats all he doesnt care about me doesnt care about sam or you or anyone else involved he simply wants to win its a contest and ill bet hes on the phone right now trying to line up votes then lets go fight his cranky ass okay lets walk into that meeting tomorrow with a chip on our shoulders lets make rosen the bad guy honestly adam the man does not have a lot of friends adam walked to the window and peeked through the shades foot traffic was heavy on the mall below it was almost five he had close to five thousand dollars in mutual funds and if he was frugal and if he made certain lifestyle changes the money might last for six months his salary was sixtytwo thousand and replacing it in the very near future would be difficult but he had never been one to worry about money and he wouldnt start now he was much more concerned about the next three weeks after a tenday career as a death penalty lawyer he knew he needed help what will it be like at the end he asked after a heavy silence goodman slowly rose from his chair and walked to another window pretty crazy you wont sleep much the last four days youll be running in all directions the courts are unpredictable the system is unpredictable you keep filing petitions and appeals knowing full well they wont work the press will be dogging you and most importantly youll need to spend as much time as possible with your client its crazy work and its all free so ill need some help oh yes you cant do it alone when maynard tole was executed we had a lawyer from jackson staked out at the governors office one at the supreme court clerks office in jackson one in washington and two on death row thats why you have to go fight tomorrow adam youll need the firm and its resources you cant do it by yourself it takes a team this is a real kick in the crotch i know a year ago you were in law school now youve been terminated i know it hurts but believe me adam its just a fluke it wont stand ten years from now youll be a partner in this firm and youll be terrorizing young associates dont bet on it lets go to chicago ive got two tickets for a sevenfifteen flight well be in chicago by eightthirty and well find a nice restaurant i need to get some clothes fine meet me at the airport at sixthirty the matter was effectively settled before the meeting began eleven members of the personnel committee were present a sufficient number for a quorum they gathered in a locked library on the sixtieth floor around a long table with gallons of coffee in the center of it and they brought with them thick files and portable dictaphones and fatigued pocket schedules one brought his secretary and she sat in the hallway and worked furiously these were busy people all of them less than an hour away from another frantic day of endless conferences meetings briefings depositions trials telephones and significant lunches ten men one woman all in their late thirties or early forties all partners of k b all in a hurry to return to their cluttered desks the matter of adam hall was a nuisance to them the personnel committee in fact was a nuisance to them it was not one of the more pleasant panels upon which to serve but theyd been duly elected and no one dared decline all for the firm go team go adam had arrived at the office at seventhirty hed been gone for ten days his longest absence yet emmitt wycoff had shifted adams work to another young associate there was never a shortage of rookies at kravitz bane by eight oclock he was hiding in a small useless conference room near the library on the sixtieth floor he was nervous but worked hard at not showing it he sipped coffee and read the morning papers parchman was a world away and he studied the list of fifteen names on the personnel committee none of whom he knew eleven strangers who would kick his future around for the next hour then vote quickly and get on with more important matters wycoff checked in and said hello a few minutes before eight adam thanked him for everything apologized for being so much trouble and listened as emmitt promised a speedy and satisfactory outcome garner goodman opened the door at five minutes after eight looks pretty good he said almost in a whisper right now there are eleven present we have commitments from at least five three of rosens votes from the subcommittee are here but it looks like he might be a vote or two shy is rosen here adam asked knowing the answer but hoping that maybe the old bastard had died in his sleep yes of course and i think hes worried emmitt was still making phone calls at ten last night weve got the votes and rosen knows it goodman eased through the door and was gone at eightfifteen the chairman called the meeting to order and declared a quorum the termination of adam hall was the sole issue on the agenda indeed the only reason for this special meeting emmitt wycoff went first and in ten minutes did a fine job of telling how wonderful adam was he stood at one end of the table in front of a row of bookshelves and chatted comfortably as if trying to persuade a jury at least half of the eleven did not hear a word they scanned documents and juggled their calendars garner goodman spoke next he quickly summarized the case of sam cayhall and provided the honest assessment that in all likelihood sam would be executed in three weeks then he bragged on adam said he might have been wrong in not disclosing his relationship with sam but what the hell that was then and this is now and the present is a helluva lot more important when your client has only three weeks to live not a single question was asked of either wycoff or goodman the questions evidently were being saved for rosen lawyers have long memories you cut ones throat today and hell wait patiently in the weeds for years until he can return the favor daniel rosen had lots of favors lying around the hallways of kravitz bane and as managing partner he was in the process of collecting them hed stepped on people his own people for years he was a bully a liar a thug in his glory days hed been the heart and soul of the firm and he knew it no one would challenge him he had abused young associates and tormented his fellow partners he had run roughshod over committees ignored firm policies stolen clients from other lawyers at kravitz bane and now in the decline of his career he was collecting favors two minutes into his presentation he was interrupted for the first time by a young partner who rode motorcycles with emmitt wycoff rosen was pacing as if playing to a packed courtroom in his glory days when the question stopped him before he could think of a sarcastic answer another question hit him by the time he could think of an answer to either of the first two a third came from nowhere the brawl was on the three interrogators worked like an efficient tag team and it was apparent that they had been practicing they took turns needling rosen with relentless questions and within a minute he was cursing and throwing insults they kept their collective cool each had a legal pad with what appeared to be long lists of questions wheres the conflict of interest mr rosen certainly a lawyer can represent a family member right mr rosen did the application for employment specifically ask mr hall if this firm represented a member of his family do you have something against publicity mr rosen why do you consider the publicity to be negative would you try to help a family member on death row what are your feelings about the death penalty mr rosen do you secretly want to see sam cayhall executed because he killed jews dont you think youve ambushed mr hall it was not a pleasant sight some of the greatest courtroom victories in recent chicago history belonged to daniel rosen and here he was getting his teeth kicked in in a meaningless fight before a committee not a jury not a judge a committee the idea of retreat had never entered his mind he pressed on growing louder and more caustic his retorts and acid replies grew personal and he said some nasty things about adam this was a mistake others joined the fray and soon rosen was flailing like wounded prey just a few steps in front of the wolf pack when it was apparent that he could never reach a majority of the committee he lowered his voice and regained his composure he rallied nicely with a quiet summation about ethical considerations and avoiding the appearance of impropriety scriptures that lawyers learn in law school and spit at each other when fighting but otherwise ignore when convenient when rosen finished he stormed out of the room mentally taking notes of those whod had the nerve to grill him hed write their names in a file the minute he got to his desk and one day well one day hed just do something about it papers and pads and electronic equipment vanished from the table which was suddenly clean except for the coffee and empty cups the chairman called for a vote rosen got five adam got six and the personnel committee adjourned itself immediately and disappeared in a rush six to five adam repeated as he looked at the relieved but unsmiling faces of goodman and wycoff a regular landslide wycoff quipped could be worse goodman said you could be out of a job why am i not ecstatic i mean one lousy vote and id be history not really wycoff explained the votes were counted before the meeting rosen had maybe two solid votes and the others stuck with him because they knew you would win you have no idea of the amount of arm twisting that took place last night this does it for rosen hell be gone in three months maybe quicker added goodman hes a loose cannon everybodys sick of him including me adam said wycoff glanced at his watch it was eight fortyfive and he had to be in court at nine look adam ive gotta run he said buttoning his jacket when are you going back to memphis today i guess can we have lunch id like to talk to you sure he opened the door and said great my secretary will give you a call gotta run see you and he was gone goodman suddenly glanced at his watch too his watch ran much slower than the real lawyers in the firm but he did have appointments to keep i need to see someone in my office ill join you guys for lunch one lousy vote adam repeated staring at the wall come on adam it wasnt that close it certainly feels close look we need to spend a few hours together before you leave i wanna hear about sam okay lets start with lunch he opened the door and was gone adam sat on the table shaking his head f baker cooley and the other lawyers in the memphis office knew anything about adams sudden termination and its quick reversal it was not apparent they treated him the same which was to say they kept to themselves and stayed away from his office they were not rude to him because after all he was from chicago they smiled when forced to and they could muster a moment of small talk in the hallways if adam was in the mood but they were corporate lawyers with starched shirts and soft hands which were unaccustomed to the dirt and grime of criminal defense they did not go to jails or prisons or holding tanks to visit with clients nor did they wrangle with cops and prosecutors and cranky judges they worked primarily behind their desks and around mahogany conference tables their time was spent talking to clients who could afford to pay them several hundred dollars an hour for advice and when they werent talking to clients they were on the phone or doing lunch with other lawyers and bankers and insurance executives thered been enough in the newspapers already to arouse resentment around the office most of the lawyers were embarrassed to see the name of their firm associated with a character such as sam cayhall most of them had no idea that hed been represented by chicago for seven years now friends were asking questions other lawyers were making wisecracks wives were humiliated over garden club teas inlaws were suddenly interested in their legal careers sam cayhall and his grandson had quickly become a pain in the ass for the memphis office but nothing could be done about it adam could sense it but didnt care it was a temporary office suitable for three more weeks and hopefully not a day longer he stepped from the elevator friday morning and ignored the receptionist who was suddenly busy arranging magazines he spoke to his secretary a young woman named darlene and she handed him a phone message from todd marks at the memphis press he took the pink phone message to his office and threw it in the wastebasket he hung his coat on a hanger and began covering the table with paper there were pages of notes hed taken on the flights to and from chicago and similar pleadings hed borrowed from goodmans files and dozens of copies of recent federal decisions he was soon lost in a world of legal theories and strategies chicago was a fading memory rollie wedge entered the brinkley plaza building through the front doors to the mall he had waited patiently at a table of a sidewalk cafe until the black saab appeared then turned into a nearby parking garage he was dressed in a white shirt with a tie seersucker slacks casual loafers he sipped an iced tea while watching adam walk along the sidewalk and enter the building the lobby was empty as wedge scanned the directory kravitz bane had the third and fourth floors there were four identical elevators and he rode one to the eighth floor he stepped into a narrow foyer to the right was a door with the name of a trust company emblazoned in brass and to the left was an adjoining hallway lined with doors to all kinds of enterprises next to the water fountain was a door to the stairway he casually walked down eight flights checking doors as he went no one passed him in the stairwell he reentered the lobby then rode the other elevator alone to the third floor he smiled at the receptionist who was still busy with the magazines and was about to ask directions to the trust company when the phone rang and she became occupied with it a set of double glass doors separated the reception area from the entryway to the elevators he rode to the fourth floor and found an identical set of doors but no receptionist the doors were locked on a wall to the right was a coded entry panel with nine numbered buttons he heard voices and stepped into the stairwell there was no lock on the door from either side he waited for a moment then eased through the door and took a long drink of water an elevator opened and a young man in khakis and blue blazer bounced out with a cardboard box under one arm and a thick book in his right hand he headed for the kravitz bane doors he hummed a loud tune and did not notice as wedge fell in behind him he stopped and carefully balanced the law book on top of the box freeing his right hand to punch the code seven seven three and the panel beeped with each number wedge was inches away peering over his shoulder and gathering the code the young man quickly grabbed the book and was about to turn around when wedge bumped into him slightly and said damn sorry i wasnt wedge took a step backwards and looked at the lettering above the door this isnt riverbend trust he said dazed and bewildered nope this is kravitz bane what floor is this wedge asked something clicked and the door was free fourth riverbend trust is on the eighth sorry wedge said again now embarrassed and almost pitiful mustve got off on the wrong floor the young man frowned and shook his head then opened the door sorry wedge said for the third time as he backed away the door closed and the kid was gone wedge rode the elevator to the main lobby and left the building he left downtown and drove east and north for ten minutes until he came to a section of the city filled with government housing he pulled into the driveway beside the auburn house and was stopped by a uniformed guard he was just turning around he explained lost again and he was very sorry as he backed into the street he saw the burgundy jaguar owned by lee booth parked between two subcompacts he headed toward the river toward downtown again and twenty minutes later parked at an abandoned redbrick warehouse on the bluffs while sitting in his car he quickly changed into a tan shirt with blue trim around the short sleeves and the name rusty stitched above the pocket then he was moving swiftly but inconspicuously on foot around the corner of the building and down a slope through weeds until he stopped in the brush a small tree provided shade as he caught his breath and hid from the scorching sun in front of him was a small field of bermuda grass thick and green and obviously well tended and beyond the grass was a row of twenty luxury condominiums hanging over the edge of the bluff a fence of brick and iron presented a vexing problem and he studied it patiently from the privacy of the brush one side of the condos was the parking lot with a closed gate leading to the only entrance and exit a uniformed guard manned the small boxlike airconditioned gatehouse few cars were in sight it was almost am the outline of the guard could be seen through tinted glass wedge ignored the fence and chose instead to penetrate from the bluff he crawled along a row of boxwoods clutching handfuls of grass to keep from sliding eighty feet onto riverside drive he slid under wooden patios some of which hung ten feet into the air as the bluff dropped fast below them he stopped at the seventh condo and swung himself onto the patio he rested for a moment in a wicker chair and toyed with an outside cable as if on a routine service call no one was watching privacy was important to these wealthy people they paid for it dearly and each little terrace was shielded from the next by decorative wooden planks and all sorts of hanging vegetation his shirt by now was sticky and clinging to his back the sliding glass door from the patio to the kitchen was locked of course a rather simple lock that slowed him for almost one minute he picked it leaving neither damage nor evidence then glanced around for another look before he went in this was the tricky part he assumed there was a security system probably one with contacts at every window and door since no one was home it was highly probable the system would be activated the delicate question was exactly how much noise would be made when he opened the door would there be a silent alert or would he be startled with a screaming siren he took a breath then carefully slid the door open no siren greeted him he took a quick look at the monitor above the door then stepped inside the relay immediately alerted willis the guard at the gate who heard a frantic though not very loud beeping sound from his monitoring screen he looked at the red light blinking at number home of lee booth and he waited for it to stop mrs booth tripped her alarm at least twice a month which was about the average for the flock he guarded he checked his clipboard and noticed that mrs booth had left at ninefifteen but she occasionally had sleepovers usually men and now she had her nephew staying with her and so willis watched the red light for fortyfive seconds until it stopped blinking and fixed itself in a permanent on position this was unusual but no need to panic these people lived behind walls and paid for aroundtheclock armed guards so they were not serious about their alarm systems he quickly dialed mrs booths number and there was no answer he punched a button and set in motion a recorded call requesting police assistance he opened the key drawer and selected one for number then left the gatehouse and walked quickly across the parking lot to see about mrs booths unit he unfastened his holster so he could grab his revolver just in case rollie wedge stepped into the gatehouse and saw the open key drawer he took a set marked for unit along with a card with the alarm code and instructions and for good measure he also grabbed keys and cards for numbers and just to baffle old willis and the cops they went to the cemetery first to pay their respects to the dead it covered two small hills on the edge of clanton one lined with elaborate tombstones and monuments where prominent families had buried themselves together over time and had their names carved in heavy granite the second hill was for the newer graves and as time had passed in mississippi the tombstones had grown smaller stately oaks and elms shaded most of the cemetery the grass was trimmed low and the shrubs were neat azaleas were in every corner clanton placed a priority on its memories it was a lovely saturday with no clouds and a slight breeze that had started during the night and chased away the humidity the rains were gone for a while and the hillsides were lush with greenery and wildflowers lee knelt by her mothers headstone and placed a small bouquet of flowers under her name she closed her eyes as adam stood behind her and stared at the grave anna gates cayhall september september she was fiftyfive when she died adam calculated so he was thirteen still living in blissful ignorance somewhere in southern california she was buried alone under a single headstone and this in itself had presented some problems mates for life are usually buried side by side at least in the south with the first one occupying the first slot under a double headstone upon each visit to the deceased the survivor gets to see his or her name already carved and just waiting daddy was fiftysix when mother died lee explained as she took adams hand and inched away from the grave i wanted him to bury her in a plot where he could one day join her but he refused i guess he figured he still had a few years left and he might remarry you told me once that she didnt like sam im sure she loved him in a way they were together for almost forty years but they were never close as i grew older i realized she didnt like to be around him she confided in me at times she was a simple country girl who married young had babies stayed home with them and was expected to obey her husband and this was not unusual for those times i think she was a very frustrated woman maybe she didnt want sam next to her for eternity i thought about that in fact eddie wanted them separated and buried at opposite ends of the cemetery good for eddie he wasnt joking either how much did she know about sam and the klan i have no idea it was not something we discussed i remember she was humiliated after his arrest she even stayed with eddie and you guys for a while because the reporters were bothering her and she didnt attend any of his trials no he didnt want her to watch she had a problem with high blood pressure and sam used that as an excuse to keep her away from it they turned and walked along a narrow lane through the old section of the cemetery they held hands and looked at the passing tombstones lee pointed to a row of trees across the street on another hill thats where the blacks are buried she said under those trees its a small cemetery youre kidding even today sure you know keep em in their place these people couldnt stand the idea of a negro lying amongst their ancestors adam shook his head in disbelief they climbed the hill and rested under an oak the rows of graves spread peacefully beneath them the dome of the ford county courthouse glittered in the sun a few blocks away i played here as a little girl she said quietly she pointed to her right to the north every fourth of july the city celebrates with a fireworks display and the best seats in the house are here in the cemetery theres a park down there and thats where they shoot from wed load up our bikes and come to town to watch the parade and swim in the city pool and play with our friends and right after dark wed all gather around here in the midst of the dead and sit on these tombstones to watch the fireworks the men would stay by their trucks where the beer and whiskey were hidden and the women would lie on quilts and tend to the babies we would run and romp and ride bikes all over the place eddie of course eddie was just a normal little brother pesky as hell sometimes but very much a boy i miss him you know i miss him very much we werent close for many years but when i come back to this town i think of my little brother i miss him too he and i came here to this very spot the night he graduated from high school i had been in nashville for two years and i came back because he wanted me to watch him graduate we had a bottle of cheap wine and i think it was his first drink ill never forget it we sat here on emil jacobs tombstone and sipped wine until the bottle was empty what year was it nineteen sixtyone i think he wanted to join the army so he could leave clanton and get away from sam i didnt want my little brother in the army and we discussed it until the sun came up he was pretty confused he was eighteen probably as confused as most kids whove just finished high school eddie was terrified that if he stayed in clanton something would happen to him some mysterious genetic flaw would surface and hed become another sam another cayhall with a hood he was desperate to run from this place but you ran as soon as you could i know but i was tougher than eddie at least at the age of eighteen i couldnt see him leaving home so young so we sipped wine and tried to get a handle on life did my father ever have a handle on life i doubt it adam we were both tormented by our father and his familys hatred there are things i hope you never learn stories that i pray remain untold i guess i pushed them away while eddie couldnt she took his hand again and they strolled into the sunlight and down a dirt path toward the newer section of the cemetery she stopped and pointed to a row of small headstones here are your greatgrandparents along with aunts uncles and other assorted cayhalls adam counted eight in all he read the names and dates and spoke aloud the poetry and scriptures and farewells inscribed in granite there are lots more out in the country lee said most of the cayhalls originated around karaway fifteen miles from here they were country people and theyre buried behind rural churches did you come here for these burials a few its not a close family adam some of these people had been dead for years before i knew about it why wasnt your mother buried here because she didnt want to be she knew she was about to die and she picked the spot she never considered herself a cayhall she was a gates smart woman lee pulled a handful of weeds from her grandmothers grave and rubbed her fingers over the name of lydia newsome cayhall who died in at the age of seventytwo i remember her well lee said kneeling on the grass a fine christian woman shed roll over in her grave if she knew her third son was on death row what about him adam asked pointing to lydias husband nathaniel lucas cayhall who died in at the age of sixtyfour the fondness left lees face a mean old man she said im sure hed be proud of sam nat as he was known was killed at a funeral a funeral yes traditionally funerals were social occasions around here they were preceded by long wakes with lots of visiting and eating and drinking life was hard in the rural south and often the funerals turned into drunken brawls nat was very violent and he picked a fight with the wrong men just after a funeral service they beat him to death with a stick of wood where was sam right in the middle of it he was beaten too but survived i was a little girl and i remember nats funeral sam was in the hospital and couldnt attend did he get retribution of course how nothing was ever proven but several years later the two men whod beaten nat were released from prison they surfaced briefly around here then disappeared one body was found months later next door in milburn county beaten of course the other man was never found the police questioned sam and his brothers but there was no proof do you think he did it sure he did nobody messed with the cayhalls back then they were known to be halfcrazy and mean as hell they left the family gravesites and continued along the path so adam the question for us is where do we bury sam i think we should bury him over there with the blacks that would serve him right what makes you think theyd want him good point seriously sam and i have not reached that point yet do you think hell want to be buried here in ford county i dont know we havent discussed it for obvious reasons theres still hope how much hope a trace enough to keep fighting they left the cemetery on foot and walked along a tranquil street with worn sidewalks and ancient oaks the homes were old and well painted with long porches and cats resting on the front steps children raced by on bikes and skateboards and old people rocked in their porch swings and waved slowly these are my old stomping grounds adam lee said as they walked aimlessly along her hands were stuck deep in denim pockets her eyes moistened with memories that were at once sad and pleasant she looked at each house as if shed stayed there as a child and could remember the little girls whod been her friends she could hear the giggles and laughs the silly games and the serious fights of tenyearolds were those happy times adam asked i dont know we never lived in town so we were known as country kids i always longed for one of these houses with friends all around and stores a few blocks away the town kids considered themselves to be a bit better than us but it wasnt much of a problem my best friends lived here and i spent many hours playing in these streets climbing these trees those were good times i guess the memories from the house in the country are not pleasant because of sam an elderly lady in a flowered dress and large straw hat was sweeping around her front steps as they approached she glanced at them then she froze and stared lee slowed then stopped near the walkway to the house she looked at the old woman and the old woman looked at lee mornin mrs langston lee said in a friendly drawl mrs langston gripped the broom handle and stiffened her back and seemed content to stare im lee cayhall you remember me lee drawled again as the name cayhall drifted across the tiny lawn adam caught himself glancing around to see if anyone else heard it he was prepared to be embarrassed if the name fell on other ears if mrs langston remembered lee it was not apparent she managed a polite nod of the head just a quick up and down motion rather awkward as if to say good morning to you now move along nice to see you again lee said and began walking away mrs langston scurried up the steps and disappeared inside i dated her son in high school lee said shaking her head in disbelief she was thrilled to see you she was always sort of wacky lee said without conviction or maybe shes afraid to talk to a cayhall afraid of what the neighbors might say i think it might be best if we go incognito for the rest of the day what about it its a deal they passed other folks puttering in their flower beds and waiting for the mailman but they said nothing lee covered her eyes with sun shades they zigzagged through the neighborhood in the general direction of the central square chatting about lees old friends and where they were now she kept in touch with two of them one in clanton and one in texas they avoided family history until they were on a street with smaller woodframed houses stacked tightly together they stopped at the corner and lee nodded at something down the street you see the third house on the right the little brown one there yes thats where you lived we could walk down there but i see people moving about two small children played with toy guns in the front yard and someone was swinging on the narrow front porch it was a square house small neat perfect for a young couple having babies adam had been almost three when eddie and evelyn disappeared and as he stood on the corner he tried desperately to remember something about the house he couldnt it was painted white back then and of course the trees were smaller eddie rented it from a local real estate agent was it nice nice enough they hadnt been married long they were just kids with a new child eddie worked in an auto parts store then he worked for the state highway department then he took another job sounds familiar evelyn worked parttime in a jewelry store on the square i think they were happy she was not from here you know and so she didnt know a lot of people they kept to themselves they walked by the house and one of the children aimed an orange machine gun at adam there were no memories of the place to be evoked at that moment he smiled at the child and looked away they were soon on another street with the square in sight lee was suddenly a tour guide and historian the yankees had burned clanton in the bastards and after the war general clanton a confederate hero whose family owned the county returned with only one leg the other one lost somewhere on the battlefield at shiloh and designed the new courthouse and the streets around it his original drawings were on the wall upstairs in the courthouse he wanted lots of shade so he planted oaks in perfect rows around the new courthouse he was a man of vision who could see the small town rising from the ashes and prospering so he designed the streets in an exact square around the courthouse common they had walked by the great mans grave she said just a moment ago and she would show it to him later there was a struggling mall north of town and a row of discount supermarkets to the east but the people of ford county still enjoyed shopping around the square on saturday morning she explained as they strolled along the sidewalk next to washington street traffic was slow and the pedestrians were even slower the buildings were old and adjoining filled with lawyers and insurance agents banks and cafes hardware stores and dress shops the sidewalk was covered with canopies awnings and verandas from the offices and stores creaky fans hung low and spun sluggishly they stopped in front of an ancient pharmacy and lee removed her sunglasses this was a hangout she explained there was a soda fountain in the back with a jukebox and racks of comic books you could buy an enormous cherry sundae for a nickel and it took hours to eat it it took even longer if the boys were here like something from a movie adam thought they stopped in front of a hardware store and for some reason examined the shovels and hoes and rakes leaning against the window lee looked at the battered double doors opened and held in place by bricks and thought of something from her childhood but she kept it to herself they crossed the street hand in hand and passed a group of old men whittling wood and chewing tobacco around the war memorial she nodded at a statue and informed him quietly that this was general clanton with both legs the courthouse was not open for business on saturdays they bought colas from a machine outside and sipped them in a gazebo on the front lawn she told the story of the most famous trial in the history of ford county the murder trial of carl lee hailey in he was a black man who shot and killed two rednecks whod raped his little daughter there were marches and protests by blacks on one side and klansmen on the other and the national guard actually camped out here around the courthouse to keep the peace lee had driven down from memphis one day to watch the spectacle he was acquitted by an allwhite jury adam remembered the trial hed been a junior at pepperdine and had followed it in the papers because it was happening in the town of his birth when she was a child entertainment was scarce and trials were always well attended sam had brought her and eddie here once to watch the trial of a man accused of killing a hunting dog he was found guilty and spent a year in prison the county was split the city folks were against the conviction for such a lowly crime while the country folks placed a higher value on good beagles sam had been particularly happy to see the man sent away lee wanted to show him something they walked around the courthouse to the rear door where two water fountains stood ten feet apart neither had been used in years one had been for whites the other for blacks she remembered the story of rosia alfie gatewood miss allie as she was known the first black person to drink from the white fountain and escape without injury not long after that the water lines were disconnected they found a table in a crowded cafe known simply as the tea shoppe on the west side of the square she told stories all of them pleasant and most of them funny as they ate blts and french fries she kept her sunglasses on and adam caught her watching the people they left clanton after lunch and after a leisurely walk back to the cemetery adam drove and lee pointed this way and that until they were on a county highway running through small neat farms with cows grazing the hillsides they passed occasional pockets of white trash dilapidated doublewide trailers with junk cars strewn about and they passed rundown shotgun houses still inhabited by poor blacks but the hilly countryside was pretty for the most part and the day was beautiful she pointed again and they turned onto a smaller paved road that snaked its way deeper into the sticks they finally stopped in front of an abandoned white frame house with weeds shooting from the porch and ivy swarming into the windows it was fifty yards from the road and the gravel drive leading to it was gullied and impassable the front lawn was overgrown with johnsongrass and cocklebur the mailbox was barely visible in the ditch beside the road the cayhall estate she mumbled and they sat for a long time in the car and looked at the sad little house what happened to it adam finally asked oh it was a good house didnt have much of a chance though the people were a disappointment she slowly removed her sunglasses and wiped her eyes i lived here for eighteen years and i couldnt wait to leave it why is it abandoned she took a deep breath and tried to arrange the story i think it was paid for many years ago but daddy mortgaged it to pay the lawyers for his last trial he of course never came home again and at some point the bank foreclosed there are eighty acres around it and everything was lost i havent been back here since the foreclosure i asked phelps to buy it and he said no i couldnt blame him i really didnt want to own it myself i heard later from some friends here that it was rented several times and i guess eventually abandoned i didnt know if the house was still standing what happened to the personal belongings the day before the foreclosure the bank allowed me to go in and box up anything i wanted i saved some things photo albums keepsakes yearbooks bibles some of mothers valuables theyre in storage in memphis id like to see them the furniture was not worth saving not a decent piece of anything my mother was dead my brother had just committed suicide and my father had just been sent to death row and i was not in the mood to keep a lot of memorabilia it was a horrible experience going through that dirty little house and trying to salvage objects that might one day bring a smile hell i wanted to burn everything almost did youre not serious of course i am after id been here for a couple of hours i decided to just burn the damned house and everything in it happens all the time right i found an old lantern with some kerosene in it and i sat it on the kitchen table and talked to it as i boxed stuff up it wouldve been easy why didnt you i dont know i wish id had the guts to do it but i remember worrying about the bank and the foreclosure and well arson is a crime isnt it i remember laughing at the idea of going off to prison where id be with sam thats why i didnt strike a match i was afraid id get in trouble and go to prison the car was hot now and adam opened his door i want to look around he said getting out they picked their way down the gravel drive stepping over gullies two feet wide they stopped at the front porch and looked at the rotting boards im not going in there she said firmly and pulled her hand away from his adam studied the decaying porch and decided against stepping on it he walked along the front of the house looking at the broken windows with vines disappearing inside he followed the drive around the house and lee tagged along the backyard was shaded by old oaks and maples and the ground was bare in places where the sun was kept out it stretched for an eighth of a mile down a slight incline until it stopped at a thicket the plot was surrounded by woods in the distance she took his hand again and they walked to a tree beside a wooden shed that for some reason was in much better condition than the house this was my tree she said looking up at the branches my own pecan tree her voice had a slight quiver its a great tree wonderful for climbing id spend hours here sitting in those branches swinging my feet and resting my chin on a limb in the spring and summer id climb about halfway up and no one could see me i had my own little world up there she suddenly closed her eyes and covered her mouth with a hand her shoulders trembled adam placed his arm around her and tried to think of something to say this is where it happened she said after a moment she bit her lip and fought back tears adam said nothing you asked me once about a story she said with clenched teeth as she wiped her cheeks with the backs of her hands the story of daddy killing a black man she nodded toward the house her hands shook so she stuck them in her pockets a minute passed as they stared at the house neither wanting to speak the only rear door opened onto a small square porch with a railing around it a delicate breeze ruffled the leaves above them and made the only sound she took a deep breath then said his name was joe lincoln and he lived down the road there with his family she nodded at the remnants of a dirt trail that ran along the edge of a field then disappeared into the woods he had about a dozen kids quince lincoln adam asked yeah howd you know about him sam mentioned his name the other day when we were talking about eddie he said quince and eddie were good friends when they were kids he didnt talk about quinces father did he no i didnt think so joe worked here on the farm for us and his family lived in a shotgun house that we also owned he was a good man with a big family and like most poor blacks back then they just barely survived i knew a couple of his kids but we werent friends like quince and eddie one day the boys were playing here in the backyard it was summertime and we werent in school they got into an argument over a small toy a confederate army soldier and eddie accused quince of stealing it typical boy stuff you know i think they were eight or nine years old daddy happened to walk by over there and eddie ran to him and told how quince had stolen the toy quince emphatically denied it both boys were really mad and on the verge of tears sam typically flew into a rage and cursed quince calling him all sorts of names like thieving little nigger and sorry little nigger bastard sam demanded the soldier and quince started crying he kept saying he didnt have it and eddie kept saying he did sam grabbed the boy shook him real hard and started slapping him on the butt sam was yelling and screaming and cursing and quince was crying and pleading they went around the yard a few times with sam shaking him and hitting him quince finally pulled free and ran home eddie ran into our house and daddy followed him inside a moment later sam stepped through the door there with a walking cane which he carefully laid on the porch he then sat on the steps and waited patiently he smoked a cigarette and watched the dirt road the lincoln house was not far away and sure enough within a few minutes joe came running out of the trees there with quince right behind him as he got close to the house he saw daddy waiting on him and he slowed to a walk daddy yelled over his shoulder eddie come here watch me whip this nigger she began walking very slowly to the house then stopped a few feet from the porch when joe was right about here he stopped and looked at sam he said something like quince says you hit him mr sam to which my father replied something like quince is a thieving little nigger joe you should teach your kids not to steal they began to argue and it was obvious there was going to be a fight sam suddenly jumped from the porch and threw the first punch they fell to the ground right about here and fought like cats joe was a few years younger and stronger but daddy was so mean and angry that the fight was pretty even they struck each other in the face and cursed and kicked like a couple of animals she stopped the narrative and looked around the yard then she pointed to the back door at some point eddie stepped onto the porch to watch it quince was standing a few feet away yelling at his father sam made a dash for the porch and grabbed the walking cane and the matter got out of hand he beat joe in the face and head until he fell to his knees and he poked him in the stomach and groin until he could barely move joe looked at quince and yelled for him to run get the shotgun quince took off sam stopped the beating and turned to eddie go get my shotgun he said eddie froze and daddy yelled at him again joe was on the ground on all fours trying to collect himself and just as he was about to stand sam beat him again and knocked him down eddie went inside and sam walked to the porch eddie returned in a matter of seconds with a shotgun and daddy made him go inside the door closed lee walked to the porch and sat on the edge of it she buried her face in her hands and cried for a long time adam stood a few feet away staring at the ground listening to the sobs when she finally looked at him her eyes were glazed her mascara was running her nose dripped she wiped her face with her hands then rubbed them on her jeans im sorry she whispered finish it please he said quickly she breathed deeply for a moment then wiped her eyes some more joe was just over there she said pointing to a spot in the grass not far from adam hed made it to his feet and he turned and saw daddy with the gun he glanced around in the direction of his house but there was no sign of quince and his gun he turned back to daddy who was standing right here on the edge of the porch then my dear sweet father slowly raised the gun hesitated for a second looked around to see if anyone was watching and pulled the trigger just like that joe fell hard and never moved you saw this happen didnt you yes i did where were you over there she nodded but didnt point in my pecan tree hidden from the world sam couldnt see you no one could see me i watched the whole thing she covered her eyes again and fought back tears adam eased onto the porch and sat beside her she cleared her throat and looked away he watched joe for a minute ready to shoot again if necessary but joe never moved he was quite dead there was some blood around his head on the grass and i could see it from the tree i remember digging my fingernails into the bark to keep from falling and i remember wanting to cry but being too scared i didnt want him to hear me quince appeared after a few minutes hed heard the shot and he was crying by the time i saw him just running like crazy and crying and when he saw his father on the ground he started screaming like any child wouldve done my father raised the gun again and for a second i knew he was about to shoot the boy but quince threw joes shotgun to the ground and ran to his father he was bawling and wailing he wore a lightcolored shirt and soon it was covered with blood sam eased to the side and picked up joes shotgun then he went inside with both guns she stood slowly and took several measured steps quince and joe were right about here she said marking the spot with her heel quince held his fathers head next to his stomach blood was everywhere and he made this strange moaning sound like the whimper of a dying animal she turned and looked at her tree and there i was sitting up there like a little bird crying too i hated my father so badly at that moment where was eddie inside the house in his room with the door locked she pointed to a window with broken panes and a shutter missing that was his room he told me later that he looked outside when he heard the shot and he saw quince clutching his father within minutes ruby lincoln came running up with a string of children behind her they all collapsed around quince and joe and god it was horrible they were screaming and weeping and yelling at joe to get up to please not die on them sam went inside and called an ambulance he also called one of his brothers albert and a couple of neighbors pretty soon there was a crowd in the backyard sam and his gang stood on the porch with their guns and watched the mourners who dragged the body under that tree over there she pointed to a large oak the ambulance arrived after an eternity and took the body away ruby and her children walked back to their house and my father and his buddies had a good laugh on the porch how long did you stay in the tree i dont know as soon as everybody was gone i climbed down and ran into the woods eddie and i had a favorite place down by a creek and i knew he would come looking for me he did he was scared and out of breath told me all about the shooting and i told him that id seen it he didnt believe me at first but i gave him the details we were both scared to death he reached in his pocket and pulled out something it was the little confederate soldier he and quince had fought over hed found it under his bed and so he decided on the spot that everything was his fault we swore each other to secrecy he promised he would never tell anyone that i had witnessed the killing and i promised i would never tell anyone that hed found the soldier he threw it in the creek did either of you ever tell she shook her head for a long time sam never knew you were in the tree adam asked nope i never told my mother eddie and i talked about it occasionally over the years and as time passed we just sort of buried it away when we returned to the house our parents were in the middle of a huge fight she was hysterical and he was wildeyed and crazy i think hed hit her a few times she grabbed us and told us to get in the car as we were backing out of the driveway the sheriff pulled up we drove around for a while mother in the front seat and eddie and i in the back both of us too scared to talk she didnt know what to say we assumed he would be taken to jail but when we parked in the driveway he was sitting on the front porch as if nothing had happened what did the sheriff do nothing really he and sam talked for a bit sam showed him joes shotgun and explained how it was a simple matter of selfdefense just another dead nigger he wasnt arrested no adam this was mississippi in the early fifties im sure the sheriff had a good laugh about it patted sam on the back and told him to be a good boy and then left he even allowed sam to keep joes shotgun thats incredible we were hoping hed go to jail for a few years what did the lincolns do what could they do who would listen to them sam forbade eddie from seeing quince and to make sure the boys didnt get together he evicted them from their house good god he gave them one week to get out and the sheriff arrived to fulfill his sworn duties by forcing them out of the house the eviction was legal and proper sam assured mother it was the only time i thought she might leave him i wish she had did eddie ever see quince years later when eddie started driving he started looking for the lincolns they had moved to a small community on the other side of clanton and eddie found them there he apologized and said he was sorry a hundred times but they were never friends again ruby asked him to leave he told me they lived in a rundown shack with no electricity she walked to her pecan tree and sat against its trunk adam followed and leaned against it he looked down at her and thought of all the years shed been carrying this burden and he thought of his father of his anguish and torment of the indelible scars hed bome to his death adam now had the first clue to his fathers destruction and he wondered if the pieces might someday fit together he thought of sam and as he glanced at the porch he could see a younger man with a gun and hatred in his face lee was sobbing quietly what did sam do afterward she struggled to control herself the house was so quiet for a week maybe a month i dont know but it seemed like years before anyone spoke over dinner eddie stayed in his room with the door locked i would hear him crying at night and he told me again and again how much he hated his father he wanted him dead he wanted to run away from home he blamed himself for everything mother became concerned and she spent a lot of time with him as for me they thought i was off playing in the woods when it happened shortly after phelps and i married i secretly began seeing a psychiatrist i tried to work it out in therapy and i wanted eddie to do the same but he wouldnt listen the last time i talked to eddie before he died he mentioned the killing he never got over it and you got over it i didnt say that therapy helped but i still wonder what wouldve happened if i had screamed at daddy before he pulled the trigger would he have killed joe with his daughter watching i dont think so come on lee that was forty years ago you cant blame yourself eddie blamed me and he blamed himself and we blamed each other until we were grown we were children when it happened and we couldnt run to our parents we were helpless adam could think of a hundred questions about the killing of joe lincoln the subject was not likely to be raised again with lee and he wanted to know everything that happened every small detail where was joe buried what happened to his shotgun was the shooting reported in the local paper was the case presented to a grand jury did sam ever mention it to his children where was her mother during the fight did she hear the argument and the gunshot what happened to joes family did they still live in ford county lets burn it adam she said strongly wiping her face and glaring at him youre not serious yes i am lets burn the whole damned place the house the shed this tree the grass and weeds it wont take much just a couple of matches here and there come on no lee come on adam bent over gently and took her by the arm lets go lee ive heard enough for one day she didnt resist she too had had enough for one day he helped her through the weeds around the house over the ruins of the driveway and back to the car they left the cayhall estate without a word the road turned to gravel then stopped at the intersection of a highway lee pointed to the left then closed her eyes as if trying to nap they bypassed clanton and stopped at a country store near holly springs lee said she needed a cola and insisted on getting it herself she returned to the car with a sixpack of beer and offered a bottle to adam whats this he asked just a couple she said my nerves are shot dont let me drink more than two okay only two i dont think you should lee im okay she insisted with a frown and took a drink adam declined and sped away from the store she drained two bottles in fifteen minutes then went to sleep adam placed the sack in the backseat and concentrated on the road he had a sudden desire to leave mississippi and longed for the lights of memphis exactly one week earlier he had awakened with a fierce headache and a fragile stomach and had been forced to face the greasy bacon and oily eggs of irene lettner and in the past seven days hed been to the courtroom of judge slattery and to chicago greenville ford county and parchman hed met the governor and the attorney general he hadnt talked to his client in six days to hell with his client adam had sat on the patio watching the river traffic and sipping decaffeinated coffee until am he swatted mosquitoes and struggled with the vivid images of quince lincoln grasping at his fathers body while sam cayhall stood on the porch and admired his handiwork he could hear the muted laughter of sam and his buddies on the narrow porch as ruby lincoln and her children fell around the corpse and eventually dragged it across the yard to the shade of a tree he could see sam on the front lawn with both shotguns explaining to the sheriff exactly how the crazy nigger was about to kill him and how he acted reasonably and in selfdefense the sheriff was quick to see sams point of course he could hear the whispers of the tormented children eddie and lee as they blamed themselves and struggled with the horror of sams deed and he cursed a society so willing to ignore violence against a despised class hed slept fitfully and at one point had sat on the edge of his bed and declared to himself that sam could find another lawyer that the death penalty might in fact be appropriate for some people notably his grandfather and that he would return to chicago immediately and change his name again but that dream passed and when he awoke for the last time the sunlight filtered through the blinds and cast neat lines across his bed he contemplated the ceiling and crown molding along the walls for half an hour as he remembered the trip to clanton today he hoped would be a late sunday with a thick newspaper and strong coffee he would go to the office later in the afternoon his client had seventeen days lee had finished a third beer after they arrived at the condo then shed gone to bed adam had watched her carefully halfexpecting a wild binge or sudden slide into an alcoholic stupor but shed been very quiet and composed and he heard nothing from her during the night he finished his shower didnt shave and walked to the kitchen where the syrupy remains of the first pot of coffee awaited him lee had been up for some time he called her name then walked to her bedroom he quickly checked the patio then roamed through the condo she was not there the sunday paper was stacked neatly on the coffee table in the den he fixed fresh coffee and toast and took his breakfast on the patio it was almost ninethirty and thankfully the sky was cloudy and the temperature was not suffocating it would be a good sunday for office work he read the paper starting with the front section perhaps shed run to the store or something maybe shed gone to church they hadnt yet reached the point of leaving notes for each other but thered been no talk of lee going anywhere this morning hed eaten one piece of toast with strawberry jam when his appetite suddenly vanished the front page of the metro section carried another story on sam cayhall with the same picture from ten years ago it was a chatty little summary of the past weeks developments complete with a chronological chart giving the important dates in the history of the case a cute question mark was left dangling by the date of august would there be an execution then evidently todd marks had been given unlimited column inches by the editors because the story contained almost nothing new the disturbing part was a few quotes from a law professor at ole miss an expert in constitutional matters whod worked on many death penalty cases the learned professor was generous with his opinions and his bottom line was that sams goose was pretty much cooked hed studied the file at length had followed it for many years in fact and was of the opinion that there was basically nothing left for sam to do he explained that in many death penalty cases miracles can sometimes be performed at the last moment because usually the inmate has suffered from mediocre legal representation even during his appeals in those cases experts such as himself can often pull rabbits out of hats because theyre just so damned brilliant and thus able to create issues ignored by lesser legal minds but regrettably sams case was different because he had been competently represented by some very fine lawyers from chicago sams appeals had been handled skillfully and now the appeals had run their course the professor evidently a gambling man gave five to one odds the execution would take place on august and for all of this the opinions and the odds he got his picture in the paper adam was suddenly nervous hed read dozens of death cases in which lawyers at the last minute grabbed ropes theyd never grabbed before and convinced judges to listen to new arguments the lore of capital litigation was full of stories about latent legal issues undiscovered and untapped until a different lawyer with a fresh eye entered the arena and captured a stay but the law professor was right sam had been lucky though sam despised the lawyers at kravitz bane they had provided superb representation now there was nothing left but a bunch of desperate motions the gangplank appeals as they were known he flung the paper on the wooden deck and went inside for more coffee the sliding door beeped a new sound from a new security system installed last friday after the old one malfunctioned and some keys mysteriously disappeared there was no evidence of a breakin security was tight at the complex and willis didnt really know how many sets of keys he kept for each unit the memphis police decided the sliding door had been left unlocked and slipped open somehow adam and lee had not worried about it he inadvertently struck a glass tumbler next to the sink and it shattered as it hit the floor bits of glass bounced around his bare feet and he tiptoed gingerly to the pantry to get a broom and dustpan he carefully swept the debris without bloodshed into a neat pile and dumped it into a wastebasket under the sink something caught his attention he slowly reached into the black plastic garbage bag and felt his way through warm coffee grounds and broken glass until he found a bottle and pulled it out it was an empty pint of vodka he raked the coffee grounds from it and studied the label the trash basket was small and normally emptied every other day sometimes once a day it was now halffilled the bottle had not been there long he opened the refrigerator and looked for the remaining three bottles of beer from yesterdays sixpack shed had two en route back to memphis then one at the condo he did not remember where they had been stored but they were not in the refrigerator nor in the trash in the kitchen den bathrooms or bedrooms the more he searched the more determined he became to find the bottles he inspected the pantry the broom closet the linen closet the kitchen cabinets he went through her closets and drawers and felt like a thief and a cheat but pressed on because he was scared they were under her bed empty of course and carefully hidden in an old nike shoe box three empty bottles of heineken stacked neatly together as if they were to be shipped somewhere as a gift he sat on the floor and examined them they were fresh with a few drops still rolling around the bottoms he guessed her weight to be around a hundred and thirty pounds and her height at five feet six or seven she was slender but not too thin her body couldnt handle much booze shed gone to bed early around nine then at some point sneaked around the condo fetching beer and vodka adam leaned against the wall his mind racing wildly shed given much thought to the hiding of the green bottles but she knew shed get caught she had to know adam would look for them later why hadnt she been more careful with the empty pint bottle why was it hidden in the trash and the beer bottles tucked away under her bed then he realized he was attempting to track a rational mind instead of a drunk one he closed his eyes and tapped the back of his head against the wall hed taken her to ford county where they looked at graves and relived a nightmare and where shed worn sunglasses to hide her face for two weeks now hed been demanding family secrets and yesterday hed been kicked in the face with a few he needed to know hed told himself he wasnt certain why but he just felt as if he had to know the reasons his family was strange and violent and hateful and now it occurred to him for the first time perhaps this was much more complicated than the casual telling of family stories perhaps this was painful for everyone involved maybe his selfish interest in closeted skeletons wasnt as important as lees stability he slid the shoe box back to its original position then threw the vodka bottle in the wastebasket for the second time he dressed quickly and left the building he asked the gate man about lee according to a sheet of paper on his clipboard shed left almost two hours ago at eightten it was customary for lawyers at kravitz bane in chicago to spend sunday at the office but evidently the practice was frowned upon in memphis adam had the place entirely to himself he locked his door anyway and was soon lost in the murky legal world of federal habeas corpus practice his concentration though was difficult and only lasted for short intervals he worried about lee and he hated sam it would be difficult to look at him again probably tomorrow through the metal screen at the row he was frail and bleached and wrinkled and by all rights entitled to a little sympathy from someone their last discussion had been about eddie and when it ended sam had asked him to leave the family stuff outside the row he had enough on his mind at the moment it wasnt fair to confront a condemned man with his ancient sins adam was not a biographer nor a genealogist he hadnt been trained in sociology or psychiatry and frankly he was at the moment quite weary of further expeditions into the cryptic history of the cayhall family he was simply a lawyer a rather green one but an advocate nonetheless whose client needed him it was time to practice law and forget the folklore at eleventhirty he dialed lees number and listened to the phone ring he left a message on the recorder telling her where he was and would she please call he called again at one and at two no answer he was preparing an appeal when the phone rang instead of lees pleasant voice he heard the clipped words of the honorable f flynn slattery yes mr hall judge slattery here ive carefully considered this matter and im denying all relief including your request for a stay of execution he said almost with a trace of cheer lots of reasons but we wont go into them my clerk will fax you my opinion right now so youll have it in a moment yes sir adam said youll need to appeal as soon as possible you know i suggest you do so in the morning im working on the appeal now your honor in fact its almost finished good so you were expecting this yes sir i started working on the appeal right after i left your office on tuesday it was tempting to take a shot or two at slattery he was after all two hundred miles away but he was also after all a federal judge adam was very aware that one day very soon he might need his honor again good day mr hall and with that slattery hung up adam walked around the table a dozen times then watched the light rain on the mall below he swore quietly about federal judges in general and slattery in particular then returned to his computer where he stared at the screen and waited for inspiration he typed and read researched and printed looked from his windows and dreamed of miracles until it was dark he had killed several hours with footless piddling and one reason he worked until eight oclock was to give lee plenty of time to return to the condo there was no sign of her the security guard said she had not returned there was no message on the recorder other than his he dined on microwave popcorn and watched two movies on video the idea of calling phelps booth was so repugnant he nearly shuddered at the thought he thought of sleeping on the sofa in the den so he would hear her if she came home but after the last movie he retired to his room upstairs and closed the door the explanation for yesterdays disappearance was slow in coming but sounded plausible by the time she finished with it shed been at the hospital all day she said as she moved slowly around the kitchen with one of her kids from the auburn house poor little girl was only thirteen baby number one but of course there would be others and she had gone into labor a month early her mother was in jail and her aunt was off selling drugs and she had no one else to turn to leed held her hand throughout the complicated delivery the girl was fine and the baby was okay and now there was another unwanted little child in the memphis ghettos lees voice was scratchy and her eyes were puffy and red she said shed returned a few minutes after one and she wouldve called earlier but they were in the labor room for six hours and the delivery room for two st peters charity hospital is a zoo especially the maternity wing and well she just couldnt get to a phone adam sat in his pajamas at the table sipping coffee and studying the paper as she talked he hadnt asked for the explanation he tried his best to act unconcerned about her she insisted on cooking breakfast scrambled eggs and canned biscuits and she was doing a good job of busying herself in the kitchen as she talked and avoided eye contact whats the kids name he asked seriously as if he was deeply concerned with lees story uh natasha natasha perkins and shes only thirteen yes her mother is twentynine can you believe it a twentynineyearold grandmother adam shook his head in disbelief he happened to be looking at the small section of the memphis press where it registered the countys vital records marriage licenses divorce petitions births arrests deaths he scanned the list of yesterdays births as if he were checking scores and found no record of a new mother named natasha perkins lee finished her struggle with the canned biscuits she placed them on a small platter along with the eggs and served them then sat at the other end of the table as far away from adam as possible bon appetit she said with a forced smile her cooking was already a rich source of humor adam smiled as if everything was fine they needed humor at this moment but wit failed them cubs lost again he said taking a bite of eggs and glancing at the folded newspaper the cubs always lose dont they not always you follow baseball i hate baseball phelps turned me against every sport known to man adam grinned and read the paper they ate without talking for a few minutes and the silence grew heavy lee punched the remote and the television on the counter came on and created noise they were both suddenly interested in the weather which was again hot and dry she played with her food nibbling on a halfbaked biscuit and pushing the eggs around her plate adam suspected her stomach was feeble at the moment he finished quickly and took his plate to the kitchen sink he sat again at the table to finish the paper she was staring at the television anything to keep her eyes away from her nephew ill probably go see sam today he said i havent been in a week her gaze fell to a spot somewhere in the middle of the table i wish we hadnt gone to clanton saturday she said i know it was not a good idea im sorry lee i insisted on going and it was not a good idea ive insisted on a lot of things and maybe ive been wrong its not fair i know its not fair i realize now that its not a simple matter of learning family history its not fair to him adam its almost cruel to confront him with these things when he has only two weeks to live youre right and its wrong to make you relive them ill be fine she said this as if she certainly wasnt fine now but there might be a bit of hope for the future im sorry lee im truly sorry its okay what will you and sam do today talk primarily the local federal court ruled against us yesterday and so well appeal this morning sam likes to talk legal strategies tell him im thinking about him i will she pushed her plate away and cuddled her cup with both hands and ask him if he wants me to come see him do you really want to adam asked unable to conceal his surprise something tells me i should i havent seen him in many years ill ask him and dont mention joe lincoln okay adam i never told daddy what i saw you and sam never mentioned the killing never it became well known in the community eddie and i grew up with it and carried it as a burden but to be honest adam it was not a big deal to the neighbors my father killed a black man it was and it was mississippi it was never discussed in our house so sam makes it to his grave without being confronted with the killing what do you accomplish by confronting him it was forty years ago i dont know maybe hell say he was sorry to you he apologizes to you and that makes everything okay come on adam youre young and you dont understand leave it alone dont hurt the old man anymore right now youre the only bright spot in his pathetic life okay okay you have no right to ambush him with the story of joe lincoln youre right i wont i promise she stared at him with bloodshot eyes until he looked at the television then she quickly excused herself and disappeared through the den adam heard the bathroom door close and lock he eased across the carpet and stood in the hallway listening as she heaved and vomited the toilet flushed and he ran upstairs to his room to shower and change by am adam had perfected the appeal to the fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans judge slattery had already faxed a copy of his order to the clerk of the fifth circuit and adam faxed his appeal shortly after arriving at the office he fedexed the original by overnight he also had his first conversation with the death clerk a fulltime employee of the united states supreme court who does nothing but monitor the final appeals of all death row inmates the death clerk often works around the clock as executions go down to the wire e garner goodman had briefed adam on the machinations of the death clerk and his office and it was with some reluctance that adam placed the first call the clerks name was richard olander a rather efficient sort who sounded quite tired early monday morning weve been expecting this he said to adam as if the damned thing shouldve been filed some time ago he asked adam if this was his first execution afraid so adam said and i hope its my last well youve certainly picked a loser mr olander said then explained in tedious detail exactly how the court expected the final appeals to be handled every filing from this point forward until the end regardless of where its filed or what its about must also simultaneously be filed with his office he stated flatly as if reading from a textbook in fact he would immediately fax to adam a copy of the courts rules all of which had to be meticulously followed up until the very end his office was on call around the clock he repeated more than once and it was essential that they receive copies of everything that was of course if adam wanted his client to have a fair hearing with the court if adam didnt care then well just follow the rules haphazardly and his client would pay for it adam promised to follow the rules the supreme court had become increasingly weary of the endless claims in death cases and wanted to have all motions and appeals in hand to expedite matters adams appeal to the fifth circuit would be scrutinized by the justices and their clerks long before the court actually received the case from new orleans the same would be true for all his eleventhhour filings the court would then be able to grant immediate relief or deny it quickly so efficient and speedy was the death clerk that the court had recently been embarrassed by denying an appeal before it was actually filed then mr olander explained that his office had a checklist of every conceivable last minute appeal and motion and he and his quite able staff monitored each case to see if all possible filings took place and if a lawyer somewhere missed a potential issue then they would actually notify the lawyer that he should pursue the forgotten claim did adam desire a copy of their checklist no adam explained that he already had a copy e garner goodman had written the book on gangplank appeals very well said mr olander mr cayhall had sixteen days and of course a lot can happen in sixteen days but mr cayhall had been ably represented in his humble opinion and the matter had been thoroughly litigated he would be surprised he ventured if there were additional delays thanks for nothing adam thought mr olander and his staff were watching a case in texas very closely he explained the execution was set for a day before sams but in his opinion there was a likely chance for a stay florida had one scheduled for two days after mr cayhalls georgia had two set for a week later but well who knows he or someone on his staff would be available at all hours and he himself would personally be by the phone for the twelvehour period leading up to the execution just call anytime he said and ended the conversation with a terse promise to make things as easy as possible for adam and his client adam slammed the phone down and stalked around his office his door was locked as usual and the hallway was busy with eager monday morning gossip his face had been in the paper again yesterday and he did not want to be seen he called the auburn house and asked for lee booth but she was not in he called her condo and there was no answer he called parchman and told the officer at the front gate to expect him around one he went to his computer and found one of his current projects a condensed chronological history of sams case the lakehead county jury convicted sam on february and two days later handed him a verdict of death he appealed directly to the mississippi supreme court claiming all sorts of grievances with the trial and the prosecution but taking particular exception to the fact that the trial occurred almost fourteen years after the bombing his lawyer benjamin keyes argued vehemently that sam was denied a speedy trial and that he was subjected to double jeopardy being tried three times for the same crime keyes presented a very strong argument the mississippi supreme court was bitterly divided over these issues and on july handed down a split decision affirming sams conviction five justices voted to affirm three to reverse and one abstained keyes then filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court which in effect asked that court to review sams case since the supreme court grants cent on such a small number of cases it was somewhat of a surprise when on march the court agreed to review sams conviction the us supreme court split almost as badly as mississippis on the issue of double jeopardy but nonetheless reached the same conclusion sams first two juries had been hopelessly deadlocked hung up by the shenanigans of clovis brazelton and thus sam was not protected by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment he was not acquitted by either of the first two juries each had been unable to reach a verdict so reprosecution was quite constitutional on september the us supreme court ruled six to three that sams conviction should stand keyes immediately filed some motions requesting a rehearing but to no avail sam had hired keyes to represent him during the trial and on appeal to the mississippi supreme court if necessary by the time the us supreme court affirmed the conviction keyes was working without getting paid his contract for legal representation had expired and he wrote sam a long letter and explained that it was now time for sam to make other arrangements sam understood this keyes also wrote a letter to an aclu lawyerfriend of his in washington who in turn wrote a letter to his pal e garner goodman at kravitz bane in chicago the letter landed on goodmans desk at precisely the right moment sam was running out of time and was desperate goodman was looking for a pro bono project they swapped letters and on december wallace tyner a partner in the whitecollar criminal defense section of kravitz bane filed a petition seeking postconviction relief with the mississippi supreme court tyner alleged many errors in sams trial including the admission into evidence of the gory pictures of the bodies of josh and john kramer he attacked the selection of the jury and claimed that mcallister systematically picked blacks over whites he claimed a fair trial was not possible because the social environment was far different in than in he maintained the venue selected by the trial judge was unfair he raised yet again the issues of double jeopardy and speedy trial in all wallace tyner and garner goodman raised eight separate issues in the petition they did not however maintain that sam had suffered because of ineffective trial counsel the primary claim of all death row inmates they had wanted to but sam wouldnt allow it he initially refused to sign the petition because it attacked benjamin keyes a lawyer sam was fond of on june the mississippi supreme court denied all of the postconviction relief requested tyner again appealed to the us supreme court but cert was denied he then filed sams first petition for writ of habeas corpus and request for a stay of execution in federal court in mississippi typically the petition was quite thick and contained every issue already raised in state court two years later on may the district court denied all relief and tyner appealed to the fifth circuit in new orleans which in due course affirmed the lower courts denial on march tyner filed a petition for a rehearing with the fifth circuit which was also denied on september tyner and goodman again trekked to the supreme court and asked for cert a week later sam wrote the first of many letters to goodman and tyner threatening to fire them the us supreme court granted sam his last stay on may pursuant to a grant of certiorari being granted in a florida case the court had decided to hear tyner argued successfully that the florida case raised similar issues and the supreme court granted stays in several dozen death cases around the country nothing was filed in sams case while the supreme court delayed and debated the florida case sam however had begun his own efforts to rid himself of kravitz bane he filed a few clumsy motions himself all of which were quickly denied he did succeed however in obtaining an order from the fifth circuit which effectively terminated the pro bono services of his lawyers on june the fifth circuit allowed him to represent himself and garner goodman closed the file on sam cayhall it wasnt closed for long on july the supreme court vacated sams stay on july the fifth circuit vacated sams stay and on the same day the mississippi supreme court set his execution date for august four weeks away after nine years of appellate warfare sam now had sixteen days to live the row was quiet and still as another day dragged itself toward noon the diverse collection of fans buzzed and rattled in the tiny cells trying valiantly to push around air that grew stickier by the moment the early television news had been filled with excited reports that sam cayhall had lost his latest legal battle slatterys decision was trumpeted around the state as if it were indeed the final nail in the coffin a jackson station continued its countdown only sixteen days to go day sixteen it said in bold letters under the same old photo of sam brighteyed reporters with heavy makeup and no knowledge of the law spouted at the cameras with fearless predictions according to our sources sam cayhalls legal options are virtually gone many people believe that his execution will take place as scheduled on august then on to sports and weather there was much less talk on the row less yelling back and forth fewer kites being floated along the cells there was about to be an execution sergeant packer smiled to himself as he shuffled along tier a the bitching and griping that was so much a part of his daily work had almost disappeared now the inmates were concerned with appeals and their lawyers the most common request in the past two weeks had been to use the phone to call a lawyer packer did not look forward to another execution but he did enjoy the quiet and he knew it was only temporary if sam got a stay tomorrow the noise would increase immediately he stopped in front of sams cell hour out sam sam was sitting on his bed typing and smoking as usual what time is it he asked placing the typewriter to his side and standing eleven sam turned his back to packer and stuck his wrists through the opening in his door packer carefully cuffed them together you out by yourself he asked sam turned with his hands behind him no henshaw wants to come out too ill get him packer said nodding at sam then nodding at the end of the tier the door opened and sam slowly followed him past the other cells each inmate was leaning on the bars with hands and arms dangling through each watching sam closely as he walked by they made their way through more bars and more hallways and packer unlocked an unpainted metal door it opened to the outside and the sunlight burst through sam hated this part of his hour out he stepped onto the grass and closed his eyes tightly as packer uncuffed him then opened them slowly as they focused and adjusted to the painful glow of the sun packer disappeared inside without a word and sam stood in the same spot for a full minute as lights flashed and his head pounded the heat didnt bother him because he lived with it but the sunlight hit like lasers and caused a severe headache each time he was allowed to venture from the dungeon he could easily afford a pair of cheap sunglasses similar to packers but of course that would be too sensible sunglasses were not on the approved list of items an inmate could own he walked unsteadily through the clipped grass looking through the fence to the cotton fields beyond the recreation yard was nothing more than a fencedin plot of dirt and grass with two wooden benches and a basketball hoop for the africans it was known to guards and prisoners alike as the bullpen sam had stepped it off carefully a thousand times and had compared his measurements with those of other inmates the yard was fiftyone feet long and thirtysix feet wide the fence was ten feet tall and crowned with another eighteen inches of razor wire beyond the fence was a stretch of grass which ran a hundred feet or so to the main fence which was watched by the guards in the towers sam walked in a straight line next to the fence and when it stopped he turned ninety degrees and continued his little routine counting every step along the way fiftyone feet by thirtysix his cell was six by nine the law library the twig was eighteen by fifteen his side of the visitors room was six by thirty hed been told the chamber room was fifteen by twelve and the chamber itself was a mere cube barely four feet wide during the first year of his confinement he had jogged around the edges of the yard trying to sweat and give his heart a workout hed also tossed shots at the basketball hoop but quit when he went days without making one he had eventually quit exercising and for years had used this hour to do nothing but enjoy the freedom from his cell at one time hed fallen into the habit of standing at the fence and staring past the fields to the trees where he imagined all sorts of things freedom highways fishing food sex occasionally he could almost picture his little farm in ford county not far over there between two small patches of woods he would dream of brazil or argentina or some other laidback hiding place where he should be living with a new name and then hed stopped the dreaming hed stopped gazing through the fence as if a miracle would take him away he walked and smoked almost always by himself his most rigorous activity was a game of checkers the door opened again and hank henshaw walked through it packer uncuffed him as he squinted furiously and looked at the ground he rubbed his wrists as soon as they were free then stretched his back and legs packer walked to one of the benches and placed a worn cardboard box on it the two inmates watched packer until he left the yard then they walked to the bench and assumed their positions astraddle the wooden plank with the box between them sam carefully placed the checkerboard on the bench as henshaw counted the checkers my turn to be red sam said you were red last time henshaw said staring at him i was black last time no i was black last time its my turn to be red look hank ive got sixteen days and if i want to be red then i get to be red henshaw shrugged and conceded they arranged their checkers meticulously i guess you get the first move henshaw said of course sam slid a checker to a vacant square and the match was on the midday sun baked the ground around them and within minutes their red jumpsuits stuck to their backs they both wore rubber shower shoes with no socks hank henshaw was fortyone now a resident of the row for seven years but not expected to ever see the gas chamber two crucial errors had been made at trial and henshaw had a decent chance of getting reversed and freed from the row bad news yesterday he said as sam pondered the next move yes things are lookin pretty grim wouldnt you say yeah what does your lawyer say neither of them looked up from the checkerboard he says we have a fightin chance what the hell does that mean henshaw asked as he made a move i think it means theyre gonna gas me but ill go down swinging does the kid know what hes doing oh yeah hes sharp runs in the blood you know but hes awfully young hes a smart kid great education number two in his law class at michigan you know editor of the law review what does that mean means hes brilliant hell think of something are you serious sam do you think its gonna happen sam suddenly jumped two black checkers and henshaw cursed youre pitiful sam said with a grin when was the last time you beat me two weeks ago you liar you havent beat me in three years henshaw made a tentative move and sam jumped him again five minutes later the game was over with sam victorious again they cleared the board and started over at noon packer and another guard appeared with handcuffs and the fun was over they were led to their cells where lunch was in progress beans peas mashed potatoes and several slices of dry toast sam ate less than a third of the bland food on his plate and waited patiently for a guard to come after him he held a pair of clean boxer shorts and a bar of soap it was time to bathe the guard arrived and led sam to a small shower at the end of the tier by court order death row inmates were allowed five quick showers a week whether they needed them or not as the guards liked to say sam showered quickly washing his hair twice with the soap and rinsing himself in the warm water the shower itself was clean enough but used by all fourteen inmates on the tier thus the rubber shower shoes remained on the feet after five minutes the water stopped and sam dripped for a few more minutes as he stared at the moldy tiled walls there were some things about the row that he would not miss twenty minutes later he was loaded into a prison van and driven a half a mile to the law library adam was waiting inside he removed his coat and rolled up his sleeves as the guards uncuffed sam and left the room they greeted each other and shook hands sam quickly took a seat and lit a cigarette whereve you been he asked busy adam said sitting across the table i had an unexpected trip to chicago last wednesday and thursday anything to do with me you could say that goodman wanted to review the case and there were a couple of other matters so goodmans still involved goodman is my boss right now sam i have to report to him if i want to keep my job i know you hate him but hes very concerned about you and your case believe it or not he does not want to see you gassed i dont hate him anymore why the change of heart i dont know when you get this close to death you do a lot of thinking adam was anxious to hear more but sam let it pass adam watched him smoke and tried not to think about joe lincoln he tried not to think of sams father being beaten in a drunken brawl at a funeral and he tried to ignore all the other miserable stories lee had told him in ford county he tried to block these things from his mind but he couldnt he had promised her he would not mention any more nightmares from the past i guess youve heard about our latest defeat he said as he pulled papers from his briefcase it didnt take long did it no a rather quick loss but ive already appealed to the fifth circuit ive never won in the fifth circuit i know but we cant select our review court atthis point what can we do at this point several things i bumped into the governor last tuesday after a meeting with the federal judge he wanted to talk in private he gave me his private phone numbers and invited me to call and talk about the case said he had doubts about the extent of your guilt sam glared at him doubts hes the only reason im here he cant wait to see me executed youre probably right but you promised not to talk to him you signed an agreement with me expressly prohibiting any contact with that fool relax sam he grabbed me outside the judges office im surprised he didnt call a press conference to talk about it i threatened him okay i made him promise not to talk then youre the first person in history to silence that bastard hes open to the idea of clemency he told you this yes why i dont believe it i dont know why sam and i dont really care but how can it hurt whats the danger in requesting a clemency hearing so he gets his picture in the paper so the tv cameras chase him around some more if theres a chance hell listen then why should you care if he gets some mileage from it no the answer is no i will not authorize you to request a clemency hearing hell no a thousand times no i know him adam hes trying to suck you into his game plan its all a sham a show for the public hell grieve over this until the very end milking it for all he can hell get more attention than i will and its my execution so whats the harm sam slapped the table with the palm of his hand because it wont do any good adam he will not change his mind adam scribbled something on a legal pad and let a moment pass sam eased back in his seat and lit another cigarette his hair was still wet and he combed it back with his fingernails adam placed his pen on the table and looked at his client what do you want to do sam quit throw in the towel you think you know so damned much law tell me what you want to do well ive been thinking about it im sure you have the lawsuit on its way to the fifth circuit has merit but it doesnt look promising theres not much left as i see things except benjamin keyes right except keyes he did a fine job for me at trial and on appeal and he was almost a friend i hate to go after him its standard in death cases sam you always go after the trial lawyer and claim ineffective assistance of counsel goodman told me he wanted to do it but you refused it shouldve been done years ago hes right about that he begged me to do it but i said no i guess it was a mistake adam was on the edge of his seat taking notes ive studied the record and i think keyes made a mistake when he didnt put you on the stand to testify i wanted to talk to the jury you know i think ive already told you that after dogan testified i thought it was essential for me to explain to the jury that i did in fact plant the bomb but there was no intent to kill anyone thats the truth adam i didnt intend to kill anyone you wanted to testify but your lawyer said no sam smiled and looked at the floor is that what you want me to say yes i dont have much of a choice do i no okay thats the way it happened i wanted to testify butmy lawyer wouldnt allow it ill file first thing in the morning its too late isnt it well its certainly late and this issue shouldve been raised a long time ago but whats there to lose will you call keyes and tell him if i have time im really not concerned with his feelings at the moment then neither am i to hell with him who else can we attack the list is rather short sam jumped to his feet and began pacing along the table in measured steps the room was eighteen feet long he walked around the table behind adam and along each of the four walls counting as he went he stopped and leaned against a shelf of books adam finished some notes and watched him carefully lee wants to know if she can come visit he said sam stared at him then slowly returned to his seat across the table she wants to i think so ill have to think about it well hurry hows she doing pretty fair i guess she sends her love and prayers and she thinks about you a lot these days do people in memphis know shes my daughter i dont think so it hasnt been in the papers yet i hope they keep it quiet she and i went to clanton last saturday sam looked at him sadly then gazed at the ceiling what did you see he asked lots of things she showed me my grandmothers grave and the plot with the other cayhalls she didnt want to be buried with the cayhalls did lee tell you that yes lee asked me where you wanted to be buried i havent decided yet sure just let me know when you make the decision we walked through the town and she showed me the house we lived in we went to the square and sat in the gazebo on the courthouse lawn the town was very busy people were packed around the square we used to watch fireworks in the cemetery lee told me all about it we ate lunch at the tea shoppe and took a drive in the country she took me to her childhood home its still there yeah its abandoned the house is rundown and the weeds have taken over we walked around the place she told me lots of stories of her childhood talked a lot about eddie does she have fond memories not really sam crossed his arms and looked at the table a minute passed without a word finally sam asked did she tell you about eddies little african friend quince lincoln adam nodded slowly and their eyes locked together yes she did and about his father joe she told me the story do you believe her i do should i its true its all true i thought so how did you feel when she told you the story i mean how did you react to it i hated your guts and how do you feel now different sam slowly rose from his seat and walked to the end of the table where he stopped and stood with his back to adam that was forty years ago he mumbled barely audible i didnt come here to talk about it adam said already feeling guilty sam turned and leaned on the same bookshelf he crossed his arms and stared at the wall ive wished a thousand times it hadnt happened i promised lee i wouldnt bring it up sam im sorry joe lincoln was a good man ive often wondered what happened to ruby and quince and the rest of the kids forget it sam lets talk about something else i hope theyre happy when im dead as adam drove past the security station at the main gate the guard waved as if by now he was a regular customer he waved back as he slowed and pushed a button to release his trunk no paperwork was required for visitors to leave only a quick look in the trunk to make sure no prisoners had caught a ride he turned onto the highway heading south away from memphis and calculated that this was his fifth visit to parchman five visits in two weeks he had a suspicion that the place would be his second home for the next sixteen days what a rotten thought he was not in the mood to deal with lee tonight he felt some responsibility for her relapse into alcohol but by her own admission this had been a way of life for many years she was an alcoholic and if she chose to drink there was nothing he could do to stop her he would be there tomorrow night to make coffee and conversation tonight he needed a break it was midafternoon the heat emanated from the asphalt highway the fields were dusty and dry the farm implements languid and slow the traffic light and sluggish adam pulled to the shoulder and raised the convertible top he stopped at a chinese grocery in ruleville and bought a can of iced tea then sped along a lonely highway in the general direction of greenville he had an errand to run probably an unpleasant one but something he felt obligated to do he hoped he had the courage to go through with it he stayed on the back roads the small paved county routes and zipped almost aimlessly across the delta he got lost twice but worked himself out of it he arrived in greenville a few minutes before five and cruised the downtown area in search of his target he passed kramer park twice he found the synagogue across the street from the first baptist church he parked at the end of main street at the river where a levee guarded the city he straightened his tie and walked three blocks along washington street to an old brick building with the sign kramer wholesale hanging from a veranda above the sidewalk in front of it the heavy glass door opened to the inside and the ancient wooden floors squeaked as he walked on them the front part of the building had been preserved to resemble an oldfashioned retail store with glass counters in front of wide shelves that ran to the ceiling the shelves and counters were filled with boxes and wrappings of food products sold years ago but now extinct an antique cash register was on display the little museum quickly yielded to modern commerce the rest of the huge building was renovated and gave the appearance of being quite efficient a wall of paned glass cut off the front foyer and a wide carpeted hallway ran down the center of the building and led no doubt to offices and secretaries and somewhere in the rear there had to be a warehouse adam admired the displays in the front counters a young man in jeans appeared from the back and asked can i help you adam smiled and was suddenly nervous yes id like to see mr elliot kramer are you a salesman no are you a buyer no the young man was holding a pencil and had things on his mind then may i ask what you need i need to see mr elliot kramer is he here he spends most of his time at the main warehouse south of town adam took three steps toward the guy and handed him a business card my name is adam hall im an attorney from chicago i really need to see mr kramer he took the card and studied it for a few seconds then he looked at adam with a great deal of suspicion just a minute he said and walked away adam leaned on a counter and admired the cash register he had read somewhere in his voluminous research that marvin kramers family had been prosperous merchants in the delta for several generations an ancestor had made a hasty exit from a steamboat at the port in greenville and decided to call it home he opened a small dry goods store and one thing led to another throughout the ordeal of sams trials the kramer family was repeatedly described as wealthy after twenty minutes of waiting adam was ready to leave and quite relieved hed made the effort if mr kramer didnt want to meet with him there was nothing he could do about it he heard footsteps on the wooden floor and turned around an elderly gentleman stood with a business card in his hand he was tall and thin with wavy gray hair dark brown eyes with heavy shadows under them a lean strong face which at the moment was not smiling he stood erect no cane to aid him no eyeglasses to help him see he scowled at adam but said nothing for an instant adam wished hed left five minutes ago then he asked himself why he was there to begin with then he decided to go for it anyway good afternoon he said when it was obvious the gentleman would not speak mr elliot kramer mr kramer nodded in the affirmative but nodded ever so slowly as if challenged by the question my name is adam hall im an attorney from chicago sam cayhall is my grandfather and i represent him it was obvious mr kramer had already figured this out because adams words didnt faze him i would like to talk to you talk about what mr kramer said in a slow drawl about sam i hope he rots in hell he said as if he was already certain of sams eternal destination his eyes were so brown they were almost black adam glanced at the floor away from the eyes and tried to think of something noninflammatory yes sir he said very much aware that he was in the deep south where politeness went a long way i understand how you feel i dont blame you but i just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes does sam send his apologies mr kramer asked the fact that he referred to him simply as sam struck adam as odd not mr cayhall not cayhall just sam as if the two were old friends whod been feuding and now it was time to reconcile just say youre sorry sam and everythings fine the thought of a quick lie raced through adams mind he could lay it on thick say how terrible sam felt in these his last days and how he desperately wanted forgiveness but adam couldnt bring himself to do it would it make any difference he asked mr kramer carefully placed the card in his shirt pocket and began what would become a long stare past adam and through the front window no he said it wouldnt make any difference its something that shouldve been done long ago his words were accented with the heavy drip of the delta and even though their meanings were not welcome their sounds were very soothing they were slow and thoughtful uttered as if time meant nothing they also conveyed the years of suffering and the hint that life had ceased long ago no mr kramer sam does not know im here so he does not send his apologies but i do the gaze through the window and into the past did not flinch or waver but he was listening adam continued i feel the obligation to at least say for myself and sams daughter that were terribly sorry for all thats happened why didnt sam say it years ago i cant answer that i know youre new ah the power of the press of course mr kramer had been reading the papers like everyone else yes sir im trying to save his life why many reasons killing him will not bring back your grandsons nor your son he was wrong but its also wrong for the government to kill him i see and you think ive never heard this before no sir im sure youve heard it all youve seen it all youve felt it all i cant imagine what youve been through im just trying to avoid it myself what else do you want could you spare five minutes weve been talking for three minutes you have two more he glanced at his watch as if to set a timer then eased his long fingers into the pockets of his pants his eyes returned to the window and the street beyond it the memphis paper quoted you as saying you wanted to be there when they strapped sam cayhall in the gas chamber that you wanted to look him in the eyes thats an accurate quote but i dont believe itll ever happen why not because we have a rotten criminal justice system hes been coddled and protected in prison for almost ten years now his appeals go on and on youre filing appeals and pulling strings at this very moment to keep him alive the system is sick we dont expect justice i assure you hes not being coddled death row is a horrible place i just left it yeah but hes alive hes living and breathing and watching television and reading books hes talking to you hes filing lawsuits and when and if death gets near hell have plenty of time to make plans for it he can say his goodbyes say his prayers my grandsons didnt have time to say goodbye mr hall they didnt get to hug their parents and give them farewell kisses they were simply blown to bits while they were playing i understand that mr kramer but killing sam will not bring them back no it wont but itll make us feel a helluva lot better itll ease a lot of pain ive prayed a million times that ill live long enough to see him dead i had a heart attack five years ago they had me strapped to machines for two weeks and the one thing that kept me alive was my desire to outlive sam cayhall ill be there mr hall if my doctors allow it ill be there to watch him die then ill come home and count my days im sorry you feel this way im sorry i do too im sorry i ever heard the name sam cayhall adam took a step backward and leaned on the counter near the cash register he stared at the floor and mr kramer stared through the window the sun was falling to the west behind the building and the quaint little museum was growing dimmer i lost my father because of this adam said softly im sorry i read where he had committed suicide shortly after the last trial sam has suffered too mr kramer he wrecked his family and he wrecked yours and he carries more guilt than you or i could ever imagine perhaps he wont be as burdened when hes dead perhaps but why dont we stop the killing how do you expect me to stop it i read somewhere that you and the governor are old friends why is it any of your business its true isnt it hes a local boy ive known him for many years i met him last week for the first time he has the power to grant clemency you know i wouldnt count on that im not im desperate mr kramer i have nothing to lose at this point except my grandfather if you and your family are hellbent on pushing for the execution then the governor will certainly listen to you youre right and if you decided you didnt want an execution i think the governor might listen to that as well so its all up to me he said finally moving he walked in front of adam and stopped near the window youre not only desperate mr hall youre also naive i wont argue that its nice to know i have so much power if i had known this before now your grandfather wouldve been dead years ago he doesnt deserve to die mr kramer adam said as he walked to the door he hadnt expected to find sympathy it was important only for mr kramer to see him and know that other lives were being affected neither did my grandsons neither did my son adam opened the door and said im sorry for the intrusion and i thank you for your time i have a sister a cousin and an aunt sams daughter i just wanted you to know that sam has a family such as it is we will suffer if he dies if hes not executed hell never leave prison hell simply wilt away and die some day very soon of natural causes you will suffer yes sir its a pathetic family mr kramer filled with tragedy im trying to avoid another one mr kramer turned and looked at him his face bore no expression then i feel sorry for you thanks again adam said good day sir mr kramer said without a smile adam left the building and walked along a shaded street until he was in the center of town he found the memorial park and sat on the same bench not far from the bronze statue of the little boys after a few minutes though he was tired of the guilt and memories and he walked away he went to the same cafe a block away drank coffee and toyed with a grilled cheese he heard a sam cayhall conversation several tables away but couldnt discern what exactly was being said he checked into a motel and called lee she sounded sober and maybe a bit relieved that he would not be there tonight he promised to return tomorrow evening by the time it was dark adam had been asleep for half an hour adam drove through downtown memphis in the predawn hours and was locked in his office by am by eight hed talked to e garner goodman three times goodman it seemed was wired and also having trouble sleeping they discussed at length the issue of keyes representation at trial the cayhall file was filled with memos and research about what went wrong at trial but little of it placed blame on benjamin keyes but that had been many years ago when the gas chamber seemed too distant to worry about goodman was pleased to hear that sam now felt he shouldve testified at trial and that keyes had stopped him goodman was skeptical of the truth at this point but he would take sams word for it both goodman and adam knew the issue shouldve been raised years ago and that to do so now was a long shot at best law books were getting thicker by the week with supreme court decisions barring legitimate claims because they werent timely filed but it was a real issue one always examined by the courts and adam got excited as he drafted and redrafted the claim and swapped faxes with goodman again the claim would first be filed under the postconviction relief statutes in state court he hoped for a quick denial there so he could immediately run to federal court at ten he faxed his final draft to the clerk of the mississippi supreme court and also faxed a copy of it to the attention of breck jefferson in slatterys office faxes also went to the clerk of the fifth circuit in new orleans then he called the death clerk at the supreme court and told mr olander what he was doing mr olander instructed him to immediately fax a copy to washington darlene knocked on the door and adam unlocked it he had a visitor waiting in the reception area a mr wyn lettner adam thanked her and a few minutes later walked down the hall and greeted lettner who was alone and dressed like a man who owned a trout dock deck shoes fishing cap they exchanged pleasantries fish were biting irene was fine when was he coming back to calico rock im in town on business and i just wanted to see you for a few minutes he said in a low whisper with his back to the receptionist sure adam whispered my office is down the hall no lets take a walk they rode the elevator to the lobby and stepped from the building onto the pedestrian mall lettner bought a bag of roasted peanuts from a pushcart vendor and offered adam a handful he declined they walked slowly north toward city hall and the federal building lettner alternately ate the peanuts and tossed them to the pigeons hows sam he finally asked he has two weeks how would you feel if you had two weeks guess id be praying a lot hes not at that point yet but it wont be long is it gonna happen its certainly being planned theres nothing in writing to stop it lettner threw a handful of peanuts into his mouth well good luck to you since you came to see me ive found myself pulling for you and of sam thanks and you came to memphis to wish me luck not exactly after you left i thought a lot about sam and the kramer bombing i looked at my personal files and records stuff i havent thought about in years it brought back a lot of memories i called a few of my old buddies and we told war stories about the klan those were the days im sorry that i missed them anyway i thought of a few things that maybe i shouldve told you such as theres more to the dogan story you know he died a year after he testified sam told me he and his wife were killed when their house blew up some kind of propane leak in the heater house filled up with gas and something ignited it went off like a bomb a huge fireball buried them in sandwich bags sad but so what we never believed it was an accident the crime lab boys down there tried to reconstruct the heater a lot of it was destroyed but they were of the opinion it had been rigged to leak how does this affect sam it doesnt affect sam then why are we talking about it it might affect you i really dont follow dogan had a son a kid who joined the army in and was sent to germany at some point in the summer of dogan and sam were indicted again by the circuit court in greenville and shortly thereafter it became widely known that dogan had agreed to testify against sam it was a big story in october of dogans son went awol in germany vanished he crunched on some peanuts and tossed the hulls to a covey of pigeons never found him either army searched high and low months went by then a year dogan died not knowing what happened to the kid what happened to him dont know to this day hes never turned up he died probably there was no sign of him who killed him maybe the same person who killed his parents and who might that be we had a theory but no suspect we thought at the time that the son was grabbed before the trial as a warning to dogan perhaps dogan knew secrets then why kill dogan after the trial they stopped under a shade tree and sat on a bench in court square adam finally took some peanuts who knew the details of the bombing lettner asked all the details sam jeremiah dogan right and who was their lawyer in the first two trials clovis brazelton would it be safe to assume brazelton knew the details i suppose he was active in the klan wasnt he yep he was a klucker that makes three sam dogan and brazelton anybody else adam thought for a second perhaps the mysterious accomplice perhaps dogans dead sam wouldnt talk and brazelton died many years ago howd he die plane crash the kramer case made him a hero down there and he was able to parlay his fame into a very successful law practice he liked to fly so he bought himself a plane and buzzed around everywhere trying lawsuits a real big shot he was flying back from the coast one night when the plane disappeared from radar they found his body in a tree the weather was clear the faa said thered been some type of engine failure another mysterious death yep so everybodys dead but sam and hes getting close any link between dogans death and brazeltons no they were years apart but the theory includes the scenario that the deaths were the work of the same person so whos at work here someone whos very concerned about secrets could be sams mysterious accomplice john doe thats a pretty wild theory yes it is and its one with absolutely no proof to support it but i told you in calico rock that we always suspected sam had help or perhaps sam was merely a helper for john doe at any rate when sam screwed up and got caught john doe vanished perhaps hes been at work eliminating witnesses why would he kill dogans wife because she happened to be in bed with him when the house blew up why would he kill dogans son to keep dogan quiet remember when dogan testified his son had been missing for four months ive never read anything about the son it was not well known it happened in germany we advised dogan to keep it quiet im confused dogan didnt finger anybody else at trial only sam why would john doe kill him afterward because he still knew secrets and because he testified against cmother klansman adam cracked two shells and dropped the peanuts in front of a single fat pigeon lettner finished the bag and threw another handful of hulls on the sidewalk near a water fountain it was almost noon and dozens of office workers hurried through the park in pursuit of the perfect thirtyminute lunch you hungry lettner asked glancing at his watch no thirsty i need a beer no how does john doe affect me sams the only witness left and hes scheduled to be silenced in two weeks if he dies without talking then john doe can live in peace if sam doesnt die in two weeks then john doe is still anxious but if sam starts talking then somebody might get hurt me youre the one trying to find the truth you think hes out there could be or he might be driving a cab in montreal or maybe he never existed adam glanced over both shoulders with exaggerated looks of fear i know it sounds crazy lettner said john doe is safe sam aint talking theres a potential danger adam i just wanted you to know im not scared if sam gave me john does name right now id scream it in the streets and file motions by the truckload and it wouldnt do any good its too late for new theories of guilt or innocence what about the governor i doubt it well i want you to be careful thanks i guess lets get a beer ive got to keep this guy away from lee adam thought its five minutes before noon surely you dont start this early oh sometimes i start with breakfast john doe sat on a park bench with a newspaper in front of his face and pigeons around his feet he was eighty feet away so he couldnt hear what they were saying he thought he recognized the old man with adam as an fbi agent whose face had appeared in the newspapers years ago he would follow the guy and find out who he was and where he lived wedge was getting bored with memphis and this suited him fine the kid worked at the office and drove to parchman and slept at the condo and seemed to be spinning his wheels wedge followed the news carefully his name had not been mentioned no one knew about him the note on the counter was dated properly she had given the time as pm it was lees handwriting which was not neat to begin with but was even sloppier now she said she was in bed with what appeared to be the flu please dont disturb shed been to the doctor who told her to sleep it off for added effect a prescription bottle from a local pharmacy was sitting nearby next to a halfempty glass of water it had todays date on it adam quickly checked the wastebasket under the sink no sign of booze he quietly put a frozen pizza in the microwave and went to the patio to watch the barges on the river the first kite of the morning arrived shortly after breakfast as sam stood in his baggy boxer shorts and leaned through the bars with a cigarette it was from preacher boy and it brought bad news it read dear sam the dream is finished the lord worked on me last night and finally showed me the rest of it i wish he hadnt done it theres a lot to it and ill explain it all if you want bottom line is that youll be with him shortly he told me to tell you to get things right with him hes waiting the journey will be rough but the rewards will be worth it i love you brother randy bon voyage sam mumbled to himself as he crumpled the paper and threw it on the floor the kid was slowly deteriorating and there was no way to help him sam had already prepared a series of motions to be filed at some uncertain point in the future when brother randy was thoroughly insane he saw gullitts hands come through the bars next door how you doin sam gullitt finally asked gods upset with me sam said really yeah preacher boy finished his dream last night thank god for that it was more like a nightmare i wouldnt worry too much about it crazy bastard has dreams when hes wide awake they said yesterday hes been crying for a week can you hear him no thank god poor kid ive done some motions for him just in case i leave this place i want to leave them with you i dont know what to do with them ill leave instructions theyre to be sent to his lawyer gullitt whistled softly man oh man sam what am i gonna do if you leave i aint talked to my lawyer in a year your lawyer is a moron then help me fire him sam please you just fired yours help me fire mine i dont know how to do it then wholl represent you your grandson tell him he can have my case sam smiled then he chuckled and then he laughed at the idea of rounding up his buddies on the row and delivering their hopeless cases to adam whatsso damned funny gullitt demanded you what makes you think hell want your case come on sam talk to the kid for me he must be smart if hes your grandson what if they gas me do you want a lawyer whos just lost his first death row client hell i cant be particular right now relax jb you have years to go how many years at least five maybe more you swear you have my word ill put it in writing if im wrong you can sue me real funny sam real funny a door clicked open at the end of the hall and heavy footsteps came their way it was packer and he stopped in front of number six mornin sam he said mornin packer put your reds on you have a visitor who is it somebody who wants to talk to you who is it sam repeated as he quickly slipped into his red jumpsuit he grabbed his cigarettes he didnt care who the visitor was or what he wanted a visit by anyone was a welcome relief from his cell hurry up sam packer said is it my lawyer sam asked as he slid his feet into the rubber shower shoes no packer handcuffed him through the bars and the door to his cell opened they left tier a and headed for the same little room where the lawyers always waited packer removed the handcuffs and slammed the door behind sam who focused on the heavyset woman seated on the other side of the screen he rubbed his wrists for her benefit and took a few steps to the seat opposite her he did not recognize the woman he sat down lit a cigarette and glared at her she scooted forward in her chair and nervously said mr cayhall my name is dr stegall she slipped a business card through the opening im the psychiatrist for the state department of corrections sam studied the card on the counter in front of him he picked it up and examined it suspiciously says here your name is n stegall dr n stegall thats correct thats a strange name n ive never met a woman named n before the small anxious grin disappeared from her face and her spine stiffened its just an initial okay there are reasons for it whats it stand for thats really none of your business nancy nelda nona if i wanted you to know i wouldve put it on the card now wouldnt i i dont know must be something horrible whatever it is nick ned i cant imagine hiding behind an initial im not hiding mr cayhall just call me s okay her jaws clenched and she scowled through the screen im here to help you youre too late n please call me dr stegall oh well in that case you can call me lawyer cayhall lawyer cayhall yes i know more law than most of the clowns who sit over there where you are she managed a slight patronizing smile then said im supposed to consult you at this stage of the proceedings to see if i can be of any assistance you dont have to cooperate if you dont want thank you so much if you need to talk to me or if you need any medication now or later just let me know how about some whiskey i cant prescribe that why not prison regulations i guess what can you prescribe tranquilizers valium sleeping pills things like that for what for your nerves my nerves are fine are you able to sleep sam thought for a long moment well to be honest i am having a little trouble yesterday i slept off and on for mo more than twelve hours usually im good for fifteen or sixteen twelve hours yeah how often do you get over here to death row not very often thats what i thought if you knew what you were doing youd know that we average about sixteen hours a day i see and what else might i learn oh lots of things youd know that randy dupree is slowly going insane and no one around here cares about him why havent you been to see him there are five thousand inmates here mr cayhall i then leave go away go tend to the rest of them ive been here for nine and a half years and never met you now that yall are about to gas me you come running over with a bag full of drugs to calm my nerves so ill be sweet and gentle when you

real job where you can help people youre here right now because ive got thirteen days and you want me to go in peace youre just another flunkie for the state i didnt come here to be abused then get your big ass out of here leave go and sin no more she jumped to her feet and grabbed her briefcase you have my card if you need anything let me know sure ned dont sit by the phone sam stood and walked to the door on his side he banged it twice with the palm of his hand and waited with his back to her until packer opened it adam was packing his briefcase in preparation for a quick trip to parchman when the phone rang darlene said it was urgent she was right the caller identified himself as the clerk of the fifth circuit court of appeals in new orleans and was remarkably friendly he said the cayhall petition attacking the constitutionality of the gas chamber had been received on monday had been assigned to a threejudge panel and that the panel wanted to hear oral argument from both sides could he be in new orleans at pm tomorrow friday for the oral argument adam almost dropped the phone tomorrow of course he said after a slight hesitation one oclock sharp the clerk said then explained that the court did not normally hear oral argument in the afternoon but because of the urgency of this matter the court had scheduled a special hearing he asked adam if hed ever argued before the fifth circuit before are you kidding adam thought a year ago i was studying for the bar exam he said no in fact he had not and the clerk said he would immediately fax to adam a copy of the courts rules governing oral argument adam thanked him profusely and hung up he sat on the edge of the table and tried to collect his thoughts darlene brought the fax to him and he asked her to check the flights to new orleans had he caught the attention of the court with his issues was this good news or just a formality in his brief career as a lawyer he had stood alone before the bench to argue a clients position on only one occasion but emmitt wycoff had been seated nearby just in case and the judge had been a familiar one and it had happened in downtown chicago not far from his office tomorrow he would walk into a strange courtroom in a strange city and try to defend an eleventhhour plea before a panel of judges hed never heard of he called e garner goodman with the news goodman had been to the fifth circuit many times and as he talked adam relaxed it was neither good news nor bad in goodmans opinion the court was obviously interested in the lawsuit but theyd heard it all before both texas and louisiana had sent similar constitutional claims to the fifth circuit in recent years goodman assured him that he could handle the arguments just be prepared he said and try to relax it might be possible for him to fly to new orleans and be there but adam said no he said he could do it alone keep in touch goodman said adam checked with darlene then locked himself in his office he memorized the rules for oral argument he studied the lawsuit attacking the gas chamber he read briefs and cases he called parchman and left word for sam that he would not be there today he worked until dark then made the dreaded trip to lees condo the same note was sitting on the counter untouched and still declaring that she was in bed with the flu he eased around the apartment and saw no signs of movement or life during the day her bedroom door was slightly opened he tapped on it while pushing lee he called out gently into the darkness lee are you all right there was movement in the bed though he couldnt see what it was yes dear she said come in adam slowly sat on the edge of the bed and tried to focus on her the only light was a faint beam from the hallway she pushed herself up and rested on the pillows im better she said with a scratchy voice how are you dear im fine lee im worried about you ill be okay its a wicked little virus the first pungent vapor wafted from the bedsheets and covers and adam wanted to cry it was the reeking odor of stale vodka or gin or sour mash or maybe a combination of everything he couldnt see her eyes in the murky shadows only the vague outline of her face she was wearing a dark shirt of some sort what type of medication he asked i dont know just some pills the doctor said itll last for a few days then quickly disappear i feel better already adam started to say something about the oddity of a flulike virus in late july but let it pass are you able to eat no appetite really is there anything i can do no dear how have you been what day is it its thursday i feel like ive been in a cave for a week adam had two choices he could play along with the wicked little virus act and hope she stopped the drinking before it got worse or he could confront her now and make her realize she was not fooling him maybe they would fight and maybe this was what you were supposed to do with drunks whod fallen off the wagon how was he supposed to know what to do does your doctor know youre drinking he asked holding his breath there was a long pause i havent been drinking she said almost inaudible come on lee i found the vodka bottle in the wastebasket i know the other three bottles of beer disappeared last saturday you smell like a brewery right now youre not fooling anyone lee youre drinking heavily and i want to help she sat straighter and pulled her legs up to her chest then she was still for a long time adam glanced at her silhouette minutes passed the apartment was deathly quiet hows my dear father she muttered her words were sluggish but still bitter i didnt see him today dont you think well be better off when hes dead adam looked at her silhouette no lee i dont do you she was silent and still for at least a minute you feel sorry for him dont you she finally asked yes i do is he pitiful yes he is what does he look like a very old man with plenty of gray hair thats always oily and pulled back he has a short gray beard lots of wrinkles his skin is very pale what does he wear a red jumpsuit all death row inmates wear the same thing another long pause as she thought about this then she said i guess its easy to feel sorry for him it is for me but you see adam ive never seen him the way you see him i saw a different person and what did you see she adjusted the blanket around her legs then grew still again my father was a person i despised do you still despise him yes very much so i think he should go ahead and die god knows he deserves it why does he deserve it this prompted another spell of silence she moved slightly to her left and took a cup or glass from the nightstand she sipped slowly as adam watched her shadows he didnt ask what she was drinking does he talk to you about the past only when i ask questions weve talked about eddie but i promised we wouldnt do it again hes the reason eddies dead does he realize this maybe did you tell him did you blame him for eddie no you should have youre too easy on him he needs to know what hes done i think he does but you said yourself its not fair to torment him at this point of his life how about joe lincoln did you talk to him about joe lincoln i told sam that you and i went to the old family place he asked me if i knew about joe lincoln i said that i did did he deny it no he showed a lot of remorse hes a liar no i think he was sincere another long pause as she sat motionless then has he told you about the lynching adam closed his eyes and rested his elbows on his knees no he mumbled i didnt think so i dont want to hear it lee yes you do you came down here full of questions about the family and about your past two weeks ago you just couldnt get enough of the cayhall family misery you wanted all the blood and gore ive heard enough he said what day is it she asked its thursday lee youve already asked once one of my girls was due today her second child i didnt call the office i guess its the medication and the alcohol all right dammit so im an alcoholic who can blame me sometimes i wish i had the guts to do what eddie did come on lee let me help you oh youve already helped a great deal adam i was fine nice and sober until you arrived okay i was wrong im sorry i just didnt realize his words trailed off then quit she moved slightly and adam watched as she took another sip a heavy silence engulfed them as minutes passed the rancid smell emanated from her end of the bed mother told me the story she said quietly almost whispering she said shed heard rumors about it for years long before they married she knew hed helped lynch a young black man please lee i never asked him about it but eddie did we had whispered about it for many years and finally one day eddie just up and confronted him with the story they had a nasty fight but sam admitted it was true it really didnt bother him he said the black kid had allegedly raped a white girl but she was white trash and many people doubted if it was really a rape this is according to mothers version sam was fifteen or so at the time and a bunch of men went down to the jail got the black kid and took him out in the woods sams father of course was the ringleader and his brothers were involved thats enough lee they beat him with a bullwhip then hung him from a tree my dear father was right in the middle of it he couldnt really deny it you know because somebody took a picture of it a photograph yeah a few years later the photo found its way into a book about the plight of negroes in the deep south it was published in my mother had a copy of it for years eddie found it in the attic and sams in the photograph sure smiling from ear to ear theyre standing under the tree and the black guys feet are dangling just above their heads everybodys having a ball just another nigger lynching there are no credits with the photo no names the picture speaks for itself its described as a lynching in rural mississippi wheres the book over there in the drawer ive kept it in storage with other family treasures since the foreclosure i got it out the other day i thought you might want to see it no i do not want to see it go ahead you wanted to know about your family well there they are grandfather greatgrandfather and all sorts of cayhalls at their very best caught in the act and quite proud of it stop it lee there were other lynchings you know shut up lee okay i dont want to hear any more she leaned to her side and reached for the nightstand what are you drinking lee cough syrup bullshit adam jumped to his feet and walked through the darkness to the nightstand lee quickly gulped the last of the liquid he grabbed the glass from her hand and sniffed the top of it this is bourbon theres more in the pantry would you get it for me no youve had more than enough if i want it ill get it no you wont lee youre not drinking any more tonight tomorrow ill take you to the doctor and well get some help i dont need help i need a gun adam placed the glass on the dresser and switched on a lamp she shielded her eyes for a few seconds then looked at him they were red and puffy her hair was wild dirty and unkempt not a pretty sight huh she said slurring her words and looking away no but well get help lee well do it tomorrow get me a drink adam please no then leave me alone this is all your fault you know now leave please go on to bed adam grabbed a pillow from the center of the bed and threw it against the door im sleeping here tonight he said pointing at the pillow im locking the door and youre not leaving this room she glared at him but said nothing he switched off the lamp and the room was completely dark he pressed the lock on the knob and stretched out on the carpet against the door now sleep it off lee go to bed adam i promise i wont leave the room no youre drunk and im not moving if you try to open this door ill physically put you back in the bed that sounds sort of romantic knock it off lee go to sleep i cant sleep try it lets tell cayhall stories okay adam i know a few more lynching stories shut up lee adam screamed and she was suddenly quiet the bed squeaked as she wiggled and flipped and got herself situated after fifteen minutes she was subdued after thirty minutes the floor became uncomfortable and adam rolled from side to side sleep came in brief naps interrupted by long periods of staring at the ceiling and worrying about her and about the fifth circuit at one point during the night he sat with his back to the door and stared through the darkness in the direction of the drawer was the book really there he was tempted to sneak over and get it then ease into the bathroom to look for the picture but he couldnt risk waking her and he didnt want to see it he found a pint of bourbon hidden behind a box of saltines in the pantry and emptied it in the sink it was dark outside sunlight was an hour away he made the coffee strong and sipped it on the sofa while he rehearsed the arguments he would present in a few hours in new orleans he reviewed his notes on the patio at dawn and by seven he was in the kitchen making toast no sign of lee he didnt want a confrontation but one was necessary he had things to say and she had apologies to make and he rattled plates and forks on the counter the volume was increased for the morning news but there was no movement from her part of the condo after he showered and dressed he gently turned the knob to her door it was locked she had sealed herself in her cave and prevented the painful talk of the morning after he wrote a note and explained that he would be in new orleans today and tonight and he would see her tomorrow he said he was sorry for now and they would talk about it later he pleaded with her not to drink the note was placed on the counter where she couldnt miss it adam left the condo and drove to the airport the direct flight to new orleans took fiftyfive minutes adam drank fruit juice and tried to sit comfortably to soothe his stiff back hed slept less than three hours on the floor by the door and vowed not to do it again by her own admission shed been through recovery three times over the years and if she couldnt stay off the booze by herself there was certainly nothing he could do to help he would stay in memphis until this miserable case was over and if his aunt couldnt stay sober then he could manage things from a hotel room he fought himself to forget about her for the next few hours he needed to concentrate on legal matters not lynchings and photographs and horror stories from the past not his beloved aunt and her problems the plane touched down in new orleans and suddenly his concentration became sharper he mentally clicked off the names of dozens of recent death penalty cases from the fifth circuit and the us supreme court the hired car was a cadillac sedan one arranged by darlene and charged to kravitz bane it came with a driver and as adam relaxed in the rear seat he conceded that life in a big firm did indeed have certain advantages adam had never been to new orleans before and the drive from the airport couldve taken place in any city just traffic and expressways the driver turned onto poydras street by the superdome and suddenly they were downtown he explained to his passenger that the french quarter was a few blocks away not far from adams hotel the car stopped on camp street and adam stepped onto the sidewalk in front of a building simply called the fifth circuit court of appeals it was an impressive structure with greek columns and lots of steps leading to the front entrance he found the clerks office on the main floor and asked for the gentleman hed spoken to a mr feriday mr feriday was as sincere and courteous in person as hed been on the phone he properly registered adam and explained some of the rules of the court he asked adam if he wanted a quick tour of the place it was almost noon the place was not busy and it was the perfect time for a look around they headed for the courtrooms passing along the way various offices of the judges and staff the fifth circuit has fifteen judges mr feriday explained as they walked casually over marble floors and their offices are along these hallways right now the court has three vacancies and the nominations are tied up in washington the corridors were dark and quiet as if great minds were at work behind the broad wooden doors mr feriday went first to the en banc courtroom a large intimidating stage with fifteen chairs sitting snugly together in a halfcircle in the front of the room most of the work here is assigned to threejudge panels but occasionally the entire body sits en banc he explained quietly as if still in awe of the spectacular room the bench was elevated well above the rest of the room so that the lawyers at the podium below looked upward as they pleaded the room was marble and dark wood heavy drapes and a huge chandelier it was ornate but understated old but meticulously maintained and as adam inspected it he felt quite frightened only rarely does the entire court sit en banc mr feriday explained again as if he were instructing a firstyear student of the law the great civil rights decisions of the sixties and seventies took place right here he said with no small amount of pride portraits of deceased justices hung behind the bench as beautiful and stately as it was adam hoped he never saw it again at least not as a lawyer representing a client they walked down the hall to the west courtroom which was smaller than the first but just as intimidating this is where the threejudge panels operate mr feriday explained as they walked past the seats in the spectators section through the bar and to the podium the bench again was elevated though not as lofty or as long as en banc virtually all oral arguments take place in the morning beginning at nine mr feriday said your case is a bit different because its a death case thats going down to the wire he pointed a crooked finger at the seats in the back youll need to be seated out there a few minutes before one and the clerk will call the case then you come through the bar and sit right here at counsel table youll go first and you have twenty minutes adam knew this but it was certainly nice to be walked through it mr feriday pointed to a device on the podium which resembled a traffic light this is the timer he said gravely and it is very important twenty minutes okay there are horrific stories of longwinded lawyers who ignored this not a pretty sight the green is on when youre talking the yellow comes on when you want your warning two minutes five minutes thirty seconds whatever when the red comes on you simply stop in midsentence and go sit down its that simple any questions who are the judges mcneely robichaux and judy he said this as if adam personally knew all three theres a waiting room over there and theres a library on the third floor just be here about ten minutes before one any more questions no sir thanks im in my office if you need me good luck they shook hands mr feriday left adam standing at the podium at ten minutes before one adam walked through the massive oak doors of the west courtroom for the second time and found other lawyers preparing for battle on the first row behind the bar attorney general steve roxburgh and his cluster of assistants were huddled together plotting tactics they hushed when adam walked in and a few nodded and tried to smile adam sat by himself along the aisle and ignored them lucas mann was seated on their side of the courtroom though several rows behind roxburgh and his boys he casually read a newspaper and waved to adam when their eyes met it was good to see him he was starched from head to toe in wrinklefree khaki and his tie was wild enough to glow in the dark it was obvious mann was not intimidated by the fifth circuit and its trappings and equally as obvious that he was keeping his distance from roxburgh he was only the attorney for parchman only doing his job if the fifth circuit granted a stay and sam didnt die lucas mann would be pleased adam nodded and smiled at him roxburgh and his gang rehuddled morris henry dr death was in the middle of it explaining things to lesser minds adam breathed deeply and tried to relax it was quite difficult his stomach was churning and his feet twitched and he kept telling himself that it would only last for twenty minutes the three judges couldnt kill him they could only embarrass him and even that could last for only twenty minutes he could endure anything for twenty minutes he glanced at his notes and to calm himself he tried to think of sam not sam the racist the murderer the lynch mob thug but sam the client the old man wasting away on death row who was entitled to die in peace and dignity sam was about to get twenty minutes of this courts valuable time so his lawyer had to make the most of it a heavy door thudded shut somewhere and adam jumped in his seat the court crier appeared from behind the bench and announced that this honorable court was now in session he was followed by three figures in flowing black robes mcneely robichaux and judy each of whom carried files and seemed to be totally without humor or goodwill they sat in their massive leather chairs high up on the shiny dark oakpaneled bench and looked down upon the courtroom the case of state of mississippi v sam cayhall was called and the attorneys were summoned from the back of the room adam nervously walked through the swinging gate in the bar and was followed by steve roxburgh the assistant attorney generals kept their seats as did lucas mann and a handful of spectators most of these adam would later learn were reporters the presiding judge was judy the honorable t eileen judy a young woman from texas robichaux was from louisiana and in his late fifties mcneely looked to be a hundred and twenty and was also from texas judy made a brief statement about the case then asked mr adam hall from chicago if he was ready to proceed he stood nervously his knees rubberlike his bowels jumping his voice high and nervous and he said that yes in fact he was ready to go he made it to the podium in the center of the room and looked up way up it seemed at the panel behind the bench the green light beside him came on and he assumed correctly this meant to get things started the room was silent the judges glared down at him he cleared his throat glanced at the portraits of dead honorables hanging on the wall and plunged into a vicious attack on the gas chamber as a means of execution he avoided eye contact with the three of them and for five minutes or so was allowed to repeat what hed already submitted in his brief it was postlunch in the heat of the summer and it took a few minutes for the judges to shrug off the cobwebs mr hall i think youre just repeating what youve already said in your brief judy said testily were quite capable of reading mr hall mr hall took it well and thought to himself that this was his twenty minutes and if he wanted to pick his nose and recite the alphabet then he should be allowed to do so for twenty minutes as green as he was adam had heard this comment before from an appellate judge it happened while he was in law school and watching a case being argued it was standard fare in oral argument yes your honor adam said carefully avoiding any reference to gender he then moved on to discuss the effects of cyanide gas on laboratory rats a study not included in his brief the experiments had been conducted a year ago by some chemists in sweden for the purpose of proving that humans do not die instantly when they inhale the poison it had been funded by a european organization working to abolish the death penalty in america the rats went into seizures and convulsed their lungs and hearts stopped and started erratically for several minutes the gas burst blood vessels throughout their bodies including their brains their muscles quivered uncontrollably they salivated and squeaked the obvious point of the study was that the rats did not die quickly but in fact suffered a great deal the tests were conducted with scientific integrity appropriate doses were given to the small animals on the average it took almost ten minutes for death to occur adam labored over the details and as he warmed to his presentation his nerves settled a bit the judges were not only listening but seemed to be enjoying this discussion of dying rats adam had found the study in a footnote to a recent north carolina case it was in the fine print and had not been widely reported now let me get this straight robichaux interrupted in a highpitched voice you dont want your client to die in the gas chamber because its a cruel way to go but are you telling us you dont mind if hes executed by lethal injection no your honor thats not what im saying i do not want my client executed by any method but lethal injection is the least offensive all methods are offensive but lethal injection seems to be the least cruel theres no doubt the gas chamber is a horrible way to die worse than being bombed blown up by dynamite a heavy silence fell over the courtroom as robichauxs words settled in he had emphasized the word dynamite and adam struggled for something appropriate mcneely shot a nasty look at his colleague on the other side of the bench it was a cheap shot and adam was furious he controlled his temper and said firmly were talking about methods of execution your honor not the crimes that send men to death row why dont you want to talk about the crime because the crime is not an issue here because i have only twenty minutes and my client has only twelve days perhaps your client shouldnt have been planting bombs of course not but he was convicted of his crime and now he faces death in the gas chamber our point is that the chamber is a cruel way to execute people what about the electric chair the same argument applies there have been some hideous cases of people suffering terribly in the chair before they died what about a firing squad sounds cruel to me and hanging i dont know much about hanging but it too sounds awfully cruel but you like the idea of lethal injection i didnt say i like it i believe i said it was not as cruel as the other methods justice mcneely interrupted and asked mr hall why did mississippi switch from the gas chamber to lethal injection this was covered thoroughly in the lawsuit and the brief and adam sensed immediately that mcneely was a friend ive condensed the legislative history of the law in my brief your honor but it was done principally to facilitate executions the legislature admitted it was an easier way to die and so to sidestep constitutional challenges such as this one it changed the method so the state has effectively admitted that there is a better way to execute people yes sir but the law took effect in and applies only to those inmates convicted afterward it does not apply to sam cayhall i understand that youre asking us to strike down the gas chamber as a method what happens if we do what happens to your client and those like him who were convicted prior to do they fall through the cracks there is no provision in the law to execute them by lethal injection adam was anticipating the obvious question sam had already asked it i cant answer that your honor except to say that i have great confidence in the mississippi legislatures ability and willingness to pass a new law covering my client and those in his position judge judy inserted herself at this point assuming they do mr hall what will you argue when you return here in three years thankfully the yellow light came on and adam had only one minute remaining ill think of something he said with a grin just give me time weve already seen a case like this mr hall robichaux said in fact its cited in your brief a texas case yes your honor im asking the court to reconsider its decision on this issue virtually every state with a gas chamber or an electric chair has switched to lethal injection the reason is obvious he had a few seconds left but decided it was a good place to stop he didnt want another question thank you he said and walked confidently back to his seat it was over he had held his breakfast and performed quite well for a rookie it would be easier the next time roxburgh was wooden and methodical and thoroughly prepared he tried a few oneliners about rats and the crimes they commit but it was a dismal effort at humor mcneely peppered him with similar questions about why the states were rushing to lethal injection roxburgh stuck to his guns and recited a long line of cases where the various federal circuits had endorsed death by gas electricity hanging and firing squads the established law was on his side and he made the most of it his twenty minutes raced by and he returned to his seat as quickly as adam had judge judy talked briefly about the urgency of this matter and promised a ruling within days everyone rose in unison and the three judges disappeared from the bench the court crier declared matters to be in recess until monday morning adam shook hands with roxburgh and made it through the doors before a reporter stopped him he was with a paper in jackson and just had a couple of questions adam was polite but declined comment he then did the same for two more reporters roxburgh typically had things to say and as adam walked away the reporters surrounded the attorney general and shoved recorders near his face adam wanted to leave the building he stepped into the tropical heat and quickly covered his eyes with sunglasses have you had lunch a voice asked from close behind it was lucas mann in aviator sunglasses they shook hands between the columns i couldnt eat adam admitted you did fine its quite nerveracking isnt it yes it is why are you here its part of my job the warden asked me to fly down and watch the argument well wait until theres a ruling before we start preparations lets go eat adams driver stopped the car at the curb and they got in do you know the city mann asked no this is my first visit the bon ton cafe mann told the driver its a wonderful old place just around the corner nice car the benefits of working for a wealthy firm lunch began with a novelty raw oysters on the half shell adam had heard of them before but had never been tempted mann artfully demonstrated the proper blending of horseradish lemon juice tabasco and cocktail sauce then dropped the first oyster into the mixture it was then delicately placed on a cracker and eaten in one bite adams first oyster slid off the cracker and onto the table but his second slid properly down his throat dont chew it mann instructed just let it slither down the next ten slithered down and not soon enough for adam he was happy when the dozen shells on his plate were empty they sipped dixie beer and waited for shrimp remoulade i saw where youre claiming ineffective assistance of counsel mann said nibbling on a cracker im sure well be filing everything from now on the supreme court didnt waste any time with it no they didnt seems as if theyre tired of sam cayhall ill file it in district court today but i dont expect any relief from slattery i wouldnt either what are my odds with twelve days to go getting slimmer by the day but things are wildly unpredictable probably still around fiftyfifty a few years back we came very close with stockholm turner with two weeks to go it looked certain with a week to go there was simply nothing else for him to file he had a decent lawyer but the appeals had run he was given his last meal and and his conjugal visit with two prostitutes howd you know sam told me all about it its true he got a last minute stay and now hes years away from the chamber you never know but whats your gut feeling mann took a long drink of beer and leaned backward as two large platters of shrimp remoulade were placed before them i dont have gut feelings when it comes to executions anything can happen just keep filing writs and appeals it becomes a marathon you cant give up the lawyer for jumbo parris collapsed with twelve hours to go and was in a hospital bed when his client went down adam chewed on a boiled shrimp and washed it down with beer the governor wants me to talk to him should i what does your client want what do you think he hates the governor he has forbidden me to talk to him you have to ask for a clemency hearing thats standard practice how well do you know mcallister not very well hes a political animal with great ambitions and i wouldnt trust him for a minute he does however have the power to grant clemency he can commute the death sentence he can impose life or he can set him free the statute grants broad discretionary authority to the governor hell probably be your last hope god help us hows the remoulade mann asked with a mouthful delicious they busied themselves with eating for a while adam was thankful for the company and conversation but decided to limit the talk to appeals and strategy he liked lucas mann but his client did not as sam would say mann worked for the state and the state was working to execute him a late afternoon flight would have taken him back to memphis by sixthirty long before dark and once there he couldve killed an hour or so at the office before returning to lees but he wasnt up to it he had a fancy room in a modern hotel by the river paid for without question by the boys at kravitz bane all expenses were covered hed never seen the french quarter and so he awoke at six after a threehour nap brought on by three dixies for lunch and a bad nights rest he was lying across the bed with his shoes on and he studied the ceiling fan for half an hour before he moved the sleep had been heavy lee did not answer the phone he left a message on her recorder and hoped she was not drinking and if she was then he hoped shed locked herself in her room where she couldnt hurt anyone he brushed his teeth and hair and rode an elevator to the spacious lobby where a jazz band performed for happy hour fivecent oysters on the half shell were being hawked from a corner bar he walked in the sweltering heat along canal street until he came to royal where he took a right and was soon lost in a throng of tourists friday night was coming to life in the quarter he gawked at the strip clubs trying desperately for a peek inside he was stopped cold by an open door which revealed a row of male strippers on a stage men who looked like beautiful women he ate an egg roll on a stick from a chinese carryout he stepped around a wino vomiting in the street he spent an hour at a small table in a jazz club listening to a delightful combo and sipping a fourdollar beer when it was dark he walked to jackson square and watched the artists pack up their easels and leave the street musicians and dancers were out in force in front of an old cathedral and he clapped for an amazing string quartet comprised of tulane students people were everywhere drinking and eating and dancing enjoying the festiveness of the french quarter he bought a dish of vanilla ice cream and headed for canal on another night and under far different circumstances he might be tempted to take in a strip show sitting in the rear of course where no one could see him or he might hang out in a trendy bar looking for lonely beautiful women but not tonight the drunks reminded him of lee and he wished hed returned to memphis to see her the music and laughter reminded him of sam who at this very moment was sitting in a humid oven staring at the bars and counting the days hoping and perhaps praying now that his lawyer might work a miracle sam would never see new orleans never again eat oysters or red beans and rice never taste a cold beer or a good coffee he would never hear jazz or watch artists paint he would never again fly on a plane or stay in a nice hotel he would never fish or drive or do a thousand things free people take for granted even if sam lived past august he would simply continue the process of dying a little each day adam left the quarter and walked hurriedly to his hotel he needed rest the marathon was about to begin the guard named tiny handcuffed sam and led him off tier a sam carried a plastic bag filled tightly with the last two weeks worth of fan mail for most of his career as a death row inmate he had averaged a handful of letters a month from supporters klansmen and their sympathizers racial purists antisemites all types of bigots for a couple of years he had answered these letters but with time had grown weary of it what was the benefit to some he was a hero but the more he swapped words with his admirers the wackier they became there were a lot of nuts out there the idea had crossed his mind that perhaps he was safer on the row than in the free world mail had been declared to be a right by the federal court not a privilege thus it could not be taken away it could however be regulated each letter was opened by an inspector unless the envelope clearly was from an attorney unless an inmate was under mail censorship the letters were not read they were delivered to the row in due course and dispensed to the inmates boxes and packages were also opened and inspected the thought of losing sam was frightening to many fanatics and his mail had picked up dramatically since the fifth circuit lifted his stay they offered their unwavering support and their prayers a few offered money their letters tended to run long as they invariably blasted jews and blacks and liberals and other conspirators some bitched about taxes gun control the national debt some delivered sermons sam was tired of the letters he was averaging six per day he placed them on the counter as the handcuffs were removed then asked the guard to unlock a small door in the screen the guard shoved the plastic bag through the door and adam took it on the other side the guard left locking the door behind whats this adam asked holding the bag fan mail sam took his regular seat and lit a cigarette what am i supposed to do with it read it burn it i dont care i was cleaning my cell this morning and the stuff got in the way i understand you were in new orleans yesterday tell me about it adam placed the letters on a chair and sat across from sam the temperature outside was a hundred and two and not much cooler inside the visitors room it was saturday and adam was dressed in jeans loafers and a very light cotton polo the fifth circuit called thursday and said they wanted to hear from me on friday i went down dazzled them with my brilliance and flew back to memphis this morning when do they rule soon a threejudge panel yes who judy robichaux and mcneely sam contemplated the names for a moment mcneelys an old warrior wholl help us judys a conservative bitch oops sorry i mean a conservative femaleamerican a republican appointee i doubt if shell help im not familiar with robichaux wheres he from southern louisiana ah a cajunamerican i guess hes a hardass he wont help then well lose by two to one i thought you said you dazzled them with your brilliance we havent lost yet adam was surprised to hear sam speak with such familiarity about the individual judges but then hed been studying the court for many years wheres the ineffective counsel claim sam asked still in district court here its a few days behind the other lets file something else okay im working on it work fast ive got eleven days theres a calendar on my wall and i spend at least three hours a day staring at it when i wake up in the morning i make a big x over the date for the day before ive got a circle around august my xs are getting closer to the circle do something im working okay in fact im developing a new theory of attack atta boy i think we can prove youre mentally unbalanced ive been considering that youre old youre senile youre too calm about this something must be wrong youre unable to comprehend the reason for your execution weve been reading the same cases goodman knows an expert wholl say anything for a fee were considering bringing him down here to examine you wonderful ill pull out my hair and chase butterflies around the room i think we can make a hard run at a mental incompetency claim i agree go for it lets file lots of things ill do it sam puffed and pondered for a few minutes they were both sweating and adam needed fresh air he needed to get in his car with the windows up and turn the air on high when are you coming back sam asked monday listen sam this is not a pleasant subject but we need to address it youre gonna die one of these days it might be on august or it might be five years from now at the rate youre smoking you cant last for long smoking is not my most pressing health concern i know but your family lee and i need to make some burial arrangements it cant be done overnight sam stared at the rows of tiny triangles in the screen adam scribbled on a legal pad the air conditioner spewed and hissed accomplishing little your grandmother was a fine lady adam im sorry you didnt know her she deserved better than me lee took me to her grave i caused her a lot of suffering and she bore it well bury me next to her and maybe i can tell her im sorry ill take care of it do that how will you pay for the plot i can handle it sam i dont have any money adam i lost it years ago for reasons which are probably obvious i lost the land and the house so there are no assets to leave behind do you have a will yes i prepared it myself well look at it next week you promise youll be here monday i promise sam can i bring you anything sam hesitated for a second and almost seemed embarrassed you know what id really like he asked with a childish grin what anything sam when i was a kid the greatest thrill in life was an eskimo pie an eskimo pie yeah its a little ice cream treat on a stick vanilla with a chocolate coating i ate them until i came to this place i think they still make them an eskimo pie adam repeated yeah i can still taste it the greatest ice cream in the world can you imagine how good one would taste right now in this oven then sam you shall have an eskimo pie bring more than one ill bring a dozen well eat em right here while we sweat sams second visitor on saturday was not expected he stopped at the guard station by the front gate and produced a north carolina drivers license with his picture on it he explained to the guard that he was the brother of sam cayhall and had been told he could visit sam on death row at his convenience between now and the scheduled execution he had talked to a mr holland somewhere deep in administration yesterday and mr holland had assured him the visitation rules were relaxed for sam cayhall he could visit anytime between h am and pm any day of the week the guard stepped inside and made a phone call five minutes passed as the visitor sat patiently in his rented car the guard made two more calls then copied the registration number of the car onto her clipboard she instructed the visitor to park a few feet away lock his car and wait by the guard station he did so and within a few minutes a white prison van appeared an armed uniformed guard was behind the wheel and he motioned for the visitor to get in the van was cleared through the double gates at msu and driven to the front entrance where two other guards waited they frisked him on the steps he was carrying no packages or bags they led him around the corner and into the empty visitors room he took a seat near the middle of the screen well get sam one of the guards said take about five minutes sam was typing a letter when the guards stopped at his door lets go sam you have a visitor he stopped typing and stared at them his fan was blowing hard and his television was tuned to a baseball game who is it he snapped your brother sam gently placed the typewriter on the bookshelf and grabbed his jumpsuit which brother we didnt ask any questions sam just your brother now come on they handcuffed him and he followed them along the tier sam once had three brothers but his oldest had died of a heart attack before sam was sent to prison donnie the youngest at age sixtyone now lived near durham north carolina albert age sixtyseven was in bad health and lived deep in the woods of rural ford county donnie sent the cigarettes each month along with a few dollars and an occasional note albert hadnt written in seven years a spinster aunt had written until her death in the rest of the cayhalls had forgotten sam it had to be donnie he said to himself donnie was the only one who cared enough to visit he hadnt seen him in two years and he stepped lighter as they neared the door to the visitors room what a pleasant surprise sam stepped through the door and looked at the man sitting on the other side of the screen it was a face he didnt recognize he glanced around the room and confirmed it was empty except for this visitor who at the moment was staring at sam with a cool and even gaze the guards watched closely as they sprung the handcuffs so sam smiled and nodded at the man then he stared at the guards until they left the room and shut the door sam sat opposite his visitor lit a cigarette and said nothing there was something familiar about him but he couldnt identify him they watched each other through the opening in the screen do i know you sam finally asked yes the man answered from where from the past sam from greenville and jackson and vicksburg from the synagogue and the real estate office and the pinder home and marvin kramers wedge the man nodded slowly and sam closed his eyes and exhaled at the ceiling he dropped his cigarette and slumped in his chair god i was hoping you were dead too bad sam glared wildly at him you son of a bitch he said with clenched teeth son of a bitch ive hoped and dreamed for twentythree years that you were dead ive killed you a million times myself with my bare hands with sticks and knives and every weapon known to man ive watched you bleed and ive heard you scream for mercy sorry here i am sam i hate you more than any person has ever been hated if i had a gun right now id blow your sorry ass to hell and back id pump your head full of lead and laugh until i cried god how i hate you do you treat all your visitors like this sam what do you want wedge can they hear us in here they dont give a damn what were saying but this place could be wired you know then leave fool just leave i will in a minute but first i just wanted to say that im here and im watching things real close and im very pleased that my name has not been mentioned i certainly hope this continues ive been very effective at keeping people quiet youre very subtle just take it like a man sam die with dignity you were with me you were an accomplice and a conspirator and under the law youre just as guilty as me sure im a free man but who said life is fair just go on and take our little secret to your grave and no one gets hurt okay where have you been everywhere my names not really wedge sam so dont get any ideas it was never wedge not even dogan knew my real name i was drafted in and i didnt want to go to vietnam so i went to canada and came back to the underground been there ever since i dont exist sam you should be sitting over here no youre wrong i shouldnt and neither should you you were an idiot for going back to greenville the fbi was clueless they never wouldve caught us i was too smart dogan was too smart you however happened to be the weak link it wouldve been the last bombing too you know with the dead bodies and all it was time to quit i fled the country and wouldve never returned to this miserable place you wouldve gone home to your chickens and cows who knows what dogan wouldve done but the reason youre sitting over there sam is because you were a dumbass and youre a dumbass for coming here today not really no one would believe you if you started screaming hell they all think youre crazy anyway but just the same id rather keep things the way they are i dont need the hassle just accept whats coming sam and do it quietly sam carefully lit another cigarette and thumped the ashes in the floor leave wedge and dont ever come back sure i hate to say it sam but i hope they gas you sam stood and walked to the door behind him a guard opened it and took him away they sat in the rear of the cinema and ate popcorn like two teenagers the movie was adams idea shed spent three days in her room with the virus and by saturday morning the binge was over he had selected a family restaurant for dinner one with quick food and no alcohol on the menu shed devoured pecan waffles with whipped cream the movie was a western politically correct with the indians as the good guys and the cowboys as scum all pale faces were evil and eventually killed lee drank two large dr peppers her hair was clean and pulled back over her ears her eyes were clear and pretty again her face was made up and the wounds of the past week were hidden she was as cool as ever in jeans and cotton buttondown and she was sober little had been said about last thursday night when adam slept by the door they had agreed to discuss it later at some distant point in the future when she could handle it that was fine with him she was walking a shaky tightrope teetering on the edge of another plunge into the blackness of dipsomania he would protect her from torment and distress he would make things pleasant and enjoyable no more talk of sam and his killings no more talk of eddie no more cayhall family history she was his aunt and he loved her dearly she was fragile and sick and she needed his strong voice and broad shoulders phillip naifeh awoke in the early hours of sunday morning with severe chest pains and was rushed to the hospital in cleveland he lived in a modern home on the grounds at parchman with his wife of fortyone years the ambulance ride took twenty minutes and he was stable by the time he entered the emergency room on a gurney his wife waited anxiously in the corridor as the nurses scurried about she had waited there before three years earlier with the first heart attack a somberfaced young doctor explained that it was a mild one that he was quite steady and secure and resting comfortably with the aid of medication he would be monitored diligently for the next twentyfour hours and if things went as expected hed be home in less than a week he was absolutely forbidden from getting near parchman and could have nothing to do with the cayhall execution not even a phone call from his bed sleep was becoming a battle adam habitually read for an hour or so in bed and had learned in law school that legal publications were marvelous sleeping aids now however the more he read the more he worried his mind was burdened with the events of the past two weeks the people hed met the things hed learned the places hed been and his mind raced wildly with what was to come he slept fitfully saturday night and was awake for long stretches of time when he finally awoke for the last time the sun was up it was almost eight oclock lee had mentioned the possibility of another foray into the kitchen she had once been quite good with sausage and eggs shed said and anybody could handle canned biscuits but as he pulled up his jeans and slipped on a tee shirt he could smell nothing the kitchen was quiet he called her name as he examined the coffee pot half full her bedroom door was open and the lights were off he quickly checked every room she was not on the patio sipping coffee and reading the paper a sick feeling came over him and grew worse with each empty room he ran to the parking lot no sign of her car he stepped barefoot across the hot asphalt and asked the security guard when shed left he checked a clipboard and said it had been almost two hours ago she appeared to be fine he said he found it on a sofa in the den a threeinch stack of news and ads known as the sunday edition of the memphis press it had been left in a neat pile with the metro section on top lees face was on the front of this section in a photo taken at a charity ball years earlier it was a closeup of mr and mrs phelps booth all smiles for the camera lee was smashing in a strapless black dress phelps was decorated fashionably in black tie they seemed to be a wonderfully happy couple the story was todd marks latest exploitation of the cayhall mess and with each report the series was becoming more tabloidlike it started friendly enough with a weekly summary of the events swirling around the execution the same voices were heard mcallisters roxburghs lucas manns and naifehs steady no comments then it turned meanspirited quickly as it gleefully exposed lee cayhall booth prominent memphis socialite wife of important banker phelps booth of the renowned and rich booth family community volunteer aunt of adam hall and believe it or not daughter of the infamous sam cayhall the story was written as if lee herself were guilty of a terrible crime it quoted alleged friends unnamed of course as being shocked to learn her true identity it talked about the booth family and its money and pondered how a blue blood such as phelps could stoop to marry into a clan such as the cayhalls it mentioned their son walt and again quoted unnamed sources who speculated about his refusal to return to memphis walt had never married it reported breathlessly and lived in amsterdam and then worst of all it quoted another nameless source and told the story of a charity event not too many years ago at which lee and phelps booth were present and sat at a table near ruth kramer the source had also been at the dinner and distinctly remembered where these people had sat the source was a friend of ruths and an acquaintance of lees and was just plain shocked to learn that lee had such a father a smaller photo of ruth kramer accompanied the story she was an attractive woman in her early fifties after the sensational uncovering of lee the story went on to summarize fridays oral argument in new orleans and the latest maneuverings of the cayhall defense taken as a whole it was sleazy narrative that accomplished nothing except that it pushed the daily murder summaries onto the second page adam threw the paper on the floor and sipped coffee she had awakened on this warm sunday clean and sober for the first time in days probably in much better spirits and had settled on the sofa with a fresh cup of coffee and the paper within minutes shed been slapped in the face and kicked in the stomach and now shed left again where did she go during these times where was her sanctuary certainly she stayed away from phelps maybe she had a boyfriend somewhere who took her in and gave her comfort but that was doubtful he prayed she wasnt driving the streets aimlessly with a bottle in her hand no doubt things were hopping around the booth estates this morning their dirty little secret was out plastered on the front page for the world to see how would they cope with the humiliation imagine a booth marrying and producing offspring with such white trash and now everyone knew the family might never recover madame booth was certainly distressed and probably bedridden by now good for them adam thought he showered and changed clothes then lowered the top on the saab he didnt expect to see lees maroon jaguar on the deserted streets of memphis but he drove around anyway he started at front street near the river and with springsteen blaring from the speakers he randomly made his way east past the hospitals on union through the stately homes of midtown and back to the projects near auburn house of course he didnt find her but the drive was refreshing by noon the traffic had resumed and adam went to the office sams only guest on sunday was again an unexpected one he rubbed his wrists when the handcuffs were removed and sat across the screen from the grayhaired man with a jolly face and a warm smile mr cayhall my name is ralph griffin and im the chaplain here at parchman im new so we havent met sam nodded and said nice to meet you my pleasure im sure you knew my predecessor ah yes the right reverend rucker where is he now retired good i never cared for him i doubt if he makes it to heaven yes ive heard he wasnt too popular popular he was despised by everyone here for some reason we didnt trust him dont know why could be because he was in favor of the death penalty can you imagine he was called by god to minister to us yet he believed we should die said it was in the scriptures you know the eye for an eye routine ive heard that before im sure you have what kind of preacher areyou what denomination i was ordained in a baptist church but im sort of nondenominational now i think the lords probably frustrated with all this sectarianism hes frustrated with me too you know hows that youre familiar with randy dupree an inmate here just down the tier from me rape and murder yes ive read his file he was a preacher at onetime we call him preacher boy and hes recently acquired the spiritual gift of interpreting dreams he also sings and heals hed probably play with snakes if they allowed it you know take up the serpents from the book of mark sixteenth chapter eighteenth verse anyway he just finished this long dream took over a month sort of like a miniseries and it eventually was revealed to him that i will in fact be executed and that god is waiting for me to clean up my act it wouldnt be a bad idea you know to get things in order whats the rush i have ten days so you believe in god yes i do do you believe in the death penalty no i dont sam studied him for a while then said are you serious killing is wrong mr cayhall if in fact you are guilty of your crime then you were wrong to kill its also wrong for the government to kill you hallelujah brother ive never been convinced that jesus wanted us to kill as a punishment he didnt teach that he taught love and forgiveness thats the way i read the bible how in hell did you get a job here i have a cousin in the state senate sam smiled and chuckled at this response you wont last long youre too honest no my cousin is the chairman of the committee on corrections and rather powerful then youd better pray he gets reelected i do every morning i just wanted to stop by and introduce myself id like to talk to you during the next few days id like to pray with you if you want ive never been through an execution before neither have l does it scare you im an old man reverend ill be seventy in a few months if i make it at times the thought of dying is quite pleasant leaving this godforsaken place will be a relief but youre still fighting sure though sometimes i dont know why its like a long bout with cancer you gradually decline and grow weak you die a little each day and you reach the point where death would be welcome but no one really wants to die not even me ive read about your grandson that must be heartwarming i know youre proud of him sam smiled and looked at the floor anyway the reverend continued ill be around would you like for me to come back tomorrow that would be nice let me do some thinking okay sure you know the procedures around here dont you during your last few hours youre allowed to have only two people present your lawyer and your spiritual adviser ill be honored to stay with you thanks and can you find the time to talk to randy dupree the poor kid is cracking up and he really needs help ill do it tomorrow thanks adam watched a rented movie by himself with the phone nearby there had been no word from lee at ten he made two calls to the west coast the first was to his mother in portland she was subdued but glad to hear from him she said she did not ask about sam and adam did not offer he reported that he was working hard that he was hopeful and that he would in all likelihood return to chicago in a couple of weeks shed seen a few stories in the papers and she was thinking about him lee was fine adam said the second call was to his younger sister carmen in berkeley a male voice answered the phone in her apartment kevin somebody if adam remembered correctly a steady companion for several years now carmen was soon on the phone and seemed anxious to hear about events in mississippi she too had followed the news closely and adam put an optimistic spin on things she was worried about him down there in the midst of all those horrible kluckers and racists adam insisted he was safe things were quite peaceful actually the people were surprisingly gentle and laidback he was staying at lees and they were making the best of it to adams surprise she wanted to know about sam what was he like his appearance his attitude his willingness to talk about eddie she asked if she should fly down and see sam before august a meeting adam had not contemplated adam said he would think about it and that he would ask sam he fell asleep on the sofa with the television on at threethirty monday morning he was awakened by the phone a voice hed never heard before crisply identified himself as phelps booth you must be adam he said adam sat up and rubbed his eyes yes thats me have you seen lee phelps asked neither calm nor urgent adam glanced at a clock on the wall above the television no whats the matter well shes in trouble the police called me about an hour ago they picked her up for drunk driving at eighttwenty last night and took her to jail oh no adam said this is not the first time she was taken in refused the breath test of course and was put in the drunk tank for five hours she listed my name on the paperwork so the cops called me i ran downtown to the jail and she had already posted bail and walked out i thought maybe shed called you no she was not here when i woke up yesterday morning and this is the first thing ive heard who would she call who knows i hate to start calling her friends and waking them up maybe we should just wait adam was uncomfortable with his sudden inclusion into the decision making these people had been married for better or for worse for almost thirty years and they had obviously been through this before how was he supposed to know what to do she didnt drive away from the jail did she he asked timidly certain of the answer of course not someone picked her up which brings up another problem we need to get her car its in a lot by the jail ive already paid the towing charges do you have a key yes can you help me get it adam suddenly remembered the newspaper story with the smiling photo of phelps and lee and he also remembered his speculation about the booth familys reaction to it he was certain most of the blame and venom had been directed at him if hed stayed in chicago none of this wouldve happened sure just tell me what go wait by the guardhouse ill be there in ten minutes adam brushed his teeth and laced up his nikes and spent fifteen minutes chatting about this and that with willis the guard at the gate a black mercedes the longest model in history approached and stopped adam said goodbye to willis and got in the car they shook hands because it was the polite thing to do phelps was dressed in a white jogging suit and wore a cubs cap he drove slowly on the empty street i guess lee has told you some things about me he said without a trace of concern or regret a few things adam said carefully well theres a lot to tell so im not going to ask what subjects shes covered a very good idea adam thought its probably best if we just talk about baseball or something i take it youre a cubs fan always a cubs fan you sure this is my first season in chicago and ive been to wrigley a dozen times i live pretty close to the park really i go up three or four times a year i have a friend with a box been doing it for years whos your favorite player sandberg i guess how about you i like the old guys ernie banks and ron santo those were the good days of baseball when the players had loyalty and you knew whod be on your team from one year to the next now you never know i love the game but greeds corrupted it it struck adam as odd that phelps booth would denounce greed maybe but the owners wrote the book on greed for the first hundred years of baseball whats wrong with the players asking for all the money they can get whos worth five million a year nobody but if rock stars make fifty whats wrong with baseball players making a few million its entertainment the players are the game not the owners i go to wrigley to see the players not because the tribune happens to be the current owner yeah but look at ticket prices fifteen bucks to watch a game attendance is up the fans dont seem to mind they drove through downtown deserted at four in the morning and within minutes were near the jail listen adam i dont know how much lee has told you about her drinking problem she told me shes an alcoholic definitely this is the second drunk driving charge i was able to keep the first out of the papers but i dont know about this shes suddenly become an item around town thank heaven she hasnt hurt anybody phelps stopped the car at a curb near a fenced lot shes been in and out of recovery half a dozen times half a dozen she told me shed been through treatment three times you cant believe alcoholics i know of at least five times in the past fifteen years her favorite place is a swanky little abuse center called spring creek its on a river a few miles north of the city real nice and peaceful its for the wealthy only they get dried out and pampered good food exercise saunas you know all the bells and whistles its so damned nice i think people want to go there anyway i have a hunch shell turn up there later today she has some friends wholl help her get checked in shes well known around the place sort of a second home how long will she stay there it varies the minimum is a week she has stayed as long as a month costs two thousand bucks a day and of course they send me the bills but i dont mind ill pay any amount to help her what am i supposed to do first we try to find her ill get my secretaries on the phones in a few hours and well track her down shes fairly predictable at this point and im sure shell turn up in a detox ward probably at spring creek ill start pulling strings in a few hours and try to keep it out of the paper it wont be easy in light of everything else thats been printed recently m sorry once we find her you need to go see her take some flowers and candy i know youre busy and i know whats ahead for the next uh nine days nine days right well try to see her and when the thing down at parchman is over i suggest you go back to chicago and leave her alone leave her alone yeah it sounds harsh but its necessary there are many reasons for her many problems ill admit im one of the reasons but theres lots of stuff you dont know her family is another reason she adores you but you also bring back nightmares and a lot of suffering dont think bad of me for saying this i know it hurts but its the truth adam stared at the chainlink fence across the sidewalk next to his door she was sober once for five years phelps continued and we thought shed stay that way forever then sam was convicted and then eddie died when she returned from his funeral she fell into the black hole and i thought many times that shed never get out its best for her if you stay away but i love lee and she loves you but you need to adore her from a distance send her letters and cards from chicago flowers for her birthday call once a month and talk about movies and books but stay away from the family stuff wholl take care of her shes almost fifty years old adam and for the most part shes very independent shes been an alcoholic for many years and theres nothing you or i can do to help her she knows the disease shell stay sober when she wants to stay sober youre not a good influence nor am i im sorry adam breathed deeply and grabbed the door latch im sorry phelps if ive embarrassed you and your family it was not intentional phelps smiled and placed a hand on adams shoulder believe it or not my family is in many ways more dysfunctional than yours weve been through worse that sir is difficult to believe its true phelps handed him a key ring and pointed to a small building inside the fence check in there and theyll show you the car adam opened the door and got out he watched the mercedes ease away and disappear as adam walked through a gate in the fence he couldnt shake the unmistakable feeling that phelps booth actually still loved his wife retired colonel george nugent was barely ruffled by the news of naifehs heart attack the old guy was doing quite well by monday morning resting comfortably and out of danger and what the hell he was only months away from retirement anyway naifeh was a good man but past his usefulness and hanging on simply to bolster his pension nugent was considering a run for the head position if he could get his politics straight now however he was pressed with a more critical matter the cayhall execution was nine days away actually only eight because it was scheduled for one minute after midnight on wednesday of next week which meant that wednesday counted as another day though only one minute of it was used tuesday of next week was actually the last day on his desk was a shiny leatherbound notebook with the words mississippi protocol printed professionally on the front it was his masterpiece the result of two weeks of tedious organizing hed been appalled at the haphazard guides and outlines and checklists thrown together by naifeh for previous executions it was a wonder theyd actually been able to gas anyone but now there was a plan a detailed and carefully arranged blueprint which included everything in his opinion it was two inches thick and a hundred and eighty pages long and of course had his name all over it lucas mann entered his office at fifteen minutes after eight monday morning youre late nugent snapped now a man in charge of things mann was just a simple lawyer nugent was the head of an execution team mann was content with his work nugent had aspirations which in the past twentyfour hours had been bolstered considerably so what mann said as he stood by a chair facing the desk nugent was dressed in his standard dark olive pants with no wrinkles and heavily starched dark olive shirt with gray tee shirt underneath his boots gleamed with heavily buffed polish he marched to a point behind his desk mann hated him we have eight days nugent said as if this were known only to him i think its nine mann said both men were standing next wednesday doesnt count we have eight working days left whatever nugent sat stiffly in his chair two things first here is a manual ive put together for executions a protocol from a to z completely organized indexed crossindexed id like for you to review the statutes contained herein and make sure theyre current mann stared at the black binder but did not touch it and second id like a report each day on the status of all appeals as i understand it there are no legal impediments as of this morning thats correct sir mann answered id like something in writing first thing each morning with the updates then hire yourself a lawyer sir youre not my boss and ill be damned if ill write a little brief for your morning coffee ill let you know if something happens but i wont push paper for you ah the frustrations of civilian life nugent longed for the discipline of the military damned lawyers very well will you please review the protocol mann flipped it open and turned a few pages you know weve managed four executions without all this i find that very surprising frankly frankly i dont weve become quite efficient im sad to say look lucas i dont relish this nugent said wistfully phillip asked me to do it i hope theres a stay i really do but if not then we must be prepared i want this to run smoothly mann acknowledged the obvious lie and picked up the manual nugent had yet to witness an execution and he was counting hours not days he couldnt wait to see sam strapped in the chair sniffing gas lucas nodded and left the office in the hallway he passed bill monday the state executioner no doubt headed to nugents for a quiet pep talk adam arrived at the twig shortly before pm the day had begun with the panic over lees drunk driving mess and had not improved he had been sipping coffee at his desk nursing a headache and trying to do some research when in the span of ten minutes darlene brought a fax from new orleans and a fax from the district court hed lost twice the fifth circuit upheld the decision of the federal court on sams claim that the gas chamber was unconstitutional because it was cruel and obsolete and the district court denied the claim that benjamin keyes had performed ineffectively at trial the headache had suddenly been forgotten within an hour the death clerk mr richard olander had called from washington inquiring about adams plans to appeal and he also wanted to know what other filings might be contemplated by the defense he told adam that there were only eight working days to go you know as if adam had to be reminded thirty minutes after olanders call a clerk at the death desk of the fifth circuit called and asked adam when he planned to appeal the district courts ruling adam had explained to both death clerks at both courts that he was perfecting his appeals as quickly as possible and he would try to file by the end of the day when he stopped to think about it it was a little unnerving practicing law with such an audience at this moment of the process there were courts and justices watching to see what he would do next there were clerks calling and asking what he might be contemplating the reason was obvious and disheartening they werent concerned with whether or not adam would seize the magical issue that would prevent an execution they were concerned only about logistics the death clerks had been instructed by their superiors to monitor the waning days so the courts could rule quickly usually against the inmate these justices did not enjoy reading briefs at three in the morning they wanted copies of all last minute filings on their desks long before the appeals officially arrived phelps had called him at the office just before noon with the news that lee had not been found he had checked every detox and recovery facility within a hundred miles and no one had admitted a lee booth he was still searching but was very busy now with meetings and such sam arrived at the prison library thirty minutes later in a somber mood hed heard the bad news at noon on television on the jackson station that was counting down the days only nine more he sat at the table and stared blankly at adam where are the eskimo pies he asked sadly like a small child who wanted candy adam reached under the table and retrieved a small styrofoam cooler he placed it on the table and opened it they almost confiscated these at the front gate then the guards picked through and threatened to throw them out so enjoy sam grabbed one admired it for a long second then carefully peeled off the wrapper he licked the chocolate coating then took a massive bite he chewed it slowly with his eyes closed minutes later the first eskimo pie was gone and sam started on the second not a good day he said licking the edges adam slid some papers to him here are both decisions short to the point and strongly against us you dont have a lot of friends on these courts sam i know at least the rest of the world adores me i dont wanna read that crap what do we do next were gonna prove youre too crazy to execute that because of your advanced age you dont fully comprehend the nature of your punishment wont work you liked the idea saturday whats happened it wont work why not because im not insane i know full well why im being executed youre doing what lawyers do best dreaming up offbeat theories then finding wacky experts to prove them he took a large bite of ice cream and licked his lips you want me to quit adam snapped sam pondered his yellow fingernails maybe he said quickly running his tongue across a finger adam slid into the seat next to him as opposed to his usual lawyerly position across the table and studied him closely whats the matter sam i dont know ive been thinking im listening when i was very young my best friend was killed in a car wreck he was twentysix had a new wife new child new house his whole life in front of him suddenly he was dead ive outlived him by fortythree years my oldest brother died when he was fiftysix ive outlived him by thirteen years im an old man adam a very old man im tired i feel like giving it up come on sam look at the advantages it takes the pressure off you you wont be forced to spend the next week running crazy and filing useless claims you wont feel like a failure when its over i wont spend my last days praying for a miracle but instead i can get my things in order we can spend more time together itll make a lot of people happy the kramers mcallister roxburgh eighty percent of the american people who favor the death penalty itll be another glorious moment for law and order i can go out with a little dignity instead of looking like a desperate man whos afraid to die its really quite appealing whats happened to you sam last saturday you were still ready to fight the bear im tired of fighting im an old man ive had a long life and what if youre successful in saving my skin where does that leave me im not going anyplace adam youll go back to chicago and bury yourself in your career im sure youll come down whenever you can well write letters and send cards but i have to live on the row you dont you have no idea were not quitting sam we still have a chance its not your decision he finished the second eskimo pie and wiped his mouth with a sleeve i dont like you like this sam i like it when youre mad and nasty and fighting im tired okay you cant let them kill you you have to fight to the bitter end sam why because its wrong its morally wrong for the state to kill you and thats why we cant give up but were gonna lose anyway maybe maybe not but youve been fighting for almost ten years why quit with a week to go because its over adam this thing has finally run its course perhaps but we cant quit please dont throw in the towel hell im making progress ive got these clowns on the run sam offered a gentle smile and a patronizing gaze adam inched closer and placed his hand on sams arm ive thought of several new strategies he said in earnest in fact tomorrow weve got an expert coming to examine you sam looked at him what kind of expert a shrink a shrink yeah from chicago ive already talked to a shrink it didnt go well this guys different he works for us and hell say that youve lost your mental faculties youre assuming i had them when i got here yes were assuming that this psychiatrist will examine you tomorrow then hell quickly prepare a report to the effect that youre senile and insane and just a blithering idiot and who knows what else hell say how do you know hell say this because were paying him to say it whos paying him kravitz bane those dedicated jewishamericans in chicago you hate but whove been busting their asses to keep you alive its goodmans idea actually must be a fine expert we cant be too particular at this point hes been used by some of the other lawyers in the firm on various cases and hell say whatever we want him to say just act bizarre when you talk to him that shouldnt be too difficult tell him all the horror stories about this place make it sound atrocious and deplorable no problem there tell him how youve deteriorated over the years and how its especially hard on a man your age youre by far the oldest one here sam so tell him how its affected you lay it on thick hell fix up a compelling little report and ill run to court with it it wont work its worth a try the supreme court allowed texas to execute a retarded boy this aint texas sam every case is different just work with us on this okay us who is us me and goodman you said you didnt hate him anymore so i figured id let him in on the fun seriously i need help theres too much work for only one lawyer sam scooted his chair away from the table and stood he stretched his arms and legs and began pacing along the table counting steps as he went ill file a petition for cert to the supreme court in the morning adam said as he looked at a checklist on his legal pad they probably wont agree to hear it but ill do it anyway ill also finish the appeal to the fifth circuit on the ineffectiveness claim the shrink will be here tomorrow afternoon ill file the mental competency claim wednesday morning id rather go peacefully adam forget it sam were not quitting i talked to carmen last night and she wants to come see you sam sat on the edge of the table and watched the floor his eyes were narrow and sad he puffed and blew smoke at his feet why would she want to do that i didnt ask why nor did i suggest it she brought it up i told her id ask you ive never met her i know shes your only granddaughter sam and she wants to come i dont want her to see me like this he said waving at his red jumpsuit she wont mind sam reached into the cooler and took another eskimo pie do you want one he asked no what about carmen let me think about it does lee still want to visit uh sure i havent talked to her in a couple of days but im sure she wants to i thought you were staying with her i am shes been out of town let me think about it right now im against it i havent seen lee in almost ten years and i just dont want her to remember me like this tell her im thinking about it but right now i dont think so ill tell her adam promised uncertain if he would see her anytime soon if she had in fact sought treatment she would undoubtedly be secluded for several weeks ill be glad when the end comes adam im really sick of all this he took a large bite of ice cream i understand but lets put it off for a while why why its obvious i dont want to spend my entire legal career encumbered with the knowledge that i lost my first case thats not a bad reason great so were not quitting i guess not bring on the shrink ill act as loony as possible thats more like it lucas mann was waiting for adam at the front gate of the prison it was almost five the temperature still hot and the air still sticky gotta minute he asked through the window of adams car i guess whats up park over there well sit under the shade they walked to a picnic table by the visitors center under a mammoth oak with the highway in view not far away a couple of things mann said hows sam is he holding up okay as well as can be expected why just concerned thats all at last count we had fifteen requests for interviews today things are heating up the press is on its way sam is not talking some want to talk to you im not talking either fine we have a form that sam needs to sign it gives us written authorization to tell the reporters to get lost have you heard about naifeh i saw it in the paper this morning hell be okay but he cant supervise the execution theres a nut named george nugent an assistant superintendent wholl coordinate everything hes a commandant retired military and all a real gungho type it really makes no difference to me he cant carry out the death warrant unless the courts allow it right i just wanted you to know who he was i cant wait to meet him one more thing i have a friend an old buddy from law school who now works in the governors administration he called this morning and it seems as if the governor is concerned about sams execution according to my friend who no doubt was told by the governor to solicit me to speak to you they would like to conduct a clemency hearing preferably in a couple of days are you close to the governor no i despise the governor so do so does my client thats why my friend was recruited to call and lean on me allegedly the governor is having serious doubts about whether sam should be executed do you believe it its doubtful the governors reputation was made at the expense of sam cayhall and im certain hes finetuning his media plan for the next eight days but what is there to lose nothing its not a bad idea im all for it my client however has given me strict orders not to request such a hearing mann shrugged as if he really didnt care what sam did its up to sam then does he have a will yes how about burial arrangements im working on them he wants to be buried in clanton they started walking toward the front gate the body goes to a funeral home in indianola not far from here itll be released to the family there all visitation ends four hours before the scheduled execution from that point on sam can have only two people with him his lawyer and his spiritual adviser he also needs to select his two witnesses if he so chooses ill speak to him we need his approved list of visitors between now and then its usually family and close friends thatll be a very short list i know every occupant of the row knew the procedure though it had never been reduced to writing the veterans including sam had endured four executions over the past eight years and with each the procedure had been followed with small variations the old hands talked and whispered among themselves and they were usually quick to dispense descriptions of the last hours to the new guys most of whom arrived at the row with muted questions about how its done and the guards liked to talk about it the last meal was to be taken in a small room near the front of the row a room referred to simply as the front office it had a desk and some chairs a phone and an air conditioner and it was in this room that the condemned man received his last visitors he sat and listened as his lawyers tried to explain why things were not developing as planned it was a plain room with locked windows the last conjugal visit was held here if in fact the inmate was up to it guards and administrators loitered in the hallway outside the room was not designed for the last hours but when teddy doyle meeks became the first in many years to be executed in such a room was suddenly needed for all sorts of purposes it once belonged to a lieutenant then a case manager it had no other name except for the front office the phone on the desk was the last one used by the inmates lawyer when he received the final word that there would be no more stays no more appeals he then made the long walk back to tier a to the far end where his client waited in the observation cell the observation cell was nothing more than a regular cell on tier a just eight doors down from sam it was six by nine with a bunk a sink and a toilet just like sams just like all the others it was the last cell on the tier and the nearest to the isolation room which was next to the chamber room the day before the execution the inmate was to be taken for the last time from his cell and placed in observation his personal belongings were to be moved too which was usually a quick task there he waited usually he watched his own private drama on television as the local television stations monitored his last ditch appeals his lawyer waited with him seated on the flimsy bed in the dark cell watching the news reports the lawyer ran back and forth to the front office a minister or spiritual adviser was also allowed in the cell the row would be dark and deathly quiet some of the inmates would hover above their televisions others would hold hands and pray through the bars others would lie on their beds and wonder when their time would come the outside windows above the hallway were all closed and bolted the row was locked down but there were voices between the tiers and there were lights from the outside for men who sit for hours in tiny cells seeing and hearing everything the flurry of strange activity was nerveracking at eleven the warden and his team would enter tier a and stop at the observation cell by now the hope of a last minute stay was virtually exhausted the inmate would be sitting on his bed holding hands with his lawyer and his minister the warden would announce that it was time to go to the isolation room the cell door would clang and open and the inmate would step into the hallway there would be shouts of support and reassurance from the other inmates many of whom would be in tears the isolation room is no more than twenty feet from the observation cell the inmate would walk through the center of two rows of armed and bulky security guards the largest the warden could find there was never any resistance it wouldnt do any good the warden would lead the inmate into a small room ten feet by ten with nothing in it except a foldaway bed the inmate would sit on the bed with his lawyer by his side at this point the warden for some baffling reason would feel the need to spend a few moments with the inmate as if he the warden was the last person the inmate wanted to chat with the warden eventually would leave the room would be quiet except for an occasional bang or knock from the room next door prayers were normally completed at this point there were just minutes to go next door to the isolation room was the chamber room itself it was approximately fifteen feet by twelve with the gas chamber in the center of it the executioner would be hard at work while the inmate prayed in isolation the warden the prison attorney the doctor and a handful of guards would be making preparations there would be two telephones on the wall for the last minute clearance there was a small room to the left where the executioner mixed his solutions behind the chamber was a series of three windows eighteen inches by thirty and covered for the moment by black drapes on the other side of the windows was the witness room at twenty minutes before midnight the doctor would enter the isolation room and attach a stethoscope to the inmates chest he would leave and the warden would enter to take the condemned man to see the chamber the chamber room was always filled with people all anxious to help all about to watch a man die they would back him into the chamber strap him in close the door and kill him it was a fairly straightforward procedure varied a bit to accommodate the individual case for example buster moac was in the chair with half the straps in place when the phone rang in the chamber room he went back to the isolation room and waited six miserable hours until they came for him again jumbo parris was the smartest of the four a longtime drug user before he made it to the row he began asking the psychiatrist for valium days before his execution he chose to spend his last hours alone no lawyer or minister and when they came to fetch him from the observation cell he was stoned he had evidently stockpiled the valium and had to be dragged to the isolation room where he slept in peace he was then dragged to the chamber and given his final dosage it was a humane and thoughtful procedure the inmate remained in his cell next to his pals up to the very end in louisiana they were removed from the row and placed in a small building known as the death house they spent their final three days there under constant supervision in virginia they were moved to another city sam was eight doors from the observation cell about fortyeight feet then another twenty feet to the isolation room then another twelve feet to the chamber from a point in the center of his bed hed calculated many times that he was approximately eightyfive feet from the gas chamber and he made the calculation again tuesday morning as he carefully made an x on his calendar eight days it was dark and hot he had slept off and on and spent most of the night sitting in front of his fan breakfast and coffee were an hour away now this would be day number on the row and the total did not include time spent in the county jail in greenville during his first two trials only eight more days his sheets were soaked with sweat and as he lay on the bed and watched the ceiling for the millionth time he thought of death the actual act of dying would not be too terrible for obvious reasons no one knew the exact effects of the gas maybe they would give him an extra dose so hed be dead long before his body twitched and jerked maybe the first breath would knock him senseless at any rate it wouldnt take long he hoped hed watched his wife shrivel and suffer greatly from cancer hed watched kinfolks grow old and vegetate surely this was a better way to go sam j b gullitt whispered you up sam walked to his door and leaned through the bars he could see gullitts hands and forearms yeah im up cant seem to sleep he lit the first cigarette of the day me neither tell me its not gonna happen sam its not gonna happen you serious yeah im serious my lawyers about to unload the heavy stuff hell probably walk me outta here in a coupla weeks then why cant you sleep im so excited about gettin out have you talked to him about my case not yet hes got a lot on his mind as soon as i get out well go to work on your case just relax try and get some sleep gullitts hands and forearms slowly withdrew then his bed squeaked sam shook his head at the kids ignorance he finished the cigarette and thumped it down the hall a breach of the rules which would earn him a violation report as if he cared he carefully took his typewriter from the shelf he had things to say and letters to write there were people out there he needed to speak to george nugent entered the maximum security unit like a fivestar general and glared disapprovingly at the hair and then at the unshined boots of a white security guard get a haircut he growled or ill write you up and work on those boots yes sir the kid said and almost saluted nugent jerked his head and nodded at packer who led the way through the center of the row to tier a number six packer said as the door opened stay here nugent instructed his heels clicked as he marched along the tier gazing with disdain into each cell he stopped at sams and peered inside sam was stripped to his boxers his thin and wrinkled skin gleaming with sweat as he pecked away he looked at the stranger staring at him through the bars then returned to his work sam my name is george nugent sam hit a few keys the name was not familiar but sam assumed he worked somewhere up the ladder since he had access to the tiers what do you want sam asked without looking well i wanted to meet you my pleasure now shove off gullitt to the right and henshaw to the left were suddenly leaning through the bars just a few feet from nugent they snickered at sams response nugent glared at them and cleared his throat im an assistant superintendent and phillip naifeh has placed me in charge of your execution there are a few things we need to discuss sam concentrated on his correspondence and cursed when he hit a wrong key nugent waited if i could have a few minutes of your valuable time sam better call him mr cayhall henshaw added helpfully hes a few years older than you and it means a lot to him whered you get those boots gullitt asked staring at nugents feet you boys back away nugent said sternly i need to talk to sam mr cayhalls busy right now henshaw said perhaps you should come back later ill be happy to schedule an appointment for you are you some kinda military asshole gullitt asked nugent stood stiffly and glanced to his right and to his left im ordering you two to get back okay i need to speak to sam we dont take orders henshaw said and whatre you gonna do about it gullitt asked throw us in solitary feed us roots and berries chain us to the walls why dont you just go ahead and kill us sam placed his typewriter on the bed and walked to the bars he took a long drag and shot smoke through them in the general direction of nugent what do you want he demanded i need a few things from you such as do you have a will thats none of your damned business a will is a private document to be seen only if its probated and its probated only after a person dies thats the law what a dumbass henshaw shrieked i dont believe this gullitt offered where did naifeh find this idiot he asked anything else sam asked nugents face was changing colors we need to know what to do with your things its in my will okay i hope youre not going to be difficult sam its mr cayhall henshaw said again difficult sam asked why would i be difficult i intend to cooperate fully with the state while it goes about its business of killing me im a good patriot i would vote and pay taxes if i could im proud to be an american an irishamerican and at this moment im still very much in love with my precious state even though it plans to gas me im a model prisoner george no problems out of me packer was thoroughly enjoying this as he waited at the end of the tier nugent stood firm i need a list of the people you want to witness the execution he said youre allowed two im not giving up yet george lets wait a few days fine ill also need a list of your visitors for the next few days well this afternoon i have this doctor coming down from chicago you see hes a psychiatrist and hes gonna talk to me and see how nutty i really am then my lawyers will run to court and say that you george cant execute me because im crazy hell have time to examine you if you want it wont take long henshaw and gullitt horselaughed and within seconds most of the other inmates on the tier were chiming in and cackling loudly nugent took a step backward and scowled up and down the tier quiet he demanded but the laughter increased sam continued puffing and blowing smoke through the bars catcalls and insults could be heard amid the ruckus ill be back nugent shouted angrily at sam he shall return henshaw yelled and the commotion grew even louder the commandant stormed away and as he marched swiftly to the end of the hall shouts of heil hitler rang through the tier sam smiled at the bars for a moment as the noise died then returned to his position on the edge of the bed he took a bite of dry toast a sip of cold coffee he resumed his typing the afternoon drive to parchman was not a particularly pleasant one garner goodman sat in the front seat as adam drove and they talked strategy and brainstormed about the last minute appeals and procedures goodman planned to return to memphis over the weekend and be available during the last three days the psychiatrist was dr swinn a cold unsmiling man in a black suit he had wild bushy hair dark eyes hidden behind thick glasses and was completely incapable of small talk his presence in the backseat was discomfiting he did not utter a single word from memphis to parchman the examination had been arranged by adam and lucas mann to take place in the prison hospital a remarkably modern facility dr swinn had very plainly informed adam that neither he nor goodman could be present during his evaluation of sam and this was perfectly fine with adam and goodman a prison van met them at the front gate and carried dr swinn to the hospital deep inside the farm goodman had not seen lucas mann in several years they shook hands like old friends and immediately lapsed into war stories about executions the conversation was kept away from sam and adam appreciated it they walked from manns office across a parking lot to a small building behind the administration complex the building was a restaurant designed along the lines of a neighborhood tavern called the place it served basic food to the office workers and prison employees no alcohol it was on state property they drank iced tea and talked about the future of capital punishment both goodman and mann agreed that executions would soon become even more commonplace the us supreme court was continuing its swing to the right and it was weary of the endless appeals ditto for the lower levels of the federal judiciary plus american juries were becoming increasingly reflective of societys intolerance of violent crime there was much less sympathy for death row inmates a much greater desire to fry the bastards fewer federal dollars were being spent to fund groups opposed to the death penalty and fewer lawyers and their firms were willing to make the enormous pro bono commitments the death row population was growing faster than the number of lawyers willing to take capital cases adam was quite bored with the conversation hed read and heard it a hundred times he excused himself and found a pay phone in a corner phelps was not in a young secretary said but hed left a message for adam no word from lee she was scheduled to be in court in two weeks maybe shed turn up then darlene typed dr swinns report while adam and garner goodman worked on the petition to accompany it the report was twenty pages long in rough draft and sounded like soft music swinn was a hired gun a prostitute whod sell an opinion to the highest bidder and adam detested him and his ilk he roamed the country as a professional testifier able to say this today and that tomorrow depending on who had the deepest pockets but for the moment he was their whore and he was quite good sam was suffering from advanced senility his mental faculties had eroded to the point where he did not know and appreciate the nature of his punishment he lacked the requisite competence to be executed and therefore the execution would not serve any purpose it was not an entirely unique legal argument nor had the courts exactly embraced it but as adam found himself saying every day what was there to lose goodman seemed to be more than a little optimistic primarily because of sams age he could not recall an execution of a man over the age of fifty they darlene included worked until almost eleven garner goodman did not return to chicago wednesday morning but instead flew to jackson mississippi the flight took thirty minutes hardly time for a cup of coffee and an unthawed croissant he rented a car at the airport and drove straight to the state capitol the legislature was not in session and there were plenty of parking places on the grounds like many county courthouses rebuilt after the civil war the capitol defiantly faced south he stopped to admire the war monument to southern women but spent more time studying the splendid japanese magnolias at the bottom of the front steps four years earlier during the days and hours prior to the maynard tole execution goodman had made this same journey on two occasions there was a different governor then a different client and a different crime tole had murdered several people in a twoday crime spree and it had been quite difficult to arouse sympathy for him he hoped sam cayhall was different he was an old man whod probably die within five years anyway his crime was ancient history to many mississippians and on and on goodman had been rehearsing his routine all morning he entered the capitol building and once again marveled at its beauty it was a smaller version of the us capitol in washington and no expense had been spared it had been built in with prison labor the state had used the proceeds from a successful lawsuit against a railroad to construct itself this monument he entered the governors office on the second floor and handed his card to the lovely receptionist the governor was not in this morning she said and did he have an appointment no goodman explained pleasantly but it was very important and would it be possible for him to see mr andy larramore chief counsel for the governor he waited as she made several calls and half an hour later mr larramore presented himself they made their introductions and disappeared into a narrow hallway that ran through a maze of small offices larramores cubbyhole was cluttered and disorganized much like the man himself he was a small guy with a noticeable bend at the waist and absolutely no neck his long chin rested on his chest and when he talked his eyes nose and mouth all squeezed together tightly it was a horrible sight goodman couldnt tell if he was thirty or fifty he had to be a genius the governor is speaking to a convention of insurance agents this morning larramore said holding an itinerary as if it were a piece of fine jewelry and then he visits a public school in the inner city ill wait goodman said its very important and i dont mind hanging around larramore placed the sheet of paper aside and folded his hands on the table what happened to that young fellow sams grandson oh hes still lead counsel im the director of pro bono for kravitz bane so im here to assist him were monitoring this thing very closely larramore said his face wrinkling fiercely in the center then relaxing at the end of each sentence looks like it will go down to the wire they always do goodman said how serious is the governor about a clemency hearing im sure hell entertain the idea of a hearing the granting of clemency is an entirely different matter the statute is very broad as im sure you know he can commute the death sentence and instantly parole the convict he can commute it to life in prison or something less than that goodman nodded will it be possible for me to see him hes scheduled to return here at eleven ill speak to him then hell probably eat lunch at his desk so there may be a gap around one can you be here yes this must be kept quiet our client is very much opposed to this meeting is he opposed to the idea of clemency we have seven days to go mr larramore were not opposed to anything larramore crinkled his nose and exposed his upper teeth and picked up the itinerary again be here at one ill see what i can do thanks they chatted aimlessly for five minutes then larramore was besieged by a series of urgent phone calls goodman excused himself and left the capitol he paused again at the japanese magnolias and removed his jacket it was ninethirty and his shirt was wet under the arms and sticking to his back he walked south in the general direction of capitol street four blocks away and considered to be the main street of jackson in the midst of the buildings and traffic of downtown the governors mansion sat majestically on manicured grounds and faced the capitol it was a large antebellum home surrounded by gates and fences a handful of death penalty opponents had gathered on the sidewalk the night tole was executed and yelled at the governor evidently he had not heard them goodman stopped on the sidewalk and remembered the mansion he and peter wiesenberg had walked hurriedly through a gate to the left of the main drive with their last plea just hours before tole was gassed the governor at that time was having a late dinner with important people and had become quite irritated with their interruption he denied their final request for clemency then in the finest southern tradition invited them to stay for dinner theyd politely declined goodman explained to his honor that they had to hurry back to parchman to be with their client as he died be careful the governor had told them then returned to his dinner party goodman wondered how many protestors would be standing on this spot in a few short days chanting and praying and burning candles waving placards and yelling at mcallister to spare old sam probably not very many there has seldom been a shortage of office space in the central business district in jackson and goodman had little trouble finding what he wanted a sign directed his attention to vacant footage on the third floor of an ugly building he inquired at the front desk of a finance company on the ground level and an hour later the owner of the building arrived and showed him the available space it was a dingy tworoom suite with worn carpet and holes in the wallboard goodman walked to the lone window and looked at the front of the capitol building three blocks away perfect he said its three hundred a month plus electricity rest rooms down the hall sixmonth minimum i need it for only two months goodman said reaching into his pocket and withdrawing a neatly folded collection of cash the owner looked at the money and asked what kind of business are you in marketing analysis where are you from detroit were thinking about establishing a branch in this state and we need this space to get started but for only two months all cash nothing in writing well be out before you know it wont make a sound the owner took the cash and handed goodman two keys one for the office the other for the entrance on congress street they shook hands and the deal was closed goodman left the dump and returned to his car at the capitol along the way he chuckled at the scheme he was pursuing the idea was adams brainchild another long shot in a series of desperate plots to save sam there was nothing illegal about it the cost would be slight and who cared about a few dollars at this point he was after all mr pro bono at the firm the source of great pride and selfrighteousness among his peers nobody not even daniel rosen would question his expenditures for a little rent and a few phones after three weeks as a death row lawyer adam was beginning to yearn for the predictability of his office in chicago if in fact he still had an office before ten oclock wednesday he had finished a claim for postconviction relief he had talked with various court clerks four times then with a court administrator he had talked with richard olander in washington twice concerning the habeas claim attacking the gas chamber and he had talked with a clerk at the death desk at the fifth circuit in new orleans regarding the ineffectiveness claim the claim alleging sams lack of mental competence was now in jackson by fax with the original to follow by fedex and adam was forced to politely beg the courts administrator to speed things up hurry up and deny it he said though not in those words if a stay of execution was forthcoming it would in all likelihood be issued by a federal judge each new claim brought with it a scant new ray of hope and as adam was quickly learning also the potential for another loss a claim had to clear four obstacles before it was extinguished the mississippi supreme court the federal district court the fifth circuit and the us supreme court so the odds were against success especially at this stage of the appeals sams bread and butter issues had been litigated thoroughly by wallace tyner and garner goodman years ago adam was now filing the crumbs the clerk at the fifth circuit doubted if the court would care to indulge in another oral argument especially since it appeared that adam would be filing new claims every day the threejudge panel would probably consider only the briefs conference calls would be used if the judges wished to hear his voice richard olander called again to say the supreme court had received adams petition for cert or request to hear the case and that it had been assigned no he did not think the court would care to hear oral argument not this late in the game he also informed adam that he had received by fax a copy of the new claim of mental incompetency and that he would monitor it through the local courts interesting he said he asked again what new claims adam might be contemplating but adam wouldnt say judge slatterys law clerk breck jefferson he of the permanent scowl called to inform adam that his honor had received by fax a copy of the new claim filed with the mississippi supreme court and frankly his honor didnt think much of it but would nonetheless give it full consideration once it arrived in their court adam took a little satisfaction in the knowledge that he had managed to keep four very different courts hopping at the same time at eleven morris henry the infamous dr death in the attorney generals office called to inform adam that they had received the latest round of gangplank appeals as he enjoyed calling them and mr roxburgh himself had assigned a dozen lawyers to produce the responding paperwork henry was nice enough on the phone but the call had made its point we have lots of lawyers adam the paperwork was being generated by the pound now and the small conference table was covered with neat stacks of it darlene was in and out of the office constantly making copies delivering phone messages fetching coffee proofreading briefs and petitions shed been trained in the tedious field of government bonds so the detailed and voluminous documents did not intimidate her she confessed more than once that this was an exciting change from her normal drudgery whats more exciting than a looming execution adam asked even baker cooley managed to tear himself away from the latest updates in federal banking regulations and popped in for a look phelps called around eleven to ask if adam wanted to meet for lunch adam did not and begged off by blaming deadlines and cranky judges neither had heard from lee phelps said shed disappeared before but never for more than two days he was worried and thinking about hiring a private investigator hed keep in touch theres a reporter here to see you darlene said handing him a business card declaring the presence of anne l piazza correspondent for newsweek she was the third reporter whod contacted the office on wednesday tell her im sorry adam said with no regret i did that already but i thought that since it was newsweek you might wanna know i dont care who it is tell her the clients not talking either she left in a hurry as the phone was ringing it was goodman reporting from jackson that he was to see the governor at one adam brought him up to date on the flurry of activity and phone calls darlene delivered a deli sandwich at twelvethirty adam ate it quickly then napped in a chair as his computer spewed forth another brief goodman flipped through a car magazine as he waited alone in the reception area next to the governors office the same pretty secretary worked on her nails between phone calls at her switchboard one oclock came and went without comment same for onethirty the receptionist now with glorious peach nails apologized at two no problem said goodman with a warm smile the beauty of a pro bono career was that labor was not measured by time success meant helping people regardless of hours billed at twofifteen an intense young woman in a dark suit appeared from nowhere and walked to goodman mr goodman im mona stark the governors chief of staff the governor will see you now she smiled correctly and goodman followed her through a set of double doors and into a long formal room with a desk at one end and a conference table far away at the other mcallister was standing by the window with his jacket off tie loosened sleeves up very much the beleaguered and overworked servant of the people hello mr goodman he said with a hand thrust forward and teeth flashing brilliantly governor my pleasure goodman said he had no briefcase no standard lawyer accessories he looked as if hed simply passed by on the street and decided to stop and meet the governor youve met mr larramore and ms stark mcallister said waving a hand at each yes weve met thanks for seeing me on such short notice goodman tried to match his dazzling smile but it was hopeless at the moment he was most humble and appreciative just to be in this great office lets sit over here the governor said waving at the conference table and leading the way the four of them sat on separate sides of the table larramore and mona withdrew pens and were poised for serious notetaking goodman had nothing but his hands in front of him i understand thereve been quite of lot of filings in the past few days mcallister said yes sir just curious have you been through one of these before goodman asked no thankfully well this is not unusual im certain well be filing petitions until the last moment can i ask you something mr goodman the governor said sincerely certainly i know youve handled many of these cases whats your prediction at this point how close will it get you never know sams a bit different from most inmates on death row because hes had good lawyers good trial counsel then superb appellate work by you i believe goodman smiled then mcallister smiled then mona managed a grin larramore remained hunched over his legal pad his face contorted in furious concentration thats right so sams major claims have already been ruled on what youre seeing now are the desperate moves but they often work id say fiftyfifty today seven days away mona quickly recorded this on paper as if it carried some enormous legal significance larramore had written every word so far mcallister thought about it for a few seconds im a little confused mr goodman your client does not know were meeting hes opposed to the idea of a clemency hearing you want this meeting kept quiet so why are we here things change governor again ive been here many times before ive watched men count down their last days it does strange things to the mind people change as the lawyer i have to cover every base every angle are you asking for a hearing yes sir a closed hearing when what about friday in two days mcallister said as he gazed through a window larramore cleared his throat and asked what sort of witnesses do you anticipate good question if i had names id give them to you now but i dont our presentation will be brief who will testify for the state mcallister asked larramore whose moist teeth glistened as he pondered goodman looked away im certain the victims family will want to say something the crime is usually discussed someone from the prison might be needed to discuss the type of inmate hes been these hearings are quite flexible i know more about the crime than anyone mcallister said almost to himself its a strange situation goodman confessed ive had my share of clemency hearings and the prosecutor is usually the first witness to testify against the defendant in this case you were the prosecutor why do you want the hearing closed the governor has long been an advocate of open meetings mona added its really best for everyone goodman said much like the learned professor its less pressure on you governor because its not exposed and you dont have a lot of unsolicited advice we of course would like for it to be closed why mcallister asked well frankly sir we dont want the public to see ruth kramer talking about her little boys goodman watched them as he delivered this the real reason was something else altogether adam was convinced that the only way to talk sam into a clemency hearing was to promise him it would not be a public spectacle if such a hearing was closed then adam could maybe convince sam that mcallister would be prevented from grandstanding goodman knew dozens of people around the country who would gladly come to jackson on a moments notice to testify on sams behalf he had heard these people make some persuasive last minute arguments against death nuns priests ministers psychologists social workers authors professors and a couple of former death row inmates dr swinn would testify about how dreadfully sam was doing these days and he would do an excellent job of trying to convince the governor that the state was about to kill a vegetable in most states the inmate has a right to a last minute clemency hearing usually before the governor in mississippi however the hearing was discretionary i guess that makes sense the governor actually said theres enough interest already goodman said knowing that mcallister was giddy with dreams of the forthcoming media frenzy it will benefit no one if the hearing is open mona the staunch open meetings advocate frowned even harder and wrote something in block letters mcallister was deep in thought regardless of whether its open or closed he said theres no real reason for such a hearing unless you and your client have something new to add i know this case mr goodman i smelled the smoke i saw the bodies i cannot change my mind unless theres something new such as such as a name you give me the name of sams accomplice and ill agree to a hearing no promise of clemency you understand just a regular clemency hearing otherwise this is a waste of time do you believe there was an accomplice goodman asked we were always suspicious what do you think why is it important its important because i make the final decision mr goodman after the courts are finished with it and the clock ticks down next tuesday night im the only person in the world who can stop it if sam deserves the death penalty then i have no problem sitting by while it happens but if he doesnt then the execution should be stopped im a young man i do not want to be haunted by this for the rest of my life i want to make the right decision but if you believe there was an accomplice and you obviously do then why not stop it anyway because i want to be sure youve been his lawyer for many years do you think he had an accomplice yes ive always thought there were two of them i dont know who was the leader and who was the follower but sam had help mcallister leaned closer to goodman and looked into his eyes mr goodman if sam will tell me the truth then i will grant a closed hearing and i will consider clemency im not promising a damned thing you understand only that well have the hearing otherwise theres nothing new to add to the story mona and larramore scribbled faster than court reporters sam says hes telling the truth then forget the hearing im a busy man goodman sighed in frustration but kept a smile in place very well well talk to him again can we meet here again tomorrow the governor looked at mona who consulted a pocket calendar and began shaking her head as if tomorrow was hopelessly filled with speeches and appearances and meetings youre booked she said in a commanding tone what about lunch nope wouldnt work youre speaking to the nra convention why dont you call me larramore offered good idea the governor said standing now and buttoning his sleeves goodman stood and shook hands with the three ill call if something breaks we are requesting a hearing as soon as possible regardless the request is denied unless sam talks said the governor please put the request in writing sir if you dont mind larramore asked certainly they walked goodman to the door and after he left the office mcallister sat in his official chair behind his desk he unbuttoned his sleeves again larramore excused himself and went to his little room down the hall ms stark studied a printout while the governor watched the rows of buttons blink on his phone how many of these calls are about sam cayhall he asked she moved a finger along a column yesterday you had twentyone calls regarding the cayhall execution fourteen in favor of gassing him five said to spare him two couldnt make up their minds thats an increase yeah but the paper had that article about sams last ditch efforts it mentioned the possibility of a clemency hearing what about the polls no change ninety percent of the white people in this state favor the death penalty and about half the blacks do overall its around eightyfour percent wheres my approval sixtytwo but if you pardon sam cayhall im sure itll drop to single digits so youre against the idea theres absolutely nothing to gain and much to lose forget polls and numbers if you pardon one of those thugs up there youll have the other fifty sending lawyers and grandmothers and preachers down here begging for the same favor you have enough on your mind its foolish yeah youre right wheres the media plan ill have it in an hour i need to see it nagels putting the final touches on it i think you should grant the request for a clemency hearing anyway but hold it monday announce it tomorrow let it simmer over the weekend it shouldnt be closed hell no we want ruth kramer crying for the cameras its my hearing sam and his lawyers will not dictate its conditions if they want it theyll do it my way right but keep in mind you want it too tons of coverage goodman signed a threemonth lease for four cellular phones he used a kravitz bane credit card and deftly dodged the barrage of questions by the chirpy young salesman he went to a public library on state street and found a reference table filled with phonebooks judging by their thickness he selected those of the larger mississippi towns places like laurel hattiesburg tupelo vicksburg biloxi and meridian then he picked the thinner ones tunica calhoun city bude long beach west point at the information desk he converted bills to quarters and spent two hours copying pages from the phonebooks he went merrily about his work no one wouldve believed the natty little man with bushy gray hair and bow tie was in fact a partner in a major chicago firm with secretaries and paralegals at his beck and call no one wouldve believed he earned over four hundred thousand dollars a year and he couldnt have cared less e garner goodman was happy with his work he was trying his best to save another soul from being legally killed he left the library and drove a few blocks to the mississippi college school of law a professor there by the name of john bryan glass taught criminal procedure and law and also had begun publishing scholarly articles against the death penalty goodman wanted to make his acquaintance and to see if maybe the professor had a few bright students interested in a research project the professor was gone for the day but scheduled to teach a am class on thursday goodman checked out the law schools library then left the building he drove a few blocks to the old state capitol building just killing time and took an extended tour of it it lasted for thirty minutes half of which was spent at the civil rights exhibit on the ground floor he asked the clerk in the gift shop about a bed and breakfast and she suggested the millsapsbuie house about a mile down the street he found the lovely victorian mansion just where shed said and took the last vacant room the house was immaculately restored with period pieces and furnishings the butler fixed him a scotch and water and he took it to his room the auburn house opened for business at eight a feeble and dispirited security guard in a bad uniform unlocked the gate across the drive and adam was the first person into the parking lot he waited in his car for ten minutes until another parked nearby he recognized the woman as the counselor hed met in lees office two weeks earlier he stopped her on the sidewalk as she was entering a side door excuse me he said weve met before im adam hall lees nephew im sorry but i dont remember your name the lady held a worn briefcase in one hand and a brown lunch bag in the other she smiled and said joyce cobb i remember wheres lee i dont know i was hoping you might know something you havent heard from her no not since tuesday tuesday i havent talked to her since saturday did you talk to her tuesday she called here but i didnt talk to her it was the day they ran that drunk driving story in the paper where was she she never said she asked for the administrator said she would be out for a while had to get some help stuff like that never said where she was or when she was coming back what about her patients were covering for her its always a struggle you know but well manage lee wouldnt forget these girls do you think maybe shes talked to them this week look adam most of these girls dont have phones okay and lee certainly would not go into the projects were seeing her girls and i know they havent talked to her adam took a step back and looked at the gate i know i need to find her im really worried shell be okay shes done this once before and everything worked out joyce was suddenly in a hurry to get inside if i hear something ill let you know please do im staying at her place i know adam thanked her and drove away by nine he was at the office buried in paper colonel nugent sat at the end of along table in the front of a room filled with guards and staff people the table was on a slight platform twelve inches above the rest of the room and behind it on the wall was a large chalkboard a portable podium sat in a corner the chairs along the table to his right were empty so that the guards and staff sitting in the folding chairs could see the faces of the more important ones on nugents left morris henry from the attorney generals office was there thick briefs lying before him lucas mann sat at the far end taking notes two assistant superintendents were next to henry a flunkie from the governors office was next to lucas nugent glanced at his watch then began his little pep talk he referred to his notes and aimed his comments at the guards and staff as of this morning august all stays have been lifted by the various courts and theres nothing to stop the execution we are proceeding as if it will take place as planned at one minute after midnight next wednesday we have six full days to prepare and i am determined for this thing to take place smoothly without a hitch the inmate has at least three petitions and appeals currently working their way through the various courts and of course theres no way to predict what might happen we are in constant contact with the attorney generals office in fact mr morris henry is here with us today it is his opinion and an opinion shared by mr lucas mann that this thing will go down to the wire a stay could be granted at any moment but that looks doubtful we have to be ready regardless the inmate is also expected to request a clemency hearing from the governor but frankly that is not expected to be successful from now until next wednesday we will be in a state of preparedness nugents words were strong and clear he had center stage and was obviously enjoying every moment of it he glanced at his notes and continued the gas chamber itself is being prepared its old and it hasnt been used in two years so were being very careful with it a representative of the manufacturer arrives this morning and will conduct tests today and tonight well go through a complete rehearsal of the execution over the weekend probably sunday night assuming theres no stay i have collected the lists of volunteers for the execution team and ill make that determination this afternoon now were being inundated with requests from the media for all sorts of things they want to interview mr cayhall his lawyer our lawyer the warden the guards other inmates on the row the executioner everybody they want to witness the execution they want pictures of his cell and the chamber typical media silliness but we must deal with it there is to be no contact with any member of the press unless i first approve it that goes for every employee of this institution no exceptions most of these reporters are not from around here and they get their jollies making us look like a bunch of ignorant rednecks so dont talk to them no exceptions ill issue the appropriate releases when i deem necessary be careful with these people theyre vultures were also expecting trouble from the outside as of about ten minutes ago the first group of ku klux klansmen arrived at the front gate they were directed to the usual spot between the highway and the administration building where the protests take place weve also heard that other such groups will be here shortly and it appears as if they plan to protest until this thing is over well watch them closely they have the right to do this so long as its peaceful though i wasnt here for the last four executions ive been told that groups of death penalty supporters usually show up and raise hell we plan to keep these two groups separated for obvious reasons nugent couldnt sit any longer and stood stiffly at the end of the table all eyes were on him he studied his notes for a second this execution will be different because of mr cayhalls notoriety it will attract a lot of attention a lot of media a lot of other loonies we must act professionally at all times and i will not tolerate any breach of the rules of conduct mr cayhall and his family are entitled to respect during these last few days no offcolor comments about the gas chamber or the execution i will not stand for it any questions nugent surveyed the room and was quite pleased with himself hed covered it all no questions very well well meet again in the morning at nine he dismissed them and the room emptied hurriedly garner goodman caught professor john bryan glass as he was leaving his office and headed for a lecture the class was forgotten as the two stood in the hallway and swapped compliments glass had read all of goodmans books and goodman had read most of glass recent articles condemning the death penalty the conversation quickly turned to the cayhall mess and specifically to goodmans pressing need for a handful of trustworthy law students who could assist with a quick research project over the weekend glass offered his help and the two agreed to have lunch in a few hours to pursue the matter three blocks from the mississippi college school of law goodman found the small and cramped offices of southern capital defense group a quasi federal agency with small cramped offices in every state in the death belt the director was a young black yaleeducated lawyer named hez kerry who had forsaken the riches of the big firms and dedicated his life to abolishing the death penalty goodman had met him on two prior occasions at conferences though kerrys group as it was referred to did not directly represent every inmate on death row it did have the responsibility of monitoring every case hez was thirtyone years old and aging quickly the gray hair was evidence of the pressure of fortyseven men on death row on a wall above the secretarys desk in the foyer was a small calendar and across the top of it someone had printed the words birthdays on death row everybody got a card nothing more the budget was tight and the cards were usually purchased with pocket change collected around the office the group had two lawyers working under kerrys supervision and only one fulltime secretary a few students from the law school worked several hours a week for free goodman talked with hez kerry for more than an hour they planned their movements for next tuesday kerry himself would camp out at the clerks office at the mississippi supreme court goodman would stay at the governors office john bryan glass would be recruited to sit in the fifth circuits satellite office in the federal courthouse in jackson one of goodmans former associates at kravitz bane now worked in washington and he had already agreed to wait at the death clerks desk adam would be left to sit on the row with the client and coordinate the last minute calls kerry agreed to participate in goodmans market analysis project over the weekend at eleven goodman returned to the governors office in the state capitol and handed to lawyer larramore a written request for a clemency hearing the governor was out of the office very busy these days and he larramore would see him just after lunch goodman left his phone number at the millsapsbuie house and said he would call in periodically he then drove to his new office now supplied with the finest rental furniture available on two months lease cash of course the folding chairs were leftovers from a church fellowship hall according to the markings under the seats the rickety tables too had seen their share of potluck suppers and wedding receptions goodman admired his hastily assembled little holeinthewall he took a seat and on a new cellular phone he called his secretary in chicago adams office in memphis his wife at home and the governors hotline by pm thursday the mississippi supreme court still had not denied the claim based on sams alleged mental incompetence almost thirty hours had passed since adam filed it hed made a nuisance of himself calling the courts clerk he was tired of explaining the obvious he needed an answer please there was not the slightest trace of optimism that the court was actually considering the merits of the claim the court in adams opinion was dragging its feet and delaying his rush to federal court at this point relief in the state supreme court was impossible he felt he wasnt exactly on a roll in the federal courts either the us supreme court had not ruled on his request to consider the claim that the gas chamber was unconstitutional the fifth circuit was sitting on his ineffectiveness of counsel claim nothing was moving on thursday the courts were just sitting there as if these were ordinary lawsuits to be filed and assigned and docketed then continued and delayed for years he needed action preferably a stay granted at some level or if not a stay then an oral argument or a hearing on the merits or even a denial so he could move on to the next court he paced around the table in his office and listened for the phone he was tired of pacing tc and sick of the phone the office was littered with the debris of a dozen briefs the table was blanketed with disheveled piles of paper pink and yellow phone messages were stuck along one bookshelf adam suddenly hated the place he needed fresh air he told darlene he was going for a walk and left the building it was almost five still bright and very warm he walked to the peabody hotel on union and had a drink in a corner of the lobby near the piano it was his first drink since friday in new orleans and although he enjoyed it he worried about lee he looked for her in the crowd of conventioneers flocking around the registration desk he watched the tables in the lobby fill up with welldressed people hoping that for some reason she would appear where do you hide when youre fifty years old and running from life a man with a ponytail and hiking boots stopped and stared then walked over excuse me sir are you adam hall the lawyer for sam cayhall adam nodded the man smiled obviously pleased that hed recognized adam and walked to his table im kirk kleckner with the new york times he laid a business card in front of adam im here covering the cayhall execution just arrived actually may i sit down adam waved at the empty seat across the small round table kleckner sat down lucky to find you here he said all smiles he was in his early forties with a rugged globetrotting journalist look scruffy beard sleeveless cotton vest over a denim shirt jeans recognized you from some pictures i studied on the flight down nice to meet you adam said dryly can we talk about what oh lots of things i understand your client will not give interviews thats correct what about you the same we can chat but nothing for the record that makes it difficult i honestly dont care im not concerned with how difficult your job may be fair enough a pliant young waitress in a short skirt stopped by long enough to take his order black coffee when did you last see your grandfather tuesday when will you see him again tomorrow how is he holding up hes surviving the pressure is building but hes taking it well so far what about you just having a ball seriously are you losing sleep you know things like that im tired yeah im losing sleep im working lots of hours running back and forth to the prison itll go down to the wire so the next few days will be hectic i covered the bundy execution in florida quite a circus his lawyers went days without sleep its difficult to relax will you do it again i know this is not your specialty but will you consider another death case only if i find another relative on death row why do you cover these things ive written for years on the death penalty its fascinating id like to interview mr cayhall adam shook his head and finished his drink no theres no way hes not talking to anyone will you ask him for me no the coffee arrived kleckner stirred it with a spoon adam watched the crowd i interviewed benjamin keyes yesterday in washington kleckner said he said he wasnt surprised that youre now saying he made mistakes at trial he said he figured it was coming at the moment adam didnt care about benjamin keyes or any of his opinions its standard i need to run nice to meet you but i wanted to talk about listen youre lucky you caught me adam said standing abruptly just a couple of things kleckner said as adam walked away adam left the peabody and strolled to front street near the river passing along the way scores of welldressed young people very much like himself all in a hurry to go home he envied them whatever their vocations or careers whatever their pressures at the moment they werent carrying burdens as heavy as his he ate a sandwich at a delicatessen and by seven was back in his office the rabbit had been trapped in the woods at parchman by two of the guards who named him sam for the occasion he was a brown cottontail the largest of the four captured the other three had already been eaten late thursday night sam the rabbit and his handlers along with colonel nugent and the execution team entered the maximum security unit in prison vans and pickups they drove slowly by the front and around the bullpens on the west end they parked by a square redbrick building attached to the southwest corner of msu two white metal doors without windows led to the interior of the square building one facing south opened to a narrow room eight feet by fifteen where the witnesses sat during the execution they faced a series of black drapes which when opened revealed the rear of the chamber itself just inches away the other door opened into the chamber room a fifteenbytwelve room with a painted concrete floor the octagonalshaped gas chamber sat squarely in the middle glowing smartly from a fresh coat of silver enamel varnish and smelling like the same nugent had inspected it a week earlier and ordered a new paint job the death room as it was also known was spotless and sanitized the black drapes over the windows behind the chamber were pulled sam the rabbit was left in the bed of a pickup while a small guard about the same height and weight as sam cayhall was led by two of his larger colleagues into the chamber room nugent strutted and inspected like general patton pointing and nodding and frowning the small guard was pushed gently into the chamber first then joined by the two guards who turned him around and eased him into the wooden chair without a word or a smile neither a grin nor a joke they strapped his wrists first with leather bands to the arms of the chair then his knees then his ankles then one lifted his head up an inch or two and held it in place while the other managed to buckle the leather head strap the two guards stepped carefully from the chamber and nugent pointed to another member of the team who stepped forward as if to say something to the condemned at this point lucas mann will read the death warrant to mr cayhall nugent explained like an amateur movie director then i will ask if he has any last words he pointed again and a designated guard closed the heavy door to the chamber and sealed it open it nugent barked and the door came open the small guard was set tree get the rabbit nugent ordered one of the handlers retrieved sam the rabbit from the pickup he sat innocently in a wire cage which was handed to the same two guards whod just left the chamber they carefully placed him in the wooden chair then went about their task of strapping in an imaginary man wrists knees ankles head and the rabbit was ready for the gas the two guards left the chamber the door was shut and sealed and nugent signaled for the executioner who placed a canister of sulfuric acid into a tube which ran into the bottom of the chamber he pulled a lever a clicking sound occurred and the canister made its way to the bowl under the chair nugent stepped to one of the windows and watched intently the other members of the team did likewise petroleum jelly had been smeared around the edges of the windows to prevent seepage the poisonous gas was released slowly and a faint mist of visible vapors rose from under the chair and drifted upward at first the rabbit didnt react to the steam that permeated his little cell but it hit him soon enough he stiffened then hopped a few times banging into the sides of his cage then he went into violent convulsions jumping and jerking and twisting frantically in less than a minute he was still nugent smiled as he glanced at his watch clear it he ordered and a vent at the top of the chamber was opened releasing the gas the door from the chamber room to the outside was opened and most of the execution team walked out for fresh air or a smoke it would be at least fifteen minutes before the chamber could be opened and the rabbit removed then they had to hose it down and clean up nugent was still inside watching everything so they smoked and had a few laughs less than sixty feet away the windows above the hallway of tier a were open sam could hear their voices it was after ten and the lights were off but in every cell along the tier two arms protruded from the bars as fourteen men listened in dark silence a death row inmate lives in a sixbynine cell for twentythree hours a day he hears everything the strange clicking sound of a new pair of boots in the hallway the unfamiliar pitch and accent of a different voice the faraway hum of a lawn mower or weedeater and he can certainly hear the opening and closing of the door to the chamber room he can hear the satisfied and important chuckles of the execution team sam leaned on his forearms and watched the windows above the hallway they were practicing for him out there between the western edge of highway and the front lawn of the administrative buildings of parchman a distance of fifty yards there was a grassy strip of land that was smooth and noticeable because it was once a railroad track it was where the death penalty protestors were corralled and monitored at every execution they invariably arrived usually small groups of committed souls who sat in folding chairs and held homemade placards they burned candles at night and sang hymns during the final hours they sang hymns offered prayers and wept when the death was announced a new twist had occurred during the hours preceding the execution of teddy doyle meeks a child rapist and killer the somber almost sacred protest had been disrupted by carloads of unruly college students who suddenly appeared without warning and had a delightful time demanding blood they drank beer and played loud music they chanted slogans and heckled the shaken death protestors the situation deteriorated as the two groups exchanged words prison officials moved in and restored order maynard tole was next and during the planning of his execution another section of turf on the other side of the main drive was designated for the death penalty proponents extra security was assigned to keep things peaceful when adam arrived friday morning he counted seven ku klux klansmen in white robes three were engaged in some attempt at synchronized protest a casual walking along the edge of the grassy strip near the highway with posters strung over their shoulders the other four were erecting a large blue and white canopy metal poles and ropes were scattered on the ground two ice chests sat next to several lawn chairs these guys were planning to stay awhile adam stared at them as he rolled to a stop at the front gate of parchman he lost track of time as he watched the kluckers for minutes so this was his heritage his roots these were the brethren of his grandfather and his grandfathers relatives and ancestors were some of these figures the same ones whod been recorded on film and edited by adam into the video about sam cayhall had he seen them before instinctively adam opened the door of his car and got out his coat and briefcase were in the rear seat he began walking slowly in their direction and stopped near their ice chests their placards demanded freedom for sam cayhall a political prisoner gas the real criminals but release sam for some reason adam was not comforted by their demands what do you want demanded one with a sign draped over his chest the other six stopped what they were doing and stared i dont know adam said truthfully then what are you looking at im not sure three others joined the first and they stepped together near adam their robes were identical white and made of a very light fabric with red crosses and other markings it was almost am and they were already sweating who the hell are you sams grandson the other three crowded behind the others and all seven examined adam from a distance of no more than five feet then youre on our side one said relieved no im not one of you thats right hes with that bunch of jews from chicago another said for the edification of the rest and this seemed to stir them up a bit why are you people here adam asked were trying to save sam looks like youre not gonna do it youre the reason hes here a young one with a red face and rows of sweat on his forehead took the lead and walked even closer to adam no hes the reason were here i wasnt even born when sam killed those jews so you cant blame it on me were here to protest his execution hes being persecuted for political reasons he wouldnt be here had it not been for the klan where are your masks i thought you people always hid your faces they twitched and fidgeted as a group uncertain what to do next he was after all the grandson of sam cayhall their idol and champion he was the lawyer trying to save a most precious symbol why dont you leave adam asked sam doesnt want you here why dont you go to hell the young one sneered how eloquent just leave okay sams worth much more to you dead than alive let him die in peace then youll have a wonderful martyr we aint leavin well be here till the end and what if sam asks you to leave will you go then no he sneered again then glanced over his shoulders at the others who all seemed to agree that they would in fact not leave we plan to make a lot of noise great thatll get your pictures in the papers thats what this is about isnt it circus clowns in funny costumes always attract attention car doors slammed somewhere behind adam and as he looked around he saw a television crew making a speedy exit from a van parked near his saab well well he said to the group smile fellas this is your big moment go to hell the young one snapped angrily adam turned his back to them and walked toward his car a hurried reporter with a cameraman in tow rushed to him are you adam hall she asked breathlessly cayhalls lawyer yes he said without stopping could we have a few words no but those boys are anxious to talk he said pointing over his shoulder she walked along beside him while the cameraman fumbled with his equipment adam opened his car door then slammed it as he turned the ignition louise the guard at the gate handed him a numbered card for his dashboard then waved him through packer went through the motions of the obligatory frisk inside the front door of the row whats in there he asked pointing to the small cooler adam held in his left hand eskimo pies sergeant would you like one lemme see adam handed the cooler to packer who flipped open the top just long enough to count half a dozen eskimo pies still frozen under a layer of ice he handed the cooler back to adam and pointed to the door of the front office a few feet away yall will be meetin in here from now on he explained they stepped into the room why adam asked as he looked around the room there was a metal desk with a phone three chairs and two locked file cabinets thats just the way we do things we lighten up some as the big day gets close sam gets to have his visitors here no time limit either how sweet adam placed his briefcase on the desk and picked up the phone packer left to fetch sam the kind lady in the clerks office in jackson informed adam that the mississippi supreme court had denied just minutes ago his clients petition for postconviction relief on the grounds that he was mentally incompetent he thanked her said something to the effect that this was what he expected and that it couldve been done a day earlier then asked her to fax a copy of the courts decision to his office in memphis and also to lucas manns office at parchman he called darlene in memphis and told her to fax the new petition to the federal district court with copies faxed to the fifth circuit and to mr richard olanders rather busy death desk at the supreme court in washington he called mr olander to inform him it was coming and was told that the us supreme court had just denied cert on adams claim that the gas chamber was unconstitutional sam entered the front office without handcuffs while adam was on the phone they shook hands quickly and sam took a seat instead of a cigarette he opened the cooler and removed an eskimo pie he ate it slowly while listening as adam talked with olander us supreme court just denied cert adam whispered to sam with his hand over the receiver sam smiled oddly and studied some envelopes hed brought with him the mississippi supreme court also turned us down adam explained to his client as he punched more numbers but that was to be expected were filing it in federal court right now he was calling the fifth circuit to check the status of the ineffective counsel claim the clerk in new orleans informed him that no action had been taken that morning adam hung up and sat on the edge of the desk fifth circuit is still sitting on the ineffectiveness claim he reported to his client who knew the law and the procedure and was absorbing it like a learned attorney all in all not a very good morning the jackson tv station this morning said ive requested a clemency hearing from the governor sam said between bites certainly this cant be true i didnt approve it relax sam its routine routine my ass i thought we had an agreement they even had mcallister on the tube talking about how he was grieving over his decision about a clemency hearing i warned you mcallister is the least of our problems sam the request was a formality we dont have to participate sam shook his head in frustration adam watched him closely he wasnt really angry nor did he really care what adam had done he was resigned almost defeated the little bit of bitching came naturally a week earlier he wouldve lashed out they practiced last night you know they cranked up the gas chamber killed a rat or something everything worked perfectly and so now everyones excited about my execution can you believe it they had a dress rehearsal for me the bastards im sorry sam do you know what cyanide gas smells like no cinnamon it was in the air last night the idiots didnt bother to close the windows on our tier and i got a whiff of it adam didnt know if this was true or not he knew the chamber was vented for several minutes after an execution and the gas escaped into the air surely it couldnt filter onto the tiers maybe sam had heard stories about the gas from the guards maybe it was just part of the lore he sat on the edge of the desk casually swinging his feet staring at the pitiful old man with the skinny arms and oily hair it was such a horrible sin to kill an aged creature like sam cayhall his crimes were committed a generation ago he had suffered and died many times in his sixbynine cell how would the state benefit by killing him now adam had things on his mind not the least of which was perhaps their last gasping effort im sorry sam he said again very compassionately but we need to talk about some items were there klansmen outside this morning the television had a shot of them here yesterday yes i counted seven a few minutes ago full uniforms except for the masks i used to wear one of those you knowhe said much like a war veteran bragging to little boys i know sam and because you wore one youre now sitting here on death row with your lawyer counting the hours before they strap you in the gas chamber you should hate those silly fools out there i dont hate them but they have no right to be here they abandoned me dogan sent me here and when he testified against me he was the imperial wizard of mississippi they gave me not one dime for legal fees they forgot about me what do you expect from a bunch of thugs loyalty i was loyal and look where you are sam you should denounce the klan and ask them to leave to stay away from your execution sam fiddled with his envelopes then placed them carefully in a chair i told them to leave adam said when just a few minutes ago i exchanged words with them they dont give a damn about you sam theyre just using this execution because youll make such a marvelous martyr someone to rally around and talk about for years to come theyll chant your name when they burn crosses and theyll make pilgrimages to your gravesite they want you dead sam its great pr you confronted them sam asked with a trace of amusement and pride yeah it was no big deal what about carmen if shes coming she needs to make travel arrangements sam took a thoughtful puff id like to see her but youve gotta warn her about my appearance i dont want her to be shocked you look great sam gee thanks what about lee what about her hows she doing we get newspapers in here i saw her in the memphis paper last sunday then i read about her drunk driving charge on tuesday shes not in jail is she no shes in a rehab clinic adam said as if he knew exactly where she was can she come visit do you want her to i think so maybe on monday lets wait and see no problem adam said wondering how in the world he could find her ill talk to her over the weekend sam handed adam one of the envelopes unsealed give this to the people up front its a list of approved visitors from now until then go ahead open it adam looked at the list there were four names adam lee carmen and donnie cayhall not a very long list i have lots of relatives but i dont want them here they havent visited me in nine and a half years so ill be damned if theyll come draggin in here at the last minute to say goodbye they can save it for the funeral im getting all kinds of requests from reporters and journalists for interviews forget it thats what ive told them but theres one inquiry that might interest you theres a man named wendall sherman an author of some repute whos published four or five books and won some awards i havent read any of his work but he checks out hes legitimate i talked to him yesterday by phone and he wants to sit with you and record your story he seemed to be very honest and said that the recording could take hours hes flying to memphis today just in case you say yes why does he want to record me he wants to write a book about you a romance novel i doubt it hes willing to pay fifty thousand dollars up front with a percentage of the royalties later on great i get fifty thousand a few days before i die what shall i do with it im just relaying the offer tell him to go to hell im not interested fine i want you to draw up an agreement whereby i assign all rights to my life story to you and after im gone you do whatever the hell you want with it it wouldnt be a bad idea to record it you mean talk into a little machine with little tapes i can get one for you sit in your cell and talk about your life how boring sam finished the eskimo pie and tossed the stick in the wastebasket depends on how you look at it things seem rather exciting now yeah youre right a pretty dull life but the end was sensational sounds like a bestseller to me ill think about it sam suddenly jumped to his feet leaving the rubber shower shoes under his chair he loped across the office in long strides measuring and smoking as he went thirteen by sixteen and a half he mumbled to himself then measured some more adam made notes on a legal pad and tried to ignore the red figure bouncing off the walls sam finally stopped and leaned on a file cabinet i want you to do me a favor he said staring at a wall across the room his voice was much lower he breathed slowly im listening adam said sam took a step to the chair and picked up an envelope he handed it to adam and returned to his position against the file cabinet the envelope was turned over so that adam could not see the writing on it i want you to deliver that sam said to whom quince lincoln adam placed it to his side on the desk and watched sam carefully sam however was lost in another world his wrinkled eyes stared blankly at something on the wall across the room ive worked on it for a week he said his voice almost hoarse but ive thought about it for forty years whats in the letter adam asked slowly an apology ive carried the guilt for many years adam joe lincoln was a good and decent man a good father i lost my head and killed him for no reason and i knew before i shot him that i could get by with it ive always felt bad about it real bad theres nothing i can do now except say that im sorry im sure itll mean something to the lincolns maybe in the letter i ask them for forgiveness which i believe is the christian way of doing things when i die id like to have the knowledge that i tried to say im sorry any idea where i might find him thats the hard part ive heard through family that the lincolns are still in ford county ruby his widow is probably still alive im afraid youll just have to go to clanton and start asking questions they have an african sheriff so id start with him he probably knows all the africans in the county and if i find quince tell him who you are give him the letter tell him that i died with a lot of guilt can you do that ill be happy to im not sure when i can do it wait until im dead youll have plenty of time once this is over sam again walked to the chair and this time picked up two envelopes he handed them to adam and began pacing slowly back and forth across the room the name of ruth kramer was typed on one no address and elliot kramer on the other those are for the kramers deliver them but wait until the execution is over why wait because my motives are pure i dont want them to think im doing this to arouse sympathy in my dying hours adam placed the kramer letters next to quince lincolns three letters three dead bodies how many more letters would sam crank out over the weekend how many more victims were out there youre sure youre about to die arent you sam he stopped by the door and pondered this for a moment the odds are against us im getting prepared we still have a chance sure we do but im getting ready just in case ive hurt a lot of people adam and i havent always stopped to think about it but when you have a date with the grim reaper you think about the damage youve done adam picked up the three envelopes and looked at them are there others sam grimaced and looked at the floor thats all for now the jackson paper on friday morning carried a frontpage story about sam cayhalls request for a clemency hearing the story included a slick photo of governor david mcallister a bad one of sam and lots of selfserving comments by mona stark the governors chief of staff all to the effect that the governor was struggling with the decision since he was a real man of the people a regular servant to all mississippians mcallister had installed an expensive telephone hotline system shortly after he was elected the tollfree number was plastered all over the state and his constituents were constantly barraged with public service ads to use the peoples hotline call the governor he cared about your opinions democracy at its finest operators were standing by and because he had more ambition than fortitude mcallister and his staff tracked the phone calls on a daily basis he was a follower not a leader he spent serious money on polls and had proven adept at quietly discovering the issues that bothered people then jumping out front to lead the parade both goodman and adam suspected this mcallister seemed too obsessed with his destiny to launch new initiatives the man was a shameless votecounter so they had decided to give him something to count goodman read the story early over coffee and fruit and by seventhirty was on the phone with professor john bryan glass and hez kerry by eight three of glass students were sipping coffee from paper cups in the grungy temporary office the marketing analysis was about to begin goodman explained the scheme and the need for secrecy they were breaking no laws he assured them just manipulating public opinion the cellular phones were on the tables along with pages of phone numbers goodman had copied on wednesday the students were a little apprehensive but nonetheless anxious to begin they would be paid well goodman demonstrated the technique with the first call he dialed the number peoples hotline a pleasant voice answered yes im calling about the story in this mornings paper the one about sam cayhall goodman said slowly in his best imitation of a drawl it left a lot to be desired the students were very amused and your name is yes im ned lancaster from biloxi mississippi goodman replied reading from the phone lists and i voted for the governor a fine man he threw in for good measure and how do you feel about sam cayhall i dont think he should be executed hes an old man whos suffered a lot and i want the governor to give him a pardon let him die in peace up there at parchman okay ill make sure the governor knows about your call thank you goodman pushed a button on the phone and took a bow before his audience nothing to it lets get started the white male selected a phone number his conversation went something like this hello this is lester crosby from bude mississippi im calling about the execution of sam cayhall yes maam my number its yes thats right bude mississippi down here in franklin county thats right well i dont think sam cayhall ought to be sent to the gas chamber im just opposed to it i think the governor should step in and stop this thing yes maam thats right thank you he smiled at goodman who was punching another number the white female was a middleaged student she was from a small town in a rural section of the state and her accent was naturally twangy hello is this the governors office good im calling about the cayhall story in todays paper susan barnes decatur mississippi thats right well hes an old man wholl probably die in a few years anyway what good will it do for the state to kill him now give the guy a break what yes i want the governor to stop it i voted for the governor and i think hes a fine man yes thank you too the black male was in his late twenties he simply informed the hotline operator that he was a black mississippian very much opposed to the ideas sam cayhall and the klan promoted but nonetheless opposed to the execution the government does not have the right to determine if someone lives or dies he said he did not favor the death penalty under any circumstances and so it went the calls poured in from all over the state one after the other each from a different person with a different logic for stopping the execution the students became creative trying assorted accents and novel reasonings occasionally their calls would hit busy signals and it was amusing to know that they had jammed the hotline because of his crisp accent goodman assumed the role of the outsider sort of a traveling death penalty abolitionist who bounced in from all over the country with a dazzling array of ethnic aliases and strange locales goodman had worried that mcallister might be paranoid enough to trace the calls to his hotline but had decided that the operators would be too busy and busy they were across town john bryan glass canceled a class and locked the door to his office he had a delightful time making repeated calls under all sorts of names not far from him hez kerry and one of his staff attorneys were also bombarding the hotline with the same messages adam hurried to memphis darlene was in his office trying vainly to organize the mountain of paperwork she pointed to a stack nearest his computerthe decision denying cert is on top then the decision from the mississippi supreme court next to it is the petition for writ of habeas corpus to be filed in federal district court ive already faxed everything adam removed his jacket and threw it on a chair he looked at a row of pink telephone messages tacked to a bookshelf who are these people reporters writers quacks a couple are other lawyers offering their assistance one is from garner goodman in jackson he said the market analysis is going fine dont call what is the market analysis dont ask no word from the fifth circuit no adam took a deep breath and eased into his chair lunch she asked just a sandwich if you dont mind can you work tomorrow and sunday of course i need for you to stay here all weekend by the phone and the fax im sorry i dont mind ill get a sandwich she left closing the door behind her adam called lees condo and there was no answer he called the auburn house but no one had heard from her he called phelps booth who was in a board meeting he called carmen in berkeley and told her to make arrangements to fly to memphis on sunday he looked at the phone messages and decided none were worth returning at one oclock mona stark spoke to the press loitering around the governors office in the capitol she said that after much deliberation the governor had decided to grant a clemency hearing on monday at am at which time the governor would listen to the issues and appeals and make a fair decision it was an awesome responsibility she explained this weighing of life or death but david mcallister would do what was just and right packer went to the cell at fivethirty saturday morning and didnt bother with the handcuffs sam was waiting and they quietly left tier a they walked through the kitchen where the trustees were scrambling eggs and frying bacon sam had never seen the kitchen and he walked slowly counting his steps checking the dimensions packer opened a door and motioned for sam to hurry and follow they stepped outside into the darkness sam stopped and looked at the square brick room to his right the little building that housed the gas chamber packer pulled his elbow and they walked together to the east end of the row where another guard was watching and waiting the guard handed sam a large cup of coffee and led him through a gate into a recreation yard similar to the bullpens on the west end of the row it was fenced and wired with a basketball goal and two benches packer said he would return in an hour and left with the guard sam stood in place for a long time sipping the hot coffee and absorbing the landscape his first cell had been on tier d on the east wing and hed been here many times before he knew the exact dimensions fiftyone feet by thirtysix he saw the guard in the tower sitting under a light and watching him through the fences and over the tops of the rows of cotton he could see the lights of other buildings he slowly walked to a bench and sat down how thoughtful of these kind people to grant his request to see one final sunrise he hadnt seen one in nine and a half years and at first nugent said no then packer intervened and explained to the colonel that it was okay no security risk at all and what the hell the man was supposed to die in four days packer would take responsibility for it sam stared at the eastern sky where a hint of orange was peeking through scattered clouds during his early days on the row when his appeals were fresh and unresolved he had spent hours remembering the glorious humdrum of everyday life the little things like a warm shower every day the companionship of his dog extra honey on his biscuits he actually believed back then that one day he would again be able to hunt squirrels and quail to fish for bass and bream to sit on the porch and watch the sun come up to drink coffee in town and drive his old pickup wherever he wanted his goal during those early fantasies on the row had been to fly to california and find his grandchildren he had never flown but the dreams of freedom had died long ago driven away by the tedious monotony of life in a cell and killed by the harsh opinions of many judges this would be his final sunrise he truly believed that too many people wanted him dead the gas chamber was not being used often enough it was time for an execution dammit and he was next in line the sky grew brighter and the clouds dissipated though he was forced to watch this magnificent act of nature through a chainlink fence it was satisfying nonetheless just a few more days and the fences would be gone the bars and razor wire and prison cells would be left for someone else two reporters smoked cigarettes and drank machine coffee as they waited by the south entrance to the capitol early saturday morning word had been leaked that the governor would spend a long day at the office struggling with the cayhall thing at seventhirty his black lincoln rolled to a stop nearby and he made a quick exit from it two welldressed bodyguards escorted him to the entrance with mona stark a few steps behind governor do you plan to attend the execution the first reporter asked hurriedly mcallister smiled and raised his hands as if hed love to stop and chat but things were much too critical for that then he saw a camera hanging from the other reporters neck i havent made a decision yet he answered stopping just for a second will ruth kramer testify at the clemency hearing on monday the camera was raised and ready i cant say right now he answered smiling into the lens sorry guys i cant talk now he entered the building and rode the elevator to his office on the second floor the bodyguards assumed their positions in the foyer behind morning newspapers lawyer larramore was waiting with his updates he explained to the governor and ms stark that there had been no changes in the various cayhall petitions and appeals since pm yesterday nothing had happened overnight the appeals were becoming more desperate and the courts would deny them more quickly in his opinion he had already spoken with morris henry at the ags office and in the learned judgment of dr death there was now an percent chance that the execution would take place what about the clemency hearing on monday any word from cayhalls lawyers mcallister asked no i asked garner goodman to stop by at nine this morning thought wed talk to him about it ill be in my office if you need me larramore excused himself ms stark was performing her morning ritual of scanning the dailies from around the state and placing them on the conference table of the nine papers she monitored the cayhall story was on the front page of eight the announcement of a clemency hearing was of special interest saturday morning three of the papers carried the same ap photo of the klansmen roasting idly under the fierce august sun outside of parchman mcallister removed his coat rolled up his sleeves and began peering over the papers get the numbers he said tersely mona left the office and returned in less than a minute she carried a computer printout which obviously bore dreadful news im listening he said the calls stopped around nine last night last one was at nineoseven the total for the day was four hundred and eightysix and at least ninety percent voiced strong opposition to the execution ninety percent mcallister said in disbelief he was no longer in shock though by noon yesterday the hotline operators had reported an unusual number of calls and by one mona was analyzing printouts they had spent much of yesterday afternoon staring at the numbers contemplating the next move he had slept little who are these people he said staring through a window your constituents the calls are coming from all over the state the names and numbers appear to be legitimate what was the old record i dont know seems like we had around a hundred one day when the legislature gave itself another pay raise but nothing like this ninety percent he mumbled again and theres something else there were lots of other calls to various numbers in this office my secretary took a dozen or so all for sam right yes all opposed to the execution ive talked tc to some of our people and everybody got nailed yesterday and roxburgh called me at home last night and said that his office had been besieged with calls against the execution good i want him to sweat too do we close the hotline how many operators work on saturday and sunday only one no leave it open today lets see what happens today and tomorrow he walked to another window and loosened his tie when does the polling start three this afternoon im anxious to see those numbers they could be just as bad ninety percent he said shaking his head over ninety percent mona corrected him the war room was littered with pizza boxes and beer cans evidence of a long day of market analysis a tray of fresh doughnuts and a row of tall paper coffee cups now awaited the analysts two of whom had just arrived with newspapers garner goodman stood at the window with a new pair of binoculars watching the capitol three blocks away and paying particular attention to the windows of the governors office during a moment of boredom yesterday hed gone to a mall in search of a bookstore hed found the binoculars in the window of a leather shop and throughout the afternoon theyd had great fun trying to catch the governor pondering through his windows no doubt wondering where all those damned calls were coming from the students devoured the doughnuts and newspapers there was a brief but serious discussion about some obvious procedural deficiencies in mississippis postconviction relief statutes the third member of the shift a firstyear student from new orleans arrived at eight and the calls started it was immediately apparent that the hotline was not as efficient as the day before it was difficult to get through to an operator no problem they used alternate numbers the switchboard at the governors mansion the lines to the cute little regional offices hed established amid great fanfare around the state so that he a common man could stay close to the people the people were calling goodman left the office and walked along congress street to the capitol he heard the sounds of a loudspeaker being tested and then saw the klansmen they were organizing themselves at least a dozen in full parade dress around the monument to confederate women at the base of the front steps to the capitol goodman walked by them actually said hello to one so that when he returned to chicago he could say he talked to some real kluckers the two reporters whod waited for the governor were now on the front steps watching the scene below a local television crew arrived as goodman entered the capitol the governor was too busy to meet with him mona stark explained gravely but mr larramore could spare a few minutes she looked a bit frazzled and this pleased goodman greatly he followed her to larramores office where they found the lawyer on the phone goodman hoped it was one of his calls he obediently took a seat mona closed the door and left them good morning larramore said as he hung up goodman nodded politely and said thanks for the hearing we didnt expect the governor to grant one in light of what he said on wednesday hes under a lot of pressure we all are is your client willing to talk about his accomplice no theres been no change larramore ran his fingers through his sticky hair and shook his head in frustration then whats the purpose of a clemency hearing the governor is not going to budge on this mr goodman were working on sam okay were talking to him lets plan on going through with the hearing on monday maybe sam will change his mind the phone rang and larramore snatched it angrily no this is not the governors office who is this he scribbled down a name and phone number this is the governors legal department he closed his eyes and shook his head yes yes im sure you voted for the governor he listened some morethank you mr hurt ill tell the governor you called yes thanks he returned the receiver to the phone so mr gilbert hurt from dumas mississippi is against the execution he said staring at the phone dazed the phones have gone crazy lots of calls huh goodman asked sympathetically you wouldnt believe for or against bout fiftyfifty id say larramore said he took the phone again and punched in the number for mr gilbert hurt of dumas mississippi no one answered this is strange he said hanging up again the man just called me left a legitimate number now theres no answer probably just stepped out try again later goodman hoped he wouldnt have the time to try again later in the first hour of the market analysis yesterday goodman had made a slight change in technique he had instructed his callers to first check the phone numbers to make certain there was no answer this prevented some curious type such as larramore or perhaps a nosy hotline operator from calling back and finding the real person odds were the real person would greatly support the death penalty if slowed flings a hit for the market analysts but goodman ef safer w with it im working on an outline for the hearing larramore said just in case well probably have it in the house ways and means committee room just down the hall will it be closed no is this a problem we have four days left mr larramore everythings a problem but the hearing belongs to the governor were just thankful hes granted one i have your numbers keep in touch im not leaving jackson until this is over they shook hands quickly and goodman left the office he sat on the front steps for half an hour and watched the klansmen get organized and attract the curious though hed worn a white robe and a pointed hood as a much younger man donnie cayhall kept his distance from the lines of klansmen patrolling the grassy strip near the front gate of parchman security was tight with armed guards watching the protestors next to the canopy where the klansmen gathered was a small group of skinheads in brown shirts they held signs demanding freedom for sam cayhall donnie watched the spectacle for a moment then followed the directions of a security guard and parked along the highway his name was checked at the guardhouse and a few minutes later a prison van came for him his brother had been at parchman for nine and a half years and donnie had tried to visit at least once a year but the last visit had been two years ago he was ashamed to admit donnie cayhall was sixtyone the youngest of the four cayhall brothers all had followed the teachings of their father and joined the klan in their teens it had been a simple decision with little thought given to it one expected by the entire family later he had joined the army fought in korea and traveled the world in the process he had lost interest in wearing robes and burning crosses he left mississippi in and went to work for a furniture company in north carolina he now lived near durham every month for nine and a half years he had shipped to sam a box of cigarettes and a small amount of cash hed written a few letters but neither he nor sam were interested in correspondence few people in durham knew he had a brother on death row he was frisked inside the front door and shown to the front office sam was brought in a few minutes later and they were left alone donnie hugged him for a long time and when they released each other both had moist eyes they were of similar height and build though sam looked twenty years older he sat on the edge of the desk and donnie took a chair nearby both lit cigarettes and stared into space any good news donnie finally asked certain of the answer no none the courts are turning everything down theyre gonna do it donnie theyre gonna kill me theyll walk me to the chamber and gas me like an animal donnies face fell to his chest im sorry sam im sorry too but dammit ill be glad when its over dont say that i mean it im tired of living in a cage im an old man and my time has come but you dont deserve to be killed sam thats the hardest part you know its not that im gonna die hell were all dying i just cant stand the thought of these jackasses getting the best of me theyre gonna win and their reward is to strap me in and watch me choke its sick cant your lawyer do something hes trying everything but it looks hopeless i want you to meet him i saw his picture in the paper he doesnt resemble our people hes lucky he looks more like his mother sharp kid sam managed a smile yeah hes pretty terrific hes really grieving over this will he be here today probably i havent heard from him hes staying with lee in memphis sam said with a touch of pride because of him his daughter and his grandson had become close and were actually living together peacefully i talked to albert this morning donnie said he says hes too sick to come over good i dont want him here and i dont want his kids and grandkids here either he wants to pay his respects but he cant tell him to save it for the funeral come on sam look no ones gonna cry for me when im dead i dont want a lot of false pity before then i need something from you donnie and itll cost a little money sure anything sam pulled at the waist of his red jumpsuit you see this damned thing theyre called reds and ive worn them every day for almost ten years this is what the state of mississippi expects me to wear when it kills me but you see i have the right to wear anything i want it would mean a lot if i die in some nice clothes donnie was suddenly hit with emotion he tried to speak but words didnt come his eyes were wet and his lip quivered he nodded and managed to say sure sam you know those work pants called dickies i wore them for years sort of like khakis donnie was still nodding a pair of them would be nice with a white shirt of some sort not a pullover but one with buttons on it small shirt small pants thirtytwo in the waist a pair of white socks and some kind of cheap shoes hell ill just wear them once wont i go to walmart or some place and you can probably get the whole thing for less than thirty bucks do you mind donnie wiped his eyes and tried to smile no sam ill be a dude wont i where will you be buried clanton next to anna im sure thatll upset her peaceful rest adams taking care of the arrangements what else can i do nothing if youll just get me a change of clothes ill do it today youre the only person in the world whos cared about me all these years do you know that aunt barb wrote me for years before she died but her letters were always stiff and dry and i figured she was doing it so she could tell her neighbors who the hell was aunt barb hubert cains mother im not even sure shes related to us i hardly knew her until i arrived here then she started this awful correspondence she was just all tore up by the fact that one of her own had been sent to parchman may she rest in peace sam chuckled and was reminded of an ancient childhood story he told it with great enthusiasm and minutes later both brothers were laughing loudly donnie was reminded of another tale and so it went for an hour by the time adam arrived late saturday afternoon donnie had been gone for hours he was taken to the front office where he spread some papers on the desk sam was brought in his handcuffs removed and the door was closed behind them he held more envelopes which adam noticed immediately more errands for me he asked suspiciously yeah but they can wait until its over to whom one is to the pinder family i bombed in vicksburg one is to the jewish synagogue i bombed in jackson one is to the jewish real estate agent also in jackson there may be others no hurry since i know youre busy right now but after im gone id appreciate it if youd take care of them what do these letters say what do you think they say i dont know that youre sorry i guess smart boy i apologize for my deeds repent of my sins and ask them to forgive me why are you doing this sam stopped and leaned on a file cabinet because i sit in a little cage all day because i have a typewriter and plenty of paper im bored as hell okay so maybe i want to write because i have a conscience not much of one but its there and the closer i get to death the guiltier i feel about the things ive done im sorry theyll be delivered adam circled something on his checklist we have two appeals left the fifth circuit is sitting on the ineffectiveness claim i expected something by now but theres been no movement for two days the district court has the mental claim its all hopeless adam maybe but im not quitting ill file a dozen more petitions if i have to im not signing anything else you cant file them if i dont sign them yes i can there are ways then youre fired you cant fire me sam im your grandson we have an agreement saying i can fire you whenever i want we put it in writing its a flawed document drafted by a decent jailhouse lawyer but fatally defective nonetheless sam huffed and puffed and began striding again on his row of tiles he made half a dozen passes in front of adam his lawyer now tomorrow and for the remainder of his life he knew he couldnt fire him we have a clemency hearing scheduled for monday adam said looking at his legal pad and waiting for the explosion but sam took it well and never missed a step whats the purpose of the clemency hearing he asked to appeal for clemency appeal to whom the governor and you think the governor will consider granting me clemency whats there to lose answer the question smartass do you with all your training experience and judicial brilliance seriously expect this governor to entertain ideas of granting me clemency maybe maybe my ass youre stupid thank you sam dont mention it he stopped directly in front of adam and pointed a crooked finger at him ive told you from the very beginning that i as the client and as such certainly entitled to some consideration will have nothing to do with david mcallister i will not appeal to that fool for clemency i will not ask him for a pardon i will have no contact with him whatsoever those are my wishes and i made this very plain to you young man from day one you on the other hand as the lawyer have ignored my wishes and gone about your merry business doing whatever the hell you wanted you are the lawyer nothing more or less i on the other hand am the client and i dont know what they taught you in your fancy law school but i make the decisions sam walked to an empty chair and picked up another envelope he handed it to adam and said this is a letter to the governor requesting him to cancel the clemency hearing on monday if you refuse to get it canceled then i will make copies of this and give it to the press i will embarrass you garner goodman and the governor do you understand plain enough sam returned the envelope to the chair and lit another cigarette adam made another circle on his list carmen will be here monday im not sure about lee sam eased to a chair and sat down he did not look at adam is she still in rehab yes and im not sure when shell get out do you want her to visit let me think about it think fast okay funny real funny my brother donnie stopped by earlier hes my youngest brother you know he wants to meet you was he in the klan what kind of question is that its a simple yes or no question yes he was in the klan then i dont want to meet him hes not a bad guy ill take your word for it hes my brother adam i want you to meet my brother i have no desire to meet new cayhalls sam especially ones who wore robes and hoods oh really three weeks ago you wanted to know everything about the family just couldnt get enough of it i surrender okay ive heard enough oh theres lots more enough enough spare me sam grunted and smiled smugly to himself adam glanced at his legal pad and saidyoull be happy to know that the kluckers outside have now been joined by some nazis and aryans and skinheads and other hate groups theyre all lined along the highway waving posters at cars passing by the posters of course demand the freedom of sam cayhall their hero its a regular circus i saw it on television theyre also marching in jackson around the state capitol this is my fault no its your execution youre a symbol now about to become a martyr what am i supposed to do nothing just go ahead and die and theyll all be happy arent you an asshole today sorry sam the pressures getting to me throw in the towel i have i highly recommend it forget it ive got these clowns on the run sam i have not yet begun to fight yeah youve filed three petitions and a total of seven courts have turned you down zero for seven i hate to see whatll happen when you really get cranked up sam said this with a wicked smile and the humor found its mark adam laughed at it and both breathed a bit easier i have this great idea for a lawsuit after youre gone he said feigning excitement after im gone sure well sue them for wrongful death well name mcallister nugent roxburgh the state of mississippi well bring in everybody its never been done sam said stroking his beard as if deep in thought yeah i know thought of it all by myself we might not win a dime but think of the fun ill have harassing those bastards for the next five years you have my permission to file it sue them the smiles slowly disappeared and the humor was gone adam found something else on his checklist just a couple more items lucas mann asked me to ask you about your witnesses youre entitled to have two people in the witness room in case this gets that far donnie doesnt want to do it i will not allow you to be there i cant imagine anybody else whod want to see it fine speaking of them i have at least thirty requests for interviews virtually every major paper and news magazine wants access no fine remember that writer we discussed last time wendall sherman the one who wants to record your story on tape and yeah for fifty thousand bucks now its a hundred thousand his publisher will put up the money he wants to get everything on tape watch the execution do extensive research then write a big book about it no fine i dont want to spend the next three days talking about my life i dont want some stranger poking his nose around ford county and i dont particularly need a hundred thousand dollars at this point in my life fine with me you once mentioned the clothing you wanted to wear donnies taking care of it okay moving right along barring a stay youre allowed to have two people with you during your final hours typically the prison has a form for you to sign designating these people its always the lawyer and the minister right thats correct then its you and ralph griffin i guess adam filled the names in on a form whos ralph griffin the new minister here hes opposed to the death penalty can you believe it his predecessor thought we should all be gassed in the name of jesus of course adam handed the form to sam sign here sam scribbled his name and handed it back youre entitled to a last conjugal visit sam laughed loudly come on son im an old man its on the checklist okay lucas mann whispered to me the other day that i should mention it to you okay youve mentioned it i have another form here for your personal effects who gets them you mean my estate sort of this is morbid as hell adam why are we doing this now im a lawyer sam we get paid to sweat the details its just paperwork do you want my things adam thought about this for a moment he didnt want to hurt sams feelings but at the same time he couldnt imagine what hed do with a few ragged old garments worn books portable television and rubber shower shoes sure he said then theyre yours take them and burn them sign here adam said shoving the form under his face sam signed it then jumped to his feet and started pacing again i really want you to meet donnie sure whatever you want adam said stuffing his legal pad and the forms into his briefcase the nitpicking details were now complete the briefcase seemed much heavier ill be back in the morning he said to sam bring me some good news okay colonel nugent strutted along the edge of the highway with a dozen armed prison guards behind him he glared at the klansmen twentysix at last count and he scowled at the brownshined nazis ten in all he stopped and stared at the group of skinheads mingling next to the nazis he swaggered around the edge of the grassy protest strip pausing for a moment to speak to two catholic nuns sitting under a large umbrella as far away from the other demonstrators as possible the temperature was one hundred degrees and the nuns were broiling under the shade they sipped ice water their posters resting on their knees and facing the highway the nuns asked him who he was and what he wanted he explained that he was the acting warden for the prison and that he was simply making sure the demonstration was orderly they asked him to leave perhaps it was because it was sunday or maybe it was the rain but adam drank his morning coffee in unexpected serenity it was still dark outside and the gentle dripping of a warm summer shower on the patio was mesmerizing he stood in the open door and listened to the splashing of the raindrops it was too early for traffic on riverside drive below there were no noises from the tugboats on the river all was quiet and peaceful and there wasnt a heckuva lot to be done this day day three before the execution he would start at the office where another last minute petition had to be organized the issue was so ridiculous adam was almost embarrassed to file it then he would drive to parchman and sit with sam for a spell it was unlikely there would be movement by any court on sunday it was certainly possible since the death clerks and their staffs were on call when an execution was looming but friday and saturday had passed without rulings coming down and he expected the same inactivity today tomorrow would be much different in his untrained and untested opinion tomorrow would be nothing but frenzy and tuesday which of course was scheduled to be sams last day as a breathing soul would be a nightmare of stress but this sunday morning was remarkably calm he had slept almost seven hours another recent record his head was clear his pulse normal his breathing relaxed his mind was uncluttered and composed he flipped through the sunday paper scanning the headlines but reading nothing there were at least two stories about the cayhall execution one with more pictures of the growing circus outside the prison gate the rain stopped when the sun came up and he sat in a wet rocker for an hour scanning lees architectural magazines after a couple of hours of peace and tranquility adam was bored and ready for action there was unfinished business in lees bedroom a matter adam had tried to forget but couldnt for ten days now a silent battle had raged in his soul over the book in her drawer shed been drunk when she told him about the lynching photo but it was not the delirious talk of an addict adam knew the book existed there was a real book with a real photo of a young black man hanging by a rope and somewhere under his feet was a crowd of proud white people mugging for the camera immune from prosecution adam had mentally pieced the picture together adding faces sketching the tree drawing the rope adding titles to the space under it but there were some things he didnt know he couldnt visualize was the dead mans face perceptible was he wearing shoes or barefoot was a very young sam easily recognizable how many white faces were in the photo and how old were they any women any guns blood lee said hed been bullwhipped was the whip in the photo he had imagined the picture for days now and it was time to finally look in the book he couldnt wait until later lee might make a triumphant return she might move the book hide it again he planned to spend the next two or three nights here but that could change with one phone call he could be forced to rush to jackson or sleep in his car at parchman such routine matters as lunch and dinner and sleeping were suddenly unpredictable when your client had less than a week to live this was the perfect moment and he decided that he was now ready to face the lynch mob he walked to the front door and scanned the parking lot just to make sure she hadnt decided to drop in he actually locked the door to her bedroom and pulled open the top drawer it was filled with her lingerie and he was embarrassed for this intrusion the book was in the third drawer lying on top of a faded sweatshirt it was thick and bound in green fabric southern negroes and the great depression published in by toffler press pittsburgh adam clutched it and sat on the edge of her bed the pages were immaculate and pristine as if the book had never been handled or read who in the deep south would read such a book anyway and if the book had been in the cayhall family for several decades then adam was positive it had never been read he studied the binder and pondered what set of circumstances brought this particular book into the custody of the sam cayhall family the book had three sections of photos the first was a series of pictures of shotgun houses and ramshackle sheds where blacks were forced to live on plantations there were family portraits on front porches with dozens of children and there were the obligatory shots of farm workers stooped low in the fields picking cotton the second section was in the center of the book and ran for twenty pages there were actually two lynching photos the first a horribly gruesome scene with two robed and hooded kluckers holding rifles and posing for the camera a badly beaten black man swung from a rope behind them his eyes half open his face pulverized and bloody kkk lynching central mississippi explained the caption under it as if these rituals could be defined simply by locale and time adam gaped at the horror of the picture then turned the page to find the second lynching scene this one almost tame compared to the first the lifeless body at the end of the rope could be seen only from the chest down the shirt appeared to be torn probably by the bullwhip if in fact one had been used the black man was very thin his oversized pants drawn tightly at the waist he was barefoot no blood was visible the rope that held his body could be seen tied to a lower branch in the background the tree was large with bulky limbs and a massive trunk a festive group had gathered just inches under his dangling feet men women and boys clowned for the camera some striking exaggerated poses of anger and manliness hard frowns fierce eyes tight lips as if they possessed unlimited power to protect their women from negro aggression others smiled and seemed to be giggling especially the women two of whom were quite pretty a small boy held a pistol and aimed it menacingly at the camera a young man held a bottle of liquor twisted just so to reveal the label most of the group seemed quite joyous that this event had occurred adam counted seventeen people in the group and every single one was staring at the camera without shame or worry without the slightest hint a wrong had been committed they were utterly immune from prosecution they had just killed another human and it was painfully obvious they had done so with no fear of the consequences this was a party it was at night the weather was warm liquor was present pretty women surely theyd brought food in baskets and were about to throw quilts on the ground for a nice picnic around the tree lynching in rural mississippi read the caption sam was in the front row crouched and resting on a knee between two other young men all three posing hard for the camera he was fifteen or sixteen with a slender face that was trying desperately to appear dangerous lip curled eyebrows pinched chin up the cocky braggadocio of a boy trying to emulate the more mature thugs around him he was easy to spot because someone had drawn in faded blue ink a line across the photo to the margin where the name sam cayhall was printed in block letters the line crossed the bodies and faces of others and stopped at sams left ear eddie it had to be eddie lee said that eddie had found this book in the attic and adam could see his father hiding in the darkness weeping over the photograph identifying sam by pointing the accusatory arrow at his head lee also had said that sams father was the leader of this ragtag little mob but adam couldnt distinguish him perhaps eddie couldnt either because there were no markings there were at least seven men old enough to be sams father how many of these people were cayhalls shed also said that his brothers were involved and perhaps one of the younger men resembled sam but it was impossible to tell for certain he studied the clear beautiful eyes of his grandfather and his heart ached he was just a boy born and reared in a household where hatred of blacks and others was simply a way of life how much of it could be blamed on him look at those around him his father family friends and neighbors all probably honest poor hardworking people caught for the moment at the end of a cruel ceremony that was commonplace in their society sam didnt have a chance this was the only world he knew how would adam ever reconcile the past with the present how could he fairly judge these people and their horrible deed when but for a quirk of fate he wouldve been right there in the middle of them had he been born forty years earlier as he looked at their faces an odd comfort engulfed him though sam was obviously a willing participant he was only one member of the mob only partly guilty clearly the older men with the stern faces had instigated the lynching and the rest had come along for the occasion looking at the photo it was inconceivable to think that sam and his younger buddies had initiated this brutality sam had done nothing to stop it but maybe he had done nothing to encourage it the scene produced a hundred unanswered questions who was the photographer and how did he happen to be there with his camera who was the young black man where was his family his mother howd they catch him had he been in jail and released by the authorities to the mob what did they do with his body when it was over was the alleged rape victim one of the young women smiling at the camera was her father one of the men her brothers if sam was lynching at such an early age what could be expected of him as an adult how often did these folks gather and celebrate like this in rural mississippi how in gods world could sam cayhall have become anything other than himself he never had a chance sam waited patiently in the front office sipping coffee from a different pot it was strong and rich unlike the watereddown brew they served the inmates each morning packer had given it to him in a large paper cup sam sat on the desk with his feet on a chair the door opened and colonel nugent marched inside with packer behind the door was closed sam stiffened and snapped off a smart salute good morning sam nugent said somberly how you doing fabulous you getting by yeah i know you gotta lot on your mind this is tough on you trying to arrange my execution and making sure it goes real smooth tough job my hats off to you nugent ignored the sarcasm need to talk to you about a few things your lawyers now say youre crazy and i just wanted to see for myself how youre doing i feel like a million bucks well you certainly look fine gee thanks you look right spiffy yourself nice

there and strap me down youre giddy with the thought of asking me if i have any last words then nodding at one of your gophers to lock the door and when its all over youll face the press with a sad face and announce that as of twelvefifteen this morning august sam cayhall was executed in the gas chamber here at parchman pursuant to an order of the circuit court of lakehead county mississippi itll be your finest hour nugent dont lie to me the colonel never looked from the sheet of paper we need your list of witnesses see my lawyer and we need to know what to do with your things see my lawyer okay we have numerous requests for interviews from the press see my lawyer nugent jumped to his feet and stormed from the office packer caught the door waited a few seconds then calmly said sit tight sam theres someone else to see you sam smiled and winked at packer then get me some more coffee would you packer packer took the cup and returned with it a few minutes later he also handed sam the sunday paper from jackson and sam was reading all sorts of stories about his execution when the chaplain ralph griffin knocked and entered sam placed the paper on the desk and inspected the minister griffin wore white sneakers faded jeans and a black shirt with a white clerical collar mornin reverend sam said sipping his coffee how are you sam griffin asked as he pulled a chair very near the desk and sat in it right now my hearts filled with hate sam said gravely im sorry whos it directed at colonel nugent but ill get over it have you been praying sam not really why not whats the hurry i have today tomorrow and tuesday i figure you and ill be doing lots of praying come tuesday night if you want its up to you ill be here i want you to be with me up to the last moment reverend if you dont mind you and my lawyer yall are allowed to sit with me during the last hours id be honored thanks what exactly do you want to pray about sam sam took a long drink of coffee well first of all id like to know that when i leave this world all the bad things ive done have been forgiven your sins thats right god expects us to confess our sins to him ad ask for forgiveness all of them one at a time yes the ones we can remember then wed better start now itll take a while as you wish what else would you like to pray for my family such as it is this will be hard on my grandson and my brother and maybe my daughter there wont be a lot of tears shed for me you understand but i would like for them to be comforted and id like to say a prayer for my friends here on the row theyll take it hard anyone else yeah i want to say a good prayer for the kramers especially ruth the family of the victims thats right and also the lincolns who are the lincolns its a long story more victims this is good sam you need to get this off your chest to cleanse your soul itll take years to cleanse my soul reverend more victims sam sat the cup on the desk and gently rubbed his hands together he searched the warm and trusting eyes of ralph griffin what if there are other victims he asked dead people sam nodded very slowly people youve killed sam kept nodding griffin took a deep breath and contemplated matters for a moment well sam to be perfectly honest i wouldnt want to die without confessing these sins and asking god for forgiveness sam kept nodding how many griffin asked sam slid off the desk and eased into his shower shoes he slowly lit a cigarette and began pacing back and forth behind griffins chair the reverend changed positions so he could watch and hear sam there was joe lincoln but ive already written a letter to his family and told them i was sorry you killed him yes he was an african lived on our place i always felt bad about it it was around sam stopped and leaned on a file cabinet he spoke to the floor as if in a daze and there were two men white men who killed my father at a funeral many years ago they served some time in jail and when they got out me and my brothers waited patiently we killed both of them but i never felt that bad about it to be honest they were scum and theyd killed our father killing is always wrong sam youre fighting your own legal killing right now i know did you and your brothers get caught no the old sheriff suspected us but he couldnt prove anything we were too careful besides they were real lowlifes and nobody cared that doesnt make it right i know i always figured they deserved what they got then i was sent to this place life has new meaning when youre on death row you realize how valuable it is now im sorry i killed those boys real sorry anybody else sam walked the length of the room counting each step and returned to the file cabinet the minister waited time meant nothing right now there were a couple of lynchings years ago sam said unable to look griffin in the eyes two i think maybe three no yes there were three but at the first one i was just a kid a small boy and all i did was watch you know from the bushes it was klan lynching and my father was involved in it and me and my brother albert sneaked into the woods and watched it so that doesnt count does it no sams shoulders sank against the wall he closed his eyes and lowered his head the second one was a regular mob i was about fifteen i guess and i was right in the middle of it a girl got raped by an african at least she said it was a rape her reputation left a lot to be desired and two years later she had a baby that was halfafrican so who knows anyway she pointed the finger we got the boy took him out and lynched him i was as guilty as the rest of the mob god will forgive you sam are you sure im positive how many murders will he forgive all of them if you sincerely ask forgiveness then hell wipe the slate clean its in the scriptures thats too good to be true what about the other lynching sam began shaking his head back and fort eyes closed now i cant talk about that one preacher he said exhaling heavily you dont have to talk to me about it sam just talk to god i dont know if i can talk to anybody about it sure you can just close your eyes one night between now and tuesday while youre in your cell and confess all these deeds to god hell instantly forgive you just doesnt seem right you know you kill someone then in a matter of minutes god forgives you just like that its too easy you must be truly sorry oh i am i swear god forgets about it sam but man does not we answer to god but we also answer to the laws of man god will forgive you but you suffer the consequences according to the dictates of the government screw the government im ready to check outta here anyway well lets make sure youre ready okay sam walked to the desk and sat on the corner next to griffin you stick close okay reverend ill need some help theres some bad things buried in my soul it might take some time to get them out it wont be hard sam if youre really ready sam patted him on the knee just stick close okay the front office was filled with blue smoke when adam entered sam was puffing away on the desk reading about himself in the sunday paper three empty coffee cups and several candy wrappers littered the desk youve made yourself at home havent you adam said noticing the debris yeah ive been here all day lots of guests i wouldnt call them guests the day started with nugent so that pretty well ruined things the minister stopped by to see if ive been praying i think he was depressed when he left then the doctor came by to make sure im fit enough to kill then my brother donnie stopped by for a short visit i really want you to meet him tell me youve brought some good news adam shook his head and sat down no nothings changed since yesterday the courts have taken the weekend off do they realize saturdays and sundays count that the clock doesnt stop ticking for me on the weekends it could be good news they could be considering my brilliant appeals maybe but i suspect the honorable brethren are more likely at their lake homes drinking beer and cooking ribs dont you think yeah youre probably right whats in the paper same old rehash of me and my brutal crime pictures of those people out front demonstrating comments from mcallister nothing new ive never seen such excitement youre the man of the hour sam wendall sherman and his publisher are now at a hundred and fifty thousand but the deadline is six oclock tonight hes in memphis sitting with his tape recorders just itching to get down here he says hell need at least two full days to record your story great what exactly am i supposed to do with the money leave it to your precious grandchildren are you serious will you spend it ill do it if youll spend it no im just kidding i dont want the money and carmen doesnt need it i couldnt spend it with a clear conscience good because the last thing i wanna do between now and tuesday night is to sit with a stranger and talk about the past i dont care how much money he has id rather not have a book written about my life ive already told him to forget it atta boy sam eased to his feet and began walking back and forth across the room adam took his place on the edge of the desk and read the sports section of the memphis paper ill be glad when its over adam sam said still walking talking with his hands i cant stand this waiting i swear i wish it was tonight he was suddenly nervous and irritable his voice louder adam placed the paper to his side were gonna win sam trust me win what he snapped angrily win a reprieve big deal what do we gain from that six months a year you know what that means it means well get to do this again someday ill go through the whole damned ritual again counting days losing sleep plotting last minute strategies listening to nugent or some other fool talking to the shrink whispering to the chaplain being patted on the ass and led up here to this cubbyhole because im special he stopped in front of adam and glared down at him his face was angry his eyes wet and bitter im sick of this adam listen to me this is worse than dying we cant quit sam we who the hell is we its my neck on the line not yours if i get a stay then youll go back to your fancy office in chicago and get on with your life youll be the hero because you saved your client youll get your picture in lawyers quarterly or whatever you guys read the bright young star who kicked ass in mississippi saved his grandfather a wretched klucker by the way your client on the other hand is led back to his little cage where he starts counting days again sam threw his cigarette on the floor and grabbed adam by the shou iers look at me son i cant go through thi again i want you to stop everything drop it call the courts and tell them were dismissing all the petitions and appeals im an old man please allow me to die with dignity his hands were shaking his breathing was labored adam searched his brilliant blue eyes surrounded with layers of dark wrinkles and saw a stray tear ease out of one corner and fall slowly down his cheek until it vanished in the gray beard for the first time adam could smell his grandfather the strong nicotine aroma mixed with an odor of dried perspiration to form a scent that was not pleasant it was not repulsive though the way it would have been if radiated by a person with access to plenty of soap and hot water air conditioning and deodorant after the second breath it didnt bother adam at all i dont want you to die sam sam squeezed his shoulders harder why not he demanded because ive just found you youre my grandfather sam stared for a second longer then relaxed he released adam and took a step backward im sorry you found me like this he said wiping his eyes dont apologize but i have to im sorry im not a better grandfather look at me he said glancing down at his legs a wretched old man in a red monkey suit a convicted murderer about to be gassed like an animal and look at you a fine young man with a beautiful education and a bright future where in the world did i go wrong what happened to me ive spent my life hating people and look what i have to show for it you you dont hate anybody and look where youre headed we have the same blood why am i here sam slowly sat in a chair put his elbows on his knees and covered his eyes neither moved or spoke for a long time the occasional voice of a guard could be heard in the hall but the room was quiet you know adam id rather not die in such an awful way sam said hoarsely with his fists resting on his temples still looking blankly at the floor but death itself doesnt worry me now ive known for a long time that i would die here and my biggest fear was dying without knowing anyone would care thats an awful thought you know dying and nobody cares theres nobody to cry and grieve to mourn properly at the funeral and burial ive had dreams where i saw my body in a cheap wooden casket lying in the funeral home in clanton and not a soul was in the room with me not even donnie in the same dream the preacher chuckled through the funeral service because it was just the two of us all alone in the chapel rows and rows of empty pews but thats different now i know somebody cares about me i know youll be sad when i die because you care and i know youll be there when im buried to make sure its done properly im really ready to go now adam im ready fine sam i respect that and i promise ill be here to the bitter end and ill grieve and mourn and after its over ill make sure youre buried properly no ones gonna screw around with you sam as long as im here but please look at it through my eyes i have to give it my best shot because im young and i have the rest of my life dont make me leave here knowing i couldve done more its not fair to me sam folded his arms across his chest and looked at adam his pale face was calm his eyes still wet lets do it this way he said his voice still low and pained im ready to go ill spend tomorrow and tuesday making final preparations ill assume its gonna happen at midnight tuesday and ill be ready for it you on the other hand play it like a game if you can win it good for you if you lose it ill be ready to face the music so youll cooperate no no clemency hearing no more petitions or appeals you have enough junk floating around out there to keep you busy two issues are still alive im not signing any more petitions sam stood his decrepit knees popping and wobbling he walked to the door and leaned on it what about lee he asked softly reaching for his cigarettes shes still in rehab adam lied he was tempted to blurt out the truth it seemed childish to be lying to sam in these declining hours of his life but adam still held a strong hope that she would be found before tuesday do you want to see her i think so can she get out it may be difficult but ill try shes sicker than i first thought shes an alcoholic yes is that all no drugs just alcohol she told me shes had a problem for many years rehab is nothing new bless her heart my children didnt have a chance shes a fine person shes had a rough time with her marriage her son left home at an early age and never returned walt right right adam answered what a heartbroken bunch of people sam was not even certain of the name of his grandson how old is he im not sure probably close to my age does he even know about me i dont know hes been gone for many years lives in amsterdam sam picked up a cup from the desk and took a drink of cold coffee what about carmen he asked adam instinctively glanced at his watch i pick her up at the memphis airport in three hours shell be here in the morning that just scares the hell outta me relax sam shes a great person shes smart ambitious pretty and ive told her all about you whyd you do that because she wants to know poor child did you tell her what i look like dont worry about it sam she doesnt care what you look like did you tell her im not some savage monster i told her you were a sweetheart a real dear sort of a delicate little fella with an earring ponytail limp wrist and these cute little rubber shower shoes that you sort of glide in you kiss my ass and that you seemed to be a real favorite of the boys here in prison youre lying you didnt tell her all that sam was grinning but half serious and his concern was amusing adam laughed a bit too long and a bit too loud but the humor was welcome they both chuckled and tried their best to seem thoroughly amused by their own wit they tried to stretch it out but soon the levity passed and gravity sank in soon they were sitting on the edge of the desk side by side feet on separate chairs staring at the floor while heavy clouds of tobacco smoke boiled above them in the motionless air there was so much to talk about yet there was little to say the legal theories and maneuverings had been beaten to death family was a subject theyd covered as much as theyd dared the weather was good for no more than five minutes of conjecture and both men knew they would spend much of the next two and a half days together serious matters could wait unpleasant subjects could be shoved back just a bit longer twice adam glanced at his watch and said hed best be going and both times sam insisted he stay because when adam left they would come for him and take him back to his cell his little cage where the temperature was over a hundred please stay he begged late that night well after midnight long after adam had told carmen about lee and her problems and about phelps and walt about mcallister and wyn lettner and the theory of the accomplice hours after theyd finished a pizza and discussed their mother and father and grandfather and the whole pathetic bunch adam said the one moment hed never forget was the two of them sitting there on the desk passing time in silence as an invisible clock ticked away with sam patting him on the knee it was like he had to touch me in some affectionate way he explained to her like a good grandfather would touch a small loved one carmen had heard enough for one night shed been on the patio for four hours suffering through the humidity and absorbing the desolate oral history of her fathers family but adam had been very careful hed hit the peaks and skipped the woeful valleys no mention of joe lincoln or lynchings or sketchy hints of other crimes he portrayed sam as a violent man who made terrible mistakes and was now burdened with remorse he had toyed with the idea of showing her his video of sams trials but decided against it he would do it later she could handle only so much in one night at times he couldnt believe the things hed heard in the past four weeks it would be cruel to hit her with all of it in one sitting he loved his sister dearly they had years to discuss the rest of the story monday august am fortytwo hours to go adam entered his office and locked the door he waited until seven then called slatterys office in jackson there was no answer of course but he was hoping for a recorded message that might direct him to another number that might lead to someone down there who could tell him something slattery was sitting on the mental claim just ignoring it as if it was simply another little lawsuit he called information and received the home number for f flynn slattery but decided not to bother him he could wait until nine adam had slept less than three hours his pulse was pounding his adrenaline was pumping his client was now down to the last fortytwo hours and dammit slattery should quickly rule one way or the other it wasnt fair to sit on the damned petition when he could be racing off to other courts with it the phone rang and he lunged for it the death clerk from the fifth circuit informed him that the court was denying the appeal of sams claim of ineffective assistance of counsel it was the opinion of the court that the claim was procedurally barred it shouldve been filed years ago the court did not get to the merits of the issue then whyd the court sit on it for a week adam demanded they couldve reached this nitpicking decision ten days ago ill fax you a copy right now the clerk said thanks im sorry okay keep in touch mr hall well be right here waiting on you adam hung up and went to find coffee darlene arrived tired haggard and early at seventhirty she brought the fax from the fifth circuit along with a raisin bagel adam asked her to fax to the us supreme court the petition for cert on the ineffectiveness claim it had been prepared for three days and mr olander in washington had told darlene that the court was already reviewing it darlene then brought two aspirin and a glass of water his head was splitting as he packed most of the cayhall file into a large briefcase and a cardboard box he gave darlene a list of instructions then he left the office the memphis branch of kravitz bane never to return colonel nugent waited impatiently for the tier door to open then rushed into the hallway with eight members of his select execution team behind him they swarmed into the quietness of tier a with all the finesse of a gestapo squad eight large men half in uniform half plainclothed following a strutting little rooster he stopped at cell six where sam was lying on his bed minding his own business the other inmates were instantly watching and listening their arms hanging through the bars sam its time to go to the observation cell nugent said as if he was truly bothered by this his men lined the wall behind him under the row of windows sam slowly eased himself from the bed and walked to the bars he glared at nugent and asked why because i said so but why move me eight doors down the tier what purpose does it serve its procedure sam its in the book so you dont have a good reason do you i dont need one turn around sam walked to his sink and brushed his teeth for a long time then he stood over his toilet and urinated with his hands on his hips then he washed his hands as nugent and his boys watched and fumed then he lit a cigarette stuck it between his teeth and eased his hands behind his back and through the narrow opening in the door nugent slapped the cuffs on his wrists and nodded at the end of the tier for the door to be opened sam stepped onto the tier he nodded at j b gullitt who was watching in horror and ready to cry he winked at hank henshaw nugent took his arm and walked him to the end of the hall past gullitt and loyd eaton and stock turner and harry ross scott and buddy lee harris and finally past preacher boy who at the moment was lying on his bed face down crying the tier ran to a wall of iron bars identical to those on the front of the cells and the wall had a heavy door in the center of it on the other side was another group of nugents goons all watching quietly and loving every moment of it behind them was a short narrow hallway which led to the isolation room and then to the chamber sam was being moved fortyeight feet closer to death he leaned against the wall puffing watching in stoic silence this was nothing personal just part of the routine nugent walked back to cell six and barked orders four of the guards entered sams cell and began grabbing his possessions books typewriter fan television toiletries clothing they held the items as if they were contaminated and carried them to the observation cell the mattress and bedding were rolled up and moved by a burly plainclothed guard who accidentally stepped on a dragging sheet and ripped it the inmates watched this sudden flurry of activity with a saddened curiosity their cramped little cells were like additional layers of skin and to see one so unmercifully violated was painful it could happen to them the reality of an execution was crashing in they could hear it in the heavy boots shuffling along the tier and in the stern muted voices of the death team the distant slamming of a door wouldve barely been noticed a week ago now it was a jolting shock that rattled the nerves the officers trooped back and forth with sams assets until cell six was bare it was quick work they arranged things in his new home without the slightest care none of the eight worked on the row nugent had read somewhere in naifehs haphazard notes that the members of the execution team should be total strangers to the inmate they should be pulled from the other camps thirtyone officers and guards had volunteered for this duty nugent had chosen only the best is everything in he snapped at one of his men yes sir very well its all yours sam oh thank you sir sam sneered as he entered the cell nugent nodded to the far end of the hall and the door closed he walked forward and grabbed the bars with both hands now listen sam he said gravely sam was leaning with his back to the wall looking away from nugent well be right here if you need anything okay we moved you down here to the end so we can watch you better all right is there anything i can do for you sam continued to look away thoroughly ignoring him very well he backed away and looked at his men lets go he said to them the tier door opened less than ten feet from sam and the death team filed out sam waited nugent glanced up and down the hall then stepped from the tier hey nugent sam suddenly yelled how bout taking these handcuffs off nugent froze and the death team stopped you dumbass sam yelled again as nugent scurried backward fumbling for keys barking orders laughter erupted along the tier loud horselaughs and guffaws and boisterous catcalls you cant leave me handcuffed sam screamed into the hallway nugent was at sams door gritting his teeth cursing finally getting the right key turn around he demanded you ignorant sonofabitch sam yelled through the bars directly into the colonels red face which was less than two feet away the laughter roared even louder and youre in charge of my execution sam said angrily and rather loudly for the benefit of others youll probably gas yourself dont bet on it nugent said tersely now turn around someone either hank henshaw or harry ross scott yelled out barney fife and instantly the chant reverberated along the tier barney fife barney fife barney fife shut up nugent yelled back barney fife barney fife shut up sam finally turned around and stuck out his hands so nugent could reach them the cuffs came off and the colonel quickstepped it through the tier door barney fife barney fife barney fife they chanted in perfect unison until the door clanged shut and the hallway was empty again their voices died suddenly the laughter was gone slowly their arms disappeared from the bars sam stood facing the hall and glared at the two guards who were watching him from the other side of the tier door he spent a few minutes organizing the place plugging in the fan and television stacking his books neatly as if they would be used checking to see if the toilet flushed and the water ran he sat on the bed and inspected the torn sheet this was his fourth cell on the row and undoubtedly the one he would occupy for the briefest period of time he reminisced about the first two especially the second on tier b where his close friend buster moac had lived next door one day they came for buster and brought him here to the observation cell where they watched him around the clock so he wouldnt commit suicide sam had cried when they took buster away virtually every inmate who made it this far also made it to the next stop and then to the last garner goodman was the first guest of the day in the splendid foyer of the governors office he actually signed the guestbook chatted amiably with the pretty receptionist and just wanted the governor to know that he was available she was about to say something else when the phone buzzed on her switchboard she punched a button grimaced listened frowned at goodman who looked away then thanked the caller these people she sighed beg your pardon goodman offered ever the innocent weve been swamped with calls about your clients execution yes its a very emotional case seems as if most people down here are in favor of the death penalty not this one she said recording the call on a pink form almost all of these calls are opposed to his execution you dont say what a surprise ill inform ms stark youre here thank you goodman took his familiar seat in the foyer he glanced through the morning papers again on saturday the daily paper in tupelo made the mistake of beginning a telephone survey to gauge public opinion on the cayhall execution a tollfree number was given on the front page with instructions and of course goodman and his team of market analysts had bombarded the number over the weekend the monday edition ran the results for the first time and they were astounding of three hundred and twenty calls three hundred and two were opposed to the execution goodman smiled to himself as he scanned the paper not too far away the governor was sitting at the long table in his office and scanning the same papers his face was troubled his eyes were sad and worried mona stark walked across the marbled floor with a cup of coffee garner goodmans here waiting in the foyer let him wait the hotlines already flooded mcallister calmly looked at his watch eleven minutes before nine he scratched his chin with his knuckles from pm saturday until pm sunday his pollster had called over two hundred mississippians seventyeight percent favored the death penalty which was not surprising however of the same sample polled fiftyone percent believed sam cayhall should not be executed their reasons varied many felt he was simply too old to face it his crime had been committed twentythree years ago in a generation different from todays he would die in parchman soon enough anyway so leave him alone he was being persecuted for political reasons plus he was white and mcallister and his pollsters knew that factor was very important if unspoken that was the good news the bad news was contained in a printout next to the newspapers working with only one operator the hotline received two hundred and thirtyone calls on saturday and one hundred and eighty on sunday a total of four hundred and eleven over ninetyfive percent opposed the execution since friday morning the hotline had officially recorded eight hundred and ninetyseven calls about old sam with a strong ninety percent plus opposed to his execution and now the hotline was hopping again there was more the regional offices were reporting an avalanche of calls almost all opposed to sam dying staff members were coming to work with stories of long weekends with the phones roxburgh had called to say his lines had been flooded the governor was already tired theres something at ten this morning he said to mona without looking at her yes a meeting with a group of boy scouts cancel it give my apologies reschedule it im not in the mood for any photographs this morning its best if i stay here lunch with senator pressgrove youre supposed to discuss the lawsuit against the universities i cant stand pressgrove cancel it and order some chicken and on second thought bring in goodman she walked to the door disappeared for a minute and returned with garner goodman mcallister was standing by the window staring at the buildings downtown he turned and flashed a weary smile good morning mr goodman they shook hands and took seats late sunday afternoon goodman had delivered to larramore a written request to cancel the clemency hearing pursuant to their clients rather strident demands still dont want a hearing huh the governor said with another tired smile our client says no he has nothing else to add weve tried everything mona handed goodman a cup of black coffee he has a very hard head always has i guess where are the appeals right now mcallister was so sincere proceeding as expected youve been through this before mr goodman i havent whats your prediction as of right now goodman stirred his coffee and pondered the question there was no harm in being honest with the governor not at this point im one of his lawyers so i lean toward optimism id say seventy percent chance of it happening the governor thought about this for a while he could almost hear the phones ringing off the walls even his own people were getting skittishdo you know what i want mr goodman he asked sincerely yeah you want those damned phones to stop ringing goodman thought to himself what id really like to talk to adam hall where is he probably at parchman i talked to him an hour ago can he come here today yes in fact he was planning on arriving in jackson this afternoon good ill wait for him goodman suppressed a smile perhaps a small hole had ruptured in the dam oddly though it was on a different far more unlikely front where the first hint of relief surfaced six blocks away in the federal courthouse breck jefferson entered the office of his boss the honorable f flynn slattery who was on the phone and rather perturbed at a lawyer breck held a thick petition for writ of habeas corpus and a legal pad filled with notes yes slattery barked slamming down the phone we need to talk about cayhall breck said somberly you know weve got his petition alleging mental incompetence lets deny it and get it outta here im too busy to worry with it let cayhall take it to the fifth circuit i dont want that damned thing lying around here breck looked troubled and his words came slower but theres something you need to take a look at aw come on breck what is it he may have a valid claim slatterys face fell and his shoulders slumped come on are you kidding what is it we have a trial starting in thirty minutes theres a jury waiting out there breck jefferson had been the numbertwo student in his law class at emory slattery trusted him implicitly theyre claiming sam lacks the mental competence to face an execution pursuant to a rather broad mississippi statute everybody knows hes crazy they have an expert whos willing to testify its not something we can ignore i dont believe this youd better look at it his honor massaged his forehead with his fingertips sit down let me see it just a few more miles adam said as they sped toward the prison how you doing carmen had said little since they left memphis her first journey into mississippi had been spent looking at the vastness of the delta admiring the lushness of its miles of cotton and beans watching in amazement as crop dusters bounced along the tops of the fields shaking her head at the clusters of impoverished shacks im nervous she admitted not for the first time they had talked briefly about berkeley and chicago and what the next years might bring they had said nothing about their mother or father sam and his family were likewise neglected hes nervous too this is bizarre adam rushing along this highway in this wilderness hurrying to meet a grandfather whos about to be executed he patted her firmly on the knee youre doing the right thing she wore oversized chinos hiking boots a faded red denim shirt very much the grad student in psychology there it is he suddenly pointed ahead on both sides of the highway cars had parked bumper to bumper traffic was slow as people walked toward the prison whats all this she asked this is a circus they passed three klansmen walking on the edge of the pavement carmen stared at them then shook her head in disbelief they inched forward going slightly faster than the people hurrying to the demonstrations in the middle of the highway in front of the entrance two state troopers directed traffic they motioned for adam to turn right which he did a parchman guard pointed to an area along a shallow road ditch they held hands and walked to the front gate pausing for a moment to stare at the dozens of robed klansmen milling about in front of the prison a fiery speech was being delivered into a megaphone that malfunctioned every few seconds a group of brownshirts stood shoulder to shoulder holding signs and facing the traffic no less than five television vans were parked on the other side of the highway cameras were everywhere a news helicopter circled above at the front gate adam introduced carmen to his new pal louise the guard who took care of the paperwork she was nervous and frazzled thered been an altercation or two between the kluckers and the press and the guards things were dicey at the moment and not likely to improve in her opinion a uniformed guard escorted them to a prison van and they hurriedly left the front entrance unbelievable carmen said it gets worse each day wait till tomorrow the van slowed as they eased along the main drive under the large shade trees and in front of the neat white houses carmen watched everything this doesnt look like a prison she said its a farm seventeen thousand acres prison employees live in those houses with children she said looking at bicycles and scooters lying in the front yards its so peaceful where are the prisoners just wait the van turned to the left the pavement stopped and the dirt road began just ahead was the row see the towers there adam pointed the fences and the razor wire she nodded thats the maximum security unit sams home for the past nine and a half years wheres the gas chamber in there two guards looked inside the van then waved it through the double gates it stopped near the front door where packer was waiting adam introduced him to carmen who by now was barely able to speak they stepped inside where packer frisked them gently three other guards watched sams already in there packer said nodding to the front office go on in adam took her hand and clenched it tightly she nodded and they walked to the door he opened it sam was sitting on the edge of the desk as usual his feet were swinging under him and he was not smoking the air in the room was clear and cool he glanced at adam then looked at carmen packer closed the door behind them she released adams hand and walked to the desk looking sam squarely in the eyes im carmen she said softly sam eased from the desk im sam carmen your wayward grandfather he drew her to him and they embraced it took a second or two for adam to realize sam had shaved his beard his hair was shorter and looked much neater his jumpsuit was zipped to the neck sam squeezed her shoulders and examined her face youre as pretty as your mother he said hoarsely his eyes were moist and carmen was fighting back tears she bit her lip and tried to smile thanks for coming he said trying to grin im sorry you had to find me like this you look great she said dont start lying carmen adam said breaking the ice and lets stop the crying before it gets outta hand sit down sam said to her pointing to a chair he sat next to her holding her hand business first sam adam said as he leaned on the desk fifth circuit turned us down early this morning so were off to greener pastures your brother here is quite a lawyer sam said to carmen he gives me this same news every day of course i dont have much to work with adam said hows your mother sam asked her shes fine tell her i asked about her i remember her as a fine person i will any word on lee sam asked him no do you want to see her i think so but if she cant make it ill understand ill see what i can do adam said confidently his last two phone calls to phelps had not been returned frankly he didnt have time at the moment to look for lee sam leaned closer to her adam tells me youre studying psychology thats right im in grad school at cal berkeley ill a sharp knock on the door interrupted the conversation adam opened it slightly and saw the anxious face of lucas mann excuse me for a minute he said to sam and carmen and stepped into the hall whats up he asked garner goodmans looking for you mann said almost in a whisper he wants you in jackson immediately why whats going on looks like one of your claims has found its mark adams heart stopped which one judge slattery wants to talk about the mental incompetence hes scheduled a hearing for five this afternoon dont say anything to me because i might be a witness for the state adam closed his eyes and gently tapped his head against the wall a thousand thoughts swirled wildly through his brain five this afternoon slattery hard to believe look you need to move fast i need a phone theres one in there mann said nodding to the door behind adam look adam its none of my business but i wouldnt tell sam this is still a long shot and theres no sense getting his hopes up if it was my decision id wait until the hearing is over youre right thanks lucas sure ill see you in jackson adam returned to the room where the cussion had drifted to life in the bay area its nothing adam said with a frown and went casually to the phone he ignored their quiet talk as he punched the numbers garner its adam im here with sam whats up get your ass down here old boy goodman said calmly things are moving im listening sam was describing his first and only trip to san francisco decades ago first the governor wants to talk privately with you he seems to be suffering were wearing his ass out with the phones and hes feeling the heat more importantly slattery of all people is hung up on the mental claim i talked with him thirty minutes ago and hes just thoroughly confused i didnt help matters he wants a hearing at five this afternoon ive already talked to dr swinn and hes on standby hell land in jackson at threethirty and be ready to testify im on my way adam said with his back to sam and carmen meet me at the governors office adam hung up just getting the appeals filed he explained to sam who at the moment was totally indifferent i need to get to jackson whats the hurry sam asked like a man with years to live and nothing to do hurry did you say hurry its ten oclock sam on monday we have exactly thirtyeight hours to find a miracle there wont be any miracles adam he turned to carmen still holding her hand dont get your hopes up dear maybe no its my time okay and im very ready i dont want you to be sad when its over we need to go sam adam said touching his shoulder ill be back either late tonight or early in the morning carmen leaned over and kissed sam on the cheek my heart is with you sam she whispered he hugged her for a second then stood by the desk you take care kid study hard and all that and dont think badly of me okay im here for a reason its nobodys fault but mine theres a better life waiting on me outside this place carmen stood and hugged him again she was crying as they left the room by noon judge slattery had fully embraced the gravity of the moment and though he tried hard to conceal it he was enjoying immensely this brief interval in the center of the storm first he had dismissed the jury and lawyers in the civil trial pending before him he had twice talked to the clerk of the fifth circuit in new orleans then to justice mcneely himself the big moment had come a few minutes after eleven when supreme court justice edward f allbright called fromwashington to get an update allbright was monitoring the case by the hour they talked law and theory neither man was opposed to the death penalty and both had particular problems with the mississippi statute in question they were concerned that it could be abused by any death row inmate who could pretend to be insane and find a wacky doctor to play along the reporters quickly learned that a hearing of some type was scheduled and they not only flooded slatterys office with calls but parked themselves in his receptionists office the us marshall was called to disperse the reporters the secretary brought messages by the minute breck jefferson dug through countless law books and scattered research over the long conference table slattery talked to the governor the attorney general garner goodman dozens of others his shoes were under his massive desk he walked around it holding the receiver with a long cord thoroughly enjoying the madness if slatterys office was hectic then the attorney generals was pure chaos roxburgh had gone ballistic with the news that one of cayhalls shots in the dark had hit a target you fight these bears for ten years up and down the appellate ladders out of one courtroom and into another battling the creative legal minds of the aclu and similar outfits producing along the way enough paperwork to destroy a rain forest and right when youve got him in your sights he files a ton of gangplank appeals and one of them gets noticed by a judge somewhere who just happens to be in a tender mood he had stormed down the hall to the office of morris henry dr death himself and together they hastily had assembled a team of their best criminal boys they met in a large library with rows and stacks of the latest books they reviewed the cayhall petition and the applicable law and they plotted strategy witnesses were needed who had seen cayhall in the last month who could testify about the things he said and did there was no time for one of their doctors to examine him he had a doctor but they didnt this was a significant problem to get their hands on him with a reputable doctor the state would be forced to ask for time and time meant a stay of execution a stay was out of the question the guards saw him every day who else roxburgh called lucas mann who suggested that he talk to colonel nugent nugent said hed seen sam just hours earlier and yes of course he would be happy to testify son of a bitch wasnt crazy he was just mean and sergeant packer saw him every day and the prison psychiatrist dr n stegall had met with sam and she could testify nugent was anxious to help he also suggested the prison chaplain and he would think about others morris henry organized a hit squad of four lawyers to do nothing but dig for dirt on dr anson swinn find other cases hed been involved in talk to other lawyers around the country locate transcripts of his testimony the guy was nothing but a hired mouthpiece a professional testifier get the goods to discredit him once roxburgh had the attack planned and others doing the work he rode the elevator to the lobby of the building to chat with the press adam parked in a vacant spot on the grounds of the state capitol goodman was waiting under a shade tree with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up his paisley bow tie perfect adam quickly introduced carmen to mr goodman the governor wants to see you at two i just left his office for the third time this morning lets walk to our place he said waving toward downtown its just a coupla blocks did you meet sam goodman asked carmen yes this morning im glad you did whats on the governors mind adam asked they were walking much too slow to suit him relax he told himself just relax who knows he wants to meet with you privately maybe the market analysis is getting to him maybe hes planning a media stunt maybe hes sincere i cant read him he does look tired though the phone calls are getting through splendidly no ones suspicious not yet frankly were hitting them so fast and so hard i doubt they have time to trace calls carmen shot a blank look at her brother who was too preoccupied to see it whats the latest from slattery adam asked as they crossed a street pausing for a minute in silence to watch the demonstration under way on the front steps of the capitol nothing since ten this morning his clerk called you in memphis and your secretary gave him my number here thats how they found me he told me about the hearing and said slattery wants the lawyers in his chamber at three to plan things what does this mean adam asked desperate for his mentor to say that they were on the brink of a major victory goodman sensed adams anxiety i honestly dont know its good news but no one knows how permanent it is hearings at this stage are not unusual they crossed another street and entered the building upstairs the temporary office was buzzing as four law students rattled away on cordless phones two were sitting with their feet on the table one stood in the window and talked earnestly one was pacing along the far wall phone stuck to her head adam stood by the door and tried to absorb the scene carmen was hopelessly confused goodman explained things in a loud whisper were averaging about sixty calls an hour we dial more than that but the lines stay jammed obviously were responsible for the jamming and this keeps other people from getting through it was much slower over the weekend the hotline used only one operator he delivered this summary like a proud plant manager showing off the latest in automated machinery who are they calling carmen asked a law student stepped forward and introduced himself to adam and then to carmen he was having a ball he said would you like something to eat goodman asked we have some sandwiches adam declined who are they calling carmen asked again the governors hotline adam replied without explanation they listened to the nearest caller as he changed his voice and read a name from a phone list he was now benny chase from hickory flat mississippi and he had voted for the governor and didnt think sam cayhall should be executed it was time for the governor to step forward and take care of this situation carmen cut her eyes at her brother but he ignored her these four are law students at mississippi college goodman explained further weve used about a dozen students since friday different ages whites and blacks male and female professor glass has been most helpful in finding these people hes made calls too so have hez kerry and his boys at the defense group weve had at least twenty people calling they pulled three chairs to the end of a table and sat down goodman found soft drinks in a plastic cooler and sat them on the table he continued talking in a low voice john bryan glass is doing some research as we speak hell have a brief prepared by four hez kerry is also at work hes checking with his counterparts in other death states to see if similar statutes have been used recently kerry is the black guy adam said yeah hes the director of the southern capital defense group very sharp a black lawyer busting his butt to save sam it makes no difference to hez its just another death case id like to meet him you will all these guys will be at the hearing and theyre working for free carmen asked sort of kerry is on salary part of his job is to monitor every death case in this state but since sam has private lawyers kerry is off the hook hes donating his time but its something he wants to do professor glass is on salary at the law school but this is definitely outside the scope of his employment there were paying these students five bucks an hour whos paying them she asked dear old kravitz bane adam grabbed a nearby phonebook carmen needs to get a flight out of here this afternoon he said flipping to the yellow pages ill take care of it goodman said taking the phonebook where to san francisco ill see whats available look theres a little deli around the corner why dont you two get something to eat well walk to the governors office at two i need to get to a library adam said looking at his watch it was almost one oclock go eat adam and try to relax well have time later to sit down with the brain trust and talk strategy right now you need to relax and eat im hungry carmen said anxious to be alone with her brother for a few minutes they eased from the room and closed the door behind them she stopped him in the shabby hallway before they reached the stairs please explain that to me she insisted grabbing his arm what that little room in there its pretty obvious isnt it is it legal its not illegal is it ethical adam took a deep breath and stared at the wall what are they planning to do with sam execute him execute gas exterminate kill call it what you want but its murder carmen legal murder its wrong and im trying to stop it its a dirty business and if i have to bend a few ethics i dont care it stinks so does the gas chamber she shook her head and held her words twentyfour hours earlier shed been eating lunch with her boyfriend at a sidewalk cafe in san francisco now she wasnt sure where she was dont condemn me for this carmen these are desperate hours okay she said and headed down the stairs the governor and the young lawyer were alone in the vast office in the comfortable leather chairs their legs crossed and feet almost touching goodman was rushing carmen to the airport to catch a flight mona stark was nowhere in sight its strange you know youre the grandson and youve known him for less than a month mcallisters words were calm almost tired but ive known him for many years in fact hes been a part of my life for a long time and ive always thought that id look forward to this day ive wanted him to die you know to be punished for killing those boys he flipped his bangs and gently rubbed his eyes his words were so genuine as if two old friends were catching up on the gossip but now im not so sure i have to tell you adam the pressures getting to me he was either being brutally honest or he was a talented actor adam couldnt tell what will the state prove if sam dies adam asked will this be a better place to live when the sun comes up wednesday morning and hes dead no but then you dont believe in the death penalty i do why because there has to be an ultimate punishment for murder put yourself in ruth kramers position and youd feel differently the problem you have adam and people like you is that you forget about the victims we could argue for hours about the death penalty youre right lets skip it has sam told you anything new about the bombing i cant divulge what sams told me but the answer is no maybe he acted alone i dont know what difference would it make today the day before the execution im not sure to be honest but if i knew that sam was only an accomplice that someone else was responsible for the killings then it would be impossible for me to allow him to be executed i could stop it you know i could do that id catch hell for it it would hurt me politically the damage could be irreparable but i wouldnt mind im getting tired of politics and i dont enjoy being placed in this position the giver or taker of life but i could pardon sam if i knew the truth you believe he had help youve told me that already the fbi agent in charge of the investigation believes it too why dont you act on your beliefs and grant clemency because were not certain so one word from sam just one name thrown out here in the final hours and bingo you take your pen and save his life no but i might grant a reprieve so the name could be investigated it wont happen governor ive tried ive asked so often and hes denied so much that its not even discussed anymore whos he protecting hell if i know perhaps were wrong has he ever given you the details of the bombing again i cant talk about our conversations but he takes full responsibility for it then why should i consider clemency if the criminal himself claims he did the crime and acted alone how am i supposed to help him help him because hes an old man wholl die soon enough anyway help him because its the right thing to do and deep down in your heart you want to do it itll take guts he hates me doesnt he yes but he could come around give him a pardon and hell be your biggest fan mcallister smiled and unwrapped a peppermint is he really insane our expert says he is well do our best to convince judge slattery i know but really youve spent hours with him does he know whats happening at this point adam decided against honesty mcallister was not a friend and not at all trustworthy hes pretty sad adam admitted frankly im surprised any person can keep his mind after a few months on death row sam was an old man when he got there and hes slowly wasted away thats one reason hes declined all interviews hes quite pitiful adam couldnt tell if the governor believed this but he certainly absorbed it whats your schedule tomorrow mcallister asked i have no idea it depends on what happens in slatterys court i had planned to spend most of the day with sam but i might be running around filing last minute appeals i gave you my private number lets keep in touch tomorrow sam took three bites of pinto beans and some of the corn bread then placed the tray at the end of his bed the same idiot guard with the blank face watched him through the bars of the tier door life was bad enough in these cramped cubicles but living like an animal and being watched was unbearable it was six oclock time for the evening news he was anxious to hear what the world was saying about him the jackson station began with the breaking story of a last minute hearing before federal judge f flynn slattery the report cut to the outside of the federal courthouse in jackson where an anxious young man with a microphone explained that the hearing had been delayed a bit as the lawyers wrangled in slatterys office he tried his best to briefly explain the issue the defense was now claiming that mr cayhall lacked sufficient mental capacity to understand why he was being executed he was senile and insane claimed the defense which would call a noted psychiatrist in this last ditch effort to stop the execution the hearing was expected to get under way at any moment and no one knew when a decision might be reached by judge slattery back to the anchorwoman who said that meanwhile up at the state penitentiary at parchman all systems were go for the execution another young man with a microphone was suddenly on the screen standing somewhere near the front gate of the prison describing the increased security he pointed to his right and the camera panned the area near the highway where a regular carnival was happening the highway patrol was out in force directing traffic and keeping a wary eye on an assemblage of several dozen ku klux klansmen other protestors included various groups of white supremacists and the usual death penalty abolitionists he said the camera swung back to the reporter who now had with him colonel george nugent acting superintendent for parchman and the man in charge of the execution nugent grimly answered a few questions said things were very much under control and if the courts gave the green light then the execution would be carried out according to the law sam turned off the television adam had called two hours earlier and explained the hearing so he was prepared to hear that he was senile and insane and god knows what else still he didnt like it it was bad enough waiting to be executed but to have his sanity slandered so nonchalantly seemed like a cruel invasion of privacy the tier was hot and quiet the televisions and radios were turned down next door preacher boy softly sang the old rugged cross and it was not unpleasant in a neat pile on the floor against the wall was his new outfit a plain white cotton shirt dickies white socks and a pair of brown loafers donnie had spent an hour with him during the afternoon he turned off the light and relaxed on the bed thirty hours to live the main courtroom in the federal building was packed when slattery finally released the lawyers from his chamber for the third time it was the last of a series of heated conferences that had dragged on for most of the afternoon it was now almost seven they filed into the courtroom and took their places behind the appropriate tables adam sat with garner goodman in a row of chairs behind them were hez kerry john bryan glass and three of his law students roxburgh morris henry and a half dozen assistants crowded around the states table two rows behind them behind the bar sat the governor with mona stark on one side and larramore on the other the rest of the crowd was primarily reporters no cameras were allowed there were curious spectators law students other lawyers it was open to the public in the back row dressed comfortably in a sports coat and tie was rollie wedge slattery made his entrance and everyone stood for a moment be seated he said into his microphone lets go on the record he said to the court reporter he gave a succinct review of the petition and the applicable law and outlined the parameters of the hearing he was not in the mood for lengthy arguments and pointless questions so move it along he told the lawyers is the petitioner ready he asked in adams direction adam stood nervously and said yes sir the petitioner calls dr anson swinn swinn stood from the first row and walked to the witness stand where he was sworn in adam walked to the podium in the center of the courtroom holding his notes and pushing himself to be strong his notes were typed and meticulous the result of some superb research and preparation by hez kerry and john bryan glass the two along with kerrys staff had devoted the entire day to sam cayhall and this hearing and they were ready to work all night and throughout tomorrow adam began by asking swinn some basic questions about his education and training swinns answers were accented with the crispness of the upper midwest and this was fine experts should talk differently and travel great distances in order to be highly regarded with his black hair black beard black glasses and black suit he indeed gave the appearance of an ominously brilliant master of his field the preliminary questions were short and to the point but only because slattery had already reviewed swinns qualifications and ruled that he could in fact testify as an expert the state could attack his credentials on crossexamination but his testimony would go into the record with adam leading the way swinn talked about his two hours with sam cayhall on the previous tuesday he described his physical condition and did so with such relish that sam sounded like a corpse he was quite probably insane though insanity was a legal term not medical he had difficulty answering even basic questions like what did you eat for breakfast who is in the cell next to you when did your wife die who was your lawyer during the first trial and on and on swinn very carefully covered his tracks by repeatedly telling the court that two hours simply was not enough time to thoroughly diagnose mr cayhall more time was needed in his opinion sam cayhall did not appreciate the fact that he was about to die did not understand why he was being executed and certainly didnt realize he was being punished for a crime adam gritted his teeth to keep from wincing at times but swinn was certainly convincing mr cayhall was completely calm and at ease clueless about his fate wasting away his days in a sixbynine cell it was quite sad one of the worst cases hed encountered under different circumstances adam wouldve been horrified to place on the stand a witness so obviously full of bull but at this moment he was mighty proud of this bizarre little man human life was at stake slattery was not about to cut short the testimony of dr swinn this case would be reviewed instantly by the fifth circuit and perhaps the us supreme court and he wanted no one from above secondguessing him goodman suspected this and swinn had been prepped to ramble so with the courts indulgence swinn launched into the likely causes of sams problems he described the horrors of living in a cell twentythree hours a day of knowing the gas chamber is a stones throw away of being denied companionship decent food sex movement plenty of exercise fresh air hed worked with many death row inmates around the country and knew their problems well sam of course was much different because of his age the average death row inmate is thirtyone years old and has spent four years waiting to die sam was sixty when he first arrived at parchman physically and mentally he was not suited for it it was inevitable he would deteriorate swinn was under adams direct examination for fortyfive minutes when adam had exhausted his questions he sat down steve roxburgh strutted to the podium and stared at swinn swinn knew what was coming and he was not the least bit concerned roxburgh began by asking who was paying for his services and how much he was charging swinn said kravitz bane was paying him two hundred dollars an hour big deal there was no jury in the box slattery knew that all experts get paid or they couldnt testify roxburgh tried to chip away at swinns professional qualifications but got nowhere the man was a welleducated welltrained experienced psychiatrist so what if he decided years ago he could make more money as an expert witness his qualifications werent diminished and roxburgh was not about to argue medicine with a doctor the questions grew even stranger as roxburgh began asking about other lawsuits in which swinn had testified there was a kid who was burned in a car wreck in ohio and swinn had given his opinion that the child was completely mentally disabled hardly an extreme opinion where are you going with this slattery interrupted loudly roxburgh glanced at his notes then said your honor were attempting to discredit this witness i know that but its not working mr roxburgh this court knows that this witness has testified in many trials around the country whats the point we are attempting to show that he is willing to state some pretty wild opinions if the money is right lawyers do that every day mr roxburgh there was some very light laughter in the audience but very reserved i dont want to hear it slattery snapped now move on roxburgh shouldve sat down but the moment was too rich for that he moved to the next minefield and began asking questions about swinns examination of sam he went nowhere swinn fielded each question with a fluid answer that only added to his testimony on direct examination he repeated much of the sad description of sam cayhall roxburgh scored no points and once thoroughly trounced finally went to his seat swinn was dismissed from the stand the next and last witness for the petitioner was a surprise though slattery had already approved him adam called mr e garner goodman to the stand goodman was sworn and took his seat adam asked about his firms representation of sam cayhall and goodman briefly outlined the history of it for the record slattery already knew most of it goodman smiled when he recalled sams efforts to fire kravitz bane does kravitz bane represent mr cayhall at this moment adam asked indeed we do and youre here in jackson at this moment working on the case thats correct in your opinion mr goodman do you believe sam cayhall has told his lawyers everything about the kramer bombing no i do not rollie wedge sat up a bit and listened intensely would you please explain certainly there has always been strong circumstantial evidence that another person was with sam cayhall during the kramer bombing and the bombings which preceded it mr cayhall always refused to discuss this with me his lawyer and even now will not cooperate with his attorneys obviously at this point in this case it is crucial that he fully divulge everything to his lawyers and he is unable to do so there are facts we should know but he wont tell us wedge was at once nervous and relieved sam was holding fast but his lawyers were trying everything adam asked a few more questions and sat down roxburgh asked only one when was the last time you spoke with mr cayhall goodman hesitated and thought about the answer he honestly couldnt remember exactly when im not sure its been two or three years two or three years and youre his lawyer im one of his lawyers mr hall is now the principal lawyer on this case and hes spent innumerable hours with the client during the last month roxburgh sat down and goodman returned to his seat at the table we have no more witnesses your honor adam said for the record call your first witness mr roxburgh slattery said the state calls colonel george nugent roxburgh announced nugent was found in the hallway and escorted to the witness stand his olive shirt and pants were wrinklefree the boots were gleaming he stated for the record who he was and what he was doing i was at parchman an hour ago he said looking at his watch just flew down on the state helicopter when did you last see sam cayhall roxburgh asked he was moved to the observation cell at nine this morning i spoke with him then was he mentally alert or just drooling over in the corner like an idiot adam started to jump and object but goodman grabbed his arm he was extremely alert nugent said eagerly very sharp he asked me why he was being moved from his cell to another one he understood what was happening he didnt like it but then sam doesnt like anything these days did you see him yesterday yes and was he able to speak or just lying around like a vegetable oh he was quite talkative what did you talk about i had a checklist of things i needed to cover with sam he was very hostile even threatened me with bodily harm hes a very abrasive person with a sharp tongue he settled down a bit and we talked about his last meal his witnesses what to do with his personal effects things such as that we talked about the execution is he aware he is about to be executed nugent burst into laughter what kind of question is that just answer it slattery said without a smile of course he knows he knows damned well whats going on hes not crazy he told me the execution would not take place because his lawyers were about to unload the heavy artillery as he put it theyve planned all this nugent waved both hands at the entire courtroom roxburgh asked about prior meetings with sam and nugent spared no details he seemed to remember every word sam had uttered in the past two weeks especially the biting sarcasm and caustic remarks adam knew it was all true he huddled quickly with garner goodman and they decided to forgo any crossexamination little could be gained from it nugent marched down the aisle and out of the courtroom the man had a mission he was needed at parchman the states second witness was dr n stegall psychiatrist for the department of corrections she made her way to the witness stand as roxburgh conferred with morris henry state your name for the record slattery said dr n stegall ann his honor asked no n its an initial slattery looked down at her then looked at roxburgh who shrugged as if he didnt know what to say the judge eased even closer to the edge of his bench and peered down at the witness stand look doctor i didnt ask for your initial i asked for your name now you state it for the record and be quick about it she jerked her eyes away from his cleared her throat and reluctantly said neldeen no wonder thought adam why hadnt she changed it to something else roxburgh seized the moment and asked her a rapid series of questions about her qualifications and training slattery had already deemed her fit to testify now dr stegall roxburgh began careful to avoid any reference to neldeen when did you meet with sam cayhall she held a sheet of paper which she looked at thursday july and the purpose of this visit as part of my job i routinely visit death row inmates especially those with executions approaching i provide counseling and medication if they request it describe mr cayhalls mental condition extremely alert very bright very sharptongued almost to the point of being rude in fact he was quite rude to me and he asked me not to come back did he discuss his execution yes in fact he knew that he had thirteen days to go and he accused me of trying to give him medication so he wouldnt be any trouble when his time came he also expressed concern for another death row inmate randy dupree who sam thinks is deteriorating mentally he was most concerned about mr dupree and chastised me for not examining him in your opinion is he suffering from any form of decreased mental capacity not at all his mind is very sharp no further questions roxburgh said and sat down adam walked purposefully to the podium tell us dr stegall how is randy dupree doing he asked at full volume i uh i havent had a chance to see him yet sam told you about him eleven days ago and you havent bothered to meet with him ive been busy how long have you held your present job four years and in four years how many times have you talked to sam cayhall once you dont care much for the death row inmates do you dr stegall i certainly do how many men are on death row right now well uh im not sure around forty i think how many have you actually talked to give us a few names whether it was fear or anger or ignorance no one could tell but neldeen froze she grimaced and cocked her head to one side obviously trying to pull a name from the air and obviously unable to do so adam allowed her to hang for a moment then said thank you dr stegall he turned and walked slowly back to his chair call your next witness slattery demanded the state calls sergeant clyde packer packer was fetched from the hallway and led to the front of the courtroom he was still in uniform but the gun had been removed he swore to tell the truth and took his seat on the witness stand adam was not surprised at the effect of packers testimony he was an honest man who simply told what hed seen hed known sam for nine and a half years and he was the same today as he was when he first arrived he typed letters and law papers all day long read many books especially legal ones he typed writs for his buddies on the row and he typed letters to wives and girlfriends for some of the guys who couldnt spell he chainsmoked because he wanted to kill himself before the state got around to it he loaned money to friends in packers humble opinion sam was as mentally alert now as hed been nine and a half years earlier and his mind was very quick slattery leaned a bit closer to the edge of the bench when packer described sams checkers games with henshaw and gullitt does he win his honor asked interrupting almost always perhaps the turning point of the hearing came when packer told the story of sam wanting to see a sunrise before he died it happened late last week when packer was making his rounds one morning sam had quietly made the request he knew he was about to die said he was ready to go and that hed like to sneak out early one morning to the bullpen on the east end and see the sun come up so packer took care of it and last saturday sam spent an hour sipping coffee and waiting for the sun afterward he was very grateful adam had no questions for packer he was excused and left the courtroom roxburgh announced that the next witness was ralph griffin the prison chaplain griffin was led to the stand and looked uncomfortably around the courtroom he gave his name and occupation then glanced warily at roxburgh do you know sam cayhall roxburgh asked i do have you counseled him recently yes when did you last see him yesterday sunday and how would you describe his mental state i cant i beg your pardon i said i cant describe his mental condition why not because right now im his minister and anything he says or does in my presence is strictly confidential i cant testify against mr cayhall roxburgh stalled for a moment trying to decide what to do next it was obvious neither he nor his learned underlings had given any thought to this situation perhaps theyd just assumed that since the chaplain was working for the state then hed cooperate with them griffin waited expectantly for an assault from roxburgh slattery settled the matter quickly a very good point mr roxburgh this witness should not be here whos next no further witnesses the attorney general said anxious to leave the podium and get to his seat his honor scribbled some notes at length then looked at the crowded courtroom i will take this matter under advisement and render an opinion probably early in the morning as soon as my decision is ready we will notify the attorneys you dont need to hang around here well call you courts adjourned everyone stood and hurried for the rear doors adam caught the reverend ralph griffin and thanked him then he returned to the table where goodman hez kerry professor glass and the students were waiting they huddled and whispered until the crowd was gone then left the courtroom someone mentioned drinks and dinner it was almost nine reporters were waiting outside the door to the courtroom adam threw out a few polite nocomments and kept walking rollie wedge eased behind adam and goodman as they inched through the crowded hallway he vanished as they left the building two groups of cameras were ready outside on the front steps roxburgh was addressing one batch of reporters and not far away on the sidewalk the governor was holding forth as adam walked by he heard mcallister say that clemency was being considered and that it would be a long night tomorrow would be even tougher would he attend the execution someone asked adam couldnt hear the reply they met at hal and mals a popular downtown restaurant and watering hole hez found a large table in a corner near the front and ordered a round of beer a blues band was cranked up in the back the dining room and bar were crowded adam sat in a corner next to hez and relaxed for the first time in hours the beer went down fast and calmed him they ordered red beans and rice and chatted about the hearing hez said hed performed wonderfully and the law students were full of compliments the mood was optimistic adam thanked them for their help goodman and glass were at the far end of the table lost in a conversation about another death row case time passed slowly and adam attacked his dinner when it arrived this is probably not a good time to bring this up hez said out of the corner of his mouth he wanted no one to hear but adam the band was even louder now i guess youll go back to chicago when this is over he said looking at goodman to make sure he was still engaged with glass i guess so adam said without conviction hed had little time to think past tomorrow well just so youll know theres an opening in our office one of my guys is going into private practice and were looking for a new lawyer its nothing but death work you know youre right adam said quietly this is a lousy time to bring it up its tough work but its satisfying its also heartbreaking and necessary hez chewed on a bite of sausage and washed it down with beer the money is lousy compared with what youre making with the firm tight budget long hours lots of clients how much i can start you at thirty thousand im making sixtytwo right now with more on the way ive been there i was making seventy with a big firm in dc when i gave it up to come here i was on the fast track to a partnership but it was easy to quit moneys not everything you enjoy this it grows on you it takes strong moral convictions to fight the system like this just think about it goodman was now looking their way are you driving to parchman tonight he asked loudly adam was finishing his second beer he wanted a third but no more exhaustion was rapidly setting in no ill wait until we hear something in the morning they ate and drank and listened to goodman and glass and kerry tell war stories of other executions the beer flowed and the atmosphere went from optimism to outright confidence sam lay in the darkness and waited for midnight hed watched the late news and learned that the hearing was over and that the clock was still ticking there was no stay his life was in the hands of a federal judge at one minute after midnight he closed his eyes and said a prayer he asked god to help lee with her troubles to be with carmen and to give adam the strength to survive the inevitable he had twentyfour hours to live he folded his hands over his chest and fell asleep nugent waited until exactly seven thirty to close the door and start the meeting he walked to the front of the room and surveyed his troops i just left msu he said somberly the inmate is awake and alert not at all the blithering zombie we read about in the paper this morning he paused and smiled and expected everyone to admire his humor it went undetected in fact hes already had his breakfast and is already bitching about wanting his recreation time so at least something is normal around here theres no word from the federal court in jackson so this thing is on schedule unless we hear otherwise correct mr mann lucas was sitting at the table across the front of the room reading the paper and trying to ignore the colonel right now there are two areas of concern first is the press ive assigned sergeant moreland here to handle these bastards were gonna move them to the visitors center just inside the front gate and try to keep them pinned down there were gonna surround them with guards and just dare them to venture about at four this afternoon ill conduct the lottery to see which reporters get to watch the execution as of yesterday there were over a hundred names on the request list they get five seats the second problem is whats happening outside the gate the governor has agreed to assign three dozen troopers for today and tomorrow and theyll be here shortly we have to keep our distance from these nuts especially the skinheads sumbitches are crazy but at the same time we have to maintain order there were two fights yesterday and things couldve deteriorated rapidly if we hadnt been watching if the execution takes place there could be some tense moments any questions there were none very well ill expect everyone to act professionally today and carry this out in a responsible manner dismissed he snapped off a smart salute and proudly watched them leave the room sam straddled the bench with the checkerboard in front of him and waited patiently for j b gullitt to enter the bullpen he sipped the stale remains of a cup of coffee gullitt stepped through the door and paused as the handcuffs were removed he rubbed his wrists shielded his eyes from the sun and looked at his friend sitting alone he walked to the bench and took his position across the board sam never looked up any good news sam gullitt asked nervously tell me it wont happen just move sam said staring at the checkers it cant happen sam he pleaded its your turn to go first move gullitt slowly lowered his eyes to the board the prevailing theory of the morning was that the longer slattery sat on the petition the greater the likelihood of a stay but this was the conventional wisdom of those who were praying for a reprieve no word had come by am nothing by adam waited in hez kerrys office which had become the operations center during the past twentyfour hours goodman was across town supervising the relentless hounding of the governors hotline a task he seemed to savor john bryan glass had parked himself outside slatterys office in the event slattery denied a stay they would immediately appeal to the fifth circuit the appeal was completed by nine just in case kerry had also prepared a petition for cert to the us supreme court if the fifth circuit turned them down the paperwork was waiting everything was waiting to occupy his mind adam called everyone he could think of he called carmen in berkeley she was asleep and fine he called lees condo and of course there was no answer he called phelps office and talked to a secretary he called darlene to tell her he had no idea when he might return he called mcallisters private number but got a busy signal perhaps goodman had it jammed too he called sam and talked about the hearing last night with special emphasis on the reverend ralph griffin packer had testified too he explained and told only the truth nugent typically was an ass he told sam he would be there around noon sam asked him to hurry by eleven slatterys name was being cursed and defamed with righteous fervor adam had had enough he called goodman and said he was driving to parchman he said farewell to hez kerry and thanked him again then he raced away out of the city of jackson north on highway parchman was two hours away if he drove within the speed limit he found a talk radio station that promised the latest news twice an hour and listened to an interminable discussion about casino gambling in mississippi there was nothing new on the cayhall execution at the eleventhirty newsbreak he drove eighty and ninety passing on yellow lines and on curves and over bridges he sped through speed zones in tiny towns and hamlets he was uncertain what drew him to parchman with such speed there wasnt much he could do once he got there the legal maneuverings had been left behind in jackson he would sit with sam and count the hours or maybe they would celebrate a wonderful gift from federal court he stopped at a roadside grocery near the small town of flora for gas and fruit juice and he was driving away from the pumps when he heard the news the bored and listless talk show host was now filled with excitement as he relayed the breaking story in the cayhall case united states district court judge f flynn slattery had just denied cayhalls last petition his claim to be mentally incompetent the matter would be appealed to the fifth circuit within the hour sam cayhall had just taken a giant step toward the mississippi gas chamber the host said dramatically instead of punching the accelerator adam slowed to a reasonable speed and sipped his drink he turned off the radio he cracked his window to allow the warm air to circulate he cursed slattery for many miles talking vainly at the windshield and dragging up all sorts of vile names it was now a little past noon slattery in all fairness couldve ruled five hours ago hell if he had guts he couldve ruled last night they could be in front of the fifth circuit already he cursed breck jefferson also for good measure sam had told him from the beginning that mississippi wanted an execution it was lagging behind louisiana and texas and florida even alabama and georgia and virginia were killing at a more enviable rate something had to be done the appeals were endless the criminals were coddled crime was rampant it was time to execute somebody and show the rest of the country that this state was serious about law and order adam finally believed him he stopped the swearing after a while he finished the drink and threw the bottle over the car and into a ditch in direct violation of mississippi laws against littering it was difficult to express his present opinions of mississippi and its laws he could see sam sitting in his cell watching the television hearing the news adams heart ached for the old man he had failed as a lawyer his client was about to die at the hands of the government and there wasnt a damned thing he could do about it the news electrified the army of reporters and cameramen now sprawled about the small visitors center just inside the front gate they gathered around portable televisions and watched their stations in jackson and memphis at least four shot live segments from parchman while countless others milled around the area their little section of ground had been cordoned off by ropes and barricades and was being watched closely by nugents troops the racket increased noticeably along the highway when the news spread the klansmen now a hundred strong began chanting loudly in the direction of the administration buildings the skinheads and nazis and aryans hurled obscenities at anyone who would listen to them the nuns and other silent protestors sat under umbrellas and tried to ignore their rowdy neighbors sam heard the news as he was holding a bowl of turnip greens his final meal before his last meal he stared at the television watched the scenes switch from jackson to parchman and back again a young black lawyer hed never heard of was talking to a reporter and explaining what he and the rest of the cayhall defense team would do next his friend buster moac had complained that there were so damned many lawyers involved with his case in the last days that he couldnt keep up with who was on his side and who was trying to kill him but sam was certain adam was in control he finished the turnip greens and placed the bowl on the tray at the foot of his bed he walked to the bars and sneered at the blankfaced guard watching him from behind the tier door the hall was silent the televisions were on in every cell all turned low and being watched with morbid interest not a single voice could be heard and that in itself was extremely rare he pulled off his red jumpsuit for the last time wadded it up and threw it in a corner he kicked the rubber shower shoes under his bed never to see them again he carefully placed his new outfit on the bed arranged it just so then slowly unbuttoned the shortsleeved shirt and put it on it fit nicely he slid his legs into the stiff work khakis pulled the zipper up and buttoned the waist the pants were two inches too long so he sat on the bed and turned them up into neat precise cuffs the cotton socks were thick and soothing the shoes were a bit large but not a bad fit the sensation of being fully dressed in real clothes brought sudden painful memories of the free world these were the pants hed worn for forty years until hed been incarcerated hed bought them at the old dry goods store on the square in clanton always keeping four or five pair in the bottom drawer of his large dresser his wife pressed them with no starch and after a half dozen washings they felt like old pajamas he wore them to work and he wore them to town he wore them on fishing trips with eddie and he wore them on the porch swinging little lee he wore them to the coffee shop and to klan meetings yes hed even worn them on that fateful trip to greenville to bomb the office of the radical jew he sat on his bed and pinched the sharp creases under his knees it had been nine years and six months since he had worn these pants only fitting he guessed that he should now wear them to the gas chamber theyd be cut from his body placed in a bag and burned adam stopped first at lucas manns office louise at the front gate had given him a note saying it was important mann closed the door behind him and offered a seat adam declined he was anxious to see sam the fifth circuit received the appeal thirty minutes ago mann said i thought you might want to use my phone to call jackson thanks but ill use the one at the row fine im talking to the ags office every half hour so if i hear something ill give you a call thanks adam was fidgeting does sam want a last meal ill ask him in a minute fine give me a call or just tell packer what about witnesses sam will have no witnesses what about you no he wont allow it we agreed on it a long time ago fine i cant think of anything else i have a fax and a phone and things may be a bit quieter in here feel free to use my office thanks adam said stepping from the office he drove slowly to the row and parked for the last time in the dirt lot next to the fence he walked slowly to the guard tower and placed his keys in the bucket four short weeks ago he had stood there and watched the red bucket descend for the first time and hed thought how crude but effective this little system was only four weeks it seemed like years he waited for the double gates and met tiny on the steps sam was already in the front office sitting on the edge of the desk admiring his shoes check out the new threads he said proudly when adam entered adam stepped close and inspected the clothing from shoes to shirt sam was beaming his face was cleanshaven spiffy real spiffy a regular dude arent i you look nice sam real nice did donnie bring these yeah he got them at the dollar store i started to order some designer threads from new york but what the hell its only an execution i told you i wouldnt allow them to kill me in one of those red prison suits i took it off a while ago never to wear one again i have to admit adam it was a good feeling youve heard the latest sure its all over the news sorry about the hearing its in the fifth circuit now and i feel good about it i like our chances there sam smiled and looked away as if the little boy was telling his grandfather a harmless lie they had a black lawyer on television at noon said he was working for me what the hells going on that was probably hez kerry adam placed his briefcase on the desk and sat down am i paying him too yeah sam youre paying him at the same rate youre paying me just curious that screwball doctor whats his name swinn he mustve done a number on me it was pretty sad sam when he finished testifying the entire courtroom could see you floating around your cell scratching your teeth and peeing on the floor well im about to be put out of my misery sams words were strong and loud almost defiant there was not a trace of fear look i have a small favor to ask of you he said reaching for yet another envelope who is it this time sam handed it to him i want you to take this to the highway by the front gate and i want you to find the leader of that bunch of kluckers out there and i want you to read it to him try and get the cameras to film it because i want people to know what it says adam held it suspiciously what does it say its quick and to the point i ask them all to go home to leave me alone so that i can die in peace ive never heard of some of those groups and theyre getting a lot of mileage out of my death you cant make them leave you know i know and i dont expect them to but the television makes it appear as if these are my friends and cronies i dont know a single person out there im not so sure its a good idea right now adam said thinking out loud why not because as we speak were telling the fifth circuit that youre basically a vegetable incapable of putting together thoughts like this sam was suddenly angry you lawyers he sneered dont you ever give up its over adam stop playing games its not over as far as im concerned it is now take the damned letter and do as i say right now adam asked looking at his watch it was onethirty yes right now ill be waiting here adam parked by the guardhouse at the front gate and explained to louise what he was about to do he was nervous she gave a leery look at the white envelope in his hand and yelled for two uniformed guards to walk over they escorted adam through the front gate and toward the demonstration area some reporters covering the protestors recognized adam and immediately flocked to him he and the guards walked quickly along the front fence ignoring their questions adam was scared but determined and more than a little comforted by his newly found bodyguards he walked directly to the blue and white canopy which marked the headquarters for the klan and by the time he stopped a group of whiterobes was waiting for himthe press encircled adam his guards the klansmen whos in charge here adam demanded holding his breath who wants to know asked a burly young man with a black beard and sunburned cheeks sweat dripped from his eyebrows as he stepped forward i have a statement here from sam cayhall adam said loudly and the circle compressed cameras clicked reporters shoved microphones and recorders into the air around adam quiet someone yelled get back one of the guards snapped a tense group of klansmen all in matching robes but most without the hoods packed tighter together in front of adam he recognized none of them from his last confrontation on friday these guys did not look too friendly the racket stopped along the grassy strip as the crowd pushed closer to hear sams lawyer adam pulled the note from the envelope and held it with both hands my name is adam hall and im sam cayhalls lawyer this is a statement from sam he repeated its dated today and addressed to all members of the ku klux klan and to the other groups demonstrating on his behalf here today i quote please leave your presence here is of no comfort to me youre using my execution as a means to further your own interests i do not know a single one of you nor do i care to meet you please go away immediately i prefer to die without the benefit of your theatrics adam glanced at the stern faces of the klansmen all hot and dripping with perspiration the last paragraph reads as follows and i quote i am no longer a member of the ku klux klan i repudiate that organization and all that it stands for i would be a free man today had i never heard of the ku klux klan its signed by sam cayhall adam flipped it over and thrust it toward the kluckers all of whom were speechless and stunned the one with the black beard and sunburned cheeks lunged at adam in an attempt to grab the letter gimme that he yelled but adam yanked it away the guard to adams right stepped forward quickly and blocked the man who pushed the guard the guard shoved him back and for a few terrifying seconds adams bodyguards scuffled with a few of the kluckers other guards had been watching nearby and within seconds they were in the middle of the shoving match order was restored quickly the crowd backed away adam smirked at the kluckers leave adam shouted you heard what he said hes ashamed of you go to hell the leader yelled back the two guards grabbed adam and led him away before he stirred them up again they moved rapidly toward the front gate knocking reporters and cameramen out of the way they practically ran through the entrance past another line of guards past another swarm of reporters and finally to adams car dont come back up here okay one of the guards pleaded with him mcallisters office was known to have more leaks than an old toilet by early afternoon tuesday the hottest gossip in jackson was that the governor was seriously considering clemency for sam cayhall the gossip spread rapidly from the capitol to the reporters outside where it was picked up by other reporters and onlookers and repeated not as gossip but as solid rumor within an hour of the leak the rumor had risen to the level of nearfact mona stark met in the rotunda with the press and promised a statement by the governor at a later hour the courts were not finished with the case she explained yes the governor was under tremendous pressure t took the fifth circuit less than three hours to bump the last of the gangplank appeals along to the us supreme court a brief telephone conference was held at three hez kerry and garner goodman raced to roxburghs office across from the state capitol building the attorney general had a phone system fancy enough to hook up himself goodman kerry adam and lucas mann at parchman justice robichaux in lake charles justice judy in new orleans and justice mcneely in amarillo texas the threejudge panel allowed adam and roxburgh to make their arguments then the conference was disbanded at four oclock the clerk of the court called all parties with the denial and faxes soon followed kerry and goodman quickly faxed the appeal to the us supreme court sam was in the process of receiving his last physical exam when adam finished his short chat with the clerk he slowly hung up the phone sam was scowling at the young frightened doctor who was taking his blood pressure packer and tiny stood nearby at the request of the doctor with five people present the front office was crowded fifth circuit just denied adam said solemnly were on our way to the supreme court not exactly the promised land sam said still staring at the doctor im optimistic adam said halfheartedly for the benefit of packer the doctor quickly placed his instruments in his bag thats it he said heading for the door so im healthy enough to die sam asked the doctor opened the door and left followed by packer and tiny sam stood and stretched his back then began pacing slowly across the room the shoes slipped on his heels and affected his stride are you nervous he asked with a nasty smile of course and i guess youre not the dying cannot be worse than the waiting hell im ready id like to get it over with adam almost said something trite about their reasonable chances in the supreme court but he was not in the mood to be rebuked sam paced and smoked and was not in a talkative mood adam typically got busy with the telephone he called goodman and kerry but their conversations were brief there was little to say and no optimism whatsoever colonel nugent stood on the porch of the visitors center and asked for quiet assembled before him on the lawn was the small army of reporters and journalists all anxiously awaiting the lottery next to him on a table was a tin bucket each member of the press wore an orange numbered button dispensed by the prison administration as credentials the mob was unusually quiet according to prison regulations there are eight seats allotted to members of the press nugent explained slowly his words carrying almost to the front gate he was basking in the spotlight one seat is allotted to the ap one to the upi and one to the mississippi network that leaves five to be selected at random ill pull five numbers from this bucket and if one of them corresponds to your credentials then its your lucky day any questions several dozen reporters suddenly had no questions many of them pulled at their orange badges to check their numbers a ripple of excitement went through the group nugent dramatically reached into the bucket and pulled out a slip of paper number foureightfourthree he announced with all the skill of a seasoned bingo caller here you go an excited young man called back tugging at his lucky badge your name nugent yelled edwin king with the arkansas gazette a deputy warden next to nugent wrote down the name and paper edwin king was admired by his colleagues nugent quickly called the other four numbers and completed the pool a noticeable ebb of despair rolled through the group as the last number was called out the losers were crushed at exactly eleven two vans will pull up over there nugent pointed to the main drive the eight witnesses must be present and ready you will be driven to the maximum security unit to witness the execution no cameras or recorders of any type you will be searched once you arrive there sometime around twelvethirty you will reboard the vans and return to this point a press conference will then be held in the main hall of the new administration building which will be opened at pm for your convenience any questions how many people will witness the execution someone asked there will be approximately thirteen or fourteen people in the witness room and in the chamber room there will be myself one minister one doctor the state executioner the attorney for the prison and two guards will the victims family witness the execution yes mr elliot kramer the grandfather is scheduled to be a witness how about the governor by statute the governor has two seats in the witness room at his discretion one of those seats will go to mr kramer i have not been told whether the governor will be here what about mr cayhalls family no none of his relatives will witness the execution nugent had opened a can of worms the questions were popping up everywhere and he had things to do no more questions thank you he said and walked off the porch donnie cayhall arrived for his last visit a few minutes before six he was led straight to the front office where he found his welldressed brother laughing with adam hall sam introduced the two adam had carefully avoided sams brother until now donnie as it turned out was clean and neat well groomed and dressed sensibly he also resembled sam now that sam had shaved cut his hair and shed the red jumpsuit they were the same height and though donnie was not overweight sam was much thinner donnie was clearly not the hick adam had feared he was genuinely happy to meet adam and proud of the fact that he was a lawyer he was a pleasant man with an easy smile good teeth but very sad eyes at the moment whats it look like he asked after a few minutes of small talk he was referring to the appeals its all in the supreme court so theres still hope sam snorted at this suggestion a little adam said very much resigned to fate there was a long pause as adam and donnie searched for less sensitive matters to discuss sam really didnt care he sat calmly in a chair legs crossed puffing away his mind was occupied with things they couldnt imagine i stopped by alberts today donnie said sams gaze never left the floor hows his prostate i dont know he thought you were already dead thats my brother i also saw aunt finnie i thought she was already dead sam said with a smile almost shes ninetyone just all tore up over whats happened to you said you were always her favorite nephew she couldnt stand me and i couldnt stand her hell i didnt see her for five years before i came here well shes just plain crushed over this shell get over it sams face suddenly broke into a wide smile and he started laughing remember the time we watched her go to the outhouse behind grandmothers then peppered it with rocks she came out screaming and crying donnie suddenly remembered and began to shake with laughter yeah it had a tin roof he said between breaths and every rock sounded like a bomb going off yeah it was me and you and albert you couldnt have been four years old i remember though the story grew and the laughter was contagious adam caught himself chuckling at the sight of these two old men laughing like boys the one about aunt finnie and the outhouse led to one about her husband uncle garland who was mean and crippled and the laughs continued sams last meal was a deliberate snub at the fingerless cooks in the kitchen and the uninspired rations theyd tormented him with for nine and a half years he requested something that was light came from a carton and could be found with ease he had often marveled at his predecessors whod ordered sevencourse dinners steaks and lobster and cheesecake buster moac had consumed two dozen raw oysters then a greek salad then a large rib eye and a few other courses hed never understood how they summoned such appetites only hours before death he wasnt the least bit hungry when nugent knocked on the door at seventhirty behind him was packer and behind packer was a trustee holding a tray in the center of the tray was a large bowl with three eskimo pies in it and to the side was a small thermos of french market coffee sams favorite the tray was placed on the desk not much of a dinner sam nugent said can i enjoy it in peace or will you stand there and pester me with your idiot talk nugent stiffened and glared at adam well come back in an hour at that time your guest must leave and well return you to the observation cell okay just leave sam said sitting at the desk as soon as they were gone donnie said damn sam why didnt you order something we could enjoy what kind of a last meal is this its my last meal when your time comes order what you want he picked up a fork and carefully scraped the vanilla ice cream and chocolate covering off the stick he took a large bite then slowly poured the coffee into the cup it was dark and strong with a rich aroma donnie and adam sat in the chairs along a wall watching sams back as he slowly ate his last meal theyd been arriving since five oclock they came from all over the state all driving alone all riding in big fourdoor cars of varied colors with elaborate seals and emblems and markings on the doors and fenders some had racks of emergency lights across the roof some had shotguns mounted on the screens above the front seats all had tall antennas swinging in the wind they were the sheriffs each elected in his own county to protect the citizenry from lawlessness most had served for many years and most had already taken part in the unrecorded ritual of the execution dinner a cook named miss mazola prepared the feast and the menu never varied she fried large chickens in animal fat she cooked blackeyed peas in ham hocks and she made real buttermilk biscuits the size of small saucers her kitchen was in the rear of a small cafeteria near the main administration building the food was always served at seven regardless of how many sheriffs were present tonights crowd would be the largest since teddy doyle meeks was put to rest in miss mazola anticipated this because she read the papers and everybody knew about sam cayhall she expected at least fifty sheriffs they were waved through the front gates like dignitaries and they parked haphazardly around the cafeteria for the most part they were big men with earnest stomachs and voracious appetites they were famished after the long drive their banter was light over dinner they ate like hogs then retired outside to the front of the building where they sat on the hoods of their cars and watched it grow dark they picked chicken from their teeth and bragged on miss mazolas cooking they listened to their radios squawk as if the news of cayhalls death would be transmitted at any moment they talked about other executions and heinous crimes back home and about local boys on the row damned gas chamber wasnt used enough they stared in amazement at the hundreds of demonstrators near the highway in front of them they picked their teeth some more then went back inside for chocolate cake it was a wonderful night for law enforcement darkness brought an eerie quiet to the highway in front of parchman the klansmen not a single one of whom had considered leaving after sam asked them to sat in folding chairs and on the trampled grass and waited the skinheads and likeminded brethren whod roasted in the august sun sat in small groups and drank ice water the nuns and other activists had been joined by a contingent from amnesty international they lit candles said prayers hummed songs they tried to keep their distance from the hate groups pick any other day another execution another inmate and those same hateful people would be screaming for blood the calm was broken momentarily when a pickup load of teenagers slowed near the front entrance they suddenly began shouting loudly and in unison gas his ass gas his ass gas his ass the truck squealed tires and sped away some of the klansmen jumped to their feet ready for battle but the kids were gone never to return the imposing presence of the highway patrol kept matters under control the troopers stood about in groups watching the traffic keeping close watch on the klansmen and the skinheads a helicopter made its rounds above goodman finally called a halt to the market analysis in five long days they had logged over two thousand calls he paid the students confiscated the cellular phones and thanked them profusely none of them seemed willing to throw in the towel so they walked with him to the capitol where another candlelight vigil was under way on the front steps the governor was still in his office on the second floor one of the students volunteered to take a phone to john bryan glass who was across the street at the mississippi supreme court goodman called him then called kerry then called joshua caldwell an old friend whod agreed to wait at the death clerks desk in washington goodman had everyone in place all the phones were working he called adam sam was finishing his last meal adam said and didnt wish to talk to goodman but he did want to say thanks for everything when the coffee and ice cream were gone sam stood and stretched his legs donnie had been quiet for a long time he was suffering and ready to go nugent would come soon and he wanted to say goodbye now there was a spot where sam had spilled ice cream on his new shirt and donnie tried to remove it with a cloth napkin its not that important sam said watching his brother donnie kept wiping yeah youre right id better go now sam theyll be here in a minute the two men embraced for a long time patting each other gently on the backs im so sorry sam donnie said his voice shaking im so sorry they pulled apart still clutching each others shoulders both men with moist eyes but no tears they would not dare cry before each other you take care sam said you too say a prayer sam okay i will thanks for everything youre the only one who cared donnie bit his lip and hid his eyes from sam he shook hands with adam but could not utter a word he walked behind sam to the door then left them no word from the supreme court sam asked out of nowhere as if he suddenly believed there was a chance no adam said sadly he sat on the desk his feet swinging beneath him i really want this to be over adam he said each word carefully measured this is cruel adam could think of nothing to say in china they sneak up behind you and put a bullet through your head no last bowl of rice no farewells no waiting not a bad idea adam looked at his watch for the millionth time in the past hour since noon there had been gaps when hours seemed to vanish then suddenly time would stop it would fly then it would crawl someone knocked on the door come in sam said faintly the reverend ralph griffin entered and closed the door hed met with sam twice during the day and was obviously taking this hard it was his first execution and hed already decided it would be his last his cousin in the state senate would have to find him another job he nodded at adam and sat by sam on the desk it was almost nine oclock colonel nugents out there sam he said hes waiting on you well then lets not go out lets just sit here suits me you know preacher my heart has been touched these past few days in ways i never dreamed possible but for the life of me i hate that jerk out there and i cant overcome it hates an awful thing sam i know but i cant help it i dont particularly like him either to be honest sam grinned at the minister and put his arm around him the voices outside grew louder and nugent barged into the room sam its time to go back to the observation cell he said adam stood his knees weak with fear his stomach in knots his heart racing wildly sam however was unruffled he jumped from the desk lets go he said they followed nugent from the front office into the narrow hallway where some of the largest guards at parchman were waiting along the wall sam took adam by the hand and they walked slowly together with the reverend trailing behind adam squeezed his grandfathers hand and ignored the faces as they walked by they went through the center of the row through two sets of doors then through the bars at the end of tier a the tier door closed behind them and they followed nugent past the cells sam glanced at the faces of the men hed known so well he winked at hank henshaw nodded bravely at j b gullitt who had tears in his eyes smiled at stock turner they were all leaning through the bars heads hung low fear stamped all over their faces sam gave them his bravest look nugent stopped at the last cell and waited for the door to be opened from the end of the tier it clicked loudly then rolled open sam adam and ralph entered and nugent gave the signal to close the door the cell was dark the solitary light and television both off sam sat on the bed between adam and the reverend he leaned on his elbows with his head hanging low nugent watched them for a moment but could think of nothing to say hed be back in a couple of hours at eleven to take sam to the isolation room they all knew he was coming back it seemed too cruel at this moment to tell sam he was leaving but that he would return so he stepped away and left through the tier door where his guards were waiting and watching in the semidarkness nugent walked to the isolation room where a foldaway cot had been installed for the prisoners last hour he walked through the small room and stepped into the chamber room where final preparations were being made the state executioner was busy and very much in control he was a short wiry man named bill monday he had nine fingers and would earn five hundred dollars for his services if the execution took place by statute he was appointed by the governor he was in a tiny closet known simply as the chemical room less than five feet from the gas chamber he was studying a checklist on a clipboard before him on the counter was a onepound can of sodium cyanide pellets a ninepound bottle of sulfuric acid a onepound container of caustic acid a fiftypound steel bottle of anhydrous ammonia and a fivegallon container of distilled water to his side on another smaller counter were three gas masks three pair of rubber gloves a funnel hand soap hand towels and a mop between the two counters was an acid mixing pot mounted on a twoinch pipe that ran into the floor under the wall and resurfaced next to the chamber near the levers monday had three checklists actually one contained instructions for mixing the chemicals the sulfuric acid and distilled water would be mixed to obtain approximately a percent concentration the caustic soda solution was made by dissolving one pound of caustic acid in two and a half gallons of water and there were a couple of other brews that had to be mixed to clean the chamber after the execution one list included all the necessary chemicals and supplies the third list was the procedure to follow during an actual execution nugent spoke to monday all was proceeding as planned one of mondays assistants was smearing petroleum jelly around the edges of the chambers windows a plainclothed member of the execution team was checking the belts and straps on the wooden chair the doctor was fiddling with his ekg monitor the door was open to the outside where an ambulance was already parked nugent glanced at the checklists once more though hed memorized them long ago in fact hed even rewritten one other checklist a suggested chart to record the execution the chart would be used by nugent monday and mondays assistant it was a numbered chronological list of the events of the execution water and acid mixed prisoner enters chamber chamber door locked sodium cyanide enters acid gas strikes prisoners face prisoner apparently unconscious prisoner certainly unconscious movements of prisoners body last visible movement heart stopped respiration stopped exhaust valve opened drain valves opened air valve opened chamber door opened prisoner removed from chamber prisoner pronounced dead beside each was a blank line to record the time elapsed from the prior event and there was an execution list a chart of the twentynine steps to be taken to begin and complete the task of course the execution list had an appendix a list of the fifteen things to do in the stepdown the last of which was to place the prisoner in the ambulance nugent knew every step on every list he knew how to mix the chemicals how to open the valves how long to leave them open and how to close them he knew it all he stepped outside to speak to the ambulance driver and get some air then he walked back through the isolation room to tier a like everyone else he was waiting for the damned supreme court to rule one way or the other he sent the two tallest guards onto the tier to close the windows along the top of the outside wall like the building the windows had been there for thirtysix years and they did not shut quietly the guards pushed them up until they slammed each one echoing along the tier thirtyfive windows in all every inmate knew the exact number and with each closing the tier became darker and quieter the guards finally finished and left the row was now locked down every inmate in his cell all doors secured all windows closed sam had begun shaking with the closing of the windows his head dropped even lower adam placed an arm around his frail shoulders i always liked those windows sam said his voice low and hoarse a squad of guards stood less than fifteen feet away peering through the tier door like kids at the zoo and sam didnt want his words to be heard it was hard to imagine sam liking anything about this place used to when it came a big rain the water would splash on the windows and some of it would make it inside and trickle down to the floor i always liked the rain and the moon sometimes if the clouds were gone i could stand just right in my cell and catch a glimpse of the moon through those windows i always wondered why they didnt have more windows around here i mean hell sorry preacher but if theyre determined to keep you in a cell all day why shouldnt you be able to see outdoors i never understood that i guess i never understood a lot of things oh well his voice trailed off and he didnt speakagain for a while from the darkness came the mellow tenor of preacher boy singing just a closer walk withthee it was quite pretty just a closer walk with thee grant it jesus is my plea daily walking close to thee quiet a guard yelled leave him alone sam yelled back startling both adam and ralph sing it randy sam said just loud enough to be heard next door preacher boy took his time his feelings obviously wounded then began again a door slammed somewhere and sam jumped adam squeezed his shoulder and he settled down his eyes were lost somewhere in the darkness of the floor i take it lee wouldnt come he said his words haunted adam thought for a second and decided to tell the truth i dont know where she is i havent talked to her in ten days thought she was in a rehab clinic i think she is too but i just dont know where im sorry i tried everything to find her ive thought about her a lot these past days please tell her i will if adam saw her again he would struggle to keep from choking her and ive thought a lot about eddie look sam we dont have long lets talk about pleasant things okay i want you to forgive me for what i did to eddie ive already forgiven you sam its taken care of carmen and i both forgive you ralph lowered his head next to sams and said perhaps there are some others we should think about too sam maybe later sam said the tier door opened at the far end of the hallway and footsteps hurried toward them lucas mann with a guard behind him stopped at the last cell and looked at the three shadowy figures huddled together on the bed adam you have a phone call he said nervously in the front office the three shadowy figures stiffened together adam jumped to his feet and without a word stepped from the cell as the door opened his belly churned violently as he halfran down the tier give em hell adam j b gullitt said as he raced by who is it adam asked lucas mann who was beside him step for step garner goodman they weaved through the center of msu and hurried to the front office the receiver was lying on the desk adam grabbed it and sat on the desk garner this is adam im at the capitol adam in the rotunda outside the governors office the supreme court just denied all of our cert petitions theres nothing left up there adam closed his eyes and paused well i guess thats the end of that he said and looked at lucas mann lucas frowned and dropped his head sit tight the governors about to make an announcement ill call you in five minutes goodman was gone adam hung up the phone and stared at it the supreme court turned down everything he reported to mann the governors making a statement hell call back in a minute mann sat down im sorry adam very sorry hows sam holding up sam is taking this much better than i am i think its strange isnt it this is my fifth one and im always amazed at how calmly they go they give up when it gets dark they have their last meal say goodbye to their families and become oddly placid about the whole thing me id be kicking and screaming and crying it would take twenty men to drag me out of the observation cell adam managed a quick smile then noticed an open shoe box on the desk it was lined with aluminum foil with a few broken cookies in the bottom it had not been there when they left an hour earlier whats that he asked not really curious those are the execution cookies the execution cookies yeah this sweet little lady who lives down the road bakes them every time theres an execution why i dont know in fact i have no idea why she does it who eats them adam asked looking at the remaining cookies and crumbs as if they were poison the guards and trustees adam shook his head he had too much on his mind to analyze the purpose of a batch of execution cookies for the occasiondavid mcallister changed into a dark navy suit freshly starched white shirt and dark burgundy tie he combed and sprayed his hair brushed his teeth then walked into his office from a side door mona stark was crunching numbers the calls finally stopped she said somewhat relieved i dont want to hear it mcallister said checking his tie and teeth in a mirror lets go he opened the door and stepped into the foyer where two bodyguards met him they flanked him as he walked into the rotunda where bright lights were waiting a throng of reporters and cameras pressed forward to hear the announcement he stepped to a makeshift stand with a dozen microphones wedged together he grimaced at the lights waited for quiet then spoke the supreme court of the united states has just denied the last appeals from sam cayhall he said dramatically as if the reporters hadnt already heard this another pause as the cameras clicked and the microphones waited and so after three jury trials after nine years of appeals through every court available under our constitution after having the case reviewed by no less than fortyseven judges justice has finally arrived for sam cayhall his crime was committed twentythree years ago justice may be slow but it still works i have been called upon by many people to pardon mr cayhall but i cannot do so i cannot overrule the wisdom of the jury that sentenced him nor can i impose my judgment upon that of our distinguished courts neither am i willing to go against the wishes of my friends the kramers another pause he spoke without notes and it was immediately obvious hed worked on these remarks for a long time it is my fervent hope that the execution of sam cayhall will help erase a painful chapter in our states tortured history i call upon all mississippians to come together from this sad night forward and work for equality may god have mercy on his soul he backed away as the questions flew the bodyguards opened a side door and he was gone they darted down the stairs and out the north entrance where a car was waiting a mile away a helicopter was also waiting goodman walked outside and stood by an old cannon aimed for some reason at the tall buildings downtown below him at the foot of the front steps a large group of protestors held candles he called adam with the news then he walked through the people and the candles and left the capitol grounds a hymn started as he crossed the street and for two blocks it slowly faded away he drifted for a while then walked toward hez kerrys office the walk back to the observation cell was much longer than before adam made it alone by now on familiar terrain lucas mann disappeared somewhere in the labyrinth of the row as adam waited before a heavy barred door in the center of the building he was immediately aware of two things first there were many more people hanging around now more guards more strangers with plastic badges and guns on their hips more sternfaced men with shortsleeved shirts and polyester ties this was a happening a singular phenomenon too thrilling to be missed adam speculated that any prison employee with enough pull and enough clout just had to be on the row when sams death sentence was carried out the second thing he realized was that his shirt was soaked and the collar was sticking to his neck he loosened his tie as the door clicked loudly then slid open under the hum of a hidden electric motor a guard somewhere in the maze of concrete walls and windows and bars was watching and punching the right buttons he stepped through still pulling on the knot of his tie and the button under it and walked to the next barrier a wall of bars leading to tier a he patted his forehead but there was no sweat he filled his lungs with muggy dank air with the windows shut the tier was now suffocating another loud click another electric hum and he stepped into the thin hallway which sam had told him was seven and a half feet wide three dingy sets of fluorescent bulbs cast dim shadows on the ceiling and floor he pushed his heavy feet past the dark cells all filled with brutal murderers each one now praying or meditating a couple even crying good news adam j b gullitt pleaded from the darkness adam didnt answer still walking he glanced up at the windows with their various shades of paint splattered around the ancient panes and was struck by the question of how many lawyers before him had made this final walk from the front office to the observation cell to inform a dying man that the last thin shred of hope was now gone this place had a rich history of executions and so he concluded that many others had suffered along this trail garner goodman himself had carried the final news to maynard tole and this gave adam a much needed shot of strength he ignored the curious stares of the small mob standing and gawking at him at the end of the tier he stopped at the last cell waited and the door obediently opened sam and the reverend were still sitting low on the bed heads nearly touching in the darkness whispering they looked up at adam who sat next to sam and placed his arm around his shoulders shoulders that now seemed even frailer the supreme court just denied everything he said very softly his voice on the verge of cracking the reverend exhaled a painful moan sam nodded as if this was certainly expected and the governor just denied clemency sam tried to raise his shoulders bravely but power failed him he slumped even lower lord have mercy ralph griffin said then its all over sam said theres nothing left adam whispered excited murmurings could be heard from the death squad squeezed together at the end of the tier this thing would happen after all a door slammed somewhere behind them in the direction of the chamber and sams knees jerked together he was silent for a moment one minute or fifteen adam couldnt tell the clock was still lurching and stopping i guess we oughta pray now preacher sam said i reckon so weve waited long enough how do you wanna do it well sam just exactly what do you want to pray about sam pondered this for a moment then said id like to make sure gods not angry with me when i die good idea and why do you think god might be angry with you pretty obvious isnt it ralph rubbed his hands together i guess the best way to do this is to confess your sins and ask god to forgive you all of them you dont have to list them all just ask god to forgive everything sort of a blanket repentance yeah thats it and itll work if youre serious im serious as hell do you believe in hell sam i do do you believe in heaven i do do you believe that all christians go to heaven sam thought about this for a long time then nodded slightly before asking do you yes sam i do then ill take your word for it good trust me on this one okay it seems too easy you know i just say a quick prayer and everythings forgiven why does that bother you because ive done some bad things preacher weve all done bad things our god is a god of infinite love you havent done what ive done will you feel better if you talk about it yeah i wont ever feel right unless i talk about it im here sam should i leave for a minute adam asked sam clutched his knee no we dont have a lot of time sam ralph said glancing through the bars sam took a deep breath and spoke in a low monotone careful that only adam and ralph could hear i killed joe lincoln in cold blood ive already said i was sorry ralph was mumbling something to himself as he listened he was already in prayer and i helped my brothers kill those two men who murdered our father frankly ive never felt bad about it until now human life seems a whole lot more valuable these days i was wrong and i took part in a lynching when i was fifteen or sixteen i was just part of a mob and i probably couldnt have stopped it if id tried but i didnt try and i feel guilty about it sam stopped adam held his breath and hoped the confessional was over ralph waited and waited and finally asked is that it sam no theres one more adam closed his eyes and braced for it he was dizzy and wanted to vomit there was another lynching a boy named cletus i cant remember his last name a klan lynching i was eighteen thats all i can say this nightmare will never end adam thought sam breathed deeply and was silent for several minutes ralph was praying hard adam just waited and i didnt kill those kramer boys sam said his voice shaking i had no business being there and i was wrong to be involved in that mess ive regretted it for many years all of it it was wrong to be in the klan hating everybody and planting bombs but i didnt kill those boys there was no intent to harm anyone that bomb was supposed to go off in the middle of the night when no one would be anywhere near it thats what i truly believed but it was wired by someone else not me i was just a lookout a driver a flunky this other person rigged the bomb to go off much later than i thought ive never known for sure if he intended to kill anyone but i suspect he did adam heard the words received them absorbed them but was too stunned to move but i couldve stopped it and that makes me guilty those little boys would be alive today if i had acted differently after the bomb was planted their blood is on my hands and ive grieved over this for many years ralph gently placed a hand on the back of sams head pray with me sam sam covered his eyes with both hands and rested his elbows on his knees do you believe jesus christ was the son of god that he came to this earth born of a virgin lived a sinless life was persecuted and died on the cross so that we might have eternal salvation do you believe this sam yes he whispered and that he arose from the grave and ascended into heaven yes and that through him all of your sins are forgiven all the terrible things that burden your heart are now forgiven do you believe this sam yes yes ralph released sams head and wiped tears from his eyes sam didnt move but his shoulders were shaking adam squeezed him even tighter randy dupree started whistling another stanza of just a closer walk with thee his notes were clear and precise and they echoed nicely along the tier preacher sam said as his back stiffened will those little kramer boys be in heaven yes but they were jews all children go to heaven sam will i see them up there i dont know theres a lot about heaven we dont know but the bible promises that there will be no sorrow when we get there good then i hope i see them the unmistakable voice of colonel nugent broke the calm the tier door clanged rattled and opened he marched five feet to the door of the observation cell six guards were behind him sam its time to go to the isolation room he said its eleven oclock the three men stood side by side the cell door opened and sam stepped out he smiled at nugent then he turned and hugged the reverend thanks he said i love you brother randy dupree yelled from his cell not ten feet away sam looked at nugent and asked could i say goodbye to my friends a deviation the manual plainly said that the prisoner was to be taken directly from the observation cell to the isolation room with nothing being mentioned about a final promenade down the tier nugent was dumbstruck but after a few seconds rallied nicely sure but make it quick sam took a few steps and clasped randys hands through the bars then he stepped to the next cell and shook hands with harry ross scott ralph griffin eased past the guards and left the tier he found a dark corner and wept like a child he would not see sam again adam stood in the door of the cell near nugent and together they watched sam work his way down the hallway stopping at each cell whispering something to each inmate he spent the most time with j b gullitt whose sobs could be heard then he turned and walked bravely back to them counting steps as he went smiling at his pals along the way he took adam by the hand lets go he said to nugent there were so damned many guards packed together at the end of the tier that it was a tight squeeze just to get by them nugent went first then sam and adam the mass of human congestion added several degrees to the temperature and several layers to the stuffy air the show of force was necessary of course to subdue a reluctant prisoner or perhaps to scare one into submission it seemed awfully silly with a little old man like sam cayhall the walk from one room to another took only seconds a distance of twenty feet but adam winced with every painful step through the human tunnel of armed guards through the heavy steel door into the small room the door on the opposite wall was shut it led to the chamber a flimsy cot had been hauled in for the occasion adam and sam sat on it nugent closed the door and knelt before them the three of them were alone adam again placed his arm around sams shoulders nugent was wearing a terribly pained expression he placed a hand on sams knee and said sam were gonna get through this together now you goofy fool adam blurted amazed at this remarkable utterance he cant help it sam said helpfully to adam hes just stupid he didnt even realize it nugent felt the sharp rebuke and tried to think of something proper to say im just trying to get through this okay he said to adam why dont you just leave adam said you know something nugent sam asked ive read tons of law books and ive read pages and pages of prison regulations and nowhere have i read anything that requires me to spend my last hour with you no law statute regulation nothing just get the hell out of here adam said ready to strike if necessary nugent jumped to his feet the doctor will enter through that door at elevenforty hell stick a stethoscope to your chest then leave at eleven fiftyfive i will enter also through that door at that time well go into the chamber room any questions no leave adam said waving at the door nugent made a quick exit suddenly they were alone with an hour to go two identical prison vans rolled to a stop in front of the visitors center and were boarded by the eight lucky reporters and one lone sheriff the law allowed but did not require the sheriff of the county where the crime was committed to witness the execution the man who was the sheriff of washington county in had been dead for fifteen years but the current sheriff was not about to miss this event he had informed lucas mann earlier in the day that he fully intended to invoke the power of the law said he felt like he owed it to the people of greenville and washington county mr elliot kramer was not present at parchman he had planned the trip for years but his doctor intervened at the last moment his heart was weak and it was just too risky ruth kramer had never thought seriously of witnessing the execution she was at home in memphis sitting with friends waiting for it to end be opened at exactly midnight and when you see the chamber the prisoner will already be inside it less than two feet from the windows you will see only the back of his head i didnt design this okay it should take about ten minutes before he is pronounced dead at which time the curtains will be closed and youll return to the vans youll have a long wait and im sorry this room has no air conditioning when the curtains open things will happen quickly any questions have you talked to the prisoner yes hows he holding up im not getting into all that a press conference is planned at one and ill answer those questions then right now im busy nugent left the witness room and slammed the door behind him he walked quickly around the corner and entered the chamber room we have less than an hour what would you like to talk about sam asked oh lots of things most of it unpleasant though its kinda hard to have an enjoyable conversation at this point you know what are you thinking right now sam whats going through your mind everything what are you afraid of the smell of the gas whether or not its painful i dont want to suffer adam i hope its quick i want a big whiff of it and maybe ill just float away im not afraid of death adam but right now im afraid of dying i just wish it was over this waiting is cruel are you ready my hard little heart is at peace ive done some bad things son but i feel like god might give me a break i certainly dont deserve one why didnt you tell me about the man who was with you its a long story we dont have much time it couldve saved your life no nobody wouldve believed it think about it twentythree years later i suddenly change my story and blame it all on a mystery man it wouldve been ridiculous whyd you lie to me i have reasons to protect me thats one of them hes still out there isnt he yes hes close by in fact hes probably out front with all the other loonies right now just watching youd never see him though he killed dogan and his wife yes and dogans son yes and clovis brazelton probably hes a very talented killer adam hes deadly he threatened me and dogan during the first trial does he have a name not really i wouldnt tell you anyway you can never breathe a word of this youre dying for someone elses crime no i couldve saved those little boys and god knows ive killed my share of people i deserve this adam no one deserves this its far better than living if they took me back to my cell right now and told me id stay there until i died you know what id do what id kill myself after spending the last hour in a cell adam couldnt argue with this he could not begin to comprehend the horror of living twentythree hours a day in a tiny cage i forgot my cigarettes sam said patting his shirt pocket i guess this is a good time to quit are you trying to be funny yeah its not working did lee ever show you the book with my lynching picture in it she didnt show it to me she told me where it was and i found it you saw the picture yes a regular party wasnt it pretty sad did you see the other picture of the lynching one page over yes two kluckers with robes and hoods and masks yes i saw it that was me and albert i was hiding behind one of the masks adams senses were beyond the point of shock the gruesome photograph flashed through his mind and he tried to purge it why are you telling me this sam because it feels good ive never admitted it before and theres a certain relief in facing the truth i feel better already i dont want to hear any more eddie never knew it he found that book in the attic and somehow figured out i was in the other party photo but he didnt know i was one of the kluckers lets not talk about eddie okay good idea what about lee im mad at lee she skipped out on us it wouldve been nice to see her you know that hurts but im so glad carmen came finally a pleasant subject shes a fine person adam said a great kid im very proud of you adam and of carmen yall got the good genes from your mother im so lucky to have two wonderful grandchildren adam listened and didnt try to respond something banged next door and they both jumped nugent must be playing with his gadgets in there sam said his shoulders vibrating again you know what hurts what ive been thinking a lot about this really flogging myself the last couple of days i look at you and i look at carmen and i see two bright young people with open minds and hearts you dont hate anybody youre tolerant and broadminded well educated ambitious going places without the baggage i was born with and i look at you my grandson my flesh and blood and i ask myself why didnt i become something else something like you and carmen its hard to believe were actually related come on sam dont do this i cant help it please sam okay okay something pleasant his voice trailed off and he leaned over his head was low and hanging almost between his legs adam wanted an indepth conversation about the mysterious accomplice he wanted to know it all the real details of the bombing the disappearance how and why sam got caught he also wanted to know what might become of this guy especially since he was out there watching and waiting but these questions would not be answered so he let them pass sam would take many secrets to his grave the arrival of the governors helicopter created a stir along the front entrance of parchman it landed on the other side of the highway where another prison van waited with a bodyguard on each elbow and mona stark racing behind mcallister scampered into the van its the governor someone yelled the hymns and prayers stopped momentarily cameras raced to film the van which raced through the front gate and disappeared minutes later it stopped near the ambulance behind msu the bodyguards and ms stark remained in the van nugent met the governor and escorted him into the witness room where he took a seat in the front row he nodded at the other witnesses all sweating profusely by now the room was an oven black mosquitoes bounced along the walls nugent asked if there was anything he could fetch for the governor popcorn mcallister cracked but no one laughed nugent frowned and left the room why are you here a reporter asked immediately no comment mcallister said smugly the ten of them sat in silence staring at the black drapes and anxiously checking their watches the nervous chatter had ended they avoided eye contact as if they were ashamed to be participants in such a macabre event nugent stopped at the door of the gas chamber and consulted a checklist it was elevenforty he told the doctor to enter the isolation room then he stepped outside and gave the signal for the guards to be removed from the four towers around msu the odds of escaping gas injuring a tower guard after the execution were minuscule but nugent loved the details the knock on the door was faint indeed but at the moment it sounded as if a sledgehammer were being used it cracked through the silence startling both adam and sam the door opened the young doctor stepped in tried to smile dropped to one knee and asked sam to unbutton his shirt a round stethoscope was stuck to his pale skin with a short wire left hanging to his belt the doctors hands shook he said nothing at eleventhirty hez kerry garner goodman john bryan glass and two of his students stopped their idle talk and held hands around the cluttered table in kerrys office each offered a silent prayer for sam cayhall then hez voiced one for the group they sat in their seats deep in thought deep in silence and said another short one for adam the end came quickly the clock sputtering and braking for the last twentyfour hours suddenly roared ahead for a few minutes after the doctor left they shared a light nervous chatter as sam walked twice across the small room measuring it then leaned on the wall opposite the bed they talked about chicago and kravitz bane and sam couldnt imagine how three hundred lawyers existed in the same building there was a jittery laugh or two and a few tense smiles as they waited for the next dreaded knock it came at precisely eleven fiftyfive three sharp raps then a long pause nugent waited before barging in adam immediately jumped to his feet sam took a deep breath and clenched his jaws he pointed a finger at adam listen to me he said firmly you can walk in there with me but you cannot stay i know i dont want to stay sam good the crooked finger dropped the jaws slackened the face sank sam reached forward and took adam by the shoulders adam pulled him close and hugged him gently tell lee i love her sam said his voice breaking he pulled away slightly and looked adam in the eyes tell her i thought about her to the very end and im not mad at her for not coming i wouldnt want to come here either if i didnt have to adams head nodded quickly and he struggled not to cry anything sam anything say hello to your mom i always liked her give my love to carmen shes a great kid im sorry about all this adam its a terrible legacy for you guys to carry well do fine sam i know you will ill die a very proud man son because of you ill miss you adam said the tears now running down his cheeks the door opened and the colonel stepped in its time now sam he said sadly sam faced him with a brave smile lets do it he said strongly nugent went first then sam then adam they stepped into the chamber room which was packed with people everyone stared at sam then immediately looked away they were ashamed thought adam ashamed to be here taking part in this nasty little deed they wouldnt look at adam monday the executioner and his assistant were along the wall next to the chemical room two uniformed guards were crowded next to them lucas mann and a deputy warden were near the door the doctor was busy to the immediate right adjusting his ekg and trying to appear calm and in the center of the room now surrounded by the various participants was the chamber an octagonalshaped tube with a gleaming fresh coat of silver paint its door was open the fateful wooden chair just waiting a row of covered windows behind it the door to the outside of the room was open but there was no draft the room was like a sauna everyone was drenched with sweat the two guards took sam and led him into the chamber he counted the steps only five of them from the door to the chamber and suddenly he was inside sitting looking around the men to find adam the mens hands moved rapidly adam had stopped just inside the door he leaned on the wall for strength his kneesspongy and weak he stared at the people in the room at the chamber at the floor the ekg it was all so sanitary the freshly painted walls the sparkling concrete floors the doctor with his machines the clean sterile little chamber with its glowing luster the antiseptic smell from the chemical room everything so spotless and hygienic it shouldve been a clinic where people went to get themselves healed what if i vomit on the floor right here at the feet of the good doctor what would that do for your disinfected little room nugent how would the manual treat that nugent if i just lost it right here in front of the chamber adam clutched his stomach straps on sams arms two of them for each then two more for the legs over the shiny new dickies then the hideous head brace so he wouldnt hurt himself when the gas hit there now all buckled down and ready for the vapors all neat and tidy spotless and germfree no blood to be shed nothing to pollute this flawless moral killing the guards backed out of the narrow door proud of their work adam looked at him sitting in there their eyes met and for an instant sam closed his the doctor was next nugent said something to him but adam couldnt hear the words he stepped inside and rigged the wire running from the stethoscope he was quick with his work lucas mann stepped forward with a sheet of paper he stood in the door of the chamber sam this is the death warrant im required by law to read it to you just hurry sam grunted without opening his lips lucas lifted the piece of paper and read from it pursuant to a verdict of guilty and a sentence of death returned against you by the circuit court of washington county on february you are hereby condemned to die by lethal gas in the gas chamber at the mississippi state penitentiary at parchman may god have mercy on your soul lucas backed away then reached for the first of two phones mounted on the wall he called his office to see if there were any miraculous last minute delays there were none the second phone was a secured line to the attorney generals office in jackson again all systems were go it was now thirty seconds after midnight wednesday august no stays he said to nugent the words bounced around the humid room and crashed in from all directions adam glanced at his grandfather for the last time his hands were clenched his eyes were closed tightly as if he couldnt look at adam again his lips were moving as if he had just one more quick prayer any reason why this execution should not proceed nugent asked formally suddenly craving solid legal advice none lucas said with genuine regret nugent stood in the door of the chamber any last words sam he asked not for you its time for adam to leave very well nugent slowly closed the door its thick rubber gasket preventing noise silently sam was now locked up and buckled down he closed his eyes tightly just please hurry adam eased behind nugent who was still facing the chamber door lucas mann opened the door to the outside and both men made a quick exit adam glanced back at the room for the last time the executioner was reaching for a lever his assistant was inching to the side to catch a glimpse the two guards were jockeying for position so they could watch the old bastard die nugent and the deputy warden and the doctor were crowded along the other wall all inching closer heads bobbing up and over each fearful he might miss something the ninetydegree heat outside seemed much cooler adam walked to the end of the ambulance and leaned on it for a second are you all right lucas asked no just take it easy youre not gonna witness it no ive seen four thats enough for me this ones especially difficult adam stared at the white door in the center of the brick wall three vans were parked nearby a group of guards smoked and whispered by the vans id like to leave he said afraid that he was about to be sick lets go lucas grabbed his elbow and led him to the first van he said something to a guard who jumped into the front seat adam and lucas sat on a bench in the center of it adam knew at that precise moment his grandfather was in the chamber gasping for breath his lungs seared with burning poison just over there in that little redbrick building right now hes sucking it in trying to swallow as much as possible hoping to simply float away to a better world he began to cry the van moved around the recreation yards and through the grass in front of the row he covered his eyes and cried for sam for his suffering at this moment for the despicable way he was being forced to die he looked so pitiful sitting there in his new clothes being tied down like an animal he cried for sam and the last nine and a half years hed spent staring through bars trying to catch a glimpse of the moon wondering if anyone out there cared about him he cried for the whole wretched cayhall family and their miserable history and he cried for himself for his anguish at this moment for the loss of a loved one for his failure to stop this madness lucas patted him gently on the shoulder and the van rolled and stopped then rolled and stopped again im sorry he said more than once this your car lucas asked as they stopped outside the gate the dirt parking lot was filled to capacity adam yanked the door handle and stepped out without a word he could say thanks later he sped along the gravel trail between the rows of cotton until he came to the main drive he drove quickly to the front entrance slowing only briefly as he weaved around two barricades then stopped at the front gate so a guard could check his trunk to his left was the swarm of reporters they were on their feet waiting anxiously for word from the row minicams were ready there was no one in his trunk and he was waved around another barricade almost hitting a guard who wasnt moving fast enough he stopped at the highway and paused to look at the candlelight vigil under way to his right hundreds of candles and a hymn in progress somewhere down the way he sped away past state troopers loitering about enjoying the break in the action he sped past cars parked on the shoulders for two miles and soon parchman was behind him he pushed the turbo and was soon doing ninety he headed north for some reason though he had no intention of going to memphis towns like tutwiler lambert marks sledge and crenshaw flew by he rolled the windows down and the warm air swirled around the seats the windshield was peppered with large bugs and insects the plague of the delta hed learned he just drove with no particular destination this trip had not been planned hed given no thought to where he would go immediately after sam died because he never truly believed it would happen maybe hed be in jackson now drinking and celebrating with garner goodman and hez kerry getting plastered because theyd pulled a rabbit out of the hat maybe hed be at the row still on the phone trying desperately to get the details of a last minute stay which would later become permanent maybe a lot of things he wouldnt dare go to lees because she might actually be there their next meeting would be a nasty one and he preferred to postpone it he decided to find a decent motel spend the night try and sleep figure things out tomorrow after the sun was up he raced through dozens of hamlets and towns none with a room for rent he slowed considerably one highway led to another he was lost but didnt care how can you be lost when you dont know where youre going he recognized towns on road signs turned this way then that way an allnight convenience store caught his attention on the outskirts of hernando not far from memphis there were no cars parked in front a middleaged lady with jetblack hair was behind the counter smoking smacking gum and talking on the phone adam went to the beer cooler and grabbed a sixpack sorry hon cant buy beer after twelve what adam demanded reaching into his pocket she didnt like his snarl she carefully laid the phone next to the cash register we cant sell beer here after midnight its the law the law yes the law of the state of mississippi thats correct she said smartly do you know what i think of the laws of this state right now no dear and i honestly dont care adam flipped a tendollar bill on the counter and carried the beer to his car she watched him leave then stuck the cash in her pocket and went back to the phone why bother the cops over a sixpack of beer he was off again going south on a twolane highway obeying the speed limit and gulping the first beer off again in pursuit of a clean room with a free continental breakfast pool cable hbo kids stay free fifteen minutes to die fifteen minutes to vent the chamber ten minutes to wash it down with ammonia spray the lifeless body deader than hell according to the young doctor and his ekg nugent pointing here and there get the gas masks get the gloves get those damned reporters back on the vans and out of here adam could see sam in there head fallen to one side still strapped under those enormous leather buckles what color was his skin now surely not the pale whiteness of the past nine and a half years surely the gas turned his lips purple and his flesh pink the chamber is now clear all is safe enter the chamber nugent says unbuckle him take the knives cut off the clothing did his bowels loosen did his bladder leak they always do be careful here heres the plastic bag put the clothes in here spray the naked body adam could see the new clothes the stiff khakis the oversized shoes the spotless white socks sam had been so proud to wear real clothes again now they were rags in a green garbage sack handled like venom and soon to be burned by a trustee where are the clothes the blue prison pants and white tee shirt get them enter the chamber dress the corpse no shoes are necessary no socks hell hes just going to the funeral home let the family worry about dressing him for a decent burial now the stretcher get him out of there into the ambulance adam was near a lake somewhere over a bridge through a bottom the air suddenly damp and cool lost again the first glint of sunrise was a pink halo over a hill above clanton it strained through the trees and was soon turning to yellow then to orange there were no clouds nothing but brilliant colors against the dark sky there were two unopened beers sitting in the grass three empty cans had been tossed against a nearby headstone the first empty can was still in the car the dawn was breaking shadows fell toward him from the rows of other gravestones the sun itself was soon peeking at him from behind the trees hed been there for a couple of hours though hed lost track of time jackson and judge slattery and mondays hearing were years ago sam had died minutes ago or was he dead had they already done their dirty act time was still playing games he hadnt found a motel not that hed looked very hard hed found himself near clanton then was drawn here where hed located the headstone of anna gates cayhall now he rested against it hed drunk the warm beer and thrown the cans at the largest monument within range if the cops found him here and took him to jail he wouldnt care hed been in a cell before yeah just got out of parchman hed tell his cell mates his rap partners just walked out of death row and theyd leave him alone evidently the cops were occupied elsewhere the graveyard was secure four little red flags had been staked out next to his grandmothers plot adam noticed them as the sun rose to the east another grave to be dug a car door closed somewhere behind him but he didnt hear it a figure walked toward him but he didnt know it it moved slowly searching the cemetery cautiously looking for something the snapping of a twig startled adam lee was standing beside him her hand on her mothers headstone he looked at her then looked away what are you doing here he asked too numb to be surprised she gently lowered herself first to her knees then she sat very close to him her back pressed to her mothers engraved name she wrapped her arm around his elbow where the hell have you been lee in treatment you couldve called dammit dont be angry adam please i need a friend she leaned her head on his shoulder im not sure im your friend lee what you did was terrible he wanted to see me didnt he he did you of course were lost in your own little world selfabsorbed as usual no thought given to others please adam ive been in treatment you know how weak i am i need help then get it she noticed the two cans of beer and adam quickly tossed them away im not drinking she said pitifully her voice was sad and hollow her pretty face was tired and wrinkled i tried to see him she said when last night i drove to parchman they wouldnt let me in said it was too late adam lowered his head and softened considerably he would accomplish nothing by cursing her she was an alcoholic struggling to overcome demons he hoped he would never meet and she was his aunt his beloved lee he asked about you at the very end he asked me to tell you he loved you and that he wasnt angry because you didnt come see him she started crying very quietly she wiped her cheeks with the backs of her hands and cried for a long time he went out with a great deal of courage and dignity adam said he was very brave he said his heart was right with god and that he hated no one he was terribly remorseful for the things hed done he was a champ lee an old fighter who was ready to move on you know where ive been she asked between sniffles as if shed heard nothing he said no where ive been to the old home place i drove there from parchman last night why because i wanted to burn it and it burned beautifully the house and the weeds around it one huge fire all up in smoke come on lee its true i almost got caught i think i mightve passed a car on the way out im not worried though i bought the place last week paid thirteen thousand dollars to the bank if you own it then you can burn it right youre the lawyer are you serious go look for yourself i parked in front of a church a mile away to wait for the fire trucks they never came the nearest house is two miles away no one saw the fire drive out and take a look theres nothing left but the chimney and a pile of ashes how gasoline here smell my hands she shoved them under his nose they bore the acrid undeniable smell of gasoline but why i shouldve done it years ago that doesnt answer the question why evil things happened there it was filled with demons and spirits now theyre gone so they died with sam no theyre not dead theyve gone off to haunt someone else it would be pointless to pursue this discussion adam decided quickly they should leave maybe return to memphis where he could get her back into recovery and maybe therapy he would stay with her and make sure she got help a dirty pickup truck entered the cemetery through the iron gates of the old section and puttered slowly along the concrete path through the ancient monuments it stopped at a small utility shed in a corner of the lot three black men slowly scooted out and stretched their backs thats herman she said herman dont know his last name hes been digging graves here for forty years they watched herman and the other two across the valley of tombstones they could barely hear their voices as the men deliberately went about their preparations lee stopped the sniffling and crying the sun was well above the treeline its rays hitting directly in their faces it was already warm im glad you came she said i know it meant a lot to him i lost lee i failed my client and now hes dead you tried your best no one could save him maybe dont punish yourself your first night in memphis you told me it was a long shot you came close you put up a good fight now its time to go back to chicago and get on with the rest of your life im not going back to chicago what im changing jobs but youve only been a lawyer for a year ill still be a lawyer just a different kind of practice doing what death penalty litigation that sounds dreadful yes it does especially at this moment in my life but ill grow into it im not cut out for the big firms where will you practice jackson ill be spending more time at parchman she rubbed her face and pulled back her hair i guess you know what youre doing she said unable to hide the doubt dont bet on it herman was walking around a battered yellow backhoe parked under a shade tree next to the shed he studied it thoughtfully while another man placed two shovels in its bucket they stretched again laughed about something and kicked the front tires i have an idea she said theres a little cafe north of town its called ralphs sam took me ralphs yeah sams minister was named ralph he was with us last night sam had a minister yes a good one anyway sam would take me and eddie there on our birthdays place has been here for a hundred years wed eat these huge biscuits and drink hot cocoa lets go see if its open now yeah she was excited and getting to her feet come on im hungry adam grabbed the headstone and pulled himself up he hadnt slept since monday night and his legs were heavy and stiff the beer made him dizzy in the distance an engine started it echoed unmuffied through the cemetery adam froze lee turned to see it herman was operating the backhoe blue smoke boiling from the exhaust his two coworkers were in the front bucket with their feet hanging out the backhoe lunged in low gear then started along the drive very slowly past the rows of graves it stopped and turned it was coming their way the end
