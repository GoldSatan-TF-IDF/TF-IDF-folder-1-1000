william faulkner flags in the dust edited as sartoris restored uncut introduction in the autumn or winter of william faulkner twentynine began work on the first of his novels about yoknapatawpha county sherwood anderson had told him some time before that he should write about his native mississippi and now faulkner took that advice he used his own land and peopled it with men and women who were partly drawn from real life and partly depicted as they should have been in some ideal mythopoeic structure a year later on september the new novel was completed it was pages long in transcript and he called it flags in the dust full of enthusiasm faulkner sent flags in the dust up to horace liveright who had published his first two novels in new york liveright read it disliked it and sent it back with his firm recommendation that faulkner not try to offer it for publication anywhere else it was too diffuse too lacking in plot and structure and liveright felt no amount of revision would be able to salvage it faulkner crushed showed flags in the dust to several of his friends who shared liverights opinion but he still believed that this would be the book that would make his name as a writer and for several months he tried to edit it himself sitting at his worktable in oxford finally discouraged he sent a new typescript off to ben wasson his agent in new york will you please try to sell this for me he asked wasson i cant afford all the postage its costing me in the meantime convinced that he would never become a successful novelist faulkner began work on a book that he was sure would never mean anything to anyone but himself the sound and the fury wasson tried eleven publishers all of whom rejected flags in the dust finally he gave the typescript to harrison smith then an editor of harcourt brace company smith liked it and showed it to alfred harcourt who agreed to publish it provided that someone other than faulkner perform the extensive cutting job that harcourt felt was necessary for fifty dollars wasson agreed to pare down his clients novel on september faulkner received a contract for the book now to be called sartoris no one knows who changed its name which was to be about words long and which was to be delivered to harcourt brace sixteen days later faulkner left immediately for new york presumably to help wasson with his revision but when he sat down in wassons apartment to observe the operation on his novel faulkner found himself unable to participate if it were cut he felt it would die wasson persisted however pointing out that the trouble with flags in the dust was that it was not one novel but six all struggling along simultaneously this to faulkner was praise evidence of fecundity and fullness of vision evidence that the world of yoknapatawpha was rich enough to last as he later wrote of his third novel i discovered that my own little postage stamp of native soil was worth writing about and that i would never live long enough to exhaust it nevertheless wasson kept ms bargain with alfred harcourt for the next two weeks whilefaulkner sat nearby writing the sound and the fury wasson went through the typescript of flags in the dust making cuts of every sort until almost a fourth of the book had been excised harcourt brace published this truncated version on january as sartoris with a dedication to sherwood anderson through whose kindness i was first published with the belief that this book will give him no reason to regret that fact and the old flags in the dust was soon forgottenby everyone but faulkner he had preserved the original holograph manuscript of flags in the dust pages in his neat but minuscule and almost illegible hand and he had bound together with thin wire the pages of a sort of composite typescript of the novel produced by the combination of three separate but overlapping typescript drafts the first of these pages long seems to have been begun before he completed his manuscript version the second pages of which are in the composite typescript was probably written after he had completed the manuscript and the first typescript in the third pages appear to have been a revision of the second typescript why faulkner should have labored over the reconstruction of this text is not clear perhaps he thought of his composite typescript as a working draft which would allow him ultimately to restore to his novel that which wasson had carved from itor perhaps fastidious man that he was he simply could not bring himself to throw away all of those typed pages in any case the manuscript and typescript both were eventually deposited at the alderman library of the university of virginia where they lay more or less undisturbed until mrs jill summers faulkners daughter remembered that her late father had spoken often of a restoration offlags in the dust mrs summers asked this writer and albert erskine editor at random house to undertake the task the result is now flags in the dust which aims at being a faithful reproduction of that composite typescript certain nonsubstantive alterations in spelling and punctuation have been made in order to bring this novel into conformity with faulkners other books but wherever possible his many idiosyncrasies especially those on which he himself insisted during his years of working with editors at random house were allowed to stand the final complete typescript which must have served as setting copy for the harcourt brace edition of sartoris and which must have been the draft in which wasson made his cuts has not survived nor have any galley proofs all we had to work from then was the composite typescript by any scholars standards a suspect source there was no way finally to tell which of the many differences between flags in the dust andsartoris were the result of faulkners emendations in the hypothetical setting copy and the galley proofs and which belonged to wasson if there were to be any publication of flags in the dust at all then it had to be what we have here provided whether it is better than sartoris as faulkner so firmly believed it to be is of course a matter of taste it is tempting to launch into a study of the genesis and development of the novel from the manuscript version through the typescript of flags in the dust to the publication of sartoris but this is not the place to do so suffice it here to suggestt that whereas sartoris is chiefly about the sartoris clan their surly gallantry and their utter and uncaring inability to adjust to the demands of whatever age they find themselves in flags in the dust is far more complicated primaryfocus is still on the sartorises but faulkner clearly wished to make of his novel an anatomy of the entire yoknapatawpha social structure excluding only the indians as foils to the doomed and hawklike bayard sartoris we have not only his dead twin john but horace benbow too as a sort of delta dilettante and buddy maccallum the young hillman who possesses all the steady virtues bayard lacks harry mitchell as the type of the new southern middle classand even byron snopes the desperate and reptilian representative of a new class threatening to overthrow the old aristocratic order of the area all of these are present in sartoris to be sure but in flags in the dust their roles are lengthened and heightened until we realize that each of them is in his way a commentary not only upon bayard sartoris but also upon the deep south in the years after the first world war flags in the dust then may or may not be a better work of art than sartoris but few will dispute that it is a more complete fictional document of a time and place in historyor that it is a better introduction to the grand and complex southern world that william faulkner was to write about until he died douglas day university of virginia february one old man falls roared cunnel was settin thar in a cheer his sock feet propped on the poch railin smokin this hyer very pipe old louvinia was settin on the steps shellin a bowl of peas fer supper and a feller was glad to git even peas sometimes in them days and you was

usual old man falls had brought john sartoris into the room with him freed as he was of time he was a far more definite presence in the room than the two of them cemented by deafness to a dead time and drawn thin by the slow attenuation of days he seemed to stand above them all around them with his bearded hawklike face and the bold glamor of his dream old bayard sat with his feet braced against the side of the fireplace holding the pipe in his hand the bowl was ornately carved and it was charred with much usage and on the bit were the prints of his fathers teeth whatre you giving it to me for after all this time he said well i reckon ive kep it long as cunnel aimed fer me to old man falls answered a po house aint no place fer anything of hisn bayard he added he sat bent forward elbows

him hit ud be takin a advantage of him after hes gone old man falls chewed his tobacco for a while im goin on ninetyfo year old bayard he said he spat neatly into the fireplace and drew the back of his hand across his month a thing he toted in his pocket and got enjoyment outen in them days hitd be different i reckon while we was abuildin the railroad he said often enough in them days we was all goin to be in the po house by saturday night or cemetery mo likely him ridin up and down the track with a saddlebag full of money night and day keepin jest one crosstie ahead of the po house like he

pistols layin on the table and that robber and that other feller he kilt all with that same dang dernger when a feller has to start killin folks he most always has to keep on killinem and when he does hes already dead hisself it showed on his brow the dark shadow of fatality and doom that night when he sat beneath the candles in his dining room and turned a wine glass in his fingers while he talked to his son the railroad was finished and today he had been elected to the legislature after a hard and bitter fight and on his brow lay the shadow of his doom and a little weariness and so he said redlawll kill me tomorrow for i shall be unarmed im tired of killing menpass the wine bayard after old man falls had gathered up his small parcels and gone old bayard sat for some time the pipe in his hand rubbing the bowl slowly with his thumb but presently john sartoris too had departed withdrawn rather to that place where the peaceful dead contemplate their frustrated days and old bayard dropped his feet to the floor and rose and thrust the pipe into his pocket and took a cigar from the humidor on the mantel as he struck the match the door behind him opened and a man wearing a green eyeshade entered and approached simons here colonel he said in an inflectionless voice what old bayard turned his head the cigar between his teeth and the match in his cupped hands simons come the other shouted flatly oh all right old bayard flung the match into the grate and thrust the cigar into his breast pocket he took his black felt hat from the desk and followed the other and stalked through the lobby of the bank and emerged onto the street where simon in a linen duster and an ancient tophat held the matched geldings at the curb there was a hitchingpost there which old bayard retained with a testy disregard of industrial progress but simon never used it until the door opened and bayard emerged from behind the drawn green shades simon sat on the seat with the reins in his left hand and the thong of the whip caught smartly backin his right and usually the unvarying and seemingly incombustible fragment of a cigar in his mouth talking to the horses in a steady loverlike flow simon spoiled horses he admired sartorises and he had for them a warmly protective tenderness but he loved horses and beneath his hands the sorriest beast bloomed and acquired comeliness like a caressed woman temperament like an opera star bayard crossed tothe carriage with that stiff erectness of his which as a countryman once remarked was so straight as to almost meet itself walking along the street one or two passers and a merchant or so in his shop door saluted him with a sort of florid servility and behind him the shade on one window drew aside upon the disembodied face of the man in the green eyeshade the bookkeeper was a hillman of indeterminate age a silent man who performed his duties with tedious slow care and who watched bayard constantly and covertly all the while he was in view nor did simon dismount even then with his races fine feeling for potential theatrics he drew himself up and arranged the limp folds of the duster communicating by some means the histrionic moment to the horses so that they too flicked their glittering coats and tossed their leashed heads and into simons wizened black face there came an expression indescribably majestical as he touched his hat brim with his whiphand bayard got in the carriage and simon clucked to the horses and the shade fell before the bookkeepers face and the bystanders halted to admire the momentary drama of the departure fell behind there was something different in simons air today however in the very shape of his back and the angle of his hat he appeared to be bursting withsomething momentous and illcontained but he withheld it for the time being and at a dashing restrained pace he drove among the tethered wagons about the square and swung into a broad street where what bayard called paupers sped back and forth in automobiles and withheld it until the town was behind them and they trotted on across burgeoning countryside cluttered still with gasolinepropelled paupers but at greater intervals and his employer had settled back into that drowsing peace which the rhythmic clopping of the horses and the familiar changeful monotony of the land always gave him then simon slowed to a more sedate pace and turned his head simons voice was not particularly robust nor resonant yet somehow he could talk to bayard without difficulty others must shout in order to penetrate that wall of deafness beyond which bayard lived yet simon could and did hold long rambling conversations with him in that monotonous rather high singsong of his particularly while in the carriage the vibration of which helped bayards hearing a little mist bayard done got home simon remarked in a conversational tone bayard returned from his region of drowsy abstraction and sat perfectly and furiously still while his heart went on a little too fast and a little too lightly cursing his grandson for a furious moment sat so still that simon looked back and found him gazing quietly out across the land simon raised his voice a little he got offen de two oclock train he continued jumped off de wrong side and lit out though de woods section hand seed im only he aint never come out home yit when i lef i thought he wuz wid you maybe dust spun from beneath thehorses feet and moiled in a sluggish cloud behind them against the thickening hedgerows their shadow rushed in failing surges with twinkling spokes and highstepping legs in a futility of motion without progress wouldnt even git off at de deepo simon continued with a kind of fretful exasperation de deepo his own folks builtjumpin offen de blind side like a hobo he never evenhad on no sojerclothes he added with frank injury jes a suit lak a drummer er somethin and when i members dem shiny boots and dem light yeller pants and dat ere

dey police after him i kep atellin him when he fust went off to dat ere foreign war him and mr johnny neither never had no business at drive on bayard said sharplydrive on damn your black hide he repeated simon clucked to the horses and shook them to a swifter gait the road went on between hedgerows paralleling them with the senseless terrific antics of their shadow beyond the bordering gums and locusts and massed vines fields newbroken or being broken spread on toward patches of woodland newly green and splashed with dogwood and judas trees behind the laborious plows viscid shards of newturned earth glinted damply in the sun this was upland country lying in tilted slopes against the unbroken blue of the hills but soon the road dropped sheerly into a valley of good broad fields richly somnolent in the levelling afternoon this was bayard sartoris land and as they went on from time to time a negro lifted his hand from the plow handle in salute to the passing carriage then the road approached the railroad and crossed it and a partridge and her brood of tiny dusty balls scuttered in the dust before them and at last the house john sartoris had built and rebuilt stood among locusts and oaks where mockingbirds were wont to sing there was a bed of salvia where that yankee patrol had halted on that day long ago simon brought up here with a flourish and bayard descended and simon clucked to the team again and drove off down the drive rolling his cigar to a freer angle and took the road back to town bayard stood for a moment before his house but the white simplicity of it dreamed unbroken amid its ancient sunshot trees wistaria mounting one end of the veranda had bloomed and fallen and a faint drift of shattered petals lay palely about the dark roots of it and about the roots of a rose trained onto the same frame the rose was slowly but steadily killing the other vine and it bloomed now thickly with buds no bigger than a thumbnail and blown flowers no larger than silver dollars myriad odorless and unpickable but the house itself was still and serenely benignant and he mounted to the empty colonnaded veranda and crossed it and entered the high spacious hallway the house was silent richly desolate of motion or any sound bayard the stairway with its white spindles and red carpet mounted in a tall slender curve into upper gloom from the center of the ceiling hung a chandelier of crystal prisms and shades fitted originally for candles but since wired for electricity to the right of the entrance beside folding doors opened upon a room emanating an atmosphere of dim and seldom violated stateliness and known as the parlor stood a tall mirror pied with grave obscurity like a still pool of evening water at the end of the hallway checkered sunlight fell in a long slant across the door and the world was drowsily monotonous without and from somewhere beyond the bar of sunlight a voice rose and fell in a rapid preoccupied minor like a chant the words were not always distinguishable but bayard sartoris could not hear them at all he raised his voice again bayard the chanting ceased and as he turned toward the stairs a tall mulatto woman appeared in the slanting sunlight without the back door and came sibilantly into the hall her faded blue garment was pinned up about her knees and it was darkly and irregularly blotched beneath it her shanks were straight and lean as the legs of a tall bird and her bare feet were pale coffee splashes on the dark polished floor wuz you callin somebody cunnel she said raising her voice to penetrate his deafness bayard sartoris paused with his hand on the walnut newel post and looked down at the womans pleasant yellow face has anybody come in this afternoon he asked why naw suh elnora answereddey aint nobody here atall dat i knows about miss jenny done gone to huh clubmeetin in town dis evening she added bayard sartoris stood with his foot raised to the step staring down at her why in hell cant you niggers tell me the truth about things he raged suddenly or not tell me anything at all lawd cunnel whod be comin out here lessen you er miss jenny sont um but he had gone on tramping furiously up the stairs the woman looked after him then she called to him does you want isom er anything but he went on without looking back perhaps he had not heard her and she stood and watched him out of sight hes gittin old she said to herself quietly and she turned on her sibilant bare feet and returned down the hall whence she had come bayard sartoris stopped again in the upper hall the western windows were closed with latticed blinds through which sunlight seeped in pale dissolving bars that but served to increase the gloom at the opposite end a tall door opened upon a shallow grilled balcony which offered the valley and the cradling semicircle of the eastern hills in panorama on either side of this door was a narrow window set with leaded varicolored panes that with the bearer of them constituted his mothers deathbed legacy to him which john sartoris youngest sister had brought from carolina in a strawfilled hamper in this was virginia du pre who came to them two years a wife and seven years a widow at thirtya slender woman with a delicate replica of the sartoris nose and that expression of indomitable and utter weariness which all southern women had learned to wear bringing with her the clothing in which she stood and a wicker hamper filled with colored glass it was she who told them of the manner of bayard sartoris death prior to the second battle of manassas she had told the story many times since at eightyshe still told it on occasions usually inopportune and as she grew older the tale itself grew richer and richer taking on a mellow splendor like wine until what had been a hairbrained prank of two heedless and reckless boys wild with their own youth was become a gallant and finely tragical focalpoint to which the history of the race had been raised from out the old miasmic swamps of spiritual sloth by two angels valiantly and glamorously fallen and strayed altering the course of human events and purging the souls of men that carolina bayard had been rather a handful even for sartorises not so much a black sheep as a nuisance all of whose qualities were positive and unpredictable his were merry blue eyesand his rather long hair fell in tawny curls about his temples his highcolored face wore that expression of frank and highhearted dullness which you visualize richard first as wearing before he went crusading and he once hunted his pack of fox hounds through a rustic tabernacle in which a methodist revival was being conducted and thirty minutes later having caught the fox he returned alone and rode his horse into the ensuing indignation meeting in a spirit of fun purely he believed too firmly in providence as all his actions clearly showed to have any religious convictions at all so when fort moultrie fell and the governor of south carolina refused to surrender it the sartorises were privately a little glad for now bayard would have something to do in virginia as an adc of jeb stuarts he found plenty to do as the adc rather for though stuart had other aides they were soldiers trying to win a war and needing sleep occasionally bayard sartoris alone was willing nay eager to defer sleep and security to that time when monotony should return tothe world but now was a holiday without any restrictions whatever the war was also a godsend to jeb stuart and shortly thereafter against the dark and bloody obscurity of the northern virginia campaigns jeb stuart at thirty and bayard sartoris at twentythree stood briefly like two flaming stars garlanded with fames burgeoning laurel and the myrtle and roses of death incalculable and sudden as meteors in general popes troubled military sky thrusting upon him like an unwilling garment that notoriety which his skill as a soldier could never have won him and still in a spirit of pure fun neither jeb stuart nor bayard sartoris as their actions clearly showed had any political convictions involved at all aunt jenny told the story first shortly after she came to them it was christmas time and they sat before a hickory fire in the rebuilt libraryaunt jenny with her sad resolute face and john sartoris bearded and hawklike and his three children and a guest a scottish engineer whom john sartoris had met in mexico in and who was now helping him to build his railway work on the railroad had ceased for the holiday season and john sartoris and his engineer had ridden in that dusk from the suspended railhead in the hills to the north and they now sat after supper in the firelight the sun had set ruddily leaving the air brittle as thin glass with frost and presently joby came in with an armful of firewood he put a fresh billet on the fire and in the dry air the flames crackled and snapped popping in fading embers outward upon the hearth chrismus joby exclaimed with the grave and simple pleasure of his race prodding at the blazing logs with the yankee musketbarrel which stood inthe chimney corner until sparks swirled upward into the dark maw of the chimney like wild golden veils year dat chilluns john sartoris eldest daughter was twentytwo and would be married in june bayard was twenty and the younger girl seventeen and so aunt jenny for all her widowhood was one of the chillen too to joby then he replaced the musketbarrel in its niche and fired a long pine sliver at the hearth in order to light the candles but aunt jenny stayed him and he was gonea shambling figure in an old formal coat too large for him stooped and gray with age and aunt jenny speaking always of jeb stuart as mister stuart told her story it had to do with an april evening and coffee or the lack of it rather and stuarts military family sat in scented darkness beneath a new moon talking of ladies and dead pleasures and thinking of home away in the darkness horses moved invisibly with restful sounds and bivouac fires fell to glowing points like spent fireflies and somewhere neither near nor far the generals body servant touched a guitar in lingering random chords thus they sat in the poignance of spring and youths immemorial sadness forgetting travail and glory remembering instead other virginian evenings with fiddles above the myriad candles and slender grave measures picked out with light laughter and lighter feet thinking when will this be again shall i make one until they had talked themselves into a state of savage nostalgia and words grew shorter and shorter and less and less frequent then the general roused himself and brought them back by speaking of coffee or its lack this talk of coffee began to end a short time later with a ride along midnight roads and then through woods black as pitch where horses went at a walk and riders rode with sabre or musket at arms lengthbefore them lest they be swept from their saddles by invisible boughs and continued until the forest thinned with dawnghosts and the party of twenty was well within the federal lines then dawn accomplished itself yet more and all efforts toward concealment were discarded and the horsemen dashed on and crashed through astonished picketparties returning placidly to camp and fatigue parties setting forth with picks and shovels and axes in the golden sunrise and swept yelling up the knoll on which general pope and his staff sat at breakfast al fresco two men captured a fat staffmajor others pursued the fleeing officers for a short distance into the sanctuary of the woods but most of them rushed on to popes private commissary tent and emerged presently from the cyclonic demolition of it bearing sundry parcels stuart and the three officers with him halted their dancing mounts at the table and one of them swept up a huge blackened coffee pot and tendered it to the general and while the enemy shouted and let off muskets among the trees they toasted each other in sugarless and creamless scalding coffee as with a loving cup general pope sir stuart said bowing in his saddle to the captured officer he drank and extended the pot ill drink it sir the major replied and thank god he is not here to respond in person i had remarked that he appeared to leave hurriedly stuart said a prior engagement perhaps yes sir with general halleck the major agreed drily i am sorry we have him for an opponent instead of lee so am i sir stuart replied i like general pope in a war bugles were shrilling among the trees farand near sending the alarm in flying echoes from brigade to brigade lying about the forest and drums were beating wildly to arms and erratic bursts of musketry surged and trickled along the scattered outposts like the dry clatter of an opening fan for the name stuart speeding from picket to picket had peopled the blossoming peaceful woods with grey phantoms stuart turned in his saddle and his men came up and sat their horses and watched him alertly their spare eager faces like mirrors reflecting their leaders constant consuming flame then from the right there came something like a concerted volley striking the coffee pot from bayard sartoris hand and clipping and snapping viciously among the dappled branches above their heads be pleased to mount sir stuart said to the captured officer and though his tone was exquisitely courteous all levity was gone from it captain wyatt you have the heaviest mount will you the captain freed his stirrup and hauled the prisoner up behind him forward the general said and whirled roweling his bay and with the thunderous coordination of a single centaur they swept down the knoll and crashed into the forest at the point from which the volley had come before it could be repeated blueclad pigmy shapes plunged scattering before and beneath them and they rushed on among trees vicious with minies like myriad bees stuart now carried his plumed hat in his hand and his long tawny locks tossing to the rhythm of iris speed appeared as gallant flames smoking with the wild and selfconsuming splendor of his daring behind them and on one flank muskets still banged and popped at the flashing phantoms of their passing and from brigade to brigade lying spaced about thejocund forest bugles shrilled their importunate alarms stuart bore gradually to the left bringing all the uproar into his rear the country became more open and they swung into column at the gallop the captured major bounced and jolted behind captain wyatt and the general reined his horse back beside the gallant black thundering along beneath its double burden i am distressed to inconvenience you thus sir he began with his exquisite courtesy if you will indicate the general location of your nearest horse picket i shall be most happy to capture a mount for you thank you general the major replied but majors can be replaced much easier than horses i shall not trouble you just as you wish sir stuart agreed stiffly he spurred on to the head of the column again they now galloped along a faint trace that was once a road it wound on between vernal palisades of undergrowth and they followed it at a rapid controlled gait and debouched suddenly upon a glade and a squadron of yankee cavalry reined back with shocked amazement then hurled forward again without a break in their speed stuart whirled his party and plunged back into the forest pistolballs were thinly about their heads and the flat tossing reports were trivial as snapping twigs above the converging thunder of hooves stuart swerved from the road and they crashed headlong through undergrowth the federal horsemen came yelling behind them and stuart led his party in a tight circle and halted it panting in a dense copse and they heard the pursuit sweep past they pushed on and regained the road and retraced their former course silently and utterly alert to the left the sound of the immediate pursuit crashed and died away then they cantered again presently the woods thickened and they were forced to slow to a trot then to a walk although there was no more firing and the bugles too had ceased into the silence above the strong and rapid breathing of the horses and the sound of their own hearts in their ears was a nameless somethinga tenseness seeping like an invisible mist from tree to tree filling the dewy morning woods with portent though birds flashed swooping from tree to tree unaware or disregarded of it a gleam of white through the trees ahead stuart raised his hand and they halted and sat their horses watching him quietly and holding their breaths with listening then the general advanced again and broke through the undergrowth into another glade and they followed and before them rose the knoll with the deserted breakfast table and the rifled commissary tent they trotted across the glade and halted at the table while the general scribbled hastily upon a scrap of paper the glade dreamed quiet and empty of threat beneath the mounting golden day laked within it lay a deep and abiding peace like golden wine yet beneath this solitude and permeating it was that nameless and waiting portent patient and brooding and sinister your sword sir stuart commanded and the prisoner removed his weapon and stuart took it and pinned his scribbled note to the tabletop with it the note read general stuarts compliments to general pope and he is sorry to have missed him again he will call again tomorrow stuart gathered his reins forward he said they descended the knoll and crossed the emptyglade and at an easy canter they took the road they had traversed that dawnthe road that led toward home stuart glanced back at his captive at the gallant black with its double burden if you will direct us to the nearest cavalry picket i will provide you with a proper mount he offered again will general stuart cavalry leader and general lees eyes jeopardize his safety and that of his men and his cause in order to provide for the temporary comfort of a minor prisoner of his sword this is not bravery it is the rashness of a heedless and headstrong boy there are fifteen thousand men within a radius of two miles of this point even general stuart cannot conquer that many though they are yankees singlehanded not for the prisoner sir stuart replied haughtily but for the officer suffering the fortune of war no gentleman would do less no gentleman has any business in this war the major retorted there is no place for him here he is an anachronism like anchovies general stuart did not capture our anchovies he added tauntingly perhaps he will send lee for them in person anchovies repeated bayard sartoris who galloped nearby and he whirled his horse stuart shouted at him but he lifted his reckless stubborn hand and flashed on and as the general would have turned to follow a yankee picket fired his musket from the roadside and darted into the woods shouting the alarm immediately other muskets exploded on all sides and from the forest to the right came the sound of a considerable body put suddenly into motion and behind them in the direction of the knoll a volley crashed a third officer spurred up and caught stuarts bridle sir sir he exclaimed what would you do stuart held his horse rearing and another volley rang behind them dribbling off into single scattered reports crashed focalized again and the noise to the right swelled nearer let go allan stuart said he is my friend but the other clung on it is too late he said sartoris can only be killed you would be captured forward sir i beg the captive major added what is oneman to a paladin out of romance think of lee for gods sake general the aide implored forward he shouted to the troop spurring his own horse and dragging the generals onward as a body of federal horse burst from the woods behind them and so aunt jenny finished mister stuart went on and bayard rode back after those anchovies with all popes army shooting at him he rode yelling yaaaiiih yaaaiiih come on boys right up the knoll and jumped his horse over the breakfast table and rode it into the wrecked commissary tent and a cook who was hidden under the mess stuck his arm out and shot bayard in the back with a derringer mister stuart fought his way out and got back home without losing but two men he always spoke well of bayard he said he was a good officer and a fine cavalryman but that he was too reckless they sat quietly for a time in the firelight the flames leaped and popped on the hearth and sparks soared in wild swirling plumes up the chimney and bayard sartoris brief career swept like a shooting star across the dark plain of their mutual remembering and suffering lighting it with a transient glare like a soundless thunderclap leaving a sort of radiance when it died the guest the scottish engineer had sat quietly listening after a time he spoke when he rode back he was not actually certain there were anchovies was he the yankee major said there were aunt jenny replied ay the scotsman pondered again and did mister stuart return next day as he said ins note he went back that afternoon aunt jenny answered looking for bayard ashes soft as rosy feathers shaled glowing onto the hearth and faded to the softest gray john sartoris leaned forward into the firelight and punched at the blazing logs with the yankee musketbarrel that was the goddamdest army the world ever saw i reckon he said yes aunt jenny agreed and bayard was the goddamdest man in it yes john sartoris admitted soberly bayard was wild the scotsman spoke again this mister stuart who said your brother was reckless who was he he was the cavalry general jeb stuart aunt jenny answered she brooded for a while upon the fire her pale indomitable face held for a moment a tranquil tenderness he had a strange sense of humor she said nothing ever seemed quite so diverting to him as general pope in his nightshirt she dreamed once more on some faraway place beyond the rosy battlements of the embers poor man she said then she said quietly i danced a valse with him in baltimore in and her voice was proud and still as banners in the dust but the door was closed now and what light passed through the colored panes was richly and solemnly hushed to his left was his grandsons room the room in which his grandsons wife and her child had died last october he stood beside this door for a moment then he opened it quietly the blinds were closed and the room was empty and he stood on the dark threshold for a while then he slammed the door to and tramped on with that heavyfooted obliviousness of the deaf and entered hisown bedroom and crashed the door behind him as was his way of shutting doors he sat down and removed his shoes the shoes that were made to his measure twice a year by a saint louis house then he rose and went in his stockings to the window and looked down upon his saddlemare tethered to a mulberry tree in the back yard and a negro lad lean and fluid of movement as a hound lounging richly static nearby from the direction of the kitchen invisible from this window elnoras endless minor ebbed and flowed unheard by him upon the lazy scene he crossed to his closet and drew therefrom a pair of scarred and stained ridingboots and stamped into them and took a cigar from the humidor on the table beside his huge walnut bed and he stood for a time with the cigar clamped between his teeth having forgotten to light it through the doth of his pocket his hand touched the pipe there and he took it out and laid it on top of his chest of drawers then he quitted the room and banged the door behind him and tramped heavily down the stairs and out the backdoor isom waked easily and untethered the mare and held the stirrup he mounted and remembered the cigar at last and fired it isom opened the gate into the lot and closed it and trotted on ahead and opened the gate that let his master into the fieldbeyond and closed that one bayard rode on trailing his pungent smoke elnora stood barelegged in the center of the kitchen floor and soused her mop into the pail and thumped it on the floor again sinner riz fum de moaners bench sinner jump to de penance bench when de preacher axim whut de reason why says preacher got de women jesde same ez i oh lawd oh lawd dats whut de matter wid de church today simons destination was a huge brick house set well up onto the street the lot had been the site of a fine old colonial house which rose among magnolias and oaks and flowering shrubs but the house had burned and some of the trees had been felled to make room for an architectural garbling so imposingly terrific as to possess a kind of chaotic majesty it was a monument to the frugality and the mausoleum of the social aspirations of his women of a hillman who had moved in from a small settlement called frenchmans bend and who as miss jenny du pre put it had built the handsomest house in frenchmans bend on the most beautiful lot in jefferson the hillman had stuck it out for two years during which his womenfolks sat about the veranda all morning in lacetrimmed boudoir caps and spent the afternoons in colored silk riding through the streets in a new rubbertired surrey then the hillman sold his house to a newcomer in the town and took his women back to the country and doubtless set them to work again a number of motor cars ranked along the street lent a formally festive air to the place and simon with his tilted cigar stub wheeled up and drew rein and indulged in a brief colorful altercation with a negro sitting behind the wheel of a car parked before the hitchingblock dont block off no sartoris cariage black boy he added when the other had moved the motor and permitted simon access to the post block off de commonality ef you wants but dont intervoke no equipage waitin on cunnelor miss jenny dey wont stand for it he descended and tethered the team and his spirit mollified by the rebuke administered and laved with the beatitude of having gained his own way simon paused and examined the motor car with curiosity and no little superciliousness tinged faintly with envious awe and spoke affably with its conductor but not for long for simon had sisters in the lord in this kitchen and presently he let himself through the gate and followed the path that led around to the back he could hear the party going on as he passed beneath the windows that stained unintelligible gabbling with which white ladies could surround themselves without effort and which they seemed to consider a necessary or unavoidable adjunct to having a good time the fact that it was a card party would have seemed neither paradoxical nor astonishing to simon for time and much absorbing experience had taught him a fine tolerance of white folks vagaries and for those of ladies of any color the hillman had built his house so close to the street that the greater part of the original lawn with its fine old trees lay behind it there were once crepemyrtle and syringa and lilac and jasmine bushes without order and casual stumps and fences with honeysuckle overgrown and after the originalhouse had burned these had taken the place and made of its shaggy formality a mazed and scented jungle loved of mockingbirds and thrushes where boys and girls lingered on spring and summer nights among drifting fireflies and choiring whippoorwills then the hillman had bought it and cut some of the trees in order to build his house near the street after the country fashion and chopped out the jungle of bushes and vines and whitewashed the remaining trees and ran his barn and hog and chickenlot fences between their ghostly trunks he didnt remain long enough to learn of garages some of the antiseptic desolation of his tenancy had faded now and its present owner had set out more shrubberyjasmine and mockorange and verbenawith green iron tables and chairs beneath them and a pool and a tennis court and simon passed on with discreet assurance and on a consonantless drone of female voices he rode into the kitchen where a thin woman in a funereal purple turban and poising a beaten biscuit heaped with a mayonnaiseimpregnated something in a soiled kid glove and a mountainous one in the stained apron of her calling and drinking melted icecream from a saucer rolled their eyes at him i seed him on de street yistiddy and he looked bad he jes didnt favor hisself the visitor was saying as simon entered but they dropped the theme of conversation immediately and made him welcome ef it aint brother strother they said in unison come in brother strother how is you poly ladies poly simon replied he doffed his hat and unclamped his cigar and stowed it away in the hatband ise had a right smart misry in de back is yallkepwell right well i thank you brother strother thevisitor replied simon drew a chair up to the table as he was bidden what you gwine eat brother strother the cook demanded hospitably deys party fixins and deys some cole greens and a little sof icecream lef fum dinner i reckon ill have a little icecream and some of dem greens sis rachel simon replied my teef aint much on party doins no mo the cook rose with majestic deliberation and waddled across to a pantry and reached down a platter she was one of the best cooks in jefferson no mistress dared protest against the social amenities of rachels kitchen ef you aint de beatines man the first guest exclaimed eatin icecream at yo age i been eatin icecream sixty years simon said whut reason got fer quittin now dats right brother strother the cook agreed placing the dish before him eat yo icecream when you kin git it jes a minute and illhere meloney she interrupted herself as a young light negressjn a smart white apron and cap entered bearing a tray of plates containing remnants of edible edifices copied from pictures in ladies magazines and possessing neither volume nor nourishment with which the party had been dulling its palates against supper git brother strother a bowl of dat ere icecream honey the girl clashed the tray into the sink and rinsed a bowl at the water tap while simon watched her with his still little eyes she whipped the bowl through a towel with a fine show of derogatory carelessness and with her nose at a supercilious angle she clattered on her high heels across the kitchen still under simons unwinking regard and slammed a door behind her then simon turned his head again yes maam he repeated i been eatin icecream too long to quit at my age dey wont no vittle hurt you ez long ez you kin stomach um the cook agreed raising her saucer to her lips again the girl returned with her head still averted and set the bowl of viscid liquid before simon who under cover of this movement dropped his hand on her thigh the girl smacked him sharply on the back of his gray head with her flat palm miss rachel cant you make him keep his hands to hisself aint you shamed rachel demanded but without rancor a ole grayhead man like you wid a family of grown chillen and one foot in de cemetery hush yo mouf woman simon said placidly spooning spinach into his soft icecream aint dey erbout breakin up in yonder yit i reckon deys erbout to the other guest answered putting another laden biscuit into her mouth with a gesture of elegant gentility seems like deys talkin louder den deys started playin again simon corrected talkin jes eased off whiles dey et yes suh deys started playin again dats white folks nigger aint got sense ernough to play cards wid all dat racket goin on but they were breaking up miss jenny du pre had just finished a story which left the three players at her table avoiding one anothers eyes a little selfconsciously as was her way miss jenny travelled very little and in pullman smokerooms not at all and people wondered where she got her stories who had told them to her and she repeated them anywhere and at any time choosing the wrong moment and the wrong audience with a cold and cheerful audacity young people liked her and she was much in demand as a chaperone for picnic parties she now spoke across the room to the hostess im going home belle she stated i think we are all tired of your party i know i am the hostess was a plump youngish woman and her cleverly rouged face showed now an hysterical immersion that was almost repose but when miss jenny broke into her consciousness with the imminence of departure this faded quickly and her face resumed its familiar expression of strained and vague dissatisfaction and she protested conventionally but with a petulant sincerity as a wellbred child might but miss jenny was adamant and she rose and her slender wrinkled hand brushed invisible crumbs from the bosom of her black silk dress if i stay any longer ill miss bayards toddy time she explained with her usual forthrightness come on narcissa and ill drive you home i have my car thank you miss jenny the young woman to whom she spoke replied in a grave contralto rising also and the others rose with sibilant gathering motions above the petulant modulation of the hostess protestings and they drifted slowly into the hall and clotted again before mirrors colorful and shrill miss jenny pushed steadily toward the door come along come along she repeated harry mitchell wont want to run into all this gabble when he comes home from work then he can sit in the car out in the garage the hostess rejoined sharply i do wish you wouldnt go miss jenny i dont think ill askyou again but miss jenny only said goodbye goodbye with cold affability and with her delicate replica of the sartoris nose and that straight grenadiers back ofhers which gave the pas for erectness to only one back in townthat of her nephew bayardshe stood at the top of the steps where narcissa benbow joined her bringing with her like an odor that aura of grave and serene repose in which she dwelt belle meant that too miss jenny said meant what miss jenny about harrynow where do you suppose that damn nigger went to they descended the steps and from the parked motors along the street came muffled starting explosions and the two women traversed the brief flowerbordered walk to the curb did you see which way my driver went miss jenny asked of the negro in the car next her carriage he went tods de back maam the negro opened the door and slid his legs clad in army od and linoleum putties to the ground ill go git him thank you well thank the lord thats over she added its too bad folks havent the sense or courage to send out invitations then shut up the house and go away all the fun of parties is in dressing and getting there i think ladies came in steady shrill groups down the walk and got into various cars or departed on foot with bright notquitemusical calls to one another the northwardswinging sun was down beyond belles house and in the shadow of the house the soft silken shades of the womens clothes were hushed delicately until the wearers reached the edge of the shadow and passed into a level spotlight of sun where they became delicately brilliant as the plumage of paroquets narcissa benbow wore gray and her eyes were violet and in her face was that serene repose of lilies not childrens parties she protested im talking about parties not about having a goodtimemiss jenny retorted speaking of children whats the news from horace oh hadnt i told you the other said quickly i had a wire yesterday he landed in new york wednesday it was such a mixedup sort of message i never could understand what he was trying to tell me except that he would have to stay in new york for a few days it was over fifty words long was it a straight messagemiss jenny asked and when the other said yes she added horace must have got rich like the soldiers say all the ymca did if it has taught a man like him to make money the war was a pretty good thing after all miss jenny how can you talk that way after johnsafter fiddlesticks miss jenny said the war just gave john a good excuse to get himself killed if it hadnt been that it would have been some other way that would have been a bother to everybody around miss jenny i know my dear ive lived with these bullheaded sartorises for eighty years and ill never give a singleghost of em the satisfaction of shedding a tear over him what did horaces message say it was about something he was bringing home with him the other answered and her serene face filled with a sort of fond exasperation it was such an incoherent messagehorace never could say anything clearly from a distance she mused again gazing down the street with its tunnel of oaks and elms through which sunlight fell in spaced tiger bars do you suppose he could have adopted a warorphan warorphan repeated miss jenny more likely its some warorphans mamma simon appeared atthe corner of the house wiping his mouth on the back of his hand and came with shuffling celerity across the lawn his cigar was not in view no the other said quickly with grave concern you dont believe he would have done that no no he wouldnt have horace wouldnt have done that he never does anything without telling me about it first he would have written i know he would you really dont think that sounds like horace do you humph miss jenny said through her highbridged norman nose an innocent like horace straying with that trusting air of his among all those manstarved european wimmen he wouldnt know it himself until it was too late especially in a foreign language i bet in every town he was in over seven days his landlady or someone was keeping his supper warm on the stove when he was late or holding sugar out on the other men to sweeten his coffee with horace was born to have some woman making a doormat of herself for him just as some men are born cuckoldedhow old are you im still twentysix miss jenny the younger woman replied equably simon unhitched the team and stood at the carriage step in his miss jenny attitude it differed from the bank one in place of that leashed military imminence it was now a gallant and slightly patronizing deference miss jenny gazed at the still serenity of the younger womans face why dont you get married and let that baby look after himself for a while mark my words it wont be six weeks before some other woman will be falling all over herself for the privilege of keeping his feet dry and he wont even miss you i promised mother the other replied quietly and without offensei dont see why he couldnt have sent an intelligible message well miss jenny turned to her carriage maybe its only an orphan after all she said with comfortless reassurance ill know soon anyway the other agreed and she crossed to a small car at the curb and opened the door miss jenny mounted with simons assistance and simon got in and gathered up the reins let us know when he does get home she called as the carriage moved forward drive out and get some more jasmine when you want it thankyou goodbye all right simon the carriage moved on again and again simon waited until they were out of town to impart his news mist bayard done come home he remarked in his former conversational tone whereis he miss jenny demanded immediately he aint come out home yit simon answered i speck he went to de graveyard fiddlesticks miss jenny snapped no sartoris ever goes to the cemetery but one timedoes colonel know hes home yessum i tole him but he dont ack like he believed iwuz tellin him de troof you mean nobodys seen him but you i aint seed him neither simon disclaimed section han seed him jump off de train and tole me you damn fool nigger miss jenny stormed and you went and blurted a fool thing like that to bayard havent you got any more sense than that section han seed him simon repeated stubbornly i reckon he knowed mist bayard when he seed him well where is he then he mought have gone out to de graveyard simon suggested drive on miss jenny said sharply miss jenny found her nephew sitting with two birddogs in his library the room was lined with bookcases containing rows of heavy legal tomes bound in dun calf and emanating an atmosphere of dusty and undisturbed meditation and a miscellany of fiction of the historicalromantic school all dumas was there and the steady progression of the volumes now constituted bayard sartoris entire reading and one volume lay always on the nighttable beside his bed and a collection of indiscriminate objectssmall packets of seed old rusted spurs and bits and harness buckles brochures on animal and vegetable diseases ornate tobacco containers which people had given him oh various occasions and which he had never used inexplicable bits of rock and desiccated roots and grain podsall collected one at a time and for reasons which had long since escaped his mind yet preserved just the same the room contained an enormous closet with a padlocked door and a big table littered with yet other casual objects and a locked rolltop desk keys and locks were an obsession with him and a divan and three big leather chairs this room was always referred to as the office and bayard sartoris now sat in it with his hat on and still wearing his ridingboots transferring bourbon whisky from a small compact keg to a silverstoppered decanter while the two dogs watched him with majestic gravity one of the dogs was quite old and nearly blind it spent most of the day lying in the sun in the backyard or during the hot summer days in the cool dusty obscurity beneath the kitchen floor but toward the middle of the afternoon it went to the front of the house and waited there quietly until it heard the carriage coming up the drive and when bayard sartoris had descended and passed into the house it returned to the back and waited again until isom led the mare up to the back porch and bayard sartoris came out and mounted then together they spent the afternoon going quietly and unhurriedly about the grazing meadows and the planting or harvesting fields and the peaceful woodlands in their dreaming seasonal mutationsthe man on his horse and the ticked setter gravely beside him while the descending evening of their fives drew toward its peaceful close upon the kind land that had bred them both the other dog was a twoyearold his net was too hasty for the sedateness of their society overlong and though at times he set forth with them or came quartering up splashed and eager from somewhere to join them in mid procession he never remained very long but must presently dash away with lolling tongue and the tense delicate feathering of his tail in pursuit of the maddening elusive smells with which the world surrounded him and tempted him from beyond every thicket and copse and ravine bayard sartoris boots were wet to the tops and the soles were rimmed with mud and he bent in intense preoccupation above his keg and bottle under the sober curiosity of the two dogs the keg was propped in another chair with the bung upward and he was siphoning the rich liquor delicately into the decanter through a slender rubber tube miss jenny came straight through the house and entered the library with her black bonnet still perched on theexact top of her trim white head and the two dogs looked up at her the older with grave dignity the younger one more quickly tapping his tail on the floor with fawning diffidence but bayard sartoris did not raise his head miss jenny closed the door and gazed coldly at his boots your feet are wet she stated still he didnt look up but held the tube delicately in the bottleneck watching the clear brown liquor mount steadily in the decanter at times bayard sartoris deafness was very convenient more convenient than actual perhaps but who could know this certainly you go upstairs and get those boots off miss jenny commanded coming into the room ill fill the decanter but within the walled serene tower of his deafness his rapt imperturbability did not falter until the decanter was full and he pinched the tube shut and raised it to drain back into the keg the older dog sat gravely before him but the younger one had retreated beyond him where it lay motionless and alert its head on its crossed forepaws watching miss jenny with one melting unwinking eye bayard sartoris drew the tube from the keg and looked at his aunt for the first time what did you say but miss jenny had returned and opened the door again and she shouted into the hall eliciting an alarmed response from the kitchen followed presently by simon in the flesh go up and get colonels slippers she directed when she turned into the room again neither her nephew nor the keg was visible but from the open closet door there protruded the young dogs interested hind quarters and the tense feathering of his barometric tail then bayard sartoris thrust the dog out of the closet with hisfoot and emerged himself and locked the door behindhim has simon come in yet he asked hes coming right now she answered i just called him sit down and get those wet boots off at that moment simon entered with the slippers and bayard sartoris sat obediently and simon knelt and drew his boots off under miss jennys martinet eye are his socks dry she asked nom dey aint wet simon answered but she bent and felt them herself here said her nephew testily but miss jenny ran her hand over both his feet with bland imperturbability precious little fault of his that they aint she said across the topless wall of his deafness and then you have to come along with that fool yarn of yours about mr bayard section han seed him simon repeated stubbornly thrusting the slippers onto bayard sartoris feet i aint never said i seed him he stood up and rubbed his hands on his thighs bayard sartoris stomped his feet into the slippers bring the toddy fixings simon then to his aunt in a casual tone simon says bayard got off the train this afternoon but miss jenny was storming at simon again come back here and get these boots and set em behind the stove she added simon returned and sidled swiftly to the hearth and gathered up the boots and take these dogs out of here too she said thank the lord bayard hasnt thought about bringing his horse in here too immediately the old dog came to his feet and followed by the younger ones diffident alacritydeparted with that same assumeddeliberation with which both bayard sartoris and simon obeyed miss jennys implacable will simon says bayard sartoris repeated simon says fiddlesticks miss jenny snapped have you lived with simon sixty years without learning that he dont know the truth when he sees it and she followed simon from the room and on to the kitchen and while simons tall yellow daughter bent over her biscuitboard and simon filled a glass pitcher with fresh water and sliced lemons and set them and a sugar bowl and two tall glasses on a tray miss jenny stood in the doorway and curled what remained of simons grizzled hair to tighter kinks yet she had a fine command of language at all times but when her ire was aroused she soared without effort to sublime heights hers was a forceful clarity and a colorful simplicity which demosthenes would have envied and that even mules comprehended and of whose intent the most obtuse persons remained not long unawares and beneath it simons head bobbed lower and lower and the fine assumption of detached preoccupation moulted like feathers from about his defenseless self until he caught up the tray and ducked from the room miss jennys voice followed him descending easily with a sweeping comprehensiveness that included a warning and a suggestion for future conduct for simon and elnora and all their descendants actual and problematical for some years and the next time miss jenny finished you or any section hand or brakeman or delivery boy either sees or hears anything you think will be of interest to colonel you tell me about it first ill do all the telling after that she gave elnora another glare for good measure and returned to the library where hernephew was stirring sugar and water carefully in the two glasses simon in a white jacket officiated as butlerdoubled in brass you might say only it was not brass but silver so fine that some of the spoon handles were worn now almost to paper thinness where fingers in their generations had held them silver which simons grandfather joby had buried on a time beneath the ammoniac bam floor while simon aged three in a single filthy garment had looked on with a childs grave interest in the curious game an effluvium of his primary calling dung about him always even when he was swept and garnished for church and a little shapeless in a discarded prince albert coat of bayard sartoris and his every advent into the dining room with dishes brought with him and the easy attitudes into which he fell near the buffet while answering miss jennys abrupt questions or while pursuing some fragmentary conversation which he and bayard sartoris had been engaged in earlier in the day disseminated and his exits left behind him a faint nostalgia of the stables but tonight he brought dishes in and set them down and scuttled immediately back to the kitchen simon realized that again he had talked too much miss jenny with a shawl of white wool about her shoulders against the evenings coolness was doing the talking tonight immersing herself and her nephew in a wealth of trivialitiespetty doings and sayings and gossipa behavior which was not like miss jenny at all she had opinions and a pithy savagely humorous way of putting them into words but it was very seldom that she descended to gossip meanwhile bayard sartoris hadshut himself up inthat walled tower of his deafness and raised the drawbridge and clashed the portcullis to where you never knew whether he heard you or no while his corporeal self ate his supper steadily presently they had done and miss jenny rang the little silver bell beside her and simon opened the door and received again the cold broadside of her glare and shut the door and lurked behind it until they had left the room bayard sartoris lit his cigar in the library and miss jenny followed him there and drew her chair up to the table beneath the lamp and opened the daily memphis newspaper she enjoyed humanity in its more colorful mutations preferring lively romance to the most impeccable of dun fact so she took in the more lurid afternoon paper even though it was yesterdays when it reached her and read with cold avidity accounts of arson and murder and violent dissolution and adultery in good time and soon the american scene was to supply her with diversion in the form of bootleggers wars but this was not yet her nephew sat without the mellow downward pool of the lamp with his feet braced against the corner of the hearth from which his bootsoles and the bootsoles of john sartoris before him had long since worn the varnish away puffing his cigar he was not reading and at intervals miss jenny glanced above her glasses and across the top of the paper toward him then she read again and there was no sound in the room save the sporadic rustling of the page presently he rose with one of his sudden plunging movements and miss jenny watched him while he crossed the room and passed through the door and banged it to behind him she read on for a while longer but her attention had followed the heavy tramp of his feet up the hall and when this ceasedshe rose and laid the paper aside and followed him to the front door the moon had gotten up beyond the dark eastern wall of the hills and it lay without emphasis upon the valley mounting like a childs balloon through the oaks and locusts along the drive bayard sartoris sat with his feet on the veranda rail in the moonlight his cigar glowed at spaced intervals and a shrill monotone of crickets rose from the immediate grass and further away from among the trees a fairylike piping of young frogs like endless silver small bubbles rising and a thin sourceless odor of locust drifted up intangible as fading tobaccowraiths and from the rear of the house up the dark ball elnoras voice floated in meaningless minor suspense miss jenny turned aside just within the door and groped about the yawning lesser obscurity of the mirror until she found her nephews felt hat and she carried it out to him and put it in his hand dont sit out here too long now it aint summer yet he grunted indistinguishably but he put the hat on and she turned away and went back to the library and finished the paper and folded it and laid it on the table she snapped the light off and mounted the dark stairs to her room the moon shone above the trees at this height and it fell in broad silver bars through the eastern windows before turning up the light she crossed to the southern wall and raised a window there upon the crickets and frogs and somewhere a mockingbird outside this window was a magnolia tree but it was not to bloom yet nor had the honeysuckle massed along the garden fence flowered but this would be soon and from here she could overlook the garden could look down upon cape jasmine and syringa and calycanthus where the moon lay upon their bronzeand yet unflowered sleep and upon those other shoots and graftings from carolina and virginian gardens she had known as a girl just beyond the corner from this window the kitchen lay and elnoras voice welled in mellow falling suspense all folks talkinbout heavenaint gwine dere elnora sang and presently she and simon emerged into the moonlight and took the path to simons house below the barn simon had fired his cigar at last and the evil smoke of it trailed behind him fading but when they had gone it still seemed that the rank pungency of it lingered yet within the sound of the crickets and of the frogs upon the silver air mingled and blended inextricably with the dying fall of elnoras voice all folks talkinbout heavenaint gwine dere his cigar was cold and he moved and dug a match from his waistcoat and relit it and braced his feet again upon the railing and again the drifting sharpness of tobacco lay along the windless currents of the silver air straying and fading slowly amid locustbreaths and the ceaseless fairy reiteration of crickets and frogs there was a mockingbird somewhere down the valley far away and in a while another sang from the magnolia at the corner of the garden fence an automobile passed along the smooth valley road slowed for the railway crossing then sped on again and when the sound of it had died away the whistle of the ninethirty train swelled from among the hills two long blasts with dissolving echoes two short following ones but before it came in sight his cigar was cold again and he sat holding it in his old fingers and watched the locomotive drag its string of yellowwindows up the valley and into the hills again where after a time it whistled once more arrogant and resonant and sad john sartoris had sat so on this veranda and watched his two trains emerge from the hills and traverse the valley into the hills again with lights and smoke and bells and a noisy simulation of speed but now his railway belonged to a syndicate and there were more than two trains on it and they ran from chicago to the gulf completing his dream though john sartoris himself slept these many years unawares perhaps amid martial cherubim lapped in the useless vainglory of that lord which his forefathers had imagined themselves in the rare periods of their metaphysical speculations then his cigar was cold again and he sat and held it in his fingers and watched a tall shape emerge from the lilac bushes along the garden fence and across the patchy moonlight toward the veranda where he sat his grandson wore no hat and he came on and mounted the steps and stood with the moonlight bringing the hawklike planes of his face into high relief while his grandfather sat holding his dead cigar and looked at him bayard son old bayard said young bayard stood in the moonlight his eyesockets were cavernous shadows i tried to keep him from going up there on that goddam little popgun he said at last with brooding savageness then he moved again and old bayard lowered his feet from the rail but his grandson only dragged a chair violently up beside him and flung himself into it his motions were abrupt also like his grandfathers but controlled and flowing for all their violence why in hell didnt you let me know you werecoming old bayard demanded what do you mean straggling in here like this i didnt let anybody know young bayard dug a cigarette from his pocket and raked a match on his shoe what i didnt tell anybody i was coming he repeated above the cupped match raising his voice simon knew it do you inform nigger servants of your movements instead of your own grandaddy damn simon sir young bayard shouted who set him to watching me dont yell at me boy old bayard shouted in turn his grandson flung the match away and drew at the cigarette in deep troubled draughts dont wake jenny old bayard added more mildly striking a match to his cold and spent cigar all right are you young bayard saw that his hands were trembling here he said extending his hand let me hold it youre going to set your moustache on fire but old bayard repulsed him sharply and sucked stubbornly and impotently at the match in his unsteady fingers i said are you all right he repeated why not young bayard snapped takes damn near as big a fool to get hurt in a war as it does in peacetime damn fool thats what it is he drew at the cigarette again then he hurled it not half consumed after the match there was one i had to lay for four days to catch him had to get sibleigh in an old crate of a dh to suck him in for me wouldnt look at anything but cold meat him and his skull and bones well he got it stayed on him for six thousand feet put a whole belt right into his cockpit youcould a covered em all with your hat but the bastard just wouldnt burn young bayards voice rose again as he talked on locust drifted up in sweet gusts upon the air and the crickets and frogs were clear and monotonous as pipes blown drowsily by an idiot boy from her silver casement the moon looked down upon the valley dissolving in opaline tranquility into the serene mysterious infinitude of the hills and young bayards voice went on and on recounting violence and speed and death hush old bayard said again youll wake jenny and his grandsons voice sank obediently but soon it rose again above the dark and stubborn struggling of his heart and soon miss jenny emerged with her white woolen shawl over her nightdress and came and kissed him i reckon youre all right she said or you wouldnt be in such a bad humor tell us about johnny he was drunk young bayard answered harshly or a fool i tried to keep him from going up there on that damn camel you couldnt see your hand that morning air all full of hunks of cloud and any fool could a known that on their side itd be full of fokkers that could reach twentyfive thousand and him on a damn camel but he was hellbent on going up there damn hear to lille i couldnt keep him from it he shot at me young bayard said i tried to head him off and drive him back but he gave me a burst he was already high as he could get but they must have been five thousand feet above us when they spotted us they flew all over him hemmed him up like a damn calf in a pen while one of them sat right on his tail until he took fire and jumped then they streaked for home locust drifted and drifted on the still air and the silver rippling of the tree frogs in the magnolia at the corner of the house the mockingbird sang down the valley another one replied streaked for home with the rest of his gang young bayard said him and his skull and bones it was ploeckner he added and for the moment his voice was still and untroubled with vindicated pride he was one of the best they had pupil of richthofens well thats something miss jenny agreed stroking his head young bayard brooded for a time i tried to keep him from going up there on that goddam little popgun he burst out again what did you expect after the way you raised him miss jenny demanded youre the oldestyouve been to the cemetery havent you yessum he answered quietly whats that old bayard demanded that old fool simon said thats where you wereyou come on and eat your supper she said briskly and firmly entering his life again without a byyourleave taking up the snarled threads of it after her brisk and capable fashion and he rose obediently whats that old bayard repeated and you come on in too miss jenny swept him also into the orbit of her will as you gather a garment from a chair in passing time you were in bed they followed her to the kitchen and stood while she delved into the ice box and set food on the table and a pitcher of milk and drew a chair up fix him a toddy jenny old bayard suggested but miss jenny vetoed this immediately milks what he wants i reckon he had to drink enough whisky during that war to last him for a while bayard used to never come home from hiswithout wanting to ride his horse up the front stepsand into the house come on now and she droveold bayard firmly out of the kitchen and up thestairs you go on to bed you hear let him alonefor a while she saw his door shut and she enteredyoung bayards room and prepared his bed and aftera while from her own room she heard him mount the stairs his room too was treacherously illumined by the moon and the old familiarity of it was sharp with ghosts that neither slept nor waked without turning on the light he went and sat on the bed outside the windows the interminable crickets and frogs as though the moons rays were thin glass impacting among the trees and shrubs and shattering in brittle musical rain upon the ground and above this and with a deep timbrous quality the measured respirations of the pump in the electric plant beyond the barn he dug another cigarette from his pocket and lit it but he took only two draughts before he flung it away and then he sat quietly in the room which he and john had shared in the young masculine violence of their twinship on the bed where he and his wife had lain the last night of his leave the night before he went back to england and thence out to the front again where john already was beside him on the pillow the wild bronze flame of her hair was hushed now in the darkness and she lay holding his arm with both hands against her breast while they talked quietly soberly at last but he was not thinking of her then when he thought of her who lay rigid in the dark beside him holding his arm tightly between her breasts it was only to be a little savagely ashamed of the heedless thing he had done to her he was thinking of hisbrother whom he had not seen in over a year thinking that in a month they would see one another again nor was he thinking of her now although the walls held like a withered flower in a casket the fragrance of that magical chaos in which they had briefly lived tragic and transient as a blooming of honeysuckle he was thinking of his dead brother the spirit of their violent complementing days lay like a dust everywhere in the room obliterating the scent of that other presence stopping his breathing and he went to the window and flung the sash crashing upward and leaned there gulping air into his lungs like a man who has been submerged and who still cannot believe that he has reached the surface again later lying naked between the sheets he waked himself with his own groaning the room was filled now with a gray light sourceless and chill and he turned his head and saw miss jenny the woolen shawl about her shoulders sitting in a chair beside the bed whats the matter he said thats what i want to know miss jenny answered you make more noise than that water pump i want a drink miss jenny leaned forward and raised a glass from the floor beside her and extended it to him bayard had risen on his elbow i said a drink he said you drink this milk boy miss jenny commanded you think im going to sit up all night just to feed you whisky drink it now he took the glass and emptied it obediently and lay back miss jenny set the glass on the floor what time is it hush she said she laid her hand on his brow go to sleep he rolled his head on the pillow but he could not evade her hand get away he said let me alone hush miss jenny said go to sleep two simon said you aint never yit planted nothin whar hit ought ter be planted he sat on the bottom step whetting the blade of his hoe with a file miss jenny stood with her caller at the edge of the veranda above him in a mans felt hat and heavy gloves a pair of shears dangled below her waist glinting in the morning sunlight and whose business is that she demanded yours or colonels either one of you can loaf on this porch and tell me where a plant will grow best or look best but if either of you ever grew as much as a weed out of the ground yourselves id like to see it i dont give two whoops in the bad place where you or colonel either thinks a flower ought to be planted i plant my flowers just exactly where i want em to be planted and den dares um not ter come up simon added dats de way you en isom gyardens thank de lawd isom aint got to make his livin wid de sort of gyardenin he learns in dat gyarden simon wore a disreputable hat of a fabric these many years anonymous miss jenny stared coldly down at this hat isom made his living by being born black miss jenny snapped suppose you quit scraping at thathoe and see if you cant dare some of the grass in that salvia bed to come up i got to git a aidge on dis currycomb simon said you gon out dar to yo gyardemill git dis bed cleaned up he scraped steadily at the hoeblade youve been at that long enough to find out that you cant possibly wear that blade down to the handle with just a file youve been at it ever since breakfast i heard you you get out there where folks passing will think youre working anyhow simon groaned and spent a half minute laying the file aside he laid it on one step then he picked it up and moved it to another step then he laid it against the step behind him then he ran his thumb along the blade examining it with morose hopefulness hit mought do now he said but hitll be jest like weedin wid a curryc you try it anyway miss jenny said maybe the weedsu think its a hoe you go give em a chance to anyhow ise gwine ise gwine simon answered pettishly rising and hobbling away you gon see erbout dat place o yon illtend to dis miss jenny and the caller descended the steps and went on around the corner of the house why hed rather sit there and rasp at that new hoe with a file instead of grubbing up a dozen weeds in that salvia bed i cant see miss jenny said but hell do it hed sit there and scrape at that hoe until it looked like a saw blade if id let him bayard bought a lawn mower three or four years agogod knows what forand turned it over to simon the folks that made it guaranteed it for a year they didnt know simon though i often thought readingabout those devastations and things in the papers last year what a good time simon would have had in the war he could have shown em things about devastation they never thought of isom she shouted they entered the garden and miss jenny paused at the gate you isom this time there was a reply and miss jenny went on with her caller and isom lounged up from somewhere and clicked the gate behind him why didnt you miss jenny began looking back over her shoulder then she stopped and regarded isoms suddenly military figure with brief cold astonishment for isom now wore khaki with a divisional emblem on his shoulder and a tarnished service stripe on his cuff and it didnt fit him or rather it fitted him too well his lean sixteenyearold neck rose from the slovenly collars limp overlarge embrace and an astonishing amount of his wrists was viable beneath the cuffs the breeches bagged hopelessly into the unskillful wrapping of the putties which with either a fine sense for the unique or a bland disregard of military usage he had donned prior to his shoes and the soiled overseas cap came down most regrettably on his bullet head where did you get those clothes miss jennys shears dangled below her waist on a heavy black cord glinting in the sun and miss benbow in a white dress and a soft straw hat turned also and looked at him with a strange expression deys caspeys isom answered i jes bord um caspey miss jenny repeated ishe home yessum he got in las night on de ninethirty last night did he where is he now asleep i reckon yessum dats whar he wuz when i lef home and i reckon thats how you borrowed his uniform miss jenny said tartly well let him sleep this morning give him a day to get over the war but if it made a fool out of him like it did bayard hed better put that thing on again and go back to it ill declare men cant seem to stand anything she strode on the other in her straight white dress followed you are awfully hard on men not to have a husband to worry with miss jenny she said besides youre judging all men by your sartorises they aint my sartorises miss jenny disclaimedpromptly i just inherited em but you just waityoull have one of your own to bother with soonyou just wait until horace gets home then see howlong it takes him to get over it men cant seem tostand anything she repeated cant even stand helling around with no worry and no responsibility andno limit to all of the meanness they can think aboutwanting to do do you think a man could sit dayafter day and month after month in a house milesfrom anywhere and spend the time between casualtylists tearing up bedclothes and window curtains andtable linen to make lint and watching sugar and flourand meat dwindling away and using pine knots forlight because there arent any candles and no candlesticks to put them in if there were and hiding innigger cabins while drunken yankee generals set fireto the house your greatgreatgrandfather built andyou and all your folks were born in dont talk to meabout men suffering in war miss jenny snipped larkspur savagely just you wait until horace comes home then youll see john at least had consideration enough after hed gone and gotten himself intowhere he had no business not to comeback and worry everybody to death but bayard now coming back in the middle of it and having everybody thinking he was settled down at last teaching at that memphis flying school and then marrying that fool girl miss jenny well i dont mean that but she ought tove been spanked hard i know didnt i do the same tiling myself it was all that harness bayard wore talk about men being taken in by a uniform miss jenny clipped larkspur dragging me up there to the wedding mind you with a lot of rented swords and some of bayards pupils trying to drop roses into the street i reckon some of em were not his pupils because one of em finally did drop a few that missed the houses miss jenny snipped larkspur savagely i had dinner with em one night sat in the hotel an hour until they finally came for me then we stopped at a delicatessen and bayard and caroline got out and went inside and came back with about a bushel of packages and dumped em into the car under my feet that was the dinner id been invited to mind you there wasnt a sign of anything that looked or smelt like a stove in the whole place i didnt offer to help em i told caroline i didnt know anything about that sort of housekeeping because my folks were so oldfashioned they cooked food at our house then the others came insome of bayards soldier friends and a herd of other folks wives near as i could gather young women that ought to have been at home seeing about supper gabbling and screeching in that silly way young married women have when theyre doing something they hope their husbands wouldnt like they began to unwrap bottlesabout a dozen i reckon and bayard and caroline came in with that silver i gave em and monogrammed napkins and that delicatessen stuff that tasted like wet swamp grass on paper plates we ate it there sitting on the floor tor standing up or just wherever you happened to be that was carolines idea of keeping house she said theyd settle down when they got old about thirtyfive i suppose she meant thin as a rail there wouldnt have been much to spank but shed ought tove had it just the same soon as she found out about the baby she named it named it bayard nine months before it was born and told everybody about it used to talk about it like it was her grandfather or something always saying bayard wont let me do this or that or the other miss jenny continued to clip larkspur the caller tall in a white dress beside her the fine and huge simplicity of the house rose among its thickening trees the garden lay in the sunlight bright with bloom myriad with scent and with a drowsy humming of beesa steady golden sound as of sunlight become audibleall the impalpable veil of the immediate the familiar just beyond it a girl with a bronze skirling of hair and a small supple body in a constant epicene unrepose a dynamic fixation like that of carven sexless figures caught in moments of action striving a mechanism all of whose members must move in performing the most trivial action her wild hands not accusing but passionate sail beyond the veil impalpable but sufficient miss jenny stooped over the bed of larkspur her narrow back though stooping erect still indomitable a thrush flashed modestly across the bright air and into the magnolia tree in a dying parabola and then when he bad to go back to the war of coursehe brought her down here and left her on my hands the caller stood tall in her white dress and miss jenny said no i dont mean that she snipped larkspur poor women she said i reckon we do have to take our revenge wherever and whenever we can get it only she ought tove taken it out on bayard when she died narcissa said and he couldntknow about it when he couldnt have come to her if he had and you can say that bayafd love anybody that cold brute miss jenny clipped larkspur he never cared a snap of his fingers for anybody in his life except johnny she snipped larkspur savagely swelling around here like it was our fault like we made em go to that war and now hes got to have an automobile got to go all the way to memphis to buy one an automobile in bayard sartoris barn mind you him that wont even lead the banks money to a man that owns onedo you want some sweerpeas yes please the gues answered miss jenny straightened up then she stopped utterly still just look yonder will you she said pointing with hear shears thats how they suffer from the war poor things beyond a frame of sweet peas isom in his khaki strode solemnly back and forth upon his right shoulder was a hoe and on his face an expression of rapt absorption and as he reversed at each end of his beat he mumbled to himself in measured singsong you isom miss jenny shouted he halted in midstride still at shoulder arms maam he answered mildly miss jenny continued to glare at him andhis military bearing faded and he lowered his piece and executed a sort of effacing movement within his martial shroud put that hoe down and bring that basket over here thats the first time in your life you ever picked up a garden tool of your own free will i wish i could discover the kind of uniform that would make you keep both hands on it idcertainly buy you one yessum if you want to play soldier you go off somewhere with bayard and do it i can raise flowers without any help from the army she added turning to her guest with her handful of larkspur and what are you laughing at she demanded sharply you both looked so funny the younger womanexplained you looked so much more like a soldierthan poor isom for all his uniform she touched her eyeswith her fingertips im sorry please forgiveme for laughing hmphmiss jenny sniffed she put the larkspur into the basket and went on to the sweet pea frame and snipped again viciously the guest followed as did isom with the basket and presently miss jenny was done with sweet peas and she moved on again with her train pausing to cut a rose here and there and stopped before a bed where tulips lifted their bright bells she and isom had guessed happily this time the various colors formed an orderly pattern when we dug em up last fall she told her guest id put a red one in isoms right hand and a white one in his left and then id say all right isom give me the red one hed never fail to hold out his left hand and if i just looked at him long enough hed hold out both hands didnt i tell you to hold that red one in your right hand id say yessum here tis and out would come his left hand again that aint your right hand stupid id say dats de one you said wuz myright hand a while agomr isomsays aint that so nigger miss jenny glared at isom who again performed his deprecatory effacing movement behind the slow equanimity of his ivory grin yessum i speck it is youd better miss jenny rejoined warningly now how can anybody keep a decent garden with a fool like that i expect every spring to find corn or lespedeza coming up in the hyacinth beds or something she examined the tulips again weighing the balanced colors one against another in her mind no you dont want any tulips she decided briskly moving on no miss jenny the guest agreed demurely they went on to the gate and miss jenny stopped again and took the basket from isom and you go home and take that thing off you hear she told isom yessum and i want to look out that window in a few minutes and see you in the garden with that hoe again she added and i want to see both of your right hands on it and i want to see it moving too youhearme yessum and tell caspey to be ready to go to work in the morning even niggers that eat here have got to work some but isom was gone and they went on and mounted the steps dont he sound like thats exactly what hes going to do she confided as they entered the hallhe knows as well as i do that i wont dare look out that window after what i said come in she added opening the parlor door this room was opened but seldom now though in john sartoris day it had been constantly in use he was always giving dinners and balls too on occasionwith the folding doors between it and the dining room thrown open and three negroes with stringed instruments ensconced on the stairway and all the candles burning for with his frank love of pageantry as well as his innate sociability he liked to surround himself with an atmosphere of scent and delicate garments and food and music he had lain also in this room in his grey regimentals and so brought to a conclusion the colorful if not always untarnished pageant of his own career perhaps ghosts he knew greeted him there again and surrounded him as of old upon the jocund mellowness of his hearth but during bayards time it was less and less in use and slowly and imperceptibly it lost its jovial but stately masculinity becoming by mutual and unspoken agreement a place for his wife and his son johns wife and miss jenny to clean thoroughly twice a year and in which preceded by a ritualistic unswaddling of brown holland they entertained their more formal callers this was its status up to the birth of his grandsons and the death of their parents and it continued thus until his wife died after that miss jenny bothered with formal callers but little and with the parlor not at all she said it gave her the creeps and so it stayed closed nearly all the time and slowly acquired an atmosphere of solemn and macabre fustiness and was referred to as the parlor with a capital p occasionally young bayard or john would open the door and peer into solemn obscurity in which the shrouded furniture loomed with a sort of ghostly benignance like albino mastodons but they did not enter already in their minds the room was associated with death an idea which even the hollyand tinsel of christmas tide could not completely obscure they were away at school by the time they reached party age but even during vacations though they had filled the house with the polite bedlam of their contemporaries the room would be opened only on christmas eve and after they had gone to england in it was opened twice a year to be cleaned after the ancient ritual that even simon had inherited from his forefathers and to have the piano tuned or when miss jenny and narcissa benbow spent a forenoon or afternoon there and formally not at all the furniture loomed shapelessly in its dun shrouds the piano alone was uncovered and the younger woman drew the bench up and removed her hat and let it slip to the floor beside her miss jenny set her basket down and from the gloom beside the piano she drew a straight hard chair uncovered also and sat down and removed her felt hat from her trim white head light came through the open door and faintly through the heavy maroonandlace curtains but it only served to enhance the obscurity and render more shapeless the hooded anonymous furniture but behind these dun bulks and in all the corners of the room there waited as actors stand within the wings beside the waiting stage figures in crinoline and hooped muslin and silk in stocks and flowing coats in grey too with crimson sashes and sabres in gallant sheathed reposejeb stuart himself perhaps on his glittering garlanded bay or with his sunny hair falling upon fine broadcloth beneath the mistletoe and holly boughs of baltimore in miss jenny sat with her uncompromising grenadiers back and held her hat upon her knees and fixed herself to look onnarcissas white dress was pliant as light against the gloom and as serene and her hands touched chords from the keyboard and drew them together and rolled the curtain back upon the scene in the kitchen caspey was having breakfast while simon his father and elnora his sister and isom his nephew still wearing the uniform watched him he had been simons understudy in the stables and general handyman about the place doing all the work simon managed through the specious excuse of decrepitude to slough off onto his shoulders and that miss jenny could devise for him and which he could not evade bayard sartoris also employed him in the fields occasionally then the draft had got him and bore him to france and the st sulpice docks as one of a labor battalion where he did what work corporals and sergeants managed to slough off onto his unmilitary shoulders and that white officers could devise for him and which he could not evade thus all the labor about the place devolved upon simon and isom but miss jenny kept isom piddling about the garden so much of the time that simon was soon as bitter against the war lords as any professional democrat meanwhile caspey was working a little and trifling with continental life in its martial mutations rather to his future detriment for at last the tumult died and the captains departed and left a vacuum filled with the usual bitter bickering of armageddons heirsatlaw and caspey returned to his native land a total loss sociologically speaking with a definite disinclination toward labor honest or otherwise and two honorable wounds incurred in a razorhedged crap game but return he did to his fathers querulous satisfaction and elnoras and isoms admiration and he now sat in the kitchen telling them about the war i dont take nothin fum no white folks no mo he was saying war done changed all dat if us colored folks is good enough to save france fum de germans den us is good enough to have de same rights de germans has french folks thinks so anyhow and if

when he passed along beside the house and crossed the lawn toward the drive there goes your gardener narcissa said miss jenny looked thats caspey she corrected now where do you reckon hes headed town ill bet a dollar she added watching his lounging khaki back by means of which he contrived in some way to disseminate a sort of lazy insolence you caspey he slowed in pacing narcissas car where it stood on the drive and examined it with a disparagement too lazy to sneer even then slouched on without quickening his pace you caspeymiss jenny called raising her voice but he went steadily on down the drive insolent and slouching and unhurried he heard me she said ominously well see about this when he comes back who was the fool anyway who thought of putting niggers into the same uniform with white men mr vardaman knew better he told those fools at washington at the time that it wouldnt do but politicians she invested the innocent word with an utter and blasting derogation if i ever get tired of associating with gentlefolks i know what ill do ill run for congresslisten at me tiradin again i declare at times i believe these sartorises and all their possessions just set out to plague and annoy me thank the lord i wont have to live with em after im dead i dont know where theyll be but no sartoris is going to stay in heaven any longer than he can help the other laughed you seem very sure of your own destination miss jenny why shouldnt i be miss jenny demanded havent i been storing up crowns and harps for a long time she shaded her eyes with her hand and stared down the drive caspey had reached the gate and he now stood beside the road waiting for a ride to town dont you stop for him you hear she said suddenly why wont you stay for dinner no the other answered i must get on home aunt sallys not well today she stood for a moment in the sunlight with her hat and the basket of flowers on her arm musing then with a motionof sudden decision she drew a folded paper from the front of her dress got another one did you miss jenny asked watching her lemme see it she took the paper and opened it and stepped back out of the sun her nose glasses hung on a slender silk cord that rolled onto a spring in a small gold case pinned to her bosom she snapped the cord out and set the glasses on her highbridged nose and behind them her gray eyes were cold and piercing as a surgeons the paper was a single sheet of unmarked foolscap it bore writing in a frank open script that at first glance divulged no individuality whatever a hand youthful yet at the same time so blandly and neatly unsecretive that presently you speculated a little you did not answer mine of th i did not expect you would yet you will answer soon i can wait i will not harm you i am square and honest as you will learn when our ways come together i do not expect you to answer yet but you know where miss jenny refolded the paper with a gesture of fine and delicate distaste id burn this thing if it wasnt the only thing we have to catch him with ill give it to bayard tonight no no the other protested quickly extending her hand please not that let me have it and tear it up its our only evidence childthis and the other one well get a detective no no please i dont want anybody else to know about it please miss jenny she reached her hand again you want to keep it miss jenny accused coldly just

had shown it to someone else let me have it please fiddlesticks why should you feel filthy you havent encouraged it have you please miss jenny but miss jenny still held on to it dont be a fool she snapped how can this thing make you feel filthy any young woman is liable to get an anonymous letter and a lot of em like it we all are convinced that men feel that way about us and we cant help but admire one thats got the courage to tell us about it no matter who he is if hed just signed his name i wouldnt mind who it was but like thisplease miss jenny dont be a fool miss jenny repeated how can we find who it is if you destroy the letter i dont want to know miss jenny released the paper and narcissa tore it into bits and cast them over the rail and rubbed her hands on her dress i dont want to know i want to forget all about it nonsense youre dying to know right now i bet you look at every man you pass and wonder if its him and as long as you dont do something about it itll go on get worse probably you better let me tell bayard no no id hate for him to know to think that i wouldmight haveits all right ill just burn them up after this without opening themi must really go of course youll throw em right into the stove miss jenny agreed with cold irony narcissa descended the steps and miss jenny came forward intothe sunlight again letting her glasses snap back into the case its your business of course but td not stand for it if twas me but then i aint twentysix years oldwell come out again when you get another one or you want some flowers yes i will thank you for these and let me know what you hear from horace thank the lord its just a glassblowing machine and not a war widow yes i will goodbye she went on through the dappled shade in her straight white dress and her basket of flowers stippled against it and got in her car the top was back and she put her hat on and started the engine and looked back again and waved her hand goodbye the negro had moved down the road slowly and had stopped again and he was watching her covertly as she approached as she passed him he looked full at her and she knew he was about to hail her she opened the throttle and passed him with increasing speed and drove swiftly all the way to town where she lived in at brick house among cedars on a hilt she was arranging the larkspur in a dull lemon urn on the piano aunt sally rocked steadily in her chair beside the window clapping her feet flatly on the floor at each stroke her work basket sat on the window ledge between the gentle billowing of the curtains her ebony walkingstick leaned beside it and you were out there two hours aunt sally said and you never saw him at all he wasnt there narcissa answered hes gone to memphis aunt sally rocked steadily if i was them id make him stay there i wouldnt have that boyaround me blood or no bloodwhat did he go to memphis for i thought that aeroplane whatdoyoucallit was broke up he went on business i suppose what business has he got in memphis bayard sartoris has got more sense than to turn over any business to that wild fool i dont know narcissa answered arranging the larkspur hell be back soon i suppose you can ask himthen me ask him i never said two words to him in his life and i dont want to i been used to associating with gentlemen narcissa broke some of the stems arranging the blooms in a pattern whats he done that gentlemen dont do aunt sally why jumping off water tanks and going up in balloons just to scare folks you think id have that boy around me id have him locked up in the insane asylum if i was bayard and jenny he didnt jump off of the tank he just swung off of it on a rope and dived into the swimming pool and it was john that went up in the balloon that wasnt what i heard i heard he jumped off that tank across a whole line of freight cars and lumber piles and didnt miss the edge of the pool an inch no he didnt he swung on a rope from the top of a house and then dived into the pool the rope was tied to the tank well didnt he have to jump over a lot of lumber and freight cars and couldnt he have broken his neck just as easy that way as jumping off the tank yes narcissa said there whatd i tell you and what was the use ofit i dont know of course you dont know that was the reason he did it aunt sally rocked triumphantly for a while narcissa put the last touches to the blue pattern of the larkspur a tortoiseshell cat bunched suddenly and silently in the window beside the work basket still crouching it blinked into the room for a moment then it sank to the window sill and with arched neck fell to grooming its shoulder with a narrow pink tongue narcissa moved to the window and laid her hand on the creatures sleek back and then going up in that balloon when that wasnt bayard narcissa repeated that was john that wasnt what i heard i heard it was the other one and that bayard and jenny were both begging him with tears in their eyes not to do it i heard neither one of them were there bayard wasnt even there it was john did it he did it because the man that came with the balloon got sick john went up in it so the country people wouldnt be disappointed i was there stood there and let him do it did you when you could a telephoned jenny or walked across the square to the bank and got bayard you stood there and never opened your mouth did you yes narcissa answered stood there beside horace in the slow intent ring of country people watching the globe swelling and tugging at its ropes watched john sartoris in a faded flannel shirt and corduroy breeches while the carnival man explained the ripcord and the parachute to him stood there feeling her breath going out faster than she could draw it in and watched the thing lurch into the air with john sitting on a frail trapeze bar swingingbelow it with eyes she could not close saw the balloon and people and all swirl slowly upward and then found herself clinging to horace behind the shelter of a wagon trying to get her breath he landed three miles away in a brier thicket and disengaged the parachute and regained the road and hailed a passing negro in a wagon a mile from town they met old bayard driving furiously in the carriage and the two vehicles stopped side by side in the road while old bayard in the one exhausted the accumulate fury of his rage and in the other his grandson sat in his shredded clothes and on his scratched face that look of one who has gained for an instant a desire so fine that its escape was a purification not a loss the next day as narcissa was passing a store he emerged with that abrupt violence which he had in common with his brother pulling up short to avoid a collision with her oh exwhy hello he said beneath the crisscrosses of tape his face was merry and wild and his unruly hair was hatless for a moment she gazed at him with wide hopeless eyes then she clapped her hand to her mouth and went swiftly on almost running then he was gone with his brother shut away by that foreign war as two noisy dogs are penned in a kennel far away the bold jolly face of him and his rough shabby clothes miss jenny gave her news of them of the dull dutiful letters they wrote home at sparse intervals then he was dead but far away beyond seas and there was no body to be returned clumsily and tediously to earth and so to her he seemed still to be laughing at that word as he had laughed at all the other mouthsounds that stood for repose who had not waited for time and its furniture to teach him that the end of wisdom is to dreamhigh enough not to lose the dream in the seeking of it aunt sally rocked steadily in her chair well it dont matter which one it was ones bad as the other but i reckon it aint their fault raised like they were rotten spoiled both of em lucy sartoris wouldnt let anybody control em while she lived if theyd been mine now she rocked on beat it but of em i would raising two wild indians like that but those folks thinking there wasnt anybody quite as good as a sartoris even lucy cranston come from as good people as there are in the state acting like it was divine providence that let her marry one sartoris and be the mother of two more pride false pride she rocked steadily in her chair beneath narcissas hand the cat purred with lazy arrogance it was a judgment on em taking john instead of that other one john at least tipped his hat to a lady on the street but that other boy she rocked monotonously dapping her feet flatly against the floor you better stay away from that boy hell be killing you same as he did he did that wife of his at least give me benefit of clergy first aunt sally narcissa said beneath her hand beneath the cats sleek hide muscles flowed suddenly into tight knots like wire and the animals bodyseemed to elongate as it whipped from beneath her hand and flashed out of sight across the veranda oh narcissa said then she whirled and caught up aunt sallys stick and ran from the room what aunt sally said you bring my stick back here she said she sat staring at tie door hearing the swift clatter of the others heels in the hall and then on the veranda she rose and leaned in the window you bring my stick here she shouted narcissa sped across the veranda and to the ground in the canna bed the cat crouching jerked its head back and its yellow unwinking eyes narcissa rushed at it raising the stick put it down she cried drop it for another second the yellow eyes glared at her then the animal ducked its head and lept in a jong fluid bound the bird between its jaws ohhh damn you damn you youyou sartoris and she hurled the stick after the final tortoise flash as the cat whipped around the corner of the house you get my stick and bring it right back this minute aunt sally shouted through the window she had seen bayard once from a distance he appeared as usual at the timea lean figure in casual easy clothes unpressed and at little comfortably shabby and with his air of smoldering abrupt violence he and his brother had both had this but bayards was a cold arrogant sort of leashed violence while in john it was a warmer thing spontaneous and merry and wild it was bayard who had attached a rope to a ninetyfoot water tank and from the roof of the adjoining building swung himself across the intervening fifty yards of piled lumber and freight cars and released the rope and dived into a narrow concrete swimming pool while upturned faces gaped and screameda cold nicety of judgment and unnecessary cruel skill john who one county fair day made the balloon ascension the aeronaut having been stricken with ptomaine poisoning that the county people might not be disappointed and landed three miles away in a brier thicket losing most of his clothing and skin and returning to town cheerful and babbling in the wagon of a passing negro but both of these were utterly beyond her it was not in her nature to differentiate between motives whose results were the same and on occasions when she had seen them conducting themselves as civilized beings had been in the same polite room with them she found herself watching them with shrinking and fearful curiosity as she might have looked upon wild beasts with a temporary semblance of men and engaged in human activities morally acknowledging the security of the cage but spiritually unreassured but she had not seen them often they were either away at school or if at home they passed their headlong days in the country coming into town at rare intervals and then on horseback in stained corduroy and flannel shirts yet rumors of their doings came in to her from time to time causing always in her that shrinking fascinated distaste that blending of curiosity and dread as if a raw wind had blown into that garden wherein she dwelt then they would be gone again and she would think of them only to remember horace and his fine and electric delicacy and to thank her gods he was not as they then the war and she learned without any surprise whatever that they had gone to it that was exactly what they would do and her nature drowsed again beneath the serene belief that they had been removed from her life for good and always to her the war had been brought about for the sole purpose of removing them from her life as noisy dogs are shut up in a kennel afar off thus her days man became amphibious and lived in mud and filth and died and was buried in it the world looked on in hysterical amazement but she within her walled and windless garden thought of them only with a sober and pointless pity like a flowers exhalation and like the flower uncaring if the scent be sensed or not she gave clothing and money to funds and she knitted things also but she did not know where saloniki was and was incurious as to how rheims or przemysl were pronounced then horace departed with his snopes and the war became abruptly personal but it was still not the same war to which the sartoris boys had gone and soon she was readjusted again with aunt sally wyatt in the house and the steady unemphasis of their feminine days she joined the red cross and various other welfare organizations and she knitted harsh wool with intense brooding skill and performed other labors while other women talked of their menfolks into her grave receptivity there was a family of country people moved recently to towna young man and his pregnant wife and two infant children they abode in a rejuvenated rented cabin on the edge of town where the woman did her own houseworkwhile the man was employed by the local distributor for an oil company laboring all day with a sort of ager fury of willingness and a desire to get on he was a steady exemplary sort willing and unfailingly goodnatured and reliable so he was drafted immediately and denied exemption and ravished celeritously overseas his family accompanied him to the station in an automobile supplied by the charity of an old lady of the town and they watched him out of their lives with that tearless uncomplaining gravity of primitive creatures the red cross took charge of the family but narcissa benbow adopted them she was present when the baby was born two weeks later she superintended the householdmeals and clothinguntil the woman was about again and for the next twelvemonths she wrote a monthly letter to the husband and father who having no particular aptitude for it save his unflagging even temper and a ready willingness to do as he was told was now a company cook in the sos this occupation too was just a grave centering of her days there was no hysteria in it no conviction that she was helping to slay the biblical beast or laying up treasure in heaven horace was away too she was waiting for him to return marking time as it were then bayard sartoris had returned home with a wife she sensed the romantic glamor of this with interest and grave approval as of a dramatic scene but that was all bayard sartoris went away again narcissa met his wife now and then and always with a little curiosity as though voluntarily associating so intimately with a sartoris she too must be an animal with the temporary semblance of a human being there was no common ground between them between narcissa with her constancy her serenity which the other considered provincial and a little dull and the other with her sexless vivid unrepose and the brittle daring of her speech and actions she had learned of john sartoris death without any emotion whatever except a faint sense of vindication a sort of itoldyouso feeling which recurred blended now with a sense of pitying outrage blaming this too on bayard when bayards wife died in childbirth in october of the same year even though she stood with old bayards deaf and arrogant back and miss jennys trim indomitability amid sad trees and streaming marble shapes beneath a dissolving afternoon then november and bells and whistles and revolvers horace would be coming home soon now she thought at the time before christmas perhaps but before he did so she had seenbayard once on the street and later while she and miss jenny sat in miss jennys dim parlor one morning he came unexpectedly to the door and stood there looking at her with his bleak and brooding gaze its bayardmiss jenny said come in here and speak to narcissa sonny he said hello and she turned on the piano bench again with that feeling of curiosity and dread who is it he said and he came into the room bringing with him like a raw wind that cold leashed violence whichshe remembered its narcissa benbow miss jenny repeated testily go on and speak to her and stop acting like you dont know who sheis narcissa gave him her hand and he stood holding it but he was not looking at her she withdrew her hand and he glanced at her again then away and he loomed above them and stood rubbing his hand through his hair i want a drink he said i cant find the key to thedesk stop and talk to us a few minutes and you can haveone he stood for a moment above them thenhemoved abruptly and before miss jenny could speakhe had dragged the holland envelope from another chair let that alone you indian miss jenny exclaimed she rose here take my chair if youre too weak to stand up any longer ill be back in a minute she added to narcissa ill have to get my keys he sat laxly in thechair rubbing his hand through his hair his gaze brooding somewhere about hisbooted feet narcissa sat utterly quiet watching him with that blending of shrinking and fascination she said at last i am so sorry about john and your wife i asked miss jenny to tell you when she wrote he sat rubbing his head slowly in the brooding violence of his temporary repose you arent married yourself are you he asked she sat quietly watching him ought to try it he added everybody ought to get married once like everybody ought to go to one war miss jenny returned with the keys and he got his long abrupt body erect and left them after that day she called on miss jenny only when she was sure he was not at home it was a week before caspey returned home in the meantime young bayard had driven out from memphis in his car memphis was seventyfive miles away and the trip had taken an hour and forty minutes because some of the road was narrow clay country road the car was long and low and gray the fourcylinder engine had sixteen valves and eight sparkplugs and the people had guaranteed that it would run eighty miles an hour although there was a strip of paper pasted to the windshield to which he paid no attention whatever asking him in red letters not to do so for the first five hundred miles miss jenny was frankly interested she must get in and sit in it for a while and though simon affected to pay it but the briefest derogatory notice isom circled quietly about it with an utter and yearning admiration but old bayard just looked down at th long dusty thing from his chair on the veranda and grunted he would not descend to examine it even despite miss jennys insistence and he sat with his feet on the rail and watched bayard slide in under the wheel and drive slowly off with miss jenny beside him watched them glide noiselessly down the drive and saw the car pass out of sight down the valley presently above thetrees a cloud of dust rose into the azure afternoon and hung rosily in the sun and a sound as of leashed thunder died muttering behind it but this had no significance for him isom squatted below him on the steps it had no significance even when they returned in twenty minutes he did not even see the car until i had entered the gate and was swooping up the drive and came to a stop almost in its former tracks miss jenny had no hat and she was holding her hair in both hands and when the car stopped she sat for a moment so then she drew a long breath i wish i smoked cigarettes she said and then is thatas fast asitllgo how fer yall been miss jenny isom asked rising and circling the car again with his diffident yearning miss jenny opened the door and got out a little stiffly but her voice was clear as a girls and heeyes were shining and her dry old cheeks were flushed weve been to town she answered proudly town was fourmiles away after that the significance grew slowly he received intimations of it from various sources but because of his deafness these intimations came slowlysince they must come directly to him and not through overheard talk the actual evidence the convincing evidence came from old man falls eight or ten times a year he walked in from the county farm always stopping in at the bank twice a year old bayard bought him a complete outfit of clothing and on the other occasions he had always for him a present of tobacco and a small sack of peppermint candy of which the old fellow was inordinately fondhe would never take money old bayards office was also the directors room it was a large room containing a long table aligned with chairs and a tall cabinet in which blank banking forms were kept and old bayards rolltop desk and swivel chair and a sofa on which he napped occasionally in the hot afternoons his desk like the one at home was cluttered with an astonishing variety of objects which had no relation to the banking business whatever and the mantel above the fireplace bore yet more objects of an agricultural nature as well as a dusty assortment of pipes and three or four jars of tobacco which furnished solace for all the banking force and for a respectable portion of the banks pipesmoking clientele weather permitting old bayard spent most of the day sitting in a tilted chair in the bank door and when these patrons found him there they would pass on back to the office and fill their pipes it was a sort of unspoken convention not to take more than a pipeful at a time it was to this room that they would retire on old man falls visits and here they would sit they were both deaf and shout at one another for half an hour or so about john sartoris and crops you could hear them plainly from the street and through the wall of the store on either side old man fallseyes were blue and innocent as a boys and his first act after he and old bayard were seated was to open bayards parcel and take from it a plug of chewing tobaccocut off a chew and put it in his mouthy replace the plug and wrap and tie the parcel neatly again he never cut the string but always untied the tedious knot with his stiff gnarled fingers and he sat now in his clean faded overalls with the small parcel on his knees telling bayard about the automobile that had passed him that morning on the road everyone had seen or heard of young bayards low gray car but old man falls was the first to tell his grandfather how he drove it old bayard sat utterly still watching the other with his fierce old eyes until he had finished are you sure who it was he asked hit passed me too fast for me to tell whether they was anybody in hit atall or not i asked when i fetched town who twas seems like everybody knows how fast he runs hit except you old bayard sat quietly for a time he raised his voice byron the door opened quietly and the bookkeepersnopes entereda thin youngish man with hairyhands and covert close eyes that looked always asthough he were just blinking them though younever saw them closed yes sir colonel he said in a slow nasal voice without inflection phone out to my house and tell my grandson not to touch that car until i come home yes sir colonel and he was gone as silently as he entered old bayard slammed around in his swivel chair again and old man falls leaned forward peering at his face whats that ere wen you got on yo face bayard he asked what bayard demanded then he raised his hand to a small bump which the suffusion of his face had brought into white relief here i dont know what it is its been there about a week but i dont reckon its anything isit gittin bigger the other asked he rose and laid his parcel down and extended his hand old bayard drew his head away its nothing he repeated testily let it alone but old man falls put the others hand aside and touched the place with his fingers hm he said hards a rock hitll git bigger too ill watch hit and when hits right ill take hit off hit aint ripe yit the bookkeeper appeared suddenly and without noise beside them yo cook says him and miss jenny is off carridin somewheres i left yo message jennys with him you say thats what yo cook says the bookkeeper repeated in his inflectionless voice well allright the bookkeeper withdrew and old man falls picked up his parcel ill be gittin on too he said ill come in next week and take a look at hit you better let hit alone till i git back he followed the bookkeeper from the room and presently old bayard rose and stalked through the lobby and tilted his chair in the door again that afternoon when he arrived home the car was not in sight nor did his aunt answer his call he mounted to his room and put on his ridingboots and lit a cigar but when he looked down from his window into the back yard neither isom nor the saddled mare was visible he tramped down the stairs and on through the house and entered the kitchen and there caspey sat eating and talking to isom and elnora and one mo time me and another boy caspey was saying then isom saw bayard and rose from his seat in the woodbox corner and his eyesrolled whitely in his bullet head elnora paused also with her broom but caspey turned his head without rising and still chewing steadily he blinked his eyes at bayard in the door i sent you word a week ago to come on out here at once or not to come at all bayard said did you get it caspey mumbled something still chewing and old bayard came into the room get up from there and saddle my horse caspey turned his back deliberately and raised his glass of buttermilk from the table git on caspey elnora hissed at him i aint workin here he answered just beneath bayards deafness he turned to isom whynt you gon git his hoss fer him aint you workin here caspey fer lawds sake elnora implored yes suh cunnel hes gwine she said loudly who me caspey said does i look like it he raised the glass steadily to his mouth then bayard moved again and caspey lost his nerve and rose quickly before the other reached him and crossed the kitchen toward the doorbut with sullen insolence in the very shape of his back as he fumbled with the door bayard overtook him are you going to saddle that mare he demanded aint gwine skip it big boy caspey answered just below bayards deafness what oh lawd caspey elnora moaned isom crouched into his corner caspey raised his eyesswiftly to bayards face and opened the screen door i says i aint gwine skip it he repeated raising his voice simon stood at the foot of the steps the setter beside him gaping his toothless mouth up at them and old bayard reached a stick of stove wood from the box at his hand and knocked caspey through the door and down the steps at his fathers feet now you go saddle that mare he said simon helped his son to rise and led him a little unsteadily toward the barn and out of earshot while the setter watched them gravely interested i kep tellin you dem newfangled war notions of yon want gwine ter work on dis place he said angrily and you better thank de lawd fer makin yo haid hard ez it is you gon and git dat mare en save dat nigger freedom talk fer townfolks dey mought stomach it whut us niggers want ter be free fer anyhow aint we got ez many white folks now ez we kin suppot that night at supper old bayard looked at his grandson across the roast of mutton will falls told me you passed him on the poor house hill running forty miles an hour today forty fiddlesticks miss jenny said promptly it was fiftyfour i was watching thewhat do you call it bayard speedometer old bayard sat with his head bent a little watching his hands trembling on the carving knife and fork hearing beneath the napkin tucked into his waistcoat his heart a little too light and a little too fast feeling miss jennys eyes upon him bayard she said sharply whats that on your face he rose so suddenly at his place that his chairtipped over backward with a crash and ee tramped blindly from the room with his trembling hands and the light swift thudding of his heart i know what you want me to do miss jenny told old bayard across her newspaper you want me to let my housekeeping go to the dogs and spend all my time in that car thats what you want well im not going to do it i dont mind riding with him now and then but ive got too much to do with my time to spend it keeping him from raining that car fast neck too she added she rattled the paper crisply she said besides you aint foolish enough to believe hell drive slow just because theres somebody with him are you if you do think so youd better send simon along lord knows simon can spare the time since you quit using the carriage if he does anything at all i dont know it she read the paper again old bayards cigar smoked in his fingers i might send isom he said miss jennys paper rattled sharply and she stared at her nephew for a long moment god in heaven man why dont you put a block and chain on him and have done with it well didnt you suggest sending simon with him yourself simon has his work to do but all isom ever does is saddle my horse once a day and i can do that myself i was trying to be ironical miss jenny said god knows i should have learned better by this time but if youve got to invent something new for the niggers to do you let it be simon i need isom to keep a roof over your head and food on the table she rattled the paper why dont you come right out and tell him not to drive fast a man that has to spend eight hours a day sitting in a chair in that bank door ought not to have to spend the rest of the afternoon helling around the country in an automobile if he dont want to do you think it would do any good to ask him there was never a damned one of em ever paid any attention to my wishes yet ask the devil miss jenny said who said anything about ask tell him not to tell him that if you hear again of his going fast in it that youll frail the life out of him i believe anyway that you like to ride in that car only you wont admit it and you just dont want him to ride in it when you cant go too but old bayard had slammed his feet to the floor and risen and he tramped heavily from the room instead of mounting the stairs however miss jenny heard his footsteps the away down the hall and presently she rose and followed to the back porch where he stood in the darkness there the night was dark myriad with drifting odors of the spring and with insects dark against lesser dark the barn loomed upon the sky he hasnt come yet she said impatiently touching his arm i could have told you go on up and go to bed now dont you know hell let you know when he comes in youre going to think him into a ditch somewhere with these fool notions of yours then more gently youre too childish about that car its no more dangerous at night than it is in daylight come on now he shook her hand off but he turned obediently and entered the house this time he mounted the stairs and she could hear him in his bedroom thumping about presently he ceased slamming doors and drawers and lay beneath the reading lamp with his dumas and he lay reading quietly after a time the door opened and young bayard entered and came into the radius of the light with his bleak eyes his grandfather did not remark his presence and he touched old bayards arm then old bayard looked up and when he did so young bayard turned and quitted the room after the shades on the windows were drawn at three oclock old bayard retired to his office to wait until his grandson came for him in the front of the bank the cashier and the bookkeeper could hear him clattering and banging around the cashier paused a stack of silver clipped neatly in his fingers hear im he said something on his mind here lately used to be he was quiet as a mouse back there until they come for him but last few weeks he tramples and thumps around back there like he was fighting hornets the bookkeeper said nothing the cashier set the stack of silver aside built up another one something on his mind lately that examiner must a put a bug in his ear i reckon the bookkeeper said nothing he swung the adding machine to his desk and clicked the lever over in the back room old bayard moved audibly about the cashier stacked the remaining silver neatly and rolled a cigarette the bookkeeper bent above the steady clicking of the adding machine and the cashier sealed his cigarette and lit it and waddled to the window and lifted the curtain simons brought the carriage today he said that boy finally wrecked that car i reckon better call colonel the bookkeeper slid from his stool and went to the door to the office and opened it old bayard glanced up from his desk all right byron he said the bookkeeper turned away old bayard stalked through the bank and opened the street door and stopped utterly the door knob in his hand wheres bayard he said he aint comin simon answered old bayard crossed the pavement what where is he he en isom off somewhar in dat cyar simon answered lawd knows whar dey is by now takin dat boy away fum his work in de middle of de day cyarridin after all de time i spent tryin to git some sense inter isoms haid simon continued cyarridin he said cyarridin old bayard got in the carriage ill be damned old bayard said if i havent got the triflingest set of foils to make a living for in the whole damn world theres just one tiling about it when i finally have to go to the poor house every damned one of youll be there when i come now here you quoilin too simon said miss jenny shoutin at me twell i wuz thru de gate and now you already started at dis end but ef mr bayard dont leave dat boy alone he aint gwine to be no bettern a town nigger spite of all i kin do jennys already ruined him old bayard said bayard cant hurt him much you sho tole de troof den simon agreed he gathered up the reins come up dar here hold up a minute simon old bayard said simon reined the horses back whut you want now old bayard drew another long breath go back to my office and get me a cigar out of that jar on the mantel two days later as he and simon tooled sedately homeward through the afternoon simultaneously almost with the warning thunder of it the car burst upon them on a curve slewed into the ditch and into the road again and rushed on and in the flashing instant he and simon saw the whites of isoms eyes and the ivory cropping of his teeth behind the steering wheel when the car returned home that afternoon simon conducted isom to the barn and whipped him with a harness strap that night they sat in the office after supper old bayard held his cigar unlighted in his fingers miss jenny was immersed in her paper suddenly old bayard said maybe hell get tired of it after a while miss jenny raised her head and when he does miss jenny said dont you know what hell get then when he finds that car wont go fast enough fo him she demanded staring at him across her newspaper he sat holding his cigar his head bent a little hell buy an aeroplane miss jenny told him she rattled the paper and turned a page he ought to have a wife she added in a detached voice reading again let him get a son then he can break his neck as soon and as often as he pleases providence doesnt seem to have any judgment at all she said thinking of the two of them of his dead brother she said but lord knows id hate to see any girl i was fond of married to him she rattled the paper again turning anotherpage i dont know what else you expect from him from any sartoris you dont waste your afternoons riding in that car because you think itll keep him from turning it over you go because when it does happen you want to be in it too so do you think youve got any more consideration for folks than he has he sat holding his cigar his face still averted miss jenny was watching him again across her paper im coming down town in the morning and were going and have the doctor look at that bump on your face you hear in his room as he removed his collar and tie before the chest of drawers his eye fell upon the pipe which he had laid there four weeks ago and he put the collar and tie down and picked up the pipe and held it in his hand rubbing the charred bowl slowly with his thumb then with sudden decision he quitted the room and tramped down the hall at the end of the hall a stair mounted into the darkness at the foot he fumbled a light switch and followed the cramped turnings cautiously in the dark to a door set at a difficult angle and opened it upon a broad low room with a pitched ceiling smelling of dust and silence and ancient disused things the room was cluttered with indiscriminate furniturechairs and sofas like patient ghosts holding lightly in dry and rigid embrace yet other ghostsa fitting place for dead sartorises to gather and speak among themselves of glamorous and old disastrous days the unshaded light swung on a single cord from the center of the ceiling he unknotted it and drew it to its full length and carried it across to a nail in the wall above a cedar chest he fastened it here and drew a chair across to the chest and sat down the chest had not been opened since whenhis son john had succumbed to yellow fever and an old spanish bulletwound there had been two occasions since in july and in october of last year but the other grandson still possessed quickness and all the incalculable portent of his heritage so he had forborne for the time being expecting to kill two birds with one stone as it were thus each opening was in a way ceremonial commemorating the violent finis to some phase of his familys history and while he struggled with the stiff lock it seemed to him that a legion of ghosts breathed quietly at his shoulder and he pictured a double line of them with their arrogant identical faces waiting just beyond a portal and stretchingaway toward the invisible dais where something sat waiting the latest arrival among them thought of them chafing a little and a little bewildered thought and desire being denied them in a place where immortal there were no opportunities for vainglorious swashbuckling denied that sartoris heaven in which they could spend eternity dying deaths of needless and magnificent violence while spectators doomed to immortality looked eternally on the valhalla which john sartoris turning the wine glass in his big wellshaped hand that night at the supper table had seen in its chaste and fragile bubble the lock gave at last and he raised the lid the ghosts fell away and from the chest there rose a thin exhilarating odor of cedar and something else a scent drily and muskily nostalgic as of old ashes and his hands wellshaped but not so large and a shade less capable than his fathers rested for a moment upon a brocade garment the brocade was richly hushed and the fall of fine mechlin was dustily yellow pale and textureless as winter sunlight he raised the garment carefully the lace cascaded mellow andpale as spilled wine upon his hands and he laid it aside and lifted out next a rapier it was a toledo a blade delicate and fine as the prolonged stroke of a violin bow in a velvet sheath the sheath was elegant and flamboyant and soiled and the seams had cracked drily old bayard held the rapier upon his hands for a while feeling the balance of it it was just such an implement as a sartoris would consider the proper equipment for raising tobacco in a virgin wilderness it and the scarlet heels and the ruffled wristbands in which he fought his stealthy and simple neighbors and old bayard held it upon his two hands seeing in its stained fine blade and shabby elegant sheath the symbol of his race that too in the tradition the thing itself fine and clear enough only the instrument had become a little tarnished in its very aptitude for shaping circumstance to its arrogant ends he laid it aside next came a heavy cavalry sabre and a rosewood box containing two dueling pistols with silver mountings and with the lean deceptive delicacy of race horses and what old man falls had called that ere dang dernger it was a stubby evillooking thing with its three barrels viciously and coldly utilitarian and between the other two weapons it lay like a cold and deadly insect between two flowers he lifted out next the blue army foragecap of the forties and a small pottery vessel and a mexican machete and a longnecked oil can such as locomotive drivers use it was of silver and engraved upon it surrounded by a carven ornate wreath was the picture of a locomotive with a huge bellshaped funnel beneath it the name virginia and the date august he laid these aside and with sudden purposefulnesshe removed the other objectsa frogged and braided coat of confederate grey and a gown of sprigged muslin scented faintly of lavender and evocative of old formal minuets and drifting honeysuckle among steady candle flamesand came upon a conglomeration of yellowed papers neatly bound in packets and at last upon a huge brassbound bible he raised this to the edge of the chest and opened it the paper was brown and mellow with years and it had a texture like that of slightlymoist wood ashes as though each page were held intact by its archaic and fading print lie turned the pages carefully back to the fly leaves beginning near the bottom of the final blank page a column of names and dates rose in stark fading simplicity growing fainter and fainter where time had lain upon them at the top they were still legible as they were at the foot of the preceding page but halfway up this page they ceased and from there on the sheet was blank save for the faint soft mottlings of time and an occasional brownish penstroke significant but without meaning bayard sat for a long time regarding the stark dissolving apotheosis of his name sartorises had derided time but time was not vindictive because it was longer than sartorises and probably unaware of them but it was a good gesture anyway and he recalled his fathers words in the nineteenth century john sartoris had said chording over genealogy anywhere is poppycock but particularly so in america where only what a man takes and keeps has any significance and where all of lis have a common ancestry and the only house from which we can claim descent with any assurance is the old bailey yet the man who professes to care nothing about his forbears is only a little lessvain than he who bases all his actions on blood precedent and a sartoris is entitled to a little vanity and poppycock if he wants it yes it was a good gesture and bayard sat and mused quietly on the tense he had unwittingly used was fatality again the augury of a mans destiny peeping out at him from the roadside hedge if he but recognize it and as he sat and gazed with blind eyes at the page time rolled back again and again he ran panting through undergrowth while a yankee cavalry patrol crashed behind him crashed fainter and fainter until he crouched with spent laboring lungs in a bramble thicket and heard their fading thunder along a dim wagon road then he crawled forth again and went to a spring he knew that flowed from the roots of a beech tree and as he leaned his mouth to it the final light of day was reflected onto his face bringing into sharp relief forehead and nose above the cavernous sockets of his eyes and the panting animal snarl of his teeth and from the still water there stared back at him for a sudden moment a skull the unturned corners of mans destiny well heaven that crowded place lay just beyond one of them they claimed heaven filled with every mans illusion of himself and with the conflicting illusions of him that parade through the minds of other illusionshe stirred again and sighed quietly and took out his fountain pen at the bottom of the column he wrote john sartoris july and beneath that caroline white sartoris and son october when the ink was dry he closed the book and replaced it and took the pipe from his pocket and putit in the rosewood box with the dueling pistols and the derringer and replaced the other things and closed the chest and locked it again young bayard drove her to town the next morning old bayard sat tilted in his chair in the door and he looked up at her with a fine assumption of surprise and his deafness seemed more pronounced than ordinary but she got him out of his chair with cold implacability and led him still grumbling along the street where merchants and loungers before the stores spoke to her as to a martial queen old bayard stalking along beside her with laggard reluctance like that of a small boy but she carriedhim firmly on and at a row of dingy signs tackedflatto the wall she turned and mounted a narrow stairway debouching between two stores at the top was a dark corridor with doors the nearest door was of pine its gray paint scarred at the bottom as though it had been kicked repeatedly by feet that struck it at the same height and with the same force in the door itself near the edge two holes an inch apart bore mute witness to the missing hasp and from a staple in the jamb depended the hasp itself fixed there by a huge rusty lock of a pattern which had not been manufactured in twenty years bayard offered to stop here but miss jenny led him firmly on to the second door across the hall this door was freshly painted and grained to represent walnut into the top half of it was let a pane of thick opaque glass bearing a name in raised gilt letters and two embracing office hours miss jenny opened this door and bayard followed her into a small cubbyhole of a room of spartan but suave asepsis the walls were an immaculate new gray with an engraved reproduction of a corot and two spidery drypoints in narrow frames and it contained a new rug in warm buff tones and a bare table and four chairs in fumed oakall impersonal and clean and inexpensive but revealing at a glance the proprietors soul a soul hampered now by material strictures but destined and determined to someday function in its proper surroundingsthat of persian rugs and mahogany or teak and a single irreproachable print on the chaste wall a young woman in a starched white dress rose from a smaller table in one corner patting her hair good morning myrtle miss jenny said tell dr alford wed like to see him please you have an appointment the girl said in a voice without any inflection at all well make one now then miss jenny replied you dont mean to say dr alford dont come to work before ten oclock do you dr alford dontdoesnt see anyone without an appointment the girl parroted gazing at a point above their heads if you have no appointment youll have to have an ap tut tut miss jenny interrupted briskly you run and tell dr alford that colonel sartoris wants to see him theres a good girl yessum miss jenny the girl said obediently and she crossed the room but at the further door she paused again and again her voice became parrotlike wont you sit down ill see if the doctor is engaged you go and tell dr alford were here miss jenny repeated affably tell him ive got some shopping to do this morning yessum miss jenny the girl agreed and disappeared and after a dignified interval she returned once more clothed faultlessly in her professional manner the doctor will see you now come in please she said holding the door open and standing aside thank you honey miss jenny replied is your mamma still in bed nom shes sitting up now thank you thats good miss jenny agreed come on bayard this room was smaller than the other and brutally carbolized there was a white enameled cabinet filled with vicious nickel gleams and a metal operating table and an array of electric furnaces and ovens and sterilizers when they entered the doctor in a linen jacket bent above a small desk and for a while he proffered them his sleek oblivious profile thenhe glanced up and rose he was in the youthful indeterminate thirties a newcomer to the town and nephew of an old resident he had made a fine record in medical school and was of a personable exterior but there was a sort of preoccupied dignity a sort of erudite and cold unillusion regarding mankind about him that precluded the easy intimacy of the small town and caused even those who remembered his visits during his boyhood to his aunt and uncle to address him as doctor or mister he had a small moustache and a face like a reposeful maska comforting face but cold and while bayard sat restively his dry scrubbed fingers probed delicately at the wen on the others face miss jenny asked him a question but he continued his delicate exploration raptly as though he had not heard as though she had not even spoken inserting a small electric bulb which he first sterilized into bayards mouth and snapping its ruby glow on and off withinhis cheek then he removed it and sterilized it again and returned it to the cabinet well miss jenny said impatiently the doctor shut the cabinet deliberately and dried his hands and came and stood over them and with his thumbs hooked in his jacket pockets he became solemnly and unctuously technical rolling the harsh words from his tongue with an epicurean deliberation it should be taken out at once he finished it doesnt pain him now and that is the reason i advise an immediate operation you mean it might develop into cancer miss jenny asked no question about it at all course of time neglect it and i can promise you nothing have it out now and he need never worry about it he looked at bayard again with lingering and chill contemplation it will be very simple i will remove it as easily as that and he made a short gesture with his hand whats that bayard demanded i say i can remove that growth so easily you wont know it colonel sartoris ill be damned if you do bayard rose with one of his characteristic plunging movements sit down bayard miss jenny ordered nobodys going to cut on you without your knowing it should it be done right away she asked yes maam i wouldnt have that thing on my face overnight otherwise it is only fair to warn you that i cannot assume responsibility for iti could remove it in two minutes he added looking at bayards face again with cold speculation then he half turned his head and stopped in a listening attitude and beyond the thin walls a voice in the other room boomed in rich rolling waves mawnin sister it said didnt i hear bayardsartoris cussin in here the doctor and miss jenny held their arrested attitudes then the door surged open and the fattest man in yocona county filled it he wore a shiny alpaca coat over waistcoat and trousers of baggy impressed black broadcloth above a plaited shirt the fatty rolls of his neck practically hid his low collar and a black string tie his roman senators head was covered with a vigorous curling of silvery hair what the devils the matter with you he boomed then he sidled into the room filling it completely dwarfing its occupants and its furnishings this was doctor lucius quintus peabody eightyseven year old and weighing three hundred and ten pounds and possessing a digestive tract like that of a horse he had practiced medicine in yocona county when a doctors equipment consisted of a saw and a gallon of whisky and a satchel of calomel he had been john sartoris regimental surgeon and up to the day of the automobile he would start out at any hour of the twentyfour in any weather and for any distance over practically impassable roads in a lopsided buckboard to visit anyone white or black who sent for him accepting for fee usually a meal of corn pone and coffee or perhaps a small measure of corn or fruit or a few flower bulbs or graftings when he was young and hasty he had kept a daybook kept it meticulously until these hypothetical assets totaled but that was forty years ago and since then he hadnt bothered with a record at all and now from time to time a countryman enters his shabby office and discharges an obligation commemorating sometimes the payors entry into the world incurred by his father or grandfather an which dr peabody himself had long since forgotten about everyone in the county knew him and it wassaid that he could spend the balance of his days driving about the county in the backboard he still used with never a thought for board and lodging and without the expenditure of a penny for either he filled the room with his bluff and homely humanity and as he crossed the floor and patted miss jennys back with one flaillike hand the whole building trembled to his tread mawnin jenny he said havin bayard measured for insurance this damn butcher wants to cut on me bayard said querulously you come on and make em let me alone loosh ten ams mighty early in the day to start carvin white folksdr peabody boomed niggers different chop up a nigger any time after midnight whats the matter with him son he asked of dr alford dont believe its anything but a wart miss jenny said but im tired of looking at it its no wartdr alford corrected stiffly he recapitulated his diagnosis in technical terms while dr peabody enveloped them all in the rubicund benevolence of his presence sounds pretty bad dont it he agreed and he shook the floor again and pushed bayard firmly into the chair again with one huge hand and with the other he dragged his face up to the light then he dug a pair of ironbowed spectacles from the side pocket of his coat and examined bayards wen through them think it ought to come off do you i dodr alford answered coldly i think it is imperative that it be removed unnecessary there cancer folks got along with cancer a long time beforethey invented knivesdr peabody said drily hold still bayard and people like you are one of the reasons was on the tip of the younger mans tongue but he forbore and said instead i can remove that growth in two minutes colonel sartoris damned if you do bayard rejoined violently trying to rise get away loosh sit stilldr peabody said equably holding him down while he probed at the wen does it hurt any no i never said it did and ill be damned youll probably be damned anywaydr peabody told him youd be about as well off dead anyhow i dont know anybody that gets less fun out of living than you seem to you told the truth for once miss jenny agreed hes the oldest person i ever knew in my life and sodr peabody continued blandly i wouldntworry about it let it stay there nobody cares what your face looks like if you were a young fellow now out sparkin the gals every night if dr peabody is permitted to interfere with impunity the younger man began will falls says he can cure it bayard said with that salve of hisdr peabody asked salvedr alford repeated colonel sartoris if you let any quack that comes along treat that growth with homemade or patent remedies youll be dead in six months dr peabody even will bear me out he added with fine irony i dont knowdr peabody replied slowly will has done some curious things with that salve of his i must protest against thisdr alford said mrs du pre i protest against a member of my profession sanctioning even negatively such a practice pshaw boydr peabody answered we aint goin to let will put his dope on bayards wart its all right for niggers and livestock but bayard dont need it well just let this thing alone long as it dont hurt him if that growth is not removed immediately i wash my hands of all responsibilitydr alford stated to neglect it will be as fatal as mr falls salve mrs du pre i ask you to witness that this consultation has taken this unethical turn through no fault of mine and over my protest pshaw boydr peabody said again this aint hardly worth the trouble of cuttin out well save you an arm or a leg as soon as that fool grandson of his turns that automobile over with em come on bayard mrs du predr alford essayed bayard can come back if he wants todr peabody patted the younger mans shoulder with his heavy hand im going to take him to my office and talk to him a while jenny can bring him back if she wants to come on bayard and he led bayard from the room miss jenny rose also that loosh peabody is as big a fogy as old will falls she said old people just fret me to death you wait ill bring him right back here and well finish this businessdr alford held the door open for her and she sailed in a stiff silkclad rage from the room and followed her nephew and dr peabody across the corridor and through the scarred door with its rusty lock and into a room resembling a miniature cyclonic devastation mellowed peacefully over with dust ancient and long undisturbed you loosh peabody miss jenny said sit down jennydr peabody told her and be quiet unfasten your shirt bayard what bayard said belligerently the other thrust him into a chair want to see your chest he explained he crossed to an ancient rolltop desk and rummaged through the dusty litter which it bore there was litter and dust everywhere in the huge room its four windows gave upon the square but the elms and mulberry trees ranged along the sides of the square shaded these firstfloor offices so that light entered them but it was tempered like light which has passed through water in the corners of the ceiling were spider webs thick and heavy as spanish moss and dingy as gray lace and the oncewhite walls were an even and unemphatic drab save for a paler rectangle here and there where an outdated calendar had hung and been removed besides the desk the room contained three or four huge chairs with broken springs and a rusty stove in a sawdustfilled box and a leather sofa holding mutely in its worn surface dr peabodys recumbent shape beside it arid slowly gathering successive lasers of dust was a stack of lurid papercovered nickel novels this was dr peabodys library and on this sofa he passed his office hours reading them over and over other books there were none but the waste basket beside the desk and the desk itself and the mantel above the trashfilled fireplace and the window ledges too were cluttered with circular mail matter and mailorder catalogues and government bulletins of all kinds in one corner on an upended packingbox sat a water cooler of stained oxidized glass in another corner leaned a clump of cane fishing poles warping slowly of their own weight and on every horizontal surface rested a collection of objects not to be found outside of a secondhand storeold garments bottles a kerosenelamp a wooden box of tins of axle grease lacking one a clock in the shape of a bland china morningglory supported by four garlanded maidens who had suffered sundry astonishing anatomical mischances and here and there among their dusty indiscrimination various instruments pertaining to the occupants profession it was one of these that dr peabody sought now in the littered desk on which sat a framed photograph of his son and though miss jenny said again you loosh peabody you listen to me he continued to seek it with undisturbed equanimity you fasten your clothes and well go back to that doctor miss jenny said to her nephew neither you nor i can waste any more time with a doddering old fool sit down jennydr peabody repeated and he drew out a drawer and removed from it a box of cigars and a handful of faded artificial trout flies and a soiled collar and lastly a stethoscope then he tumbled the other things back into the drawer and shut it with his knee miss jenny sat trim and outraged fuming while he listened to bayards heart well she snapped does it tell you how to take that wart off his face will falls didnt need any telephone to find that out it tells more than thatdr peabody answered it tells how bayardll get rid of all his troubles if he keeps on riding in that hellions automobile fiddlesticks miss jenny said bayards a good driver i never rode with a better one itll take moren a good driver to keep thishe tapped bayards chest with his blunt fingergoin time that boy whirls that tiling around another curve or two like ive seen him do did you ever hear of a sartoris dying from a natural cause like anybody else miss jenny demanded dont you know that heart aint going to take bayard off before his time you get up from there and come on with me she added to her nephew bayard buttoned his shirt and dr peabody sat onthe sofa and watched him quietly bayard he said suddenly why dont you stay out of that damn thing what if you dont keep out of that car you aint goin to need me nor will falls nor that boy in yonder with all his handboiled saws and razors neither what business is it of yours bayard demanded by god cant i break my neck in peace if i want to he rose he was trembling again fumbling at his waistcoat buttons and miss jenny rose also and made to button it for him but he put her roughly aside dr peabody sat quietly thumping his fat fingers on one fat knee i have already outlived my time bayard continued more mildly i am the first sartoris there is any record of who saw sixty years i reckon old marster is keeping me for a reliable witness to the extinction of my race now miss jenny said icily youve made your speech and loosh peabody has wasted the morning for you so i reckon we can leave now and let loosh go out and doctor mules for a while and you can sit around the rest of the day being a sartoris and feeling sorry for yourself good morning loosh make him let that place alone jennydr peabody said aint you and will falls going to cure it for him you keep him from letting will falls put anything on itdr peabody repeated equably its all right just let it alone were going to a doctor thats what were going to do miss jenny replied come on here when the door had closed he sat motionless and heard them quarrelling beyond it then the sound of their voices moved down the corridor toward the stairs and still quarrelling loudly and on bayards part with profane emphasis the voices died away then dr peabody lay back on the sofa shaped already to the bulk of him and with random deliberation he reached a nickel thriller from the stack at the head of the couch as they neared the bank narcissa benbow came along from the opposite direction and they met at the door old bayard liked her liked to rally her in a ponderously gallant way on imaginary affairs of the heart and she had for him a diffident sort of affection and she stopped in her pale print dress and shouted her grave voice into his deafness and when he took his tilted chair again miss jenny followed her into the bank and to the window there was no one behind the grille at the moment save the bookkeeper he glanced briefly and covertly over his shoulder at them then slid from his stool and crossed to the window with his surreptitious tread but without raising his eyes again he took narcissas check and while she listened to miss jennys recapitulation of bayards and loosh peabodys stubborn masculine stupidity she remarked beneath the brim of her hat his forearms from which the sleeves had been turned back and the fine reddish hair which clothed them down to the second joints of his fingers and while miss jennyceased momentarily to nurse her sense of helpless outrage she remarked with a faint distinct distaste and a little curiosity since it was not particularly warm today the fact that his arms and hands were beaded with perspiration but this was not long in her consciousness and she took the notes he pushed under the grille to her and opened her bag from its blue satin maw the corner of an envelope and some of its superscription peeped suddenly but she crumpled it quickly from sight and put the money in and closed the bag before miss jenny had seen they turned away at the door she paused again clothed in her still and untarnished aura and stood for a moment while old bayard made her a heavy and involved compliment upon her appearance then she went on surrounded by her grave tranquility like a visible presence or an odor or a sound as long as she was in sight at the door the bookkeeper stood where she had left him his head was bent and his hand made a series of neat meaningless figures on the pad beneath it until she moved again and went on out of sight then he moved and in doing so he found that the pad had adhered to his sweating wrist so that when he removed his arm it came away also then its own weight freed it and it dropped to the floor he finished the forenoon stooped on his high stool at his high desk beneath the greenshaded light penning his neat figures into ledgers and writing words into them in the flowing spencerian hand he had been taught in a memphis business college at times he slid from the stool and crossed to the window with his covert evasive eyes and served a client then returned to his stool and picked up his pen the cashier a rotund man with bristling hair and lappingjowls like a berkshire hog returned presently accompanied by a director who followed him inside the grille they ordered cocacolas from a neighboring drug store by telephone and stood talking until the refreshment arrived by negro boy snopes had been included and he descended again and took his glass the other two sipped theirs he spooned the ice from his into a spittoon and emptied it at a draught and replaced the glass on the tray and spoke a general and ignored thanks in his sober country idiom and returned to his desk noon came old bayard rose crashing from his tilted chair and stalked back to his office where he would eat his frugal cold lunch and then sleep for an hour and banged the door behind him the cashier took his hat and departed also for an hour snopes would have the bank to himself outside the square lay motionless beneath noon the dinnerward exodus of lawyers and merchants and clerks did not disturb its atmosphere of abiding and timeless fixation in the elms surrounding the courthouse no leaf stirred in the may sunlight across the bank windows an occasional shadow passed but none turned into the door and presently the square was motionless as a theatre drop snopes drew a sheet of paper from a drawer and laid it beneath the light and wrote slowly upon it pausing at intervals drawing his pen through a sentence or a word writing again someone entered without looking up he slid the paper beneath a ledger crossed to the window and served the customer returned and wrote again the clock on the wall ticked into the silence and into the slow mouselike scratching of the pen the pen ceased at last but the clock ticked on like a measured dropping of small shot he reread the firstdraught slowly then he drew out a second sheet and made a careful copy when this was done he reread it also comparing the two then he folded the copy again until it was a small square thickness and stowed it awayin the fobpocket of his trousers the original he carried across to the cuspidor and holding it above the receptacle he struck a match to it and held it in his fingers until the final moment then he dropped it into the spittoon and when it was completely consumed he crushed the charred thing to powder quarter to one he returned to his stool and opened his ledgers again at one the cashier with a toothpick appeared at the door talking to someone then he entered and went to old bayards office and opened the door one oclock colonel he shouted into the room and old bayards heels thumped heavily on the floor as the snopes took his hat and emerged from the grille old bayard stalked forth again and tramped on ahead and took the tilted chair in the doorway there is in jefferson a boarding house known as the beard hotel it is a rectangular frame building with a double veranda just off the square and it is conducted theoretically by a countryman but in reality by his wife beard is a mild bleached man of indeterminate age and of less than medium size dressed always in a collarless shirt and a black evil pipe he also owns the grist mill near the square and he may be found either at the mill or on the outskirts of the checkergame in the courthouse yard or sitting in his stocking feet on the veranda of hishostelry he is supposed to suffer from some obscure ailment puzzling to physicians which prevents him exerting himself physically his wife is a woman in a soiledapron with straggling damp grayish hair and an air of spent but indomitable capability they have one son a pale quiet boy of twelve or so who is always on the monthly honor roll at school he may be seen on spring mornings schoolward bound with a bouquet of flowers his rating among his contemporaries is not high men only patronize the beard hotel itinerant horse and cattletraders countrymen in town overnight during court or the holiday season or arrested perhaps by inclement weather stop there and juries during court weektwelve good men and true marching in or out in column of twos or aligned in chairs and spitting across the veranda rail with solemn and awesome decorum and two of the town young bloods keep a room there in which it is rumored dice and cards progress sundays and drinking is done but no women if a skirt other than mrs beards gray apron so much as flashes in the vicinity of its celibate portals the city fathers investigate immediately and woe to the peripatetic semiramis if she be run to earth here in company with a number of other bachelorsclerks mechanics and such the bookkeeper snopes lives and here he repaired when the bank day was finished the afternoon was a replica of the morning then at three oclock the green shades were drawn upon door and windows and snopes and the cashier went about striking a daily balance at young bayard arrived in his car and old bayard stalked forth and got in it and was driven away presently thereafter the janitor an ancient practically incapacitated negro called doctor jones came in and doddered futilely with a broom by he was done and the cashier locked the vault and switchedon the light above it and he and the bookkeeper emerged and locked the front door and the cashier shook it experimentally snopes crossed the square and passed through the courthouse and entered a street it was a tawdry street lined with shabby and odorous stores into one of these he turned this was a restaurant a concretefloored space bounded by a wooden counter polished by eating elbows and lined with a row of backless and excruciating stools it was owned and operated by a cousin snopes and here he purchased fifteen centsworth of gaudy stale candy he recrossed the square and entered the beard hotel the hall was empty it smelled of damp harsh soap and its linoleum floor covering gleamed still wet from the rear came the unmistakable sounds of mrs beards ceaseless and savage activity and he followed these sounds and she ceased mopping and looked across her gray shoulder at him sweeping her lank hair aside with a reddened forearm evening miz beard he said virgil come home yet he was through here a minute ago she answered if he aint out front i reckon he aint fur you got some mo work ferhim yessum you dont know whichaway he went call him in the back yard he dont usually go fur away she dragged her dank hair aside again shaped long to labor her muscles were restive under inaction she grasped the mop again he thanked her and went on and stood on the kitchen steps above a yard barren of grass and containing a chicken pen also grassless in which a few fowls huddled or moved about in forlorn distraction in the dust on one hand was a small kitchen gardenin orderly tended rows in the corner of the fence was an outhouse of some sort of weathered boards virgil he called the yard was desolate with ghosts ghosts of discouraged weeds of food in the shape of tin cans broken boxes and barrels a pile of stove wood and a chopping block across which lay an axe whose helve had been mended with rusty wire amateurishly wound presently he descended into it and the chickens remarked him and raised a discordant clamor anticipating food doubtless virgil sparrows found sustenance of some sort in the dust among the fowls but the fowls perhaps with a foreknowledge of doom huddled back and forth along the wire discordant and distracted watching him with predatory importunate eyes he was about to turn and reenter the kitchen when the boy appeared silently and innocently from the outhouse with his strawcolored hair and his bland eyes his mouth was pale and almost sweet but secretive at the corners his chin was negligible hi mr snopes you calling me yes if you aint doin anything special snopes answered and they reentered the house and passed the room where the boys mother labored with drab fury and mounted a stairs carpeted too with linoleum fastened to each step by a treacherous sheetiron strip treated to resemble brass and scuffed and scarred by tired or careless feet snopes room contained a bed a chair a dressing table and a washstand with a slopjar beside it the floor was covered with straw matting frayed in places the single light hung unshaded from a greenishbrown cord upon the wall above the paperfilled fireplace a framed lithograph of an indian maiden in immaculate buckskin leaned her naked bosom above a formal moonlit pool of italian marble she held a guitar and a rose and dusty sparrows sat on the window ledge and watched them brightly through the dusty screen the boy entered politely nevertheless his pale eyes took in the room and its contents at a comprehensive glance he said that air gun aint come yet has it mr snopes no it aint snopes answered itll be here soon though you ordered off after it a long time now thats right but itll be here soon maybe they havent got one in stock right now he crossed to the dresser and took from a drawer a few sheets of foolscap and laid them on the dresser top and drew the chair up and dragged his suitcase from beneath the bed and set it in the chair then he took a fountain pen from his pocket and uncapped it and laid it beside the paper it ought to be here any day now the boy seated himself on the suitcase and took up the pen they got em at watts hardware store he suggested if the one we ordered dont come soon well git one there snopes said when did we order it anyway week ago tuesday the boy answered glibly i wrote it down well itllbe here soon you ready the boy squared himself before the paper yes sir snopes took a folded paper from the top pocket of his trousers and spread it open code number fortyeight mister joe butler saint louis missouri he read then he leaned over the boys shoulder watching the pen thats right up close to the top he commended now the boy dropped down the page about two inches and assnopes read he transcribed in his neat copybook hand pausing only occasionally to inquire as to the spelling of a word i thought once i would try to forget you but i cannot forget you because you cannot forget me i saw my letter in your hand satchel today every day i can put my hand out and touch you you do not know it just to see you walk down the street to know what i know what you know some day we will both know together when you got use to it you kept my letter but you do not answer that is a good sign you do the boy had reached the foot of the page snopes removed it leaving the next sheet ready he continued to read in his droning inflectionless voice not forget me you would not keep it i think of you at night the way you walk down the street like i was dirt i can tell you something you will be surprised i know more than watch you walk down the street with cloths i will someday you will not be surprised then you pass me you do not know it i know it you will know it someday because i will tell you now he said and the boy dropped on to the foot of the page yours truly hal wagner code number twentyfour again he looked over the boys shoulder thats right he blotted the final sheet and gathered it up also the boy recapped the pen and thrust the chair back and snopes produced a small paper bag from his coat the boy took it soberly much obliged mr snopes he said he opened it and squinted into it its funny that air gun dont come on it sure is snopes agreed i dont know why it dont come maybe it got lost in the post office the boy suggested it may have i reckon thats about what happened to it ill write em again tomorrow the boy rose but he stood yet with his strawcolored hair and his bland innocent face he took a piece of candy from the sack and ate it without enthusiasm i reckon i better tell papa to go to the post office and ask em if it got lost no i wouldnt do that snopes said quickly you wait ill tend to it

ill see you git that gun the boy departed snopes locked the door and for a while he stood beside it with his head bent hishands slowlyknotting and writhing together then he burned the folded sheet over his hearth and ground the carbonized paper to dust under his heel with his knife he cut the fictitious address from the top of the first sheet the signature from the bottom of the second then he folded them and inserted them in a cheap envelope he sealed this and stamped it and took out his pen and with his left hand he addressed it with labored printed letters that night he took it to the station and mailed it on the train in the meantime he stopped in at watts and bought an air rifle at times as simon puttered about the place during the day he could look out across the lot into the pasture and see the carriage horses growing daily shabbier and less prideful with idleness and the cessation of their once daily grooming or he would pass the carriage motionless in its shed its tongue propped at an accusing angle on the wooden mechanism he had invented for that purpose and in the harness room the duster and tophat gathered slow dust on the nail in the wall holding too in their mute waiting a patient and questioning uncomplaint and at times when he stood shabby and stooped a little with stubborn bewilderment and age on the veranda with its ancient roses and wisteria and all its unchangeable and steadfast serenity and watched sartorises come and go in a machine a gentleman of his day would have scorned and which any pauper could own and only a fool would ride in it seemed to him that john sartoris stood beside him with his bearded hawklike face and an expression of haughty and fine contempt and standing so with the afternoon slanting athwart the southern end of the porch and the heady and myriad odors of the ripening spring and the drowsy hum of insects and the singing of birds steady upon it isom rolling his eyes in the dark cool doorway or near the corner of the house would hear his grandfather mumbling in a monotonous singsong in which was incomprehension and the petulant querulousness of age and isom would withdraw to the kitchen where his mother labored steadily with her placid yellow face and her endless crooning song pappy out dar talkin ter marse john agin isom told her gimme dem cole taters mammy aint miss jenny got some work fer

you git on outen my kitchen now i got dis flo mopped and i dont want it tracked up quite often these days isom could hear his grandfather talking to john sartoris as he labored about the stable or the flower beds or the lawn mumbling away to that arrogant ghost which dominated the house and its occupants and the whole scene itself across which the railroad he had built ran punily with distance but distinct as though it were a stage set for the diversion of him whose stubborn dream flouting him so deviously and cunningly while the dream was impure had shaped itself fine and clear now that the dreamer was purged of the grossness of pride with that of flesh gentmun equipage simon mumbled he was working again with his hoe in the salvia bed at thetop of the drive ridin indat thing wid a gentmuns proper equipage goin to rack and ruin in de barn he wasnt thinking of miss jenny it didnt make much difference what women rode in their menfolks permitting of course they only showed off a

youself marse john aint sartorises set de quality in dis country since you wuz bawn and now jes look at um he leaned on his hoe and watched the car swing up the drive and stop before the house miss jenny and young bayard got out and mounted to the veranda the engine was still running a faint shimmer of exhaust drifted upon the bright forenoon simon came up with his hoe and peered at the array of dials and knobs on the dash bayard turned in the door and spoke his name cut the switch off he ordered cut de which whut off simon asked that little brightcolored lever by the steering wheel there turn it down naw suh simon answered backing away i aint gwine tech it i aint gwine have it blowin up in my face it wont hurt you bayard said impatiently just put your hand on it and pull it down that little bright jigger there simon peered doubtfully at the gadgets and things but without coming any nearer then he craned his neck further and stared over into the car i dont see nothin but dis here big lever stickin up thoo de flo dat aint de one you mentioninis it bayard descended in two strides and leaned across the door and cut the switch under simons curious blinking regard the purr of the engine ceased well now simon said is dat de one you wuz takin erbout he stared at the switch for a time then he straightened up and stared at the hood shes quit bilin under dar aint she is dat de way you stops her but bayard had mounted the steps again and entered the house simon lingered a while longer examining the gleaming long thing dynamic as a motionless locomotive and a little awesome touching it lightly with his hand then rubbing his hand on his thigh he walked all around it slowly and touched the tires mumbling to himself and shaking his head then he returned to his salvia bed where bayard emerged presently and found him want to take a ride simon he asked simons hoe ceased and he straightened up who me sure come on simon stood with his static hoe and rubbed his head slowly bayard continued to cajole him come on well just go down the road a piece it wont hurt you naw suh i dont reckon if s gwine ter hurt me he agreed but he allowed himself to be drawn gradually toward the car staring at its various members with slow blinking speculation now that it was about to become an actual quantity in his life at the doorand with one foot raised to the running board he made a final stand against the subtle powers of evil judgment you aint gwine run it thoo de bushes like you and isom done dat day yall passed cunnel and me on de road is you bayard reassured him and he got in slowly with mumbled sounds of anticipatory concern and he sat forward on the seat with his feet drawn under him clutching the door with one hand and a lump of shirt on his chest with the other as the car moved down the drive they passed through the gates and onto the road and still he sat hunched forward on the seat as the car gained speed and with a sudden convulsive movement he caught his hat just as it blew off his head i speck dis is fur ernough aint it he suggested raising his voice he putted his hat down on his head but as he released it he had to clutch wildly at it again and he removed it and clasped it beneath his aim and again his hand fumbled at his breast and became motionless clamped tightly about a lump of his shirt i got to weed dat bed dis mawnin he said louder stul please suh mist bayard lie added and his wizened old body sat yet further forward on the seat and he cast quick covert glances at the steadily increasing rush of hedgerow beside the road then bayard leaned forward and simon watched his forearm tauten and then they shot forward on a roar of sound like blurred thunderous wings earth the unbelievable ribbon of the road crashed beneath them and away behind into dust convolvulae a dim moiling nausea of speed and the roadside greenery was a tunnel rigid and streaming and unbroken but he said no other word and when bayard glanced the lipless cruel derision of his teeth at him presently simon knelt in the floor his old disreputable hattinder his arm and his hand clutching a fold of his shirt on ins breast later the white man glanced at him again and simon was watching him and the blurred irises of his eyes were no longer a melting pupilless brown they were red and in the blast of wind they were unwinking and in them was that mindless phosphorescence of an animals bayard jammed the throttle down to the floor the wagon was movingdrowsily and peacefully along the road it was drawn by two mules and was filled with negro women asleep in chairs some of them wore drawers the mulesthemselves didnt wake at all but ambled sedately on with the empty wagon and the overturned chairs even when the car crashed into the shallow ditch and surged back onto the road again and thundered on without slowing the thunder ceased but the car rushed on and still under its own momentum it began to sway from side to side as bayard tried to drag simons hands from the switch but simon knelt in the floor with his eyes shut tightly and the air blast toying with the grizzled remnant of his hair holding the switch off with both sands turn it loose bayard shouted dats de way you stops it lawd dats de way you stops it lawd simon chanted keeping the switch covered with his hands while bayard hammered them with his fist and he clung to it until the car slowed and stopped then he fumbled the door open and descended to the ground bayard called to him but he went on back along the road at a limping rapid shuffle simon bayard called but simons shabby figure went on stiffly like a man who has been deprived of the use of his legs for a long time simon bayard called again but he neither slowed nor looked backand bayard started the car again and drove on until he could torn it about simon now stood in the ditch at the roadside and his head was bent above something that engaged his hands when bayard overtook him and stopped come on here and get in he commanded naw suh ill walk simon answered jump in now bayard said sharply he opened the door but simon stood in the ditch with his hand thrust inside his shirt and bayard could see that he was shaking uncontrollably come on you old fool im not going to hurt you ill walk home simon repeated stubbornly but without heat you git on wid dat thing ah get in simon i didnt know id scared you that bad i wont do it again you git on home simon said again deyll be worried erbout you you kin tell um whar im at bayard watched him a moment but simon was not looking at him and presently he slammed the door and went on nor did simon look up even then even when the car burst again into the thunder of roaring wings within a swirling cloud of dust that hung sluggishly after the thunder had died soon the wagon emerged from the dust the mules now at a high flopeared trot and jingled past him leaving behind it upon the dusty insectrasped air a womans voice in a quavering wordless hysteria passive and quavering and sustained this faded slowly down the shimmering flat reaches of the valley and simon removed from the breast of his shirt an object hung on a cord about his neck it was small vaguely globular and desiccated and was covered with soiled napped fur the first joint of the hind leg of a rabbit caught supposedly in a graveyard in the dark of the moon and simon rubbed it through the sweat on his forehead and on the back of his neck then he returned it to his bosom his hands were still trembling and he put his hat on and got back onto the road and turned toward home through the dusty noon he drove on down the valley toward town passing the neverclosed iron gates and the serene white house among its old trees and went on at speed the sound of the unmuffled engine crashed into the dust and swirled it into lethargic bursting shapes and faded punily across the fecund valley quick with cotton and corn just outside of town he came upon another negro in a wagon and he held the car straight upon the vehicle until the mules reared tilting the wagon for an instant then he swerved and whipped past with not an inch to spare so close that the yelling negro in the wagon could see the lipless and sayage derision of his teeth he went on then in a mounting swoop like a niggard zoom the cemetery with his greatgrandfather in pompous effigy gazing out across the valley and his railroad flashed past and he thought of old simon trudging along the dusty road toward home clutching his rabbits foot and again he felt savage and ashamed then town among its trees its shady streets like green tunnels along which tight lives accomplished their peaceful tragedies an he closed the muffler and at a sedate pace he approached the square the clock on the courthouse raised its four faces above the bowering elms in glimpses seen between arching vistas of bordering oaks ten minutes to twelve at twelve exactly his grandfather would repair to his office in the rear of the bank and there he would drink the pint of buttermilk which he brought inwith him every morning in a vacuum bottle then for an hour he would sleep on the sofa in a dark corner of the room as bayard turned onto the square the tilted chair in the bank door was already vacant and he slowed his car and eased it into the curb before a propped sandwich board fresh catfish today the board stated in letters of liquefied chalk and through the screen doors behind it came a smell of refrigerated foodcheese and pickle with a faint overtone of fried grease he stood for a moment on the sidewalk while the noon throng parted and flowed about him negroes slow and aimless as figures of a dark placid dream with an animal odor murmuring and laughing among themselves there was in their consonantless murmuring something ready with mirth in their laughter something grave and sad country people men in overalls or corduroy or khaki and without neckties women in shapeless calico and sunbonnets and snuffsticks groups of young girls in stiff mailorder finery the young heritage of their bodies grace dulled already by selfconsciousness and labor and unaccustomed high heels and soon to be obscured forever by childbearing youths and young men in cheap tasteless suits and shirts and caps weathertanned and cleanlimbed as race horses and a little belligerently blatant against the wall squatting a blind negro beggar with a guitar and a wire frame holding a mouthorgan to his lips patterned the background of smells and sounds with a plaintive reiteration of rich monotonous chords rhythmic as a mathematical formula but without music he was a man of at least forty and his was that patient resignation of many sightless years yet he too wore filthy khaki with a corporals stripes on one sleeve and a crookedly sewn boy scout emblem on the other andon his breast a button commemorating the fourthliberty loan and a small metal brooch bearing two gold stars obviously intended for female adornment his weathered derby was encircled by an officers hat cord and on the pavement between his feet sat a tin cup containing a dime and three pennies bayard sought a coin in his pocket and the beggar sensed his approach and his tune became a single repeated chord but without a break in the rhythm until the coin clinked into the cup and still without a break in the monotony of his strumming and the meaningless strains of his mouthorgan his left hand dropped groping a little to the cup and read the coin in a single motion then once more the guitar and mouthorgan resumed their blended pattern as bayard turned away someone spoke at his sidea broad squat man with a keen weathered face and gray temples he wore corduroys and boots and his body was the supple body of a horseman and his brown still hands were the hands that horses love maccallum his name one of a family of six brothers who lived eighteen miles away in the hills and with whom bayard and john hunted foxes and coons during their vacations been hearing about that car of yours maccallum said thats her is it he stepped down from the curb and moved easily about the car examining it his hands on his hips too much barrelhe said and she looks heavy in the withers quinsy have to use a curb on her i reckon i dont bayard answered jump in and ill show you what shell do no much obliged the other answered he stepped onto the pavement again among the negroes gathered to stare at the car along the street there came now in small groups children going home fromschool during the noon recesslittle girls with colored boxes and books and skippingropes and talking sibilantly among themselves of intense feminine affairs and boys in various stages of déshabille shouting and scuffling and jostling the little girls who shrank together and gave the boys cold reverted glares going to eat a snack he explained he crossed the pavement and opened the screen door you ate yet he asked looking back come on in a minute anyway and he patted his hip significantly the store was half grocery and confectionery and half restaurant a number of customers stood about the cluttered but clean front section with sandwiches and bottles of soda water and the proprietor bobbed his head with flurried slightly distrait affability above the counter to them the rear half of the room was filled with tables at which a number of men and a woman or so mostly country people sat eating with awkward and solemn decorum next to this was the kitchen filled with frying odors and the brittle hissing of it where two negroes moved about like wraiths in a blue floating lethargy of smoke they crossed this room also and maccallum opened a door set in an outthrust angle of the wall and they entered a smaller room or rather a large disused closet there was a small window high in the wall and a bare table and three or four chairs and presently the younger of the two negroes followed them yes suh mr maccallum and mr sartoris he set two freshly rinsed glasses to which water yet adhered in sliding drops on the table and stood drying his hands on his apron he had a broad untroubled black face a reliable sort of face lemons and sugar and ice maccallum said you dont want none of that soda pop do you heasked bayard the negro bowed and was turning away when maccallnm addressed bayard whereupon he paused with his hand on the door no bayard answeredrather have a toddy myself yes suh the negro agreed yall wants a toddy someway he contrived to imply a grave approval a vindication and he bowed again with a sort of suave sense of the fine moment and turned doorward again then he stepped aside as the proprietor in a fresh apron entered at his customary distracted trot and stood rubbing his hands on his thighs morning morning he said howre you rafe bayard i saw miss jenny and the old colonel going up to dr alfords office the other day aint nothing wrong is there his head was like an inverted egg his hair curled meticulously away from the part in the center into two careful reddishbrown wings like a toupee and his eyes were a melting passionate brown come in here and shut that door maccallum ordered drawing the other into the room he produced from beneath his coat a bottle of astonishing proportions and set it on the table it contained a delicate amber liquid and the proprietor rubbed his hands on his thighs and his hot mild gaze gloated upon it great savior he said whered you have that demijohn hid in your pants leg maccallum uncorked the bottle and extended it and the proprietor leaned forward and smelled it his eyes closed he sighed henrys maccallumsaid best run hes made yet reckon youd take a drink if bayard and me was to hold you the other cackled loudly unctuously aint he a comical feller now he asked bayard some joker aint he he glanced at the table you aint got but two glasses wait till i someone tapped at the door the proprietor leaned his conical head to it and waggled his hand at them maccallum concealed the bottle without haste as the proprietor opened the door it was the negro with another glass and lemons and sugar and a cracked bowl of ice the proprietor admitted him if they want me up front tell em ive stepped out but ill be back in a minute houston yes suh the negro replied setting the things on the table maccallum produced the bottle again what do you keep on telling your customers that old lie for he asked everybody knows what you are doing the proprietor cackled again gloating upon the bottle yes sir he repeated hes sore some joker well you boys have got plenty of time but i got to geton back and keep things running go ahead maccallum told him and the proprietor made himself a toddy he raised the glass stirring it and sniffing it alternately while the others mixed lemons and whisky and water then he removed his spoon and put it on the table well i hate to hurry a good thing mighty bad he said but business dont wait on pleasure you know work does interfere with a mans drinking maccallum agreed yes sir it sure does the other replied he lifted his glass your fathers good health he said he drank i dont see the old gentleman in town much nowadays no maccallum answered he aint never got over buddy being in the yankee army claims he aint coming to town again until the democratic party denies woodrow wilson itll be the best thing they ever done if they was to recall him and elect a man like debs or senator vardaman president the proprietor agreed sagely well that sure was fine he added henrys sure a wonder aint he he set his glass down and turned to the door well you boys make yourselves at home if you want anything just call houston and he bustled out at his distracted trot sit down maccallum said he drew up a chair and bayard drew another up opposite him across the table deacon sure ought to know good whisky hes drunk enough of it to float his counters right on out the front door he filled his glass and pushed the bottle across to bayard and they drank again quietly you look bad son maccallum said suddenly and bayard raised his head and found the other examining him with his keen steady eyes overtrained he added and bayard made an abrupt gesture of negation and raised his glass again but he could still feel the other watching him intently but without rudeness well you havent forgot how to drink good whisky anyhowwhy dont you come out and take a weeks hunt got an old red we been saving for you been running him off and on for two years now with the young dogs aint put old general on him yet because the old fellerll nose him out and i wanted to save him for you boys john would have enjoyed that fox you remember that night john cut across down to samsons bridge ahead of the dogs and when we got to the river here come him and the fox floating along on that drift log the fox on one end and john on the other ringing that fool song as loud as he could yell john wouldhave enjoyed this here fox he outsmarts them young dogs every time but old generalll get him bayard sat with his head bent taming his glass in his hand he reached a packet of cigarettes from his jacket and shook a few of them onto the table at his hand and flipped the packet across the table to the other but maccallum made no move to take it he drank his toddy steadily and refilled his glass and stirred his spoon slowly in it bayard lit one of his cigarettes and emptied his glass and reached for the bottle you look like hell boy maccallum repeated dry i reckon bayard answered in a voice as level as the others he made himself another toddy his cigarette smoking on the table edge beside him he raised his glass but instead of drinking he held it for a moment to his nose and the small muscles at the base of his nostrils tautened whitely then he swung the glass from him and with a steady hand he emptied it onto the floor the other watched him quietly while he picked up the bottle again and poured the glass half full of raw liquor and sloshed a little water into it and tilted it down his throat ive been good too damn long he said aloud and he fell to talking of the war not of combat but rather of a life peopled by young men like fallen angels and of a meteoric violence like that of fallen angels beyond heaven or hell and partaking of both doomed immortality and immortal doom maccallum sat and listened quietly drinking his whisky steadily and slowly and without appreciable effect as though it were milk he drank and bayard talked on and presently found himself without surprise eating food the bottle was now less than half full the negro houston had brought the food in and had his drink taking it neat and without battingan eye ef i had a cow datgive dat de calf wouldnt git no milk atall he said and i wouldnt never churn thankee mr maccahum suh then he was out and bayards voice went on filling the cubbyhole of a room surmounting the odor of cheap food too quickly cooked and of sharp spilt whisky with ghosts of a thing highpitched as a hysteria like a glare of fallen meteors on the dark retina of the world again a light tap at the door and the proprietors eggshaped head and his hot diffident eyes you gentlemen got everything you want he asked rubbing his hands on his thighs come and get it maccallum said jerking his head toward the bottle and the other made himself a toddy in his stale glass and drank it and stood while bayard finished his tale of himself and an australian major and two ladies in the leicester lounge one evening the leicester lounge being out of bounds and the anzac lost two teeth and his girl and bayard himself got a black eye watching the narrator with round melting astonishment great savior he said the avaytors was sure some hellraisers wadnt they well i reckon theyre wanting me up front again you got to keep on the jump to make a living these days and he scuttled out again ive been good too goddam long bayard repeated harshly watching maccallum fill the two glasses thats the only thing johnny was ever good for kept me from getting in a rut bloody rut with a couple of old women hanging around me and nothing to do except scare old niggers he drank his whisky and set the glass down on the table still clutching it damn hamhanded hun he said he never could learn to fly properly i kept trying to keep him fromgoing up there on that goddam popgun and he cursed his dead brother savagely then he raised his glass again but halted it half way to his mouth where in hell did my drink go maccallum reached the bottle and emptied it into bayards glass and he drank and banged the thick tumbler on the table and rose and lurched back against the wall his chair crashed backward and he braced himself staring at the other i kept on trying to keep him from going up there on that camel but he gave me a burst right across my nose maccallum rose also come on here he said quietly and he offered to take bayards arm but bayard evaded him and they passed through the kitchen and traversed the long tunnel of the store bayard walked steadily enough and the proprietor bobbed his head at them across the counter call again gentlemen he said call again all right deacon maccallum answered bayard strode on without turning his head as they passed the soda fountain a young lawyer standing beside a stranger addressed him captain sartoris shake hands with mr gratton here gratton was up on the british front for a while last year the stranger turned and extended his hand but bayard stared at him bleakly and walked so steadily on that the other involuntarily gave back a pace in order not to be overborne why goddam his soul he said to bayards back the lawyer grasped his arm hes drunk he whispered quickly hes drunk i dont give a damn the other exclaimed loudly because he was a goddam shavetail he thinks shhhh shhhh the lawyer hissed the proprietor appeared at the corner of his candy case peering out with hot round alarm gentlemen gentlemen he exclaimed the stranger made another violent movement and bayard stopped wait a minute while i bash his face in he told maccallum turning the stranger thrust the lawyer aside and stepped forward you never saw the day he began maccallum took bayards arm firmly and easily come on here boy ill bash his bloody face in bayard stated equably watching the angry stranger with his bleak eyes the lawyer grasped his companions arm again get away the other said flinging him off just let him try it come on you limey gentlemen gentlemen the proprietor implored come on here boy maccallum said ive got to look at a horse a horse bayard repeated he turned obediently then as an afterthought he paused and looked back cant bash your face in now he told the stranger sorry got to look at a horse call for you at the hotel later but the strangers back was turned and behind it the lawyer grimaced at maccallum and waggled his hand get him away maccallum for gods sake bash his face in later bayard repeated cant bash yours though eustace he toldthe lawyer taught us in groundschool never seduce a fool nor hit a cripple come on here maccallum repeated leading him away at the door bayard must stop again to light a cigarette then they went on it was three oclock and again they walked among school children in released surges sibilant with temporary freedom bayard strode steadily enough and a little belligerently and presently maccallum turned into a side street and they went on before negro shops and between a busy grist mill and a silent cotton gin they turned into a lane filled with tethered horses and mules from the end of the lane a blacksmiths anvil clangedbut they passed its ruby glow and the squatting overalled men along the shady wall and came next to a high barred gate backing a long duncolored brick building smelling of ammonia a few men sat on the top of the gate others leaned their crossed arms upon it and from the paddock itself came voices then through the slatted gate gleamed a haughty motionless shape of burnished flame the stallion stood against the yawning cavern of the livery stable door like a motionless bronze flame and along its burnished coat ran at intervals little tremors of paler flame little tongues of nervousness and pride but its eye was quiet and arrogant and occasionally and with a kingly air its gaze swept along the group at the gate with a fine disdain without seeing them as individuals at all and again little tongues of paler flame rippled flicking along its coat about its head was a rope hackamore it was tethered to a door post and in the background a white man moved about at a respectful distance with a proprietorial air beside him a negro hostler with a tow sack tied about his middle with a string maccallum and bayard halted at the gate and the white man circled the stallions haughty immobility and crossed to them the negro hostler came forth also with a soft dirty cloth and chanting in a sad mellow singsong the stallion permitted mm to approach and suffered him to erase with his rag the licking nervous little flames that ran in renewed ripples under its skin aint he a picture now the white man demanded of maccallum leaning his elbow on thegate a cheap nickel watch was attached to his suspender loop by a length of rawhide lace leather worn black and soft with age and his shaven beard was heaviest from the corners of his mouth to his chin he looked always as though he were chewing tobacco with his mouth open he was a horse trader by profession and he was usually engaged in litigation with the railroad company over the violent demise of some of his stock by its agency look at that nigger now he added hell let tobe handle him like a baby i wouldnt get within ten foot of him myself damf i know how tobe does it must be some kin between a nigger and a animal i always claim i reckon hes afraid youll be crossing the railroad with him some day about the time is due maccallum said drily yes i reckon i have the hardest luck of any feller in this county the other agreed but they got to settle this time i gotem dead to rights this time yes maccallum said the railroad company ought to furnish that stock of yourn with time tables the other onlookers guffawed ah the companys got plenty of money the trader rejoined then he said you talk like i might have druv them mules in front of that train lemme tell you how it come about i reckon you wont never drive him in front of no train maccallum jerked his head toward the stallion the negro burnished its shimmering coat crooning to it in a monotonous singsong the trader laughed i reckon not he admitted not lessn tobe goes too just look at him now i wouldnt no more walk up to that animal than id fly im going to ride that horse bayard said suddenly what hoss the trader demanded and the other onlookers watched bayard climb the gate and vault over into the lot you let that hoss alone young feller the trader added but bayard paid him no heed he turned from the gate the stallion swept its regal gaze upon him and away you let that hoss alone the trader shouted or ill have the law on you let him be maccallum said and let him damage a fifteen hundred dollar stallion that hossllkill him yousartoris maccallum drew a wad of bills enclosed by a rubber band from his hip pocket let him be he repeated thats what he wants the trader glanced at the money with quick calculation i take you gentlemen to witness he began loudly then he ceased and they watched tensely as bayard approached the stallion the beast swept its haughty glowing eye upon him again and lifted its head without alarm and snorted and the negro crouched against its shoulder and his crooning chant rose to a swifter beat then the beast snorted again and swept its head up snapping the rope like a gossamer thread and the negro grasped at the flying ropeend git away whitefolks he said hurriedly git away quick but the stallion eluded his hand it cropped its teeth in a vicious arc and the negro leaped sprawling as the animals whole body soared like a bronze explosion but bayard had dodged beneath the sabring hooves and as the horse swirled the myriad flicking tongues of its glittering coat the spectators saw that the man had contrived to take a turn with the ropeend about its jaws then they saw the animal rear again dragging the man from the ground and whipping hisbody like a rag upon its flashing arc then it stopped trembling as bayard closed its nostrils with the twisted rope and suddenly he was upon its back while still it stood with lowered head and rolling eyes rippling its burnished coat into quivering tongues of flame before exploding again the beast burst like unfolding bronze wings a fluid desperation the onlookers tumbled away from the gate and hurled themselves to safety as the gate splintered to matchwood beneath its soaring volcanic thunder bayard crouched on its shoulders and dragged its mad head around and they swept down the lane spreading pandemonium among the horses and mules tethered and patient before the blacksmith shop and among the wagons there where the lane debouched into the street a group of negroes scattered before them and without a break in its stride the stallion soared over a small negro child clutching a stick of striped candy directly in its path a wagon drawn by mules was turning into the lane these reared madly before the wild slackjawed face of the white man in the wagon and again bayard dragged his thunderbolt around and headed it away from the square down the lane behind him through the dust the spectators ran shouting the trader among them and rafe maccallum still clutching his roll of money the stallion moved beneath him like a tremendous mad music uncontrolled splendidly uncontrollable the rope served only to curb its direction not its speed and among shouts from the pavement on either side he swung the animal into another street that broke suddenly upon his vision this was a quieter street soon they would be in the country and the stallion could exhaust its rage without the added hazards of motors and pedestrians voices faded behind himinto the thunder of shod hooves runaway runaway but this street was deserted save for a small automobile going in the same direction and further along beneath the slumbrous tunnel of the trees bright small spots of color scuttled out of the street and clotted on one side children hope they stay there he said to himself his eyes were streaming a little beneath him the surging lift and fall in his nostrils a pungent sharpness of rage and energy and heat like smoke from the animals body and he swept past the motor car remarking for a flashing second a womans face and a mouth partly open and two eyes round with a serene astonishment but the face flashed away without registering on his mind and he saw the children small taut shapes of fear in bright colors and on the other side of the street a negro man playing a hose onto the sidewalk and beside him a second negro with a pitchfork someone screamed from a neighboring veranda and the group of children broke shrieking a small figure in a white shirt and diminutive pale blue pants darted from the curb into the street and bayard leaned forward and dragged at the rope swerving the beast toward the opposite sidewalk where the two negroes stood the small figure came on flashed safely behind then rushing green beneath the stallions feet a tree trunk like a wheel spoke in reverse and the animal struck clashing fire from wet concrete slipped lunged then crashed down and for bayard a red shock then blackness the horse scrambled to its feet and whirled and struck viciously at the prone rider with its forefeet but the negro with the pitchfork drove it away whereupon it trotted stiffly back up the street and passed the slowing motor car with the woman driver at the end of the street it submitted docilely to capture by the negrohostler rafe maccallum still clutched his roll of bills they gathered him up and brought him to town in a commandeered motor car and roused dr peabody from slumber dr peabody profanely bandaged bayards unconscious head and when he came to gave him a drink from the bottle which resided in the littered waste basket and threatened to telephone miss jenny if bayard didnt go straight home rafe maccallum promised to see that he went and the owner of the impressed automobile offered to drive him it was a ford body with in place of a tonneau a miniature oneroom cabin of sheet iron and larger than a dog kennel in each painted geometrical window of which a painted housewife simpered benignantly above a painted sewing machine and into which an actual sewing machine neatly fitted borne thus about the countryside by the agent the agents name was v k suratt and he now sat with his shrewd plausible face behind the wheel bayard with his humming head sat beside him and to the fender clung a youth with brown forearms and a slanted extremely new straw hat who let his limber body absorb the jolts with negligent young skill as they rattled sedately out of town on the valley road the drink dr peabody had given him instead of quieting his jangled nervous system rolled sluggishly and hotly in his stomach and served only to nauseate him a little and against his closed eyelids red antic shapes rolled in throbbing and tedious cycles he watched them dully and without astonishment as they emerged from blackness and whirled sluggishlyand consumed themselves and reappeared each time a hole fainter as his mind cleared and yet somewhere blended with them yet at the same time apart and beyond them with a serene aloofness and steadfast among their senselessconvolutions was a head with twin dark wings of hair it seemed to have some relation to the instant itself as it culminated in crashing blackness at the same time it seemed for all its aloofness to be a part of the whirling ensuing chaos which now enveloped him a part of it yet bringing into the vortex a sort of constant coolness like a faint shady breeze so it remained aloof and not quite distinct while the coiling shapes faded into a dull unease of physical pain from the jolting of the car leaving about him like an echo that cool serenity and something morea sense of shrinking yet fascinated distaste of which he or something he had done was the object it was getting well into evening on either hand cotton and corn showed in green spears upon the rich dark soil and in the patches of green woodland doves called moodily after a time suratt turned from the highway into a faint rutted wagon road between a field and a patch of woods and they drove straight into the sun and bayard held his hat before his face sun hurt yo head suratt asked beside him taint long now he added the road wound presently into the woods where the sun was intermittent and it rose gradually toward a low merest on which trees stood like a barred grate against the western sky they crossed this mil and the land fell away in ragged illtended fields and beyond them in a clump of fruit trees and a grove of silver poplars pale as absinthe and twinkling ceaselessly without wind a weathered small house squatted beyond itand much larger loomed a barn gray arid gaunt withage the road forked here one faint arm curvedsandily away toward the house the other went onbetween rank weeds toward the barn the youth onthe fender leaned his head into the car drive on to the barn he directed suratt obeyed beyond the bordering weeds a fence straggled in limp dilapidation and from the weeds the handles of a plow stood at a gaunt angle while its shard rusted peacefully in the undergrowth and other implements rusted half concealed in the growthskeletons of labor healed over by the earth they were to have violated kinder than they the fence turned at an angle and suratt stopped the car and the youth stepped down and opened a warped wooden gate and suratt drove on into the barnyard where stood a wagon with drunken wheels and a homemade bed and the rusting skeleton of a ford car low down upon its domed and hoodless radiator the two lamps gave it an expressions beetling patient astonishment like a skull and a lean cow ruminated and watched them without interest the barn doors sagged drunkenly from broken hinges held to the posts with twists of baling wire beyond the cavern of the hallway yawned in stale desolationa travesty of earths garnered fullness and its rich inferences bayard sat on the fender and leaned his bandaged head back against the car body and watched suratt and the youth enter the barn and disappear slowly upward on invisible ladder rungs the cow stood yet in ruminant dejection and upon the yellow surface of a pond enclosed by banks of trodden and suncracked day beneath a clump of locust shrubs and willows geese drifted like small muddy clouds the sun fell in a long slant upon their rumps and their suave necks and upon the cows leanrhythmically twitching flank ridging her visible ribs with dingy gold presently suratts legs fumbled into sight followed by his cautious body and after him the youth with his slanted hat slid easily down the perpendicular ladder letting his body from rung to rung in easy onehanded swoops he emerged carrying an earthen jug close against his leg suratt followed in his neat tieless blue shirt and jerked his head at bayard and they turned the corner of the barn and retreated along the wall among waisthigh jimson weeds bayard rose and followed and overtook them as the youth with his jug slid with an agile unceasing motion between two lax strands of barbed wire suratt stooped through more sedately and held the top strand taut and pressed the lower one down with his foot until bayard was through behind the barn the land descended into shadow toward a junglish growth of willow and elder against which a huge beech and a clump of saplings stood like mottled ghosts and from which a cool dankness rose like a breath to meet them the spring welled from the roots of the beech into a wooden frame buried to the edge in white sand that quivered ceaselessly and delicately beneath the waters limpid unrest and strayed on away into the willow and elder growth without a sound the earth about the spring was trampled smooth and packed as an earthen floor near the spring a blackened iron pot sat on four bricks beneath it was a heap of pale wood ashes and a litter of extinct brands and charred fagotends against the pot leaned a scrubbing board with a ridged metal face polished to a dull even gleam like old silver and a rusty tin cup hung from a nail in the beech tree above the spring the youth set the jug down and he md suratt squatted gravely beside it i dont know if we aint agoin to git in trouble givinmr bayard whisky hub suratt said still doc peabody give him one dram hisself so i reckon we kingive him one moaint that right mr bayard squatting he glanced up at bayard with his shrewd affable face hub twisted the corncob stopper from the jug and passed it to suratt who tendered it to bayard i been knowinmr bayard ever since he was a chap in knee pants suratt confided to hub but this is the first time me and him ever taken a drink together aint that so mr bayardi reckon youll want a drinkin cup wont you but bayard was already drinking with the jug tinted across his horizontal forearm and the mouth held to his lips by the same hand as it should be done he knows how to drink outen a jug dont he suratt added i knowed he was all right he said in a tone of confidential vindication bayard lowered the jug and returned it to suratt who offered it formally to hub go ahead hub said hit it suratt did so with measured pistonings of his taut throat in relief against the brooding green of the jungle wall above the stream gnats whirled and spun in a leveling ray of sunlight like erratic golden chaff suratt lowered the jug and passed it to hub and wiped his mouth on the back of his hand how you fed now mr bayard he asked then he said heavily youll have to excuse me i reckon i ought to said captain sartoris oughtnt i what for bayard asked he squatted also on hi heels against the bole of the tree beside the limpid soundless laughing of the spring the rising slope of ground behind them hid the barn and the house and the three of them squatted in a small bowl of peacefulness remote from the world and its rumors filled with the cool unceasing breathing of the spring and a seeping of sunlight among the elders and willows like a thinly diffused wine on the surface of the spring the sky lay reflected stippled with windless beech leaves hub squatted leanly with his brown forearms clasped about his knees smoking a cigarette beneath the downward tilt of his straw hat suratt was across the spring from him he wore a faded clean blue shirt and in contrast to it his hands and face were a rich even brown like mahogany the jug sat rotundly benignantly between them yes sir suratt repeated i always find the best cure for a wound is plenty of whisky doctors these here fancy young doctors tell a feller different but old doc peabody hisself cut off my granpappys leg while granpappy laid back on the dinin table with a demijohn in his hand and a mattress and a chair across his laigs and fo men aholdin him down and him cussin and singin so scandalous the womenfolks and the chillen went down to the pasture behind the barn and waited take some mo he said and he reached the jug across the spring and bayard drank again reckon youre beginnin to feel pretty fair aint you damned if i know bayard answered its dynamite boys suratt with the lifted jug guffawed then he lipped it and his adams apple pumped again in arched relief against the wall of elder and willow the elder would soon flower with pale clumps of tiny blooms miss jenny made a little wine of it every year good wine if you knew how and had the patience elder flower wine like a ritual for a childrens game a game played by little girls in small pale dresses between supper and twilight above the bowl where sunlight yet came in a leveling beam gnats whirledand spun like dustmotes in a quiet disused room suratts voice went on affably ceaselessly recapitulant in polite admiration of the hardness of bayards head and the fact that this was the first time he and bayard had ever taken a drink together they drank again and hub began to borrow cigarettes of bayard and he became also a little profanely and robustly anecdotal in his country idiom about whisky and girls and dice and presently he and suratt were arguing amicably about work they seemed to be able to sit tirelessly and without discomfort on their heels but bayards legs had soon grown numb and he straightened them tingling with released blood and he now sat with his back against the tree and his long legs straight before him hearing suratts voice without listening to it his head was now no more than a sort of taut discomfort at times it seemed to float away from his shoulders and hang against the wall of green like a transparent balloon within which or beyond which that face that would neither emerge completely and distinguishably nor yet fade completely away and so trouble him no longer lingered with shadowy exasperationtwo eyes round with a grave shocked astonishment two lifted hands flashing behind little white shirt and blue pants swerving into a lifting rush plunging clatter crash blackness suratts slow plausible voice went on steadily but without any irritant quality it seemed to fit easily into the still scene speaking of earthy things way i learnt to chop cotton he was saying my oldest brother taken and put me in the same row ahead of him started me off and soons i taken a lick or two here he come behind me and ever time my hoe chopped once i could year hisn chop twice i never had no shoes in them days neither headded drily so i had to learn to chop fast but i swo then come what mought that i wouldnt never plant nothin in the ground soons i could hep myself its all right for folks that owns land but folks like my folks was dont never own no land and ever time we made a furrow we was scratchin earth for somebody else the gnats danced and whirled more madly yet in the sun above the secret places of the stream and the suns light was taking on a rich copper tinge suratt rose well boys i got to be gittin back tods town myself he looked at bayard again with his shrewd talkative face i reckon mr bayards clean got over that knock he taken aint he dammit bayard said quit calling me mr bayard suratt picked up the jug i knowed he was all right when you got to know him he said to hub i been knowin him since he was kneehigh to a grasshopper but me and him jest aint been throwed together like this i was raised a pore boy fellers while mr bayards folks has lived on that ere big place with plenty of money in the bank and niggers to wait on em but hes all right he repeated he aint goin to say nothin about who give turn this here whisky let him tell if he wants hub answered idont give a damn they drank again the sun was almost gone and from the secret marshy places of the stream came a fairylike piping of young frogs the gaunt invisible cow lowed barnward and hub replaced the corncob in the mouth of the jug and drove it home with his palm and they mounted the slope above the spring and crawled through the fence the cow stood in the barn door and watched diem approach and lowed again moody and mournful and the geese hadleft the pond and they now paraded sedately across the barnyard toward the house in the door of which framed by two crepemyrtle bushes a woman stoodhub she said in a flat country voice goin to town hub answered shortly suell have to milk the woman stood quietly in the door hub carried the jug into the barn the cow turned and followed him but he heard her and turned and gave her a resounding kick in her gaunt ribs and cursed her without heat presently he reappeared and went on to the gate and opened it and stood so until suratt drove through then he closed it and wired it to again and swung onto the fender but bayard moved over in the seat and hub got inside the woman stood yet in the door watching them quietly about the doorstep the geese surged erratically with discordant cries their necks undulant and suave as formal gestures in a pantomime the shadow of the poplar grove fell long across the untidy fields and the car pushed its elongated shadow before it like the shadow of a huge humpshouldered bird they mounted the sandy hill in the last of the sun among the trees and dropped downward out of sunlight and into violet dusk the road was soundless with sand and the car lurched in the worn and shifting ruts and so out of the woods between tilled fields again and onto the broad valley road the warring moon stood overhead as yet it gave off no light though and they drove on toward town passing an occasional belated country wagon homeward bound these suratt greeted with a grave gesture of his brown hand and presently where the road crossed a wooden bridge among more willow and elder where dusk was yet denser and more palpablesuratt stopped the car and climbed out over the door you fellers set still he said i wont be but a minute they heard him at the rear of the car then he reappeared with a tin bucket and he let himself gingerly down the rank roadside bank beside the bridge water chuckled and murmured beneath the bridge invisible with twilight its murmur burdened with the voice of cricket and frog above the willows that marked its course gnats still spun and whirled for bullbats appeared from nowhere in long swoops in midswoop vanished then appeared again against the serene sky swooping silent as drops of water on a pane of glass swift and noiseless and intent as though their wings were feathered with twilight and with silence suratt scrambled up the bank with his pail and he removed the radiator cap and tilted the bucket above the mouth of it the moon stood yet without emphasis overhead yet a faint shadow of the bucket fell upon the hood of the car and upon the pallid planking of the bridgethe leaning willow fronds were repeated faintly but delicately distinct the last of the water gurgled with faint rumblings into the engines interior and suratt replaced the bucket and climbed over the blind door again the lights operated from a generator he turned these on now while the car was in low speed the lights glared to a soundless crescendo but when he let the clutch in they dropped to a wavering glow no more than a luminous shadow on the unrolling monotonous ribbon of the road night was an accomplished thing before they reached town across the unemphatic land the lights on the courthouse clock were like yellow beads suspended above the trees on the dark horizon line and upon the green afterglow in the west a column of smoke stood like a balanced plume suratt put themout at the restaurant and drove on and they entered and the proprietor lifted his conical head and his round melting eyes from behind the soda fountain great savior boy he exclaimed aint you gone home yet doc peabodys been huntin you ever since four oclock andmiss jenny drove to town in the carriage lookin for you youll kill yourself get to hell back yonder deacon bayard answered and bring me and hub about two dollars worth of ham and eggs later they returned for the jug in bayards car bayard and hub and a third young man freight agent at the railway station with three negroes and a bull fiddle in the rear seat but they drove no further than the edge of the field above the house and stopped here while hub went on afoot down the sandy weedhedged road toward the barn in its looming silver solitude the moon stood pale and cold overhead and on all sides insects shrilled in the dusty undergrowth in the rear seat the negroes murmured among themselves fine night mitch the freight agent suggested but bayard smoked his cigarette moodily his head closely helmeted in its white bandage moon and insects were one audible and visible dimensionless and unsourced after a while hub materialized against the dissolving vagueness of the road crowned by the silver gleam of his hat and he swung the jug onto the door and removed the stopper mitch passed it to bayard drink bayard said shortly and mitch did so then the others drank we aint got no thin for the niggers to drink out of hub said thats so mitch agreed he turned in his seat aint one of you boys got a cup or something the negroes murmured again questioning one another in mellow consternation i know bayard said he got out and lifted the hood and removed the cap from the breatherpipe itll taste a little like oil for a drink or two but you boys wont notice it after that naw sub the negroes agreed in chorus onetook the cup and wiped it out with the corner of hiscoat and they top drank in turn with smacking expulsions of breath then bayard replaced the cap and go t into his seat anybody want another right now hub askedpoising the corncob above the jug mouth give mitch another bayard directed hell have to catch up mitch drank again briefly then bayard took the jug and tilted it the others watched him respectfully damf he dont drink it mitch murmured id be afraid to hit it so often if i was you its my damned head bayard lowered the jug and passed it to hub i keep thinking another drink will ease it off some doc put that bandage on too tight hub said you want it loosened a little i dont know bayard lit another cigarette and threw the match away i believe ill take it off its been on there long enough he raised his hands and fumbled at the bandage you better let it alone mitch said but bayard fumbled at the fastening then he slid his fingers beneath a turn of the cloth and tugged at it savagely one of the negroes leaned forward with a pocket knife and severed it and they watched quietly while bayard stripped it off and flung it away you ought not to done that mitch told him ah let him take it off if he wants hub said hes all right he got in and stowed the jug away between his knees bayard backed the car around the sandy road hissed beneath its broad tires and rose shaling into the woods again where the dappled moonlight was intermittent treacherous with dissolving vistas of shadow and formless growth invisible and sourceless among the shifting patterns of light and shade whippoorwills were like flutes tongued liquidly the road passed out of the woods and descended with sand in shifting and silent lurches and they emerged between fields flattening away to the straight valley road and turned onto it and away from town the car swept onward borne on the sustained hiss of its muffled intake like a dry sibilance of sand in a huge hour glass the negroes in the back murmured quietly among themselves in mellow snatches mellow snatches of laughter whipped from their lips like scraps of torn paper swirling away behind they passed the iron gates and bayards home dreaming serenely in the moonlight among its trees and the silent boxlike flag station and the metalroofed cotton gin on the railroad siding then the road rose into the hills it was broad and smooth and empty for all its winding and the negroes sat now a little tensely anticipatory but bayard drove at a steady smooth gait not slow but hot anything like what they had expected of him twice more they stopped and drank and then from an ultimate hilltop they looked downward upon clustered lights again hub produced the breather cap and they drank once more through streets identical with those at home they moved smoothly toward an identical square people along the streets turned and looked after them curiously they crossed the square without stopping and into another quiet street there were no arc lights at the street intersections since there was a moon and they went on between broad lawns and shaded windows and presently beyond an iron fence and set well back among ancient trees lighted windows hung in ordered tiers like rectangular lanterns strung among the branches they stopped here in shadow the negroes descended and lifted the bass viol out and a guitar the third negro held a slender tube frosted over with keys upon which the intermittent moon glinted in hushed glints and they stood with their heads together murmuring among themselves and touching plaintive muted chords from the strings then the one with the clarinet raised it to his lips the tunes were old tunes some of them were sophisticated tunes and formally intricate but in the rendition this was lost and all of them were imbued instead with a plaintive similarity a slurred and rhythmic simplicity and they drifted in rich plaintive chords upon the silver air fading dying in minor reiterations along the treacherous vistas of moon and shadow they played again an old waltz the college cerberus came across the dappled lawn to the fence but without antagonistic intent across the street in the shadows there other listeners stood a car approached and slowed into the curb and shut off motor and lights and in the tiered windows heads leaned aureoled against the lighted rooms behind without individuality at this distance but feminine and delicately and divinely young at last they played home sweet home andwhen the rich minor died away across to them came a soft clapping of slender palms then mitch sang goodnight ladies in his true oversweet tenor and the young hands were more importunate and as they drove away the slender heads leaned aureoled with bright hair in the lighted windows and the soft dapping drifted after them for a long while fainter and fainter in the silver silence at the top of the first hill out of town they stopped and hub removed the breather cap behind them random lights among the trees and it was as though there came yet to them across the hushed world that sound of young palms like flung delicate flowers before their youth and masculinity and they drank without speaking lapped yet in the fading magic of the lost moment mitch sang tp himself softly the car slid purring on again the road dropped curving smoothly empty and blanched bayard broke the spell cut out hub he said hub bent forward and reached under the dash and the car slid on with a steady leashed muttering like waking thunderous wings then the road flattened in a long swoop toward another rise and the muttering lept to crescendo and the car shot forward with necksnapping violence the negroes murmur ceased then one of them raised a wailing shout reno lost his hat hub said looking back he dont need it bayard shouted in reply the car roared up this hill and rushed across the crest of it and flashed around a tight banked curve oh lawd the negro wailed mr bayard his words whipped away behind like stripped leaves lemme out mr bayard jump out then bayard answered the road fell from beneath them like a tilting floor and awayacross a valley straight now as a string the negroes crouched with their eyes shut against the air blast clutching their instruments the speedometer showed and and turned slowly on mad rushing miles sped beneath them sparse houses loomed into the headlights sweep flashed slumbering away and fields and patches of woodland like tunnels and still they roared on beneath the silver night across the black and silver land the road wound among the hills whippoorwills called on either side one to another in quiring liquid astonishment at their thunderous phantom at intervals when the headlights swept in the roads abrupt windings two spots of pale fire blinked in the dust before the bird blundered awkwardly somewhere beneath the radiator the ridge rose steadily with wooded slopes falling away on either hand sparse negro cabins squatted upon the slopes or beside the road dappled with shadow and lightless and profound with slumber beneath trees before them wagons stood or warped farm implements leaned shelterless after the shiftless fashion of negroes the road dipped then rose again in a long slant broken by another dip then it stood directly before them like a wall the car shot upward and over the dip left the road completely then swooped dreadfully on and the negroes concerted wail whipped forlornly away then the ridge attained its crest and the cars thunder ceased and it came slowly to a stop the negroes sat now in the bottom of the tonneau is dis heaven one murmured after a time dey wouldnt let you in heaven wid licker on yo breaf and no hat feller another said ef de lawd dont take no better keer of me dan he done of dat hat i dont wanter go dar noways the first rejoined mmmmm the second agreedwhen us come down dat ere las hill dis yere clainet almos blowed clean outen my han let lone my hat and when us jumped over dat ere lawg er whutever it wuz back dar the third one added i thought for a minute dis whole autobile done blowedoutenmy han they drank again it was high here and the air moved with gray coolness on either hand lay a valley filled with shadow and with ceaseless whippoorwills beyond these valleys the silver earth rolled on into the sky across it sourceless and mournful and far a dog howled before them the lights on the courthouse clock were steadfast and yellow and unwinking in the dissolving distance but in all other directions the world rolled away in slumbrous ridges milkily opaline bayards head felt as cool and clear as a clapperless and windless bell within it that head emerged clearly at last those two eyesround with grave astonishment winged serenely by two dark wings of hair he sat for a while in the motionless car gazing into the sky it was that benbow girlhe said to himself quietly all of her instincts were antipathetic toward him toward his violence and his brutally obtuse disregard of all the qualities which composed her being his idea was like a trampling of heavy feet in those cool corridors of hers in that grave serenity in which her days accomplished themselves at the very syllables of his name her instincts brought her upstanding and under arms against him thus increasing doubling the sense of violation by the act of repulsing him and by the necessity for it and yet despite her armed sentinels he still crashed with that hot violence of his through the bastions and thundered at the very inmost citadel of her being even chance seemed to abet him lending to his brutal course a sort of theatrical glamor a tawdry simulation of the virtues which the reasons if he had reasons for his actions outwardly ridiculed that mad flaming beast he rode almost over her car and then swerved it with an utter disregard of consequences to himself onto a wet sidewalk in order to avoid a frightened child the pallid suddenly dreaming calm of his bloody face from which violence had been temporarily wiped as with a damp cloth leaving it still with that fine bold austerity of roman statuary beautiful as a flame shaped in bronze and cooled the outward form of its energy but without its heat her appetite was gone at sapper and aunt sally mouthed her prepared soft food and mumbled querulously at her because she would not eat but eat she could not there was still between her and any desire for food the afternoons experience like a recurring echo in her violated corridorsthe mad rash of the beast and its rider like a bronze tidal wave into which the small running figure in white and pale blue was sucked and overwhelmed and spewed forth again unscathed while the wave spent its blind fury and ebbed leaving the rider prone on the wet sidewalk while the horse stood erect like a man and struck at him with its forefeet and partly because that with recurrence of the picture her sense of irremediable violation increased and partly through irritation and anger with herself because it did food choked her she could not swallow it later aunt sally sat and talked monotonously above her interminable fancywork aunt sally would never divulge what is was to be when completed nor for whom and she had been working on it for fifteen years carrying always about with her a shapeless bag of dingy threadbare brocade containing odds and ends of colored fabric in all possible shapes she could never bring herself to trim any of them to any pattern so she shifted and fitted and mused and shifted them like pieces of a puzzle picture trying to fit them to a pattern or to create a pattern about them without cutting them smoothing her colored scraps on a card table with flaccid patient puttycolored fingers shifting and shifting them from the bosom of her dress the needle narcissa had threaded for her dangled its spidery skein across the room narcissa sat on her curled legs with a book aunt sallys voice droned on with bland querulous interminability and narcissa turned the pages restively under her unseeing eyes suddenly she rose and laid the book down and crossed the hall into another room and sat in the halflight at her piano but still between herself and the familiar keyboard the thunderous climacteric of the afternoons moment recurred and she saw his calm and bloodless face as a piece of flotsam unwelcome and too heavy to move washed onto the grave unshadowed beach of her days disrupting that serene constancy to which she clung so fiercely and at last she rose with abrupt decision and went to the telephone miss jenny thanked her for her solicitude tardy and dared to say that bayard was all right still an active member of the socalled human race that is since they had received no official word from the coroner no she had heard nothing of him since loosh peabody had phoned her at four oclock that bayard was on his way home with a broken head the broken head she readily believed but the otherpart of the message she had put no credence in whatever having lived with those damn sartorises eighty years and knowing that home would be the last place in the world a sartoris with a broken head would ever consider going no she was not even interested in his present whereabouts and she hoped he hadnt injured the horse horses were valuable animals well if miss jenny wasnt alarmed she certainly had no call to be and she returned to the living room and explained to aunt sally whom she had been talking to and why and drew a low chair to the lamp and picked up her book she put the afternoon from her mind deliberately and for a while and with a sort of detachment she watched her other self sink further and further into the book until at last the book absorbed her attention but then the vacuum of her relaxed will roused her again and although she read deliberately on a minor part of her consciousness probed ceaselessly seeking the reason until with a stabbing rush like a touched nerve it filled her mind againthe bronze fury of them the child become an intent and voiceless automaton of fear bayards bleeding head chiseled and calm and cold then the long effort of thrusting him without her bastions again aunt sally fumbled her colored scraps together and returned them to their receptacle and rose and said goodnight and hobbled from the room narcissa sat and turned the pages on hearing the other mount the stairs with measured laborious tappings of her ebony stick and for a while longer she read with a mounting crescendo of nervous effort for a paragraph or two sometimes for a page the book would absorb her then again she would find her muscles tensing as she relived the afternoon she flung the book away and returned to the piano again determined to exorcise it but aunt sally thumped on the floor overhead with her stick and she desisted and returned to her discarded book so it was with actual relief that she greeted dr alford shortly after i was passing and heard your piano he said you havent stopped she explained that aunt sally had gone to bed and he sat formally and talked to her in his cultured pedantic voice on cold and erudite subjectsfor two hours then he departed and she stood in the door and watched him down the drive the moon stood in the sky along the drive cedars in a grave descending curve were pointed inkyandmotionless on the pale faintly spangled sky and upon the unstirring silver air the thin stringent odor of them lay like an exhalation she returned to the living room and got her book and turned out the lights and mounted tie stairs across the corridor aunt sally snored with genteel placidity and narcissa stood for a moment listening to the homely noise i will be glad when horry gets home she thought going on she turned on her light and undressed and took her book to bed where she again held her consciousness deliberately submerged as you hold a puppy under water until its body ceases to resist and after a time her mind surrendered wholly to the book and she read on pausing to think warmly of sleep reading a page more and so when tie negroes first blended their instruments beneath her window she paid them only the most perfunctory notice why in the world are those jellybeans serenading me she thought with faint amusement visioning immediately aunt sally in her nightcap leaning from a window and shouting them away but in the midst of this amusing picture she satbolt upright with a sharp and utter certainty then she rose and entered the adjoining room and looked out the window the negroes were grouped on the lawn in the moonlight the frosted clarinet the guitar the grave comic bulk of the viol at the street entrance to the drive a motor car loomed in shadow whose and occupied by whom she could not discern the musicians played once then they retreated across the lawn and down the drive and presently the car drove on without lights it was he no one else would play one tune beneath a ladys midnight window just enough to waken her from sleep then go away she returned to her room the book lay face downward on the bed but the labor was undone again and she stood for a while at her window between the parted curtains looking out upon the black and silver world and the peaceful night the air moved upon her face and amid the fallen dark wings of her hair with grave coolness but inwardlythe beast the beast she whispered to herself she let the curtains fall and on her silent feet she descended the stairs again and sought the telephone in the darkness she miffled its bell with her fingers when she rang miss jennys voice came out of the night with its usual brisk and cold asperity and without surprise or curiosity no he had not returned home for he was now safely locked up in jail she believed unless the city officers were too corrupted to obey a ladys request serenading fiddlesticks what would he want to go serenading for he couldnt injure himself serenading unless someone killed him with a flat iron or an alarm clock and why was she concerned about him narcissa hung up and for a moment she stood in the darkness beating her fists on the telephones unresponsive box the beast the beast she had received three callers that night one came formally and with intent the second came informally and without any particular effort to remain anonymous or otherwise the third came anonymously and with calculated intent the garage which sheltered her car was a small brick building surrounded by evergreens one side of it was a continuation of the garden wall beyond the wall a grassgrown lane led back to another street the garage was about fifteen yards from the house and its roof rose to the level of the second story of the house narcissas bedroom windows looked out upon the slate roof of it this third caller entered by the lane and mounted onto the wall and thence onto the garage roof where he now lay in the shadow of a cedar branching above it sheltered so from the moon he had lain there for a long time the room facing him was dark when he arrived but he had iain in his fastness quiet as an animal and with an animals patience without movement save to occasionally raise his head and reconnoiter the immediate scene with covert dartings of hiseyes but the room facing him remained dark after the first hour had passed in the meantime a car entered the drive he recognized it he knew every car in town and a man entered the house the second hour passed and the room was still dark and still the car stood in the drive then the man emerged again and drove away and a moment later the window facing him glowed suddenly and beyond the sheer curtains her figure moved across his vision he watched her move about the room beyond the gauzy veil of the curtains watched the shadowy motions of her disrobing then she passed out of his vision but the light still burned and he lay with a still and infinite patience lay so while another hour passed and another car stopped in the street and three men carrying an awkwardly shaped burden came up the drive and stepped into the moonlight beneath her window and stopped there lay so until they played their music and went away again when they had gone she came to the window and parted the curtains and stood for a while in the dark fallen wings of her hair looking directly into his hidden eyes then the curtains fell again and once more she was a shadowy movement beyond them then the light went off and he lay face down on the steep pitch of the garage roof utterly motionless for a long time darting from beneath his hidden face covert ceaseless glances quick and darting and allembracing as those of an animal to narcissas house they came finally they had visited the dark homes of all the other unmarried girls one by one and sat in the car while the negroes stood on the lawn with their blended instruments heads had appeared at darkened windows sometimes lights went up once they were invited in but hub and mitch hung diffidently back once refreshment was sent out to them once they were heartily cursed by a young man who happened to be sitting with the young lady on the dark veranda in the meantime they had lost the breather cap and as they moved from house to house all six of them drank fraternally from the jug turn and turn about at last theyreached the benbows and the negroes crossed the lawn and played beneath the cedars there was a light yet in one window but none came to it the moon stood far down the sky its light was now a sourceless silver upon things spent and a little coldlywearied and the world was empty for them as they rolled without lights along a street lifeless and fixed in blackandsilver as any street in the moon itself beneath stippled intermittent shadows they passed crossed quiet intersections of streets dissolving away occasionally a car motionless at the curb before a house a dog crossed the street ahead of them trotting and went on across a lawn and so from sight intently but without haste but saving this there was no movement anywhere the square opened spaciously about the absinthecloudy mass of elms that framed the courthouse among them the round spaced globes were more like huge pallid grapes than ever above the exposed vault in each of the banks burned a single bulb inside the hotel lobby before which a few cars were aligned with their rears outward another burned with a hushed glow other lights there were none they circled the courthouse and a shadow moved near the hotel door and detached itself from shadow and came to the curb and stood there its white shirt glinting dully between the lax wings of dark coat and as the slow car swung away toward another street the man hailed them bayard slowed and stopped and the man came through the blanched dust and laid his hand on the door hi buck mitch said youre up pretty late aintyou the man had a sober goodnatured horses face and he wore a metal star on his unbuttoned waistcoat his coat humped slightly on his hip what you boys doin he asked been to a dance havinga little party bayard answered want a drink buck no much obligedhe stood with his hand on the door gravely and goodnaturedly serious aint you fellers out kind of late yourselves it is getting on mitch agreed the marshal lifted his foot to the running board beneath his hat his eyeswere in shadow were going in now mitch said the other mused quietly and bayard added sure were on our way home now the officer stood quietly for a moment then he moved his head slightly and spoke to the negroes ireckon you boys are about ready to turn in aint you yes suh the negroes answered in chorus and they got out and lifted the bass viol out bayard gave reno a bill and they thanked him and picked up the viol and departed quietly down a side street the officer paid them no further heed aint that yo car in front of rogerscafé mitch he asked i reckon so thats where i left it well suppose you run hub out home lessen hes goin to stay in town tonight bayard better come withme aw hell buck mitch protested what for bayarddemanded his folks are worried about him the other said addressing mitch and hub they aint seen hide nor hair of him since that stallion fell

bayard mad than miss jenny the other answered patiently you boys go on and bayard better come with me mitch and hub got out and hub lifted out his jug and they said goodnight and crossed the square to where mitchs ford stood before the restaurant the marshal got in beside bayard and he drove on the jail was not far it loomed presently above its walled court square and implacable its slitted upper windows brutal as sabre blows they turned into an alley and the marshal got out and opened a gate bayard drove into the grassless littered court and stopped while the other crossed the yard to a small garage in which stood a ford car he backed this out and motioned bayard forward the garage was built to the fords dimensions and when the nose of bayards long car touched the back wall a good quarter of it was still out of doors bettern nothing though the marshal saidcome on they entered through the kitchen into the jailkeepers living quarters and bayard stood in a dark passage while the other fumbled with hushed sounds ahead of him then a light came on and they entered a bleak neat room with spare conglomerate furniture and a few articles of masculine apparel about say bayard objected arent you giving me your bed wont need it befo mawnin the other answeredyoull be gone then want me to hep you off with yodothes no im all right then more graciouslygoodnight buck and much obliged goodnight the marshal answered he closed the door behind him and bayard removed his coat and shoes and his tie and snapped the light off and lay on the bed moonlight seeped into the room impalpably refracted and sourceless the night was without any sound beyond the window a cornice rose in successive shallow steps beyond that the sky was opaline and dimensionless his head was dear and col a the whisky he had drunk was completely dead or rather it was as though his head were one bayard who watched curiously and impersonally that other bayard who lay in a strange bed and whose alcoholdulled nerves radiated like threads of ice through that body which he must drag forever about a bleak and barren world with him hell he said lying on his back staring out the window where nothing was to be seen waiting for sleep not knowing if it would come or not not caring a particular damn either way nothing to be seen and the long long span of a mans natural life three score and ten years to drag a stubborn body about the world and cozen its insistent demands three score and ten the bible said seventy years and hie was only twentysix not much more than a third through it hell three horace benbow in his clean wretchedly fitting khaki which but served to accentuate his air of fine and delicate futility and laden with an astonishing impedimenta of knapsacks and kitbags and paperwrapped parcels got off the twothirty train his sister called to him across the tight clotting of descending and ascending passengers and he roved his distraught gaze like a somnambulist rousing with an effort to avoid traffic about the agglomerate faces hello hello he said then he thrust himself clear and laid his bags and parcels on the edge of the platform and moved with intent haste up the train toward the baggage ear horace his sister called again running after him the station agent emerged from his office and stopped him and held him like a finely bred restive horse and shook his hand and thus his sister overtook him he turned at her voice and came completely from out his distraction and swept her up in his arms until her feet were off the ground and kissed her on the mouth dear old narcy he said kissing her again then he set her down and stroked his hands on her face as a child would dear old narcy he repeated touching her face with his fine spatulate hands gazing at her as though he were drinking that constant serenityof hers through his eyes he continued to repeatdear old narcy stroking his hands on her faceutterly oblivious of his surroundings until she recalled him where in the world are you going up this way then he remembered and released her and rushed on she following and stopped again at the door of the baggage car from which the station porter and a trainband were taking trunks and boxes as the baggage clerk tilted them out cant you send down for it she asked but he stood peering into the car oblivious of her again the two negroes returned and he stepped aside still looking into the car with peering birdlike motions of his head lets send back for it his sister said again what oh ive seen it every time i changed cars he told her completely forgetting the sense of her words itd be rotten luck to have it go astray right at my doorstep wouldnt it again the negroes moved away with a trunk and he stepped forward again and peered into the car thats just about what happened to it some clerk forgot to put it on thetrain at m there it is he interrupted himself easy now cap he called in the country idiom in a fever of alarm as the clerk slammed into the door a box of foreign shape and stenciled with a military address shes got glass in her all right colonel the baggage clerk agreed we aint hurt her none i reckon if we have all you got to do is sue us the two negroes backed up to the door and horace laid his delicate impractical hands on the box as the clerk tilted it expertly outward easy now boys he repeated nervously and he trotted beside them to the platform set it down easy now here sis lend a hand will you we got it all right capm the station porter said we aint gwine drop it but horace continued to dab at it with his hands and as they set it down he leaned his head to it listening shes all right on de inside aint she its all right the train porter assured him he turned away lets go he called i think its all right horace agreed his ear against the box i dont hear anything its packed pretty well the engine blew two blasts and horace sprang erect digging into his pocket and ran to the moving cars the porter was just closing the vestibule but he leaned down to horaces extended hand and straightened up and touched his cap horace returned to his box and gave another coin to the station porter put it inside for me careful now ill be back for it soon yes suh mr benbow ill look out fer it i thought it was lost once he confided dipping his arm inside his sisters and they retraced their steps toward the car it was delayed at brest and didnt come until the next boat i had the first outfit i gota small onewith me and i pretty near lost that one too i was blowing a small one in my cabin on the boat one afternoon when the whole thing cabin and all took fire the captain decided that id better not try it again until we got ashore with all the men on board the vase turned out pretty well though he babbled lovely little thing im catching on i really am venice is a lovely place he added must take you there some day then he squeezed her arm and fell to repeating dear old narcy as though the homely sound of the nickname on his tongue was a taste he loved and had not forgotten a few people still lingered about the station some of them spoke to him and he stopped to shaketheir hands and a marine private with the second division indian head on his shoulder remarked the triangle on horaces sleeve and made a vulgar sound of derogation through his pursed lips howdy buddy horace said turning upon the other his shy startled gaze evenin general the marine answered he spat not exactly at horaces feet and not exactly anywhere else narcissa clamped her brothers arm against her side with her elbow do come on home and get into some decent clothes she said in a lower tone hurrying him along get out of uniform he said i rather fancied myself in khaki he said a little hurt you really think i am ridiculous in this he asked quietly of course not she answered immediately squeezing his hand im sorry i said that you wear it just as long as you want to its a good uniform he said soberly people will realize that in about ten years when noncombatants hysteria has worn itself out and the individual soldiers realize that the aef didnt invent disillusion what did it invent she asked holding his arm against her surrounding him with the fond inattentive serenity of her affection god knowsdear old narcy he said again and they crossed the side track and approached her car so you have dulled your palate for khaki of course not she answered shaking his arm a little you wear it just as long as you want to she opened the car door someone called after themand they looked back and saw the porter trotting after them with horaces handluggage which he had walked off and left lying on the platform oh lord horace said i worry with it for fourthousand miles then lose it on my own doorstep much obliged solhe extended his hands but the porter came up and stowed the things in the car thats the first outfit i got he added to his sister and the vase i blew on shipboard ill show it to you when we get home his sister got in under the wheel where are your clothes in the box i havent got any had to throw most of em away to make room for the other stuff no room for anything else narcissa looked at him for a moment with fond fretted annoyance whats the matter he asked innocently forget something yourself no get in aunt sallys waiting to see you they drove on and mounted the shady gradual hill toward the square and horace looked about happily upon familiar quiet scenes some new tight little houses with minimum of lawnhomes built by countrybred people and set close to the street after the country fashion occasionally a house going up on a lot that was vacant sixteen months ago when he went away other streets stretched away shadier with houses a little older and a little more imposing as they got away from the stations vicinity and pedestrians usually old men bound townward after their naps to spend the afternoon in grave futile absorptions the hill flattened away into the plateau on which the town proper had been built these hundred and more years ago and the street became definitely urban presently with garages and small new shops with merchants in shirtsleeves and customers the picture show with its lobby plastered with life in colored lithographic mutations then the square withits unbroken low skyline of old weathered brick and fading dead names stubborn yet beneath the superimposed recenter ones and drifting negroes in casual od garments worn by both sexes and country people in occasional khaki too and their more brisk urban brethren weaving among their placid chewing unhaste and among the sitting groups in chairs before certain stores the courthouse was of brick top with stone arches rising among elms and among the trees the monument of the confederate soldier stood like a white candle beneath the porticos of the courthouse and upon benches about the green the city fathers sat and talked and drowsed in uniform too now and then but it was the grey of jackson and beauregard and johnston and they sat in a sedate gravity of minor political sinecures murmuring and smoking and spitting about unhurried checkerboards when the weather was bad they moved inside to the circuit clerks office it was here that the young men loafed also pitching dollars or tossing baseballs back and forth or lying on the grass until the young girls in their little colored dresses and cheap nostalgic perfume came trooping down town through the late afternoon to the drug store when the weather was bad the young men loafed in the drug stores or in the barber shop lots of uniforms yethorace said all be home by june have the sartoris boys come home yet john is dead his sister answered didnt you know no he answered quickly with swift concern poor old bayard rotten luck they have funny family always going to wars and always getting killed and bayards wife died you wrote me yes but bayards here hes got a racing automobile and he spends all his time tearing around the country we are expecting every day tohear hes killed himself init poor devilhorace said and again poor old colonel he used to hate an automobile like a snake wonder what he thinks about it he goes with him what oldbayard in amotor car yes miss jenny says its to keep bayard from breaking his fool neck but she says colonel sartoris doesnt know it but that bayard would just as soon break both their necks that he probably will before hes done she drove on across the square among tethered wagons and cars parked casually and without order i hate bayard sartoris she said with sudden vehemence i hate all men horace looked at her quickly whats the matter whats bayard done to you no thats backward what have you done to bayard but she didnt answer she turned into another street bordered by negro stores of one story and shaded by metal awnings beneath which negroes lounged skinning bananas or small florid cartons of sweet cakes and then a grist mill driven by a spasmodic gasoline engine it oozed chaff and a sifting dust motelike in the sun and above the door a tediously handlettered sign wc beards mill between it and a shuttered and silent gin draped with feathery soiled festoons of old lint an anvil clanged at the end of a short lane filled with wagons and horses and mules and shaded by mulberry trees beneath which countrymen in overalls squatted he ought to have more consideration for the old fellow than that horace said fretfully still theyve just gone through with an experience that pretty wellshook the verities and the humanities and whether they know it or not theyve got another one ahead of em thatll finish the business give him a little timebut i personally cant see why they dont let him go ahead and kill himself if thats what he wants sorry for miss jenny though yes his sister agreed quietly again theyre worried about colonel sartoris heart too everybody except him and bayard that is im glad i have you instead of one of those sartorises horry she laid her hand quickly and lightly on his thin knee dear old narcy he said then his face clouded again damn scoundrel he said well its their trouble hows aunt sally been all right and then i am glad youre home again the shabby small shops were behind and now the street opened away between old shady lawns spacious and quiet these homes were quite old in actuality or appearance at least and set well back from the street and its dust they emanated a gracious and benign peace steadfast as a windless afternoon in a world without motion or sound horace looked about him and drew a long breath perhaps this is the reason for wars he said the meaning of peace the meaning of peace they turned into an intersecting street narrower but more shady and even quieter with a golden arcadian drowse and drove through a gate in a honeysucklecovered fence of iron pickets from the gate the cinderpacked drive rose in a grave curve between cedars the cedars had been set out by an english architect of the forties who had built the house with the minor concessionof a veranda in the funereal light tudor which the young victoria had sanctioned and beneath and among them even on the brightest days lay a resinous exhilarating gloom mockingbirds loved them and catbirds and thrushes demurely mellifluous in the late afternoon but the grass beneath them was sparse or not at all and there were no insects save fireflies in the dusk the drive ascended to the house and curved before it and descended again to the street in an unbroken arc of cedars within the arc rose a lone oak tree broad and huge and low around its trunk ran a wooden bench about this halfmoon of lawn and without the arc of the drive were bridal wreath and crepemyrtle bushes old as time and huge as age would make them big as trees they were and in one fence corner was an astonishing clump of stunted banana palms and in the other a lantana with its clotted wounds which francis benbow had brought home from barbados in a tophatbox in about the oak and from the funereal scimitar of the drive lawn flowed streetward with good sward broken by random clumps of jonquil and narcissus and gladiolus originally the lawn was in terraces and the flowers constituted a formal bed on the first terrace then will benbow horace and narcissas father had had the terraces obliterated it was done with plows and scrapers and the lawn was seeded anew with grass and he had supposed the flower bed destroyed but the next spring the scattered bulbs sprouted again and now every year the lawn was stippled with bloom in yellow white and pink without order neighbors children played quietly beneath the cedars and a certain few young girls asked and received permission to pick some of the flowers each spring at the top of the drive whereit curved away descending again sat the brick dolls house in which horace and narcissa lived surrounded always by that cool faintlystringent odor of cedar trees it was trimmed with white and it had mullioned casements brought out from england along the veranda eaves and above the door grew a wisteria vine like heavy tarred rope and thicker than a mans wrist the lower casements stood open upon gently billowing curtains of white dimity upon the sill you expected to see a scrubbed wooden bowl or at least an immaculate and supercilious cat but the window all held only a wicker work basket from which like a drooping poinsettia spilled an end of patchwork in crimson and white and in the doorway aunt sally a potty little woman in a lace cap leaned upon a goldheaded ebony walkingstick just as it should be and horace turned and looked back at his aster crossing the drive with the parcels he had forgotten again the meaning of peace he banged and splashed happily in his bathroom shouting through the door to his sister where she sat on his bed his discarded khaki lay upon a chair holding yet through long association in its harsh drab folds something of life taut and delicate futility on the old marbletopped dresser lay the crucible and tubes of his glassblowing outfit the first one he had bought and beside it the vase he had blown on shipboarda small chaste shape in clear glass not four inches high fragile as a silver lily and incomplete they work in caves he was shouting through the door down flights of stairs underground you feel water seeping under your foot while you arereaching for the next step and when you put your hand out to steady yourself against the wall its wet when you take it away it feels just like blood horace yes magnificent and way ahead you see the glow all of a sudden the tunnel comes glimmering out of nothing then you see the furnace with things rising and falling in front of it cutting the light off and the walls go glimmering again at first theyre just shapeless things hunching about antic with shadows on the wet walls red shadows a dull red gleam and black shapes like cardboard cutouts rising and falling like a magiclantern shutter and then a face comes out blowing and the other faces sort of swell out of the red dark like painted balloons and the things themselves sheerly and tragically beautiful like preserved flowers you know macabre and inviolate purged and purified as bronze yet fragile as soap bubbles sound of pipes crystallized flutes and oboes but mostly reeds oaten reeds dammit they bloom like flowers right before your eyes midsummer nights dream to a salamander his voice became unintelligible soaring into phrases which she did not herself recognize but from the pitch of his voice she knew were miltons archangels in their sonorous plunging ruin presently he emerged in a white shirt and serge trousers but still borne aloft on his flaming verbal wings and while his voice chanted in measured syllables she fetched a pair of shoes from the closet and while she stood holding the shoes he ceased and touched her face again with his hands after that fashion of a child at supper aunt sally broke into his staccato babbling did you bring your snopes back with yon she asked this snopes was a young man member of a seemingly inexhaustible family which for the last ten or twelve years had been moving to town in driblets from a small settlement known as frenchmans bend flem the first snopes had appeared unheralded one day and without making a ripple in the towns life behind the counter of a small restaurant on a side street patronized by country people with this foothold and like abraham of old he led his family piece by piece into town flem himself was presently manager of the city light and water plant and for the following few years he was a sort of handyman to the city government and three years ago to old bayard sartoris profane surprise and unconcealed disapproval he became vicepresident of the sartoris bank where already a relation of his was a bookkeeper he still retained the restaurant and the canvas tent in the rear of it in which he and his wife and baby had passed the first few months of their residence in town and it served as an alightingplace for incoming snopeses from which they spread to small thirdrate businesses of various kindsgrocery stores barber shops there was one an invalid of some sort with a secondhand peanut parcher where they multiplied and flourished the older residents from their jeffersonian houses and genteel stores and offices looked on with amusement at first but this was long since become something like consternation the snopes to which aunt sally referred was named montgomery ward and he had just turned twentyone in and just before the draft law went into effect he applied to a recruiting officer in memphis and was turned down because of his heart later somewhat to everyones surprise particularly that of horace benbows friends he departed with horace to a position in the yjvga later still it was told of him that he had travelled all the way to memphis on that day he offered himself for service with a plug of chewing tobacco beneath his left armpit but he and his patron had already gone when that story got out did you bring your snopes back with you aunt sally asked no he answered and his thin nervesick face clouded with a fine cold distaste i was very much disappointed in him i dont even care to talk about anybody could have told you that when you left aunt sally said chewing slowly above her plate horace brooded for a moment his thin hand tightened slowly about his fork ifs individuals like that parasites he began but his sister interrupted who cares about an old snopes anyway she said besides its too late at night to talk about the horrors of war aunt sally made a moist sound through her food of vindicated superiority its the generals they have nowadays she said general johnston or general forrest wouldnt have took a snopes in his army aunt sally was no relation at all she lived next door but one with two maiden sisters one younger and one older than she she had been in and out of the house ever since horace and narcissa could remember having arrogated to herself certain rights in their lives before they could walk rights which were never expressed and which she never availed herself of yet the mutual understanding of which she never permitted to fallinto desuetude she would walk into any of the rooms unannounced and she liked to talk tediously and a little tactlessly of horaces and narcissas infantile ailments it was said that she had once made eyes at will benbow although she was a woman of thirtyfour or five when will married and she still spoke of him with a faintly disparaging possessiveness and of his wife she spoke nicely too juliawas a right sweetnatured girl aunt sally would say so when horace went off to the war aunt sally moved over to keep narcissa company no other arrangement had ever occurred to any one of the three of them aunt sally was a good old soul but she lived much in the past shutting her intelligence with a bland finality to anything which had occurred since for her time had gone out drawn by horses and into her stubborn and placid vacuum the squealing of automobile brakes had never penetrated aunt sally had a lot of the crudities which old people are entitled to she liked the sound of her own voice and she didnt like to be alone in the house after dark and as she had never got accustomed to her false teeth and so never touched them other than to change occasionally the water in which they sat she ate unprettily of unprepossessing but easily malleable foods narcissa reached her hand beneath the table and squeezed her brothers knee i am glad youre home horry he looked at her quickly and the cloud faded from his face as suddenly as it had come and he let himself slip as into water into the constant serenity of her affection again he was a lawyer principally through a sense of duty to the family tradition and though he had no particular affinity to it other than a love for printed words for the dwellingplaces of books he contemplated returning to his musty office with a glow ofnot eagerness no of deep and abiding unreluctance almost of pleasure the meaning of peace old unchanging days unwinged perhaps but undisastrous too you dont see it feel it save with perspective fireflies had not yet come and the cedars flowed unbroken on either hand down to the street like a curving ebony wave with rigid unbreaking crests pointed on the sky light fell outward from the casement across the porch and upon a bed of cannas hardy bronzelikenone of your flowerlike fragility theirs and within the room aunt sallys quavering monotone narcissa was there too beside the lamp with a book filling the room with her still and constant presence like the odor of jasmine watching the door and horace stood on the dark veranda with his cold pipe surrounded by that cool faintlystringent scent of cedar trees like another presence the meaning of peace he said to himself again releasing the grave words one by one within the cool bell of silence into which he bad come at last again hearing them linger with a dying fall pure as silver and crystal struck lightly together hows belle he asked on theevening of his arrival home theyre all right his sister answered they have a new car dare say horace agreed with detachment the war should certainly have accomplished that much aunt sally had left them at last and tapped her slow bedward way horace stretched his serge legs luxuriously and for a while he ceased striking matches to his stubborn pipe and sat watching his sisters dark head bent above the magazine upon her knees lost from lesser and inconstant things her hair was smoother than any reposing wings sweeping with burnished unrebellion to a simple knot low on her neck belles a rotten correspondent he added like all women she turned a pale without looking up did you write to her often its because they realize that letters are only good to bridge intervals between actions like the interludes in shakespeares plays he went on oblivious and did you ever know a woman who read shakespeare without skipping the interludes shakespeare himself knew that so he didnt put any women in the interludes let the men bombast to one anothers echoes while the ladies were backstage washing the dinner dishes or putting the children to bed i never knew a woman who read shakespeare narcissa corrected he talks too much horace rose and stood above her and patted her dark head o profundity he said you have reduced all wisdom to a phrase arid measured your sex by the stature of astar well they dont she repeated raising her head no why dont they he struck another match to his pipe watching her across his cupped hands as gravely and with poised eagerness like a striking bird your arlens and sabatinis talk a lot and nobody ever had more to say and more trouble saying it than old dreiser but they have secrets she explained shakespeare doesnt have any secrets he tells everything i see shakespeare had no sense of discrimination and no instinct for reticence in other words he wasnt a gentleman he suggested yesthats what i mean and so to be a gentleman you must have secrets oh you make me tired she returned to her magazine and he sat beside her on the couch and took her hand in his and stroked it upon his cheek and upon the fine devastation of his hair its like walking through a twilit garden he said happily the flowers you know are all there in their shifts and with their hair combed out for the night but you know all of them so you dont bother em you just walk on and sort of stop and turn over a leaf occasionally a leaf you didnt notice before perhaps you find a violet under it or a bluebell or a lightning bug perhaps only another leaf or a blade of grass but theres always a drop of dew on it he continued to stroke her hand upon his face with her other hand she turned the magazine slowly on listening to him with her fond serene detachment did you write to belle often she repeated what did you say to her i wrote what she wanted to read what all women want in letters people are really entitled to half of what they think they ought to have you know what did you tell her narcissa persisted turning the pages slowly without looking up her passive hand in his following the stroking movement of his itold her i was unhappy perhaps i was he added his sister freed her hand quietly and laid it on the page he said i admire belle shes so cannily stupid once i feared her perhapsno i dont i am immune to destruction i have a magic which is a good sign that i am due for it say the sages headded lightly but then acquired wisdom is a drything it has a way of crumbling to dust where a sheer and blind coursing of stupid sap is impervious he sat without touching her in a rapt and instantaneous repose not like yours o serene he said waking again then he fell to saying dear old narcy and again he took her hand it did not withdraw neither did it wholly surrender i dont think you ought to say im dull so often horry she said soberly neither do i he agreed but i must take some sort of revenge on perfection later she lay in her dark room across the corridor aunt sally snored with placid regularity in the adjoining room horace lay while that wild fantastic futility of his voyaged in lonely regions of its own beyond the moon about meadows nailed with firmamented stars to the ultimate roof of things where unicorns filled the neighing air with galloping or grazed or lay supine in latent and goldenhooved repose horace was seven when she had been born in the background of her sober babyhood were three beings whose lives and conduct she had adopted with rapt intensitya lad with a wild thin face and an unflagging aptitude for tribulation a darkly gallant shape romantic with smuggled edibles and with strong hard hands smelling always of a certain thrilling carbolic soapa being something like omnipotence but without awesomeness and lastly a gentle figure without legs or any inference of locomotion like a minor shrine surrounded always by an aura of gentle melancholy and an endless delicate manipulation of colored silken thread this last figure was constant with a gentle and melancholy unassertion the second revolved in an orbit which bore it at regular intervals into outer space then returned it with its strong and jolly virility into her intense world again but the first she had made her own by a sober and maternal perseverance and so by the time she was five or six people coerced horace by threatening to tell narcissa on him julia benbow died genteellyand irreproachably when narcissa was seven and horace fourteen had been removed from their livesas a small sachet of lavender is removed from a chest of linen leaving a delicate lingering impalpability and slept now amid pointed cedars and doves and serene marble shapes thus narcissa acquired two masculine destinies to control and shape and through the intense maturity of seven and eight and nine she cajoled and threatened and commanded and very occasionally stormed them into concurrence and so through fourteen and fifteen and sixteen while horace was first at sewanee and later at oxford then will benbows time came and he joined his wife julia among the marbles and the cedars and the doves and the current of her maternalism had now but a single channel for a time this current was dammed by a stupid mischancing of human affairs but now horace was home again and lay now beneath the same roof and the same recurrence of days and the channel was undammed again why dont you marry and let that baby look after himself for a while miss jenny du pre had demanded once in her cold abrupt way perhaps when she too was eighty all men would be sartorises to her also but that was a long time away sartorises she thought of bayard but briefly and without any tremor at all he was now no more than the shadow of a hawks flight mirrored fleetingly by the windlesssurface of pool and gone where the pool knew and cared not leaving no stain he settled into the routine of days between office and home the musty solemn familiarity of calfbound and neverviolated volumes on whose dusty bindings prints of will benbows dead fingers could yet have been found a little tennis in the afternoons usually on harry mitchells fine court cards in the evenings also with belle and harry usually or again and better still with the ever accessible and neverfailing magic of printed pages while his sister beyond the lamp from rum filled the room with that constant untroubling serenity of hers in which his spirit drowsed like a swimmer on a tideless summer sea aunt sally had returned home with her bag of colored scraps and her false teeth leaving behind her a fixed impalpability of a nebulous but definite obligation conferred at some personal sacrifice as was her way and a faint odor of old female flesh which faded from the rooms slowly lingering yet in unexpected places so that at times narcissa waking and lying for a while in the darkness in the sensuous pleasure of having horace home again imagined that she could hear yet in the dark myriad silence of the house aunt sallys genteel and placid snores at times it would be so distinct that she would pause suddenly and speak aunt sallys name into an empty room and sometimes aunt sally replied having availed herself again of her prerogative of coming in at any hour the notion took her unannounced to see how they were getting along and tocomplain querulously of her own household she was old too old to react easily to change and it was hard for her to readjust herself to her sisters ways again after her long sojourn in a household where everyone gave in to her regarding all domestic affairs at home her older sister ran things in a capable shrewish fashion she and the third aster persisted in treating aunt sally like the child she had been sixtyfive years ago whose diet and clothing and hours must be rigorously and pettishly supervised i cant even go to the bathroom in peace she complained querulously pm a good mind to pack up and move back over here and let em get along the best way they can she rocked fretfully in the chair which by unspoken agreement was never disputed her looking about the room with her bleared old eyes that nigger dont half clean up since i left that furniture nowadampcloth i wish you would take her back miss sophia the elder aster told narcissa shes got so crochety since shes been with you that theres no living with her whats this i hear horaces taken up making glassware his proper crucibles and retorts had arrived intact at first he had insisted on using the cellar clearing out the lawn mower and the garden tools and all the accumulate impedimenta and walling up the windows so as to make a dungeon of it but narcissa had finally persuaded him upon the upper floor of the garage and here he had set up his furnace and had had four mishaps and produced one almost perfect vase of clear amber larger more richly and chastely serene and which he kept always on his night table and called by his sisters name in the intervals of apostrophizing both of them impartially in his moments of rhapsody over the realization of the meaning ofpeace and the unblemished attainment of it as thou still unravished bride of quietude at times he found himself suddenly quiet a little humble in the presence of the happiness of his winged and solitary cage for a cage it was barring him from freedom with trivial compulsions but he desired a cage a topless cage of course that his spirit might wing on short excursions into the blue but far afield his spirit did not desire to go its direction was always upward plummeting for a plummeting fall still unchanging days they were doomed days he knew it yet for the time being his devious and uncontrollable impulses had become one with the rhythm of things as a swimmers counter muscles become one with a current and cage and all his life grew suave with motion oblivious of destination during this period not only did his immediate days become starkly inevitable but the dead thwarted ones with all the spent and ludicrous disasters which his nature had incurred upon him grew lustrous in retrospect and without regret and those to come seemed as undeviating and logical as mathematical formulae beyond an incurious golden veil at sewanee where he had gone as his father before him he had been an honor man in his class as a rhodes scholar he had gone to oxford there to pursue the verities and humanities with that waiting law office in a mississippi country town like a gate in the remote background through which he must someday pass thinking of it not often and with no immediate perspective accepting it with neither pleasure nor regret here amid the mellow benignance of these walls was a perfect life a life accomplishing itself placidly in a region remote from time and into which the worlds noises came onlyfrom afar and with only that glamorous remote significance of a parade passing along a street far away with inferences of brass and tinselfading beyond far walls into the changeless sky here he developed a reasonably fine discrimination in alcohol and a brilliant tennis game after his erratic electric fashion but save for an occasional half sophomoric half travellingsalesmanish sabbatical to the continent in company with fellowcountrymen his life was a golden and purposeless dream without palpable intent or future with the exception of that law office to which he was reconciled by the sheer and youthful insuperability of distance and time there had come a day on which he stood in that mild pleasurable perplexity in which we regard our belongings and the seemingly inadequate volume of possible packing space coatless among his chaotic possessions slowly rubbing the fine unruly devastation of his head about the bedroom bags and boxes gaped and on the bed on chairs on the floor were spread his clothesjackets and trousers of all kinds and all individual as old friends a servant moved about in the next room and he entered but the man ignored him with silent and deft efficiency and he went on to the window the thin curtains starred to a faint troubling exhalation of late spring he put their gentle billowing aside and lit a cigarette and idly watched the match fall its initial outward impulse fading into a wavering reluctance as though space itself were languid in violation someone crossing the quad called up to him indistinguishably he waved his hand vaguely in reply and sat on the window sill outward above and beyond buildings peaceful and gray and old within and beyond trees in an untarnished and gracious resurgence of green afternoon was like a blonde woman going slowly in awindless garden afternoon and june were likeblonde sisters in a windless gardenclose approachingwithout regret the fall of day walking a littleslower perhaps perhaps looking backward butwithout sadness untroubled as cows horace sat inthe window while the servant methodically reducedthe chaps of his possessions to the boxes and bagsgazing out across ancient gray roofs and trees whichhe had seen in all their seasonal moods in all moodsmatching his own had he been younger he wouldhave said goodbye to them secretively or defiantlyolder he would have felt neither the desire to northe impulse to suppress it so he sat quietly in hiswindow for the last time while the curtains stirreddelicately against his hair brooding upon theirdreaming vistas where twilight was slowly finding itself and where beyond dissolving spires lingeredgrave evening shapes and he knew a place wherehad he felt like walking he could hear a cuckoo thatsymbol of sweet and timeless mischief that augur of the fever renewed again all he wanted anyway was quiet and dull peace arid a few women preferablyyoung and good looking and fair tennis players with whom to indulge in harmless and lazy intrigue so his mind was made up and on the homeward boat he framed the words with which he should tell his father that he was going to be an episcopal minister but when he reached new york the wire waited him saying that will benbow was ill and all thoughts of his future fled his mind during the journey home and during the two subsequent days that his father lived then will benbow was buried beside his wife and aunt sally wyatt was sombrely ubiquitous about the house and talked with steady macabre complacence of will at mealsand snored placidly by night inthe guest room thenext day but one horace opened his fathers lawoffice again his practice what there was of it consisted of polite interminable litigation that progressed decorously and pleasantly from conference to conference the greater part of which were given to discussions of the worlds mutations as exemplified by men or by printed words conferences conducted as often as not across pleasant dinner tables or upon golf links or if the conferee were active enough upon tennis courtconferences which wended their endless courses without threat of consummation or of advantage or detriment to anyone involved there reposed also in a fireproof cabinet in his officethe one concession will benbow had ever made to progressnumber of wills which horace had inherited and never read the testators of which accomplished their lives in black silk and lace caps and an atmosphere of formal and timeless desuetude in stately highceiled rooms screened from the ceaseless world by flowering shrubs and old creeping vines existences circumscribed by church affairs and socalled literary clubs and a conscientious slightly contemptuous preoccupation with the welfare of remote and obtusely ungrateful heathen peoples they did not interest themselves in civic affairs to interfere in the lives or conduct of people whom you saw daily or who served you in various ways or to whose families you occasionally sent food and castoff clothing was not genteel besides the heathen was far enough removed from his willynilly elevation to annoy no one save his yet benighted brethren clients upon whom he called at rare intervals by formal and unnecessary request and who bade fair to outlive him as they had outlived his father and to beheired in turn by some yet uncorporeal successor to him as if god circumstance looking down upon the gracious if faintly niggard completeness of their lives found not the heart to remove them from surroundings tempered so peacefully to their requirements to any other of lesser decorum and charm the meaning of peace one of those instants in a mans life a neap tide in his affairs when as though with a premonition of disaster the moment takes on a sort of fixed clarity in which his actions and desires stand boldly forth unshadowed and rhythmic one with another like two steeds drawing a angle chariot along a smooth empty road and during which the i in him stands like a tranquil deciduated tree above the sere and ludicrous disasters of his days narcissa had failed to call at the office for him and he walked home and changed to flannels and the blue jacket with the oxford club insignia embroidered upon the breast pocket and removed his racket from its press in trees and flower beds spring was accomplishing itself more and more with the accumulating days and he walked on with the sunlight slanting into his hair toward belles he strode on chanting to himself walking a little faster until the majestic monstrosity of the house came into view someone piped thinly to him from beyond the adjoining fence it was belles eightyearold daughter her dress of delicate yellow a single note in a chord of other small colored garments engaged in the intense and sober preoccupations of little girls horace waved his racket and went on and turned into belles drive the gravel slipped with short sibilance beneath his rubber soles he did not approach the house but followed instead along the drive toward the rear where already against further sunshot green he saw a figure in white tautly antic with motion they were playing already belle would be there already ensconced in her usual chair ahenobarbus vestal proprietorial and inattentive preeningly dictatorial removed from the dust and the heat and the blood disdainful and the principal actor in the piece o thou grave myrtle shapes amid which petulant death but belle was the sort of watcher he preferred engaged as she would be in that outwardly faultless immersion in the unflagging theatrics of her own part in the picture surrounding him as she would with that atmosphere of surreptitious domesticity belle didnt play tennis herself her legs were not good and belle knew it but sat instead in a tea gown of delicate and irreproachable lines at a table advantageously placed and laden with books and magazines and the temporarily discarded impedimenta of her more atalantaesque sisters there was usually a group around belles chairother young women or a young man or so inactive between sets with an occasional older woman come to see just exactly what was going on or what belle wore at the time watching belles pretty regal airs with the young men like a moving picture aunt sally wyatt said once with cold and curious interest and presently meloney would bring tea out and lay it on the table at belles side between the two of them belle with her semblance of a peahen suave and preening and petulant upon clipped sward before marble urns and formal balustrades and meloney in her starched cap and apron and her lean shining legs they made a rite of the most casualgathering lending a sort of stiffness to it which meloney seemed to bring in on her tray and beneath which the calling ladies grew more and more reserved and coldly watchful and against which belle flowered like a hothouse bloom brilliant and petulant and perverse it had taken belle some time to overcome jeffersons prejudice against a formal meal between dinner and supper and to educate the group in which she moved to tea as a function in itself and not as something to give invalids or as an adjunct to a party of some sort but horace had assisted her unwittingly and without selfconsciousness and there had been a youth son of a carpenter of whom belle had made a poet and sent to new orleans and who being a conscientious objector had narrowly escaped prison during the war and who now served in a reportorial capacity on a texas newspaper holding the position relinquished by a besotted young man who had enlisted in the marine corps early in but educate them she did certain young matrons took to the idea and emulated her and even her husband himself had learned to take his cup horace passed on around the house and there came into view the entire court with its two occupants in fluid violent action beneath an arcade of white pilasters and vinehung beams belle was ensconced like a colorful butterfly surrounded by the fragile harmonious impedimenta of the theatric moment two sat with her above the group a crepemyrtle flowered already the other woman the third member of the group was a young girl in white and with a grave molasses bang and a tennis racket across her knees spoke to him and belle greeted him with a sort of languid possessive desolation her hand was warm prehensile like mercury in his palm exploring softlywith delicate bones and petulant scented flesh belles eyes were like hothouse grapes and her mouth was redly mobile rich with discontent but waked now from its rouged repose this was temporarily lost she had lost meloney she told him meloney saw through your gentility horace said you grew careless probably your elegance is much inferior to meloneys you surely didnt expect to always deceive anyone who can lend as much rigid discomfort to the function of eating and drinking as meloney could did you or has she got married some more shes gone in business belle answered fretfully a beauty shop and why i cant for the life of me see those things never do last here can you imagine jefferson women supporting a beauty shop with the exception of us three mrs marders and i might im sure we need it but what use has frankie for one what seems curious to me the other woman said is where the money came from people thought that perhaps you had given it to her belle since when have i been a public benefactor belle rejoined coldly horace grinned faintly mrs marderssaid now belle we all know how kindhearted you are dont try to conceal it i said a public benefactor belle repeated horace said quickly well harry would swap a handmaiden for an ox any day at least he can save a lot of wear and tear on his cellar not having to counteract your tea in a lot of unrelated masculine tummies i suppose therell be no more tea out here will there dont be silly belle said horace said i realize now that it is not tennis thati came here for but for the incalculable amount of uncomfortable superiority i always get when meloney serves me teai saw your daughter as i came along he added shes somewhere around i suppose belle agreedindifferently you havent had your hair cut yetshe stated why is it that men have no sense aboutbarbers she addressed the other two the olderwoman watched them brightly coldly across hertwo flaccid chins the young girl sat quietly in hersimple virginal white her racket on her lap and onebrown hand lying upon it like a sleeping tan puppyshe was watching horace with sober interest butwithout rudeness as children do they either wontgo to the barber at all or they insist on having their heads all gummed up with pomade and things belle added horace is a poet the other woman said in an admonitory tone her flesh draped loosely from her cheekbones like rich slightly soiled velvet her eyes were like the eyes of an old turkey mucous and predatory and unwinking poets must be excused for what they do you should remember that belle horace bowed in her direction your race never fails intact belle he said mrs marders is one of the few people i know who give the law profession its true evaluation its like any other business i suppose belle said you are late today why didnt narcissa come i mean dubbing me a poet horace explained the law like poetry is the final resort of the lame the halt the imbecile and the blind i dare say caesar invented the law business to protect himself against poets youre so clever belle said the young girl spoke suddenly why do you bother about what men put on their hair miss belle mr mitchells bald the other woman laughed unctuously steadily watching them with her lidless unlaughing eyes she watched belle and horace and still laughed steadily brightly and cold out of the mouths of babes she quoted the young girl glanced from one to another with her clear sober eyes she rose i guess ill see if leant get a set now she said horace moved also lets you and ihe began without turning her head belle touched him with her hand sit down frankie she commanded they havent finished the game yet you shouldnt laugh so much on an empty stomach she told the other woman do sit down horace the girl still stood with slim and awkward grace holding her racket she looked at belle a moment then she turned her head toward the court again horace took the chair beyond belle her hand dropped hidden into his with that secret movement then it grew passive it was as though she had turned a current off somewhere like one entering a dark room in search of something finding it and pressing the light off again dont you like poets frankie horace asked across belles body they cant dance the girl answered without turning her head i guess they are all right though they went to the war the good ones did there was one was a good tennis player that got killed ive seen his picture but i dont remember his name oh dont start talking about the war for heavens sake belle said her hand stirred in horaces but did not withdraw i had to listen to harry for twoyears explaining why he couldnt go as if i cared whether he did or not he had a family to supportmrs marders suggested brightly belle half reclined her head againstthe chairback her hidden hand moving slowly inhoraces exploring turning ceaselessly like a separate volition curious but without warmth some of them were aviators the girl continuedshe now turned the pages of the magazine upon the table she stood with one little unemphatic hipbraced against the tableedge her racket clasped beneath her arm then she dosed the magazine andagain she watched the two figures leanly antic uponthe court i danced with one of those sartoris boysonce i was too scared to know which one it was i wasnt anything but a baby then were they poets horace asked i mean the one thatgot back i know the other one the dead one was he sure can drive that car of his she answered still watching the game her straight hair hers was the first bobbed head in town not brown not gold her brief nose in profile her brown still hands clasping her racket belle stirred and freed her hand do go on and play you all she saidyou make me nervous horace rose with alacrity come on frankie he said lets you and i take emon the girl looked at him im not so hot she said soberly i hope you wont get mad why if we get beat they moved together toward the court where the two players were now exchanging sides do you know what the finest sensation of all is her straight brown head moved just at his shoulder its her dress that makes her armsand hands so brown he thought little he could not remember her at all sixteen months back when he had gone away they grow up so quickly though after a certain age go away again and return and find her with a baby probably good music she suggested tentatively after a time no its to finisha day and say to yourself heres one day during which i have accomplished nothing and hurt no one and had a whale of a good time how does it go count that day lost whose low descending sun well theyve got it exactly backward i dont know i learned it in school i guess sheanswered indifferently but i dont remember itnow dyou reckon theyll let me play im not sohot she repeated of course they will horace assured her and soon they were aligned the two players the bookkeeper in the local department store and a youth who had been recently expelled from the state university for a practical joke he had removed the red lantern from the barrier about a street excavation and hung it above the door of the girls dormitory against horace and the girl horace was an exceptional player electric and brilliant one who knew tennis and who had patience and a cool head could have defeated him out of hand by letting him beat himself but not these the points seesawed back and forth but usually horace managed to retrieve the advantage with stroking or strategy so audacious as to obscure the faultiness of his tactics meanwhile he could watch her her taut earnestness her unflagging determination not to let him down her awkward virginal grace from the back line he outguessed their opponents with detached and impersonal skill keeping the point in abeyance and playing the ball so as to bring her young intentbody into motion as he might pull a puppets strings hers was an awkward speed that cost them points but from the base line horace retrieved her errors when he could pleasuring in the skimpy ballooning of her little dress moulded and dragged by her arms and legs watching the taut revelations of her speeding body in a sort of ecstasy girl white and all thy little oh notpink no for amoment i thought shed no disgraceful her mamma would call it or any other older woman belles are pink o muchly oaten reed above the lyre horace chanted catching the ball at his shoetops with a full swing watching it duck viciouslybeyondthe net oaten reed above the lyre and belle like a harped gesture not sonorous piano perhaps blended chords any way unchaste knowledgeable better knowingly wearied weariedly knowing yes piano fugue fugue of discontent o moon rotting waxed overlong too long last point game and set she made it with savage awkwardness and turned at the net and stood with lowered racket as he approached beneath the simple molasses of her hair the was perspiring a little i kept on letting em get my alley she explained you never bawled me out a single time what ought i to do to break myself of that you ought to run in a cheesecloth shimmy on hills under a new moon horace told her with chained ankles of course but a slack chain no not the moon but in a dawn like pipes green and gold and maybe a little pink would you risk a little pink she watched him with grave curious eyes as he stood before her lean in his flannels and with his sick brilliant face and his wild hair no he corrected himself again on sand blanched sand with dead ripples ghosts of dead motion waved into the sand do you know how cold the sea can be just before dawn with a falling tide like lying in a dead world upon the dead respirations of the earth shes too big to the all at once like elephants how old are you now all at once her eyes became secretive and she looked away now what he demanded what didyou start to say then theres mr mitchell shesaid harry mitchellhad come out in tight flannels and a white silk shirtand new ornate sport shoes that cost twenty dollarsper pair with a new racket in a patent case andpress standing with his squat legs and his bald bullethead and his undershot jaw of rotting teeth besidethe studied picture of his wife presently when hehad been made to drink a cup of tea he wouldgather up all the men present and lead them through the house to his bathroomand give them whisky pouring out a glass and fetching it down to rachel he would give you the shirt off his back he was a cotton speculator and a good one he was ugly as sin and kindhearted and dogmatic and talkative and he called belle little mother until she broke him of it belle lay yet in her chair she was watching them as they turned together from the court what was it horace persisted sir what you started to say just then nothing she answered i wasnt going to say anything oh thats too feminine horace said i didnt expect that of you after the way you play tennisthey moved on under the veiled contemplation of belles gaze feminine then she added i hope i can get another set soon im not a bit tired are you yes any woman might have said that but maybe youre not old enough to be a woman horace belle said im seventeen the girl answered miss belle likes you dont she belle spoke his name again mellifluously lazily peremptory airs marders sat now with her slack chins in a raised teacup the girl turned to him with polite finality thanks for playing with me she said ill be better someday i hope we beat em she said generally you and the little lady gave em the works hey big boy harry mitchell said showing his discolored teeth his heavy prognathous jaw narrowed delicately down then nipped abruptly off into pugnacious bewilderment mr benbow did the girl corrected in her clear voice and she took the chair next belle i kept on lettingem get my alley horace belle repeated your tea is getting cold it had been fetched bythe combination gardenerstablemanchauffeur temporarily impressed and smelling of vulcanized rubber and ammonia mrs marders removedher chins from her cup horace plays too well she said really too well the other men cant compete with him you were lucky to have him for a partner child yessum the girl agreed i guess he wont risk me again nonsensemrs marders rejoined horace enjoyed playing with you didnt you notice it belle belle made no reply she poured horaces tea andat this moment belles daughter came across the lawn in her crocusyellow dress her eyes were like stars more soft and melting than any deers and she gave horace a swiftshining glance well titania he said belle half turned her head still with the teapot raised and harry set his cup on the table and went and knelt on one knee in her path as if he were cajoling a puppy the child came up still watching horace with her radiant arid melting diffidence arid permitted her father to embrace her and fondle her with his short heavy hands daddys gal harry said she submitted to having her prim little dress mussed pleasurably but a little restively her eyes flew shining again dont muss your dress sister belle said and the child evaded her fathers hands with a prim movement what is it now belle asked why arent you playing nothing i just came home she came arid stood diffidently beside her mothers chair speak to the company belle said dont you know better than to come where older people are without speaking to them the little girl did so shyly and faultlessly greeting them in rotation and her mother turned and pulled arid patted at her straight soft hair now do go arid play why do youalways want to come where grown people are youre not interested in what were doing ah let her stay mother harry said she wants to watch her daddy and horace play tennis run along now belle added with a final pat paying no attention to harry and do keep your dress clean yessum the child agreed and she turned obediently giving horace another quick shining look hewatched her and saw rachel stand presently in the kitchen door and speak to her and she turned and mounted the steps and entered the door which rachel held open what a beautifully mannered childmrs marders said how do you do it belle theyre so hard to do anything with belle saidshe has some of her fathers traits drink your teaharry harry took his cup from the table and sucked its lukewarm contents into himself noisily and dutifully well big boy he said to horace how about a set these squirrels think they can beat us frankie wants to play again belle said do let the child have the court for a little while what harry was busy evolving his racket from its intricate and expensive casing he paused and raised his savage undershot face and his dull kind eyes no no the girl protested quickly ive had enough id rather look on a while dont be silly belle said they can play any time sure the little lady can play harry said hereyou jellybeans how about fixing up a set with the little lady he restored his racket with ostentatious care please mr mitchell the girl said dont mind him belle told her he and horace can play some other time you children go on and play hell have to make the fourth anyway the exstudent spoke sure mr harry come on me and frankiell play you and joe you folks go ahead and play a set harry repeated ive got a little business to talk over with horace you all go ahead he insisted overrodetheir polite protests until they took the court then he jerked his head significantly at horace go on with him belle said the baby without looking at him without touching him she enveloped him with rich and smoldering promise mrs marders sat across the table from them curious and bright and cold with her teacup unless you want to play with that silly child again silly horacerepeated shes too young to be unconsciously silly yet run along belle told him and hurry back mrs marders andi are tired of one another horace followedhis host into the house followed his short rolling gait and the bald indomitability of his head from the kitchen as they passed little belles voice came steadily recounting some astonishment of the day with an occasional mellow ejaculation from rachel for antistrophe in the bathroom harry got a bottle from a cabinet and preceded by labored heavy footsteps mounting rachel entered without knocking bearing a pitcher of ice water whynt yall gawn and play ef you wants she demanded whut you let that oman treat you and that baby like she do anyhow she demanded of harry you ought to take and lay her out wid a stick of wood messinup my kitchen at fooclock in de evenin and you aint helpin none neither she told horace gimme a dram mr harry please suh she took her glass and waddled heavily out they heard her descend the stairs slowly and heavily on her fallen arches belle couldnt get along without rachel harry said rinsing two glasses she talks too much like all niggers to listen to her youd think belle was some kind of a wild animal wouldnt you a damn tiger or something but belle and iunderstand each other youve got to make allowances for women anyway different from men born contrary complain when you dont please em and complain whenyou do then he said with astonishing irrelevance id kill the man that tried to wreck my home like i would a damn snake well lets take one big boy presently he sloshed ice water into his empty glass and gulped that too and he reverted to his former grievance cant get to play on my own damn court he said belle gets all these damn people here every day what i want is a court where i can come home from work and get in a couple of fast sets every afternoon appetizer before supper but every damn day i get home from work and find a lot of young girls and jellybeans using it like it was a public court horace drank his more moderately and harry lit a cigarette and threw the match onto the floor and hung his leg across the lavatory i reckon ill have to build another court for my own use and put a hogwire fence around it with a yale lock so belle cant give picnics on it theres plenty of room down there by the lot fence no trees too put it out in the damn sun and i reckon bellell let me use it now and then well suppose we get on back he led the way through his bedroom and stopped to show horace a new repeating rifle he had just bought and to press upon him a package of cigarettes which he imported from south america and they descended and emerged into afternoon become later the sun was level now across the court where three players leaped and sped with soft quick slapping of rubber soles following the fleeting impact of the ball mrs marders sat yet with her ceaseless chinsalthough she was speaking of departure as they came up belle turned her head against the chairback but harry led horace on were going to look over a location for a tennis court i think ill take up tennis myself he told mrs marders with clumsy irony horace halted in his loose worn flannels with his thin face brilliant and sick with nerves smoking his hosts cigarettes and watching his hopeless indomitable head and his intent faintly comical body as he paced off dimensions and talked steadily in his harsh voice paced back and forth and planned and calculated with something of a boys fine ability for fabling for shaping the incontrovertible present to adesire which he will presently lose in a recenter one and so forget presently harry was satisfied and they returned ifwas later still mrs marders was gone and belle sat alone immersed in a magazine a youth in a batteredford had called for frankie but another young manhad dropped in and when horace and harry cameup the three youths clamored politely for harry to join them take horace here harry said obviously pleased hell give youa run for your money but horace demurred and the three continued to importune harry lemme get my racket he said finally and horace followed the heavy scuttling of his backside across the court belle glanced up at them briefly did you find a place she asked yes harry answered uncasing his racket again where i can play by myself sometimes a place too far from the street for everybody that comes along to see it and stop but belle was reading again harry unscrewed his racket press and removed it ill go in one set then you and i can get in a fast one before dark he told horace yes horace agreed he sat down and watched harry stride heavily onto the court and take his position watched the first serve then belles magazine rustled and slapped onto the table come she said rising horace rose too and belle preceded him and they crossed the lawn and entered the house rachel moved about in the kitchen and they went on through the house where all noises wore remote and the furniture gleamed peacefully indistinct in the dying evening light belle slid her soft prehensile hand into his clutching his hand against her softly clothed thigh and led him into a room beyond folding doors this room too was quiet and empty and here she stopped against him half turning land they kissed but she freed her mouth presently and led him on in the rising dusk and he drew the piano bench out and they sat on opposite sides of it and kissed again you havent told me you love me belle said touching his face with her fingertips and the fine devastation of his hair not in a long time not since yesterday horace agreed but he told her she leaning her breast against him and listening with a sort of rapt voluptuous inattention like a great still cat and when he had done and sat touching her face and her hair with his delicate wild hands she removed her breast and opened the piano and touched the keys saccharine melodies she played from memory and in the current mode that you might hear on any vaudeville stage and with shallow skill a sense for their oversweet nuances they sat thus for some time belle in another temporary vacuum of discontent building with her hands and for herself an edifice a world in which she moved romanticallyfinely and a little tragical while horace sat beside her and watched both belle in her selfimposed and tragic role and himself performing like the old actor whose hair is thin and whose profile is escaping him via his chin but who can play to any cue at a moments notice while the younger men chew their bitter thumbs in the wings presently the rapid heavy concussions of harrys feet thumped again on the stairs mounting and the harsh wordless uproar of his voice as he led someone else in the back way and up to his bathroom belle ceased her hands and leaned her body against him and kissed him again clinging this is intolerable she said freeing her mouth with a movement of her head for a moment she resisted against his arm then her hands crashed discordantly upon the keys and slid through horaces hair and down his cheeks tightening she freed her mouth again now sit over there she directed from his chair she at the piano was half in shadow twilight was deeper yet only the line of her bent head and her back tragic and still somehow young we do turn corners upon ourselves like suspicious old ladies spying on servants horace thought no eke boys trying to head off a parade theres always divorce he said to marry again her hands trailed off into chords they merged and faded again into a minor motif in one hand overhead harry moved with his heavy staccato tread shaking the house youd make a rotten husband i wont as long as im not married horace answered she said come here and he rose and in the dusk she was again tragic and young and familiar and he knew the sad fecundity of the world andtimes hopeful disillusion that fools itself i want to have your child horace she said and then her own child came up the hall and stood diffidently in the door for a moment belle was an animal awkward and mad with fear she surged away from him with a mad spuming movement her hands crashed on the keys before she controlled her instinctive violent escape and left in the dusk a mindless protective antagonism pervading in steady cumulate waves directed at horace as well come in titania horace said the little girl stood diffidently in silhouette belles voice was sharp with relief well what do you want sitover there she hissed at horace what do you want belle horace drew away a little but without rising ive got a new story to tell you soon he said but little belle stood yet as though she had not heard and her mother said go on and play belle why did you come in the house it isnt supper time yet everybodys gone home she answered i havent got anybody to play with go to the kitchen and talk to rachel then belle said she struck the keys again harshly you worry me to death hanging around the house the little girl looked at them for a moment then she turned obediently and went away sit over there belle repeated horace resumed his chair and belle sat in the twilight and played loudly and swiftly with cold and hysterical skill overhead he heard harry again heard them descend the stairs harry was talking again the voices passed on toward the rear ceased belle continued to play it was dance music in the new jazz tradition still about him in the dark roomthat mindless protective antagonism like a muscular contraction that remains after the impulse of fright has faded without ceasing she said are you going to stay for supper he was not he answered waking suddenly she did not rise with him did not turn her head again and he let himself out of the house and descended into the violet dusk of late spring where was already a faint star above the windless trees on the drive just without the garage harrys new car stood at the moment he was doing something to the engine of it while the houseyardstable boy held a patent troublelamp over the bald crag of his head and his daughter and rachel peered across his bent back leaning their intent and dissimilar faces into the soft bluish glare of the light horace went on homeward and supperward before he reached the narrow street on which be lived the street lamps sputtered and failed then glared beneath the dark boughs of trees beneath delicate motionless veils of leaves general william booth has gotten a leprechaun on uriahs wife horace told himself and gravely presented the flowers he had brought and received in return the starry incense of her flying eyes mrs marders was among the group of belles more intimate familiars in this room affable and brightly cold a little detached and volubly easy she admired little belles gifts one by one with impeccable patience belles voice came from the adjoining room where the piano was bowered for the occasion by potted palms and banked pots and jars of bloom andwhere yet more ladies were sibilantly crescendic with an occasional soberly clad male on the outer fringe of thecolorful clattering like rocks dumbly imponderable about the cauldron where seethed an hysterical tideflux these men spoke to one another from the sides of their mouths and when addressed by the ladies with bleak and swift affability from the teeth outward harrys bald bullet head moved among his guests borne hither and you upon the harsh uproar of his voice presently when the recital would have gotten underway and the ladies engaged he would begin to lead the men one by one and on tiptoe from the room and up the back stairs to his apartments but now the guests stood and drifted and chattered anticipatory and unceasing and every minuteor two harry gravitated again to the diningroomon the table of which his daughters gifts and flowerswere arrayed and beside which little belle in her palelilac dress stood in a shiningeyed and breathless ecstasy daddys gal harry in his tight silvergray gabardine suit and his bright tie with the diamond stud chortled putting his short thick hands on her then together they examined the latest addition to the array of gifts with utter if dissimilar sinceritylittle belle with quiet and shining diffidence her father stridently tactlessly overloud harry was smoking his cigarettes steadily scattering ash he had receptacles of them open on every available flat surface throughout the lighted rooms hows the boy he added shaking horaces hand will you look at that sumptuous bouquet horace has brought your daughtermrs marders said horace its really a shame shed have appreciated a toyor a doll much more wouldnt you honey are you trying to make belle jealous little belle gave horace her flying stars again harry squatted before herdid horace bring daddys gal some flowers he brayed just look at the flowers horace brought her he put his hands on her again mrs marders said quickly youll burn her dress with that cigarette harry daddys gal dont care harry answered buy her a new dress tomorrow but little belle freed herself craning her soft brown head in alarm trying to see the back of her frock and then belle entered in pink beneath a dark blue frothing of tulle and the rich bloody auburn of her hair little belle showed her horaces bouquet and she knelt and fingered and patted little belles hair and smoothed her dress did you thank him she asked i know you didnt of course she did horace interposed just as you thank providence for breath every time you breathe little belle looked up at him with her grave ecstatic shining we think girls should always have flowers when they play music and dance he explained gravely too dont we yes little belle agreed breathlessly yes sir belle corrected fretfully patting and pulling at her daughters delicate wisp of dress with its tiny embroidered flowers at the yoke belle kneeling in a soft swishing of silk with her rich and smoldering unrepose harry stood with his squat tightly clothed body looking at horace with the friendly bloodshot bewilderment of his eyes yes sir little belle piped obediently belle rose swishing again come on sister itstime to begin and dont forget and start pulling atyour clothes the indiscriminate furniturediningroom chairs rockers sofas and allwere ranged in semicircular rows facing the corner where the piano was placed beside the piano and above little belles soft brown head and her little sheer frock and the tense impotent dangling of her legs the music teacher a thin passionate spinster with cold thwarted eyes behind nose glasses stood the men clung stubbornly to the rear row of chairs their sober decorum splotched sparsely among the cacophonous hues of the womens dresses with the exception of harry that is who now sat with the light full on his bald crag just beyond him and between him and mrs marders horace could see narcissas dark burnished head belle sat on the front row at the end turned sideways in her chair the other ladies were still now temporarily in a sort of sibilant vacuum of sound into which the tedious labored tinkling of lit tie belles playing fell like a fairy fountain the music tinkled and faltered hesitated corrected itself to the intent nodding of little belles head and the strained meagre gestures of the teacher tinkled monotonously and tunelessly on while the assembled guests sat in a sort of bland waiting inattention and horace speculated on that persevering and senseless urge of parents and of all adults for making children a little ridiculous in their own eyes and in the eyes of other children the clothes they make them wear the stupid mature things they make them do and he found himself wondering if to be cultured did not mean to be purged of all taste civilized to be robbed of all fineness of objective judgment regarding oneself then he remembered that little belle also had been born a woman the music tinkled thinly ceased the teacher leaned forward with a passionate movement and removed the sheet from the rack and the room swelled with a polite adulation of bored palms horace too and little belle turned on the bench with her flying eyes and horace grinned faintly at his own masculine vanity sympathy here when she was answering one of the oldest compulsions of her sex a compulsion that taste nor culture nor anything else would ever cause to appear ridiculous to her then the teacher spoke to her and the turned on the bench again with her rapt laborious fingers and the brown intent nodding of her head belle sat sideways in her chair her head was bent and her hands lay idle upon her lap and she sat brooding and remote horace watched her the fine of her neck the lustrous stillness of her arm trying to project himself into that region of rich and smoldering immobility into which she had withdrawn for the while but he could not she did not seem to be aware of him at all the corridors where he sought her were empty and he moved quietly in his seat beneath the tim tinkling of the music and looked about at the other politely attentiveheads and beyond them in the doorway harry making significant covert signs in his direction harry jerked his thumb toward his mouth and moved his head meaningly but horace flipped his hand briefly in reply without moving when he looked doorward again harry was gone little belle ceased again when the clapping died the heavy thumpthumpthump of harrys heels sounded on the ceiling above ridiculous like the innocent defenseless backside of a small boy caught delving into an apple barrel and a few of the guests cast their eyes upward in polite astonishment belle raised her head sharply with an indescribable gesture then she looked at horace with cold and blazing irritation enveloping savage disdainful of who might see the thumping ceased became a cautious clumsy tipping and belles anger faded though her gaze was still full upon him little belle played again and horace looked away from the cold fixity of belles gaze a little uncomfortably and so saw harry and one of the men guests enter surreptitiously and seat themselves he turned his head again beneath the heavy shadow of her hair belle still watched him and he shaped three words with his lips but belles mouth did not change its sullen repose nor her eyes and then he realized that she was not looking at him at all perhaps had never been later belle herself went to the piano and played a trite saccharine waltz and little belle danced to it with studied meaningless gestures top thinly conceived and too airily executed to be quite laughable and stood with her diffident shining among the smug palms she would have danced again but belle rose from the piano and the guests rose also with prompt unanimity and surrounded her in laudatory sibilance belle stoodmoodily beside her daughter in the center of it and little belle pleasurably horace rose also above the gabbling of the women he could hear harry again overhead thumpthumpthump and he knew that belle was also listening although she responded faultlessly to the shrill indistinguishable compliments of her guests beside little belle the teacher stood with her cold sad eyes proprietorial and deprecatory touching little belles hair with a meagre passionate hand then they drifted doorward with their shrill polite uproar little belle slid from among them and came a little drunk with all the furor and her central figuring in it and took horaces hand what do you think was the best she asked when i played or when i danced i think they both were he answered i know but what do you think was the best well i think the dancing was because your mamma was playing for you so do i little belle agreed they could see all of me when i was dancing couldnt they when you are playing they cant see but your back yes horace agreed he moved toward the door little belle still clinging to his hand i wish they wouldnt go why do they have to go now cant you stay a while i must take narcissa home she cant go home by herself you know yes little belle agreed daddy could take her home in our car i expect id better do it but ill be coming back soon well all right then little belle sighed with weary contentment i certainly do like parties i certainly do i wish we had one every night the guests clotted at the door evacuating with politely trailing phrases into the darkness belle stood responding to their recapitulations with smoldering patience narcissa stood slightly aside waiting for him and harry was among them again strident and affable daddys gal he said did horace see her playing the piano and dancing want to go up andtake one before you leave he asked horace in a jarring undertone no thanks narcissis waiting for me some other time sure sure harry agreed and horace was aware of belle beside him speaking to little belle but when he turned his head she was moving away with her silken swishing and her heavy feint scent harry was still talking how about a couple of sets tomorrow lets get over early before belles gang comes and get in a couple of fast ones then let em have the court all right horace agreed as he always did to this arrangement wondering as usual if that boys optimism of harrys really permitted him to believe that they could or would follow it out or if he had just said the phrase so many times that the juxtaposition of the words no longer had any meaning in his liquorfuddled brain then narcissa was beside him and they were saying goodnight and the door closed upon little belle and harrys glazed squat dome and upon belles smoldering and sullen rage she had said no word to him all evening he turned away and found that his sister had descended the steps and was half way down the dark walk to the street if youre going my way ill walk along with you he called to her she made no reply neither did she slacken her pace nor did she increase it when he joined her why is it he began that grown people will go to so much trouble to make children do ridiculous things do you suppose belle had a house full of people she doesnt care anything about and most of whom dont approve of her and kept little belle up three hours past her bedtime and the result isharrys about half tight and belle is in a bad humor and little belle is too excited to go to sleep and you and i wish we were home and are sorry we didnt stay there why do you go there then narcissa asked coldly horace was suddenly stilled they walked on through the darkness toward the next street light against it branches hung like black coral in a silver sea oh horace said then i saw that old cat talking with you why do you call mrs marders an old cat because she told me something that concerns me and that everybody else seems to know so thats who told you is it i wondered he slid his arm within her unresponsive one dear old narcy they passed through the dappled shadows beneath the light went on in the darkness again isit true she asked after a time you forget that lying is astruggle for survival he said little puny mans way of dragging circumstance about to fit his preconception of himself as a figure in the world revenge on the sinister gods is it true she persisted they walked on arm in arm she grave and constant and waiting he shaping and discarding phrases in his mind finding time to be amused at his own fantastic impotence in the presence of her constancy people dont usually lie about things that dont concern them he answered wearilythey are impervious to the world even if they arent to life not when fact is so much more diverting than their imaginings could be he added narcissa freed her arm with grave finality narcy dont she said dont call me that the next corner beneath the next light was theirs they would torn there above the arching feathery canyon of the street the sinister gods stared down with their yellow unwinking eyes horace thrust ids hands into his jacket pockets and for a space he was stilled again while his fingers learned the unfamiliar object they had found there thai he drew it forth a sheet of heavy notepaper folded twice and tinged with a fading heavy scent a scent as of flowers that bloom richly at night a familiar scent yet baffling too for the moment like a face watching him from an arras he knew the face would emerge in a moment but as he held the note in his fingers and sought the face through the corridors of his present distraction his aster spoke suddenly and hard at his side youve got the smell of her all over you oh horry shes dirty i know he answered unhappily and the face emerged clearly and he was suddenly empty and cold and sad i know it was like a road stretching on through darkness into nothingness and so away a road lined with black motionless trees o thou grave myrtle shapes amid which death a road along which he and narcissa walked like two children drawn apart one from the other to opposite sides of it strangers yet not daring to separate and go in opposite ways while the sinister gods watched them with cold unwinking eyes and somewhere everywhere behind and before and about them pervading the dark warm cave of belles rich discontent and the tigerreek of it but the world was opening out before him fearsome and sad and richly moribund as though he were again an adolescent and filled with shadowyshapes of dread and of delight not to be denied he must go on though the other footsteps sounded fainter and fainter in the darkness behind him and then not at all perhaps they had ceased or turned intoabyway this byway led her back to miss jenny it was now well into june and the scent of miss jennys transplanted jasmine drifted steadily into the house and surrounded it with constant cumulate waves more grave and simple than a fading resonance of viols the earlier flowers were gone and the birds had finished eating the strawberries and now sat about the fig bushes all day waiting for them to ripen zinnia and delphinium bloomed without any assistance from isom who since caspey had more or less returned to normalcy with the exception of saturday nights and layingby time was yet a while away now spent the lazy long days sleeping peacefully with a cane fishing pole on the creek bank old simon pottered querulously about the place his linen duster and tophat gathered chaff on the nail in the harness room and the carriage horses waxed fat and insolent and lazy in the pasture the duster and hat came down from their nail and the horses were harnessed to the carriage but once a week nowon sundays to drive in to town to church miss jenny said she was too far along to risk salvation by driving to church at fifty miles an hour that she had as many sins as her ordinary behavior could take care of particularly as she had old bayards soul to get into heaven somehow also what with him and young bayard tearing around the country every afternoon at the imminent risk of their necks about youngbayards soul miss jenny did not alarm herself at all he had no soul meanwhile he rode about the farm and harried the negro tenants in his cold fashion and in twodollar khaki breeches and a pair of field boots that had cost him fourteen guineas he tinkered with farming machinery and with the tractor he had persuaded old bayard to buy for the time being he had become almost civilized again he went to town only occasionally now and often on horseback and all in all his days had become so usefully innocuous that both his aunt and his grandfather were growing a little nervously anticipatory mark my words miss jenny told narcissa on the day she drove out again hes storing up devilment thats going to burst loose all at once someday and then therell be hell to pay lord knows what itll bemaybe he and isom will take his car and that tractor and hold a steeple chase with emwhat did you come out for got another letter ive got several more narcissa answered lightly im saving them until i get enough for a book then ill bring diem all out for you to read miss jenny sat opposite her erect as a crack guardsman with that cold briskness of hers that caused agents and strangers to stumble through their errands with premonitions of failure ere they began but to narcissa it was like emerging into the fresh air from a stale room i just came to see you she added and for a moment her serene face held such grave and still despair that miss jenny sat more erect yet and stared at her guest with her piercing eyes why what is it child did the man walk into your house no no the look was gone but still miss jennywatched her with those keen old eyes that seemed to see so much more than you thoughtor hoped shall i play a while its been a long time hasnt it well miss jenny agreed if you want to there was dust on the piano narcissa opened it with a fine gesture and brushed her fingertips on her skirt if youll let me get a cloth here lemme dust it miss jenny said and she caught up her skirt by the hem and mopped the keyboard violently there thatll do then she drew her chair from behind the instrument and seated herself she still watched the others profile with cold speculation but presently the old tunes stirred her memory again and in a while her eyes grew more and more remote and the other and the trouble that had shown momentarily in her face was lost in miss jennys own dead young nights and days and vanquished abiding griefs and it was some time before she realized that the other was weeping quietly while she played without rising miss jenny leaned forward and touched narcissas arm now you tell me what it is she commanded and narcissa told her quietly in her grave contralto while her eyes still wept hmph miss jenny said thats to be expected of a man that hasnt any more to do than horace i dont see why you are so upset over it but that womannarcissa wailed suddenly like a little girl burying her face in her hands shes so dirty miss jenny dug into the pocket of her skirt and handed the other a mans handkerchief what do you mean she asked dont she wash often enough not that way i mmean shesshes narcissa turned suddenly and laid her head on the piano oh miss jenny said all women are if thats what you mean she sat stiffly indomitable musing on the younger womans shaking shoulders hmph she said again horace has spent so much time being educated thathe never has learned anythingwhy didnt you break it up in time didnt you see it coming the other wept more quietly now she sat up and dried her eyes on miss jennyshandkerchief it started before he went away dont you remember thats so i do sort of remember at lot of womens gabble who told you about it anyway horace mrs marders did and then horace did but i never thought that hedi never thought again her head dropped to the piano hidden in her arms i wouldnt have treated horace that way sarah marders was it i might have known i admire strong character even if it is bad miss jenny stated well crying wont help any she rose briskly well think what to do about it only id let him go ahead itll do him good if shell just turn around and make a doormat of himtoo bad harry hasnt got spunk enough to but i reckon hell be glad i know i wouldthere there she said at the others movement of shocked alarm i dont reckon harryll hurt him dry your face now you better go to the bathroom and fix up bayardll be coming in soon and you dont want him to see youve been crying you know narcissa glanced swiftly and a little fearfully toward the door and dabbed hastily at her cheeks with miss jennys handkerchief at times the dark lifted the black trees were no longer sinister and then horace and narcissa walked the road in sunlight as of old then he would seek her through the house and cross the drive and descend the lawn in the sunny afternoon to where she sat in the white dresses he loved beneath the oak into which a mockingbird came each afternoon and sang bringing her the result of his latest venture in glassblowing lie had five now in different colors and all nearly perfect and each of them had a name and as he finished them and before they were scarce cooled he must bring them across the lawn to where she sat with a book or with a startled caller perhaps in his stained disheveled clothes and his sooty hands in which the vase lay demure and fragile as a bubble and with his face blackened too with smoke and a little mad passionate and fine and austere but then the dark would descend once more and beyond the black and motionless trees belles sultry imminence was like a presence like the odor of death and then he and narcissa were strangers again tugging and straining at the shackles of custom and old affection that bound them with slipping bonds and then they were no longer even side by side at times he called back to her through the darkness making no sound and receiving no reply at times he hovered distractedly like a dark bird between the two of them but at last he merged with himself fused in the fatalism of his nature and set his face steadily up the road looking not back again and then the footsteps behind him ceased for a time the earth held him in a smoldering hiatus that might have been called contentment he was up at sunrise planting things in the ground and watching them grow and tending them he cursed and harried niggers and males into motion and kept them there and put the grist mill into raining shape and taught caspey to drive the tractor and came in at mealtimes and at night smelling of machine oil and of stables and of the earth and went to bed with grateful muscles and with the sober rhythms of the earth in his body and so to sleep but he still waked at times in the peaceful darkness of his familiar bed and without previous warning tense and sweating with old terror and always and constant beneath activity and bodily fatigue and sleep and all that stubborn struggling of his heart which would not wear away but his days were filled at least and he discovered pride again nowadays he drove the car into town to fetch his grandfather from habit alone and though he still considered fortyfive miles an hour merely cruising speed he no longer took cold and fiendish pleasure in turning curves on two wheels or in detaching mules from wagons by striking the whiffletrees with his bumper in passing old bayard still insisted on riding with him when he must ride but with freer breath and once he aired to miss jenny his growing belief that at last young bayard had outworn his seeking for violent destruction miss jenny being a true optimistthat is expecting the worst at all times and so being daily agreeably surprisedpromptly disillusioned him meanwhile she made young bayard drink plenty of milk and otherwise superintended his diet and hours in her martinetish way and at times she entered his room at night and sat for a while quietly beside the bed where he slept nevertheless young bayard improved in his ways without being aware of the progress of it he had become submerged in a monotony of days had beensnared by a rhythm of activities repeated arid repeated until his muscles grew so familiar with them as to get his body through the days without assistance from him at all he had been so neatly tricked by earth that ancient delilah that he was not aware that his locks were shorn was not aware that miss jenny and old bayard were wondering how long it would be before they grew out again he needs a wife was miss jennys thought then maybe hell stay sheared a young person to worry with him she said to herself bayards too old and ive got too much to do to worry with the long devil he saw narcissa about the house now and then sometimes at the table and he was aware of her shrinking and of her distaste but not for long at a time and with no other emotion save a mild curiosity as to why she had not married miss jenny told him that she was twentysix the same age as himself then sowing time was over and it was summer cotton and corn was out of the ground and laidby the grist mill was ready to run arid the gin had been overhauled and one day he found himself with nothing to do it was like coming dazed out of sleep out of the warm sunny valleys where people lived and again the cold peak of his stubborn despair stood bleakly among black and savage stars and the valleys were obscured by shadow the road descended in a quiet red curve between pines through which the hot july winds swelled with a long sound like a faraway passing of trains descended to a mass of lighter green of willows where a creek ran beneath a stone bridge at the top of the grade the scrubby rabbitlike mules stopped and theyounger negro got down and lifted a gnawed whiteoak sapling from the wagon and locked the off rear wheel by wedging the pole between the warped wirebound spokes of it and across the axle tree then he climbed into the crazy wagon again where the other negro sat motionless with the lifted ropespliced reins in his hand and his head tilted creek ward whut uz dat he said what uz whut the other asked but his father sat yet in his attitude of motionless grave attention and the younger negro listened also but there was no further sound save the long sough of the wind among the sober pines and the liquid whistling of a quail somewhere among diem whut you hear pappy he repeated somethin busted down dar tree fell mebbe he jerked the reins hwup mules the mules flapped their jackrabbit ears and lurched the wagon into motion and they descended among the cool dappled shadows on the jarring scrape of the locked wheel that left behind it a glazed bluish ribbon in the soft red dust at the foot of the hill the road crossed the bridge and went on mounting again beneath the bridge the creek rippled and flashed brownly among willows and beside the bridge and bottom up in the creek a motor car lay its front wheels were still spinning and the engine yet ran at idling speed trailing a faint shimmer of exhaust the older negro drove onto the bridge and stopped and the two of them sat and stared quietly down upon the cars long belly the younger negro spoke suddenly dar he is he in de water under hit i kin see his foots stickin out he liable to drown dar the other said with static interest and they descended from the wagon the younger one slid down the creek bank theotherwrapped the reins about one of the stakes that held the bed on the wagon frame and thrust his peeled hickory goad beneath the seat and circled the wagon without haste and dragged the whiteoak pole free of the locked wheel and put it in the wagon then he also slid gingerly down the creek bank to where his son squatted peering at young bayards submerged legs dont you git too clost to dat thing boy he commanded hit mought blow up dont you year hit still grindin in dar we got to git dat man out theyounger one replied he gwine drown dont you tech im white folksll be sayin we done it we gwine wait right heer twell some white man comes erlong hell drown fo dat the other said layin in dat water he was barefoot and he stepped into the water and stood again with brown flashing wings of water stemming about his lean black calves you john henry his father said you come way fum dat thing we got to git im outen dar the boy repeated and the one in the water and the other on the bank they wrangled amicably while the water rippled about bayards boot toes then the younger negro approached warily and caught bayards leg and tugged at it the body responded shifted stopped again and grunting querulously the older one removed his shoes and stepped into the water also he hung again john henry said squatting in the water and searching beneath the car with his hand he hung under de guidin wheel his haid aint quite under water dough lemme git de pole he mounted the bank and got the sapling from the wagon bed and returned and joined his father wherethe other stood in sober curious disapproval abovebayards legs and with the pole they lifted the carenough to drag bayard free of it they lifted himonto the shelving bank and he sprawled there in thesun with his calm face and his matted hair while water drained out of his boots and they stood abovehim on alternate legs while they wrung out theiroveralls hists cunnel sartoriss boy aint it the elder said at last and he lowered himself stiffly to the sand groaning and grunting and donned his shoes yessuh john henry answered is he daid pappy cose he is the other answered petulantly atter that ottobile jumped offen dat bridge wid im whut you reckon he is ef he aint daid and whut you gwine say when de law axes how come you de onliest

of my business the other repeated but he bent and picked up bayards legs and they lifted him and he groaned without waking dar now john henry exclaimedhear dat he aint daid but he might well have been with his long inert body and his head wrung excruciatingly against john henrys shoulder they shifted their grips and turned toward the road hah said john henry les go they struggled up the shaling treacherous bank with him and onto the road where the elder let his end of the burden slip to the ground whuf he expelled his breath sharply he heavy ez a flou barl come on pappy john henry saidles git im in de waggin the other stooped again with bared teeth and they raised bayard with dust caked redly on his wet thighs and heaved him by panting stages into the wagon bed he looks lak a daid man john henry added and hesho do acklak one ill ride back here and keep his haid fum bumpin git dat brakin pole you lef in de creek his father ordered and john henry descended and retrieved the sapling and got in the wagon again and lifted bayards head onto his knees and his father unwrapped the reins from the stanchion and mounted to the sagging seat and picked up his peeled hickorywand i dont lak dis kind o traffickin he repeated hwup mules the mules lurched the wagon into motion once more and they went on behind them the car lay on its back in the creek its engine still muttered and rumbled at idling speed its owner lay in the springless wagon jolting lady and inert oblivious of it and of john henrys dark compassionate face above him thus for some miles while john henry kept the sun from bayards face with the shadow of his hat then their jolting progress penetrated into that region to which he had withdrawn arid he groaned again drive slower pappy john henry said de joltin wakinim up i caint hep dat the elder replied i never run dat ottobile offen dat bridge i got to git on into town and git back home git on dar mules john henry tried to ease him to the jolting andbayard groaned again and lifted his hand to his chest and moved and opened his eyes but he closed them immediately against the sun and he lay on john henrys knees cursing then he moved again trying to sit up john henry restrained htaj firmly yet diffidently and he opened his eyes again struggling let go goddam you he said imhurt yessuh captain ef youll jes lay still bayard heaved himself violently clutching his side his teeth shone between his drawn bloodless lips arid he gripped john henrys shoulder with a clutch like steel hooks stop he shoutedstop him make him stop hes driving my damn ribs right through me he cursed again trying to get onto his knees gripping john henrys shoulder clutching his side with his other hand the older negro turned and lookedback at him hit him with something bayard shouted make him stop im hurt goddamn it the wagon stopped bayard was now on his hands and knees bending lower and lower on all fours like a wounded beast the two negroes watched him quietly and still clutching his side he moved and essayed to climb out of the wagon john henry jumped down and helped him and he got slowly out and leaned against the wheel with his sweating bloodless face and the dry grinning of his teeth git back in de waggin captain and les git to town to de doctor john henry said bayard stared at him moistening his lips with his tongue then he moved again and crossed to the roadsideand sat down fumbling at the buttons of his shirt the two negroes watched him got a knife son he asked presently yessuh john henry produced his knife and by bayards direction he slit the others shirt off thenthe two of them bound it tightly about bayards body and he got to his feet got a cigarette he asked john henry had not pappy got some chewin terbacker he suggested gimme a chew then they gave him a chew and helped him back into the wagon and onto the seat and drove on again they jingled and rattled interminably onward in the red dust through shadow and sunlight and uphill and down while bayard alternately chewed and swore on and on and at every jolt with every breath he took his broken ribs stabbed and probed into his flesh then a final hill and the road emerged from the trees and crossed the flat valley and joined the highway and here they stopped while the sun blazed down on bayards naked shoulders and bare head while he and the old negro wrangled as to whether they should drive him home or not and bayard swore and raged and suffered at last he took the reins from the elder negros hands and swung the mules about himself the negro continued to protest querulously until bayard dug a banknote from his trousers and gave it to him and surrendered the lines and they went on this last mile was the worst of all on all sides of them cultivated fields spread away to the shimmering hills earth was saturated with heat and broken and turned and saturated again and drunken with it exuding heat like an alcoholics breath the trees along the road were sparse and but half grown and the mules moved at a maddening walk in their own dust his nerves had become inured to pain and had surrendered to it he was conscious only of dreadful thirst and he knew that he was becoming light headed the negroes too realized that he was goingout of his head and the younger one crawled precariously forward and offered him his frayed straw hat bayard accepted it and put it on the moles with their comical overlarge ears assumed fantastic shapes merged into other shapes without significance or meaning shifted and changed again at times it seemed to him that they were travelling backward that they would crawl terrifically past the same tree or telephone post time after time and it seemed to him that the three of them and the rattling wagon and the two beasts were caught in a ceaseless and senseless treadmill a motion without progress forever and to no escape but at last and without his being aware of it the wagon turned in between the iron gates and shadow fell gratefully upon his naked shoulders and he opened his eyes and his home swam and floated in a pale mirage like a huge serene shape submerged in water the jolting stopped and the two negroes helped him down he mounted the steps and crossed the veranda in the hallway after the outer glare he could see nothing at all for a moment and he stood a little dizzy and nauseated blinking then simons eyeballs rolled out of the obscurity whut in de lawds name said simon is you been into now simon he said he swayed a little to keep on his feet he strode on again and blundered into something simon simon moved swiftly and touched him i kep tellin you dat car uz gwine to kill you i kep tellin you simon slid his arm about bayard and they went on at the stairs he tried to turn bayard but bayard wouldnt be turned he continued on down the hall and entered his grandfathers study and stopped leaning against a chairback keys he said thickly aunt jenny got to have drink miss jenny done gone to town wid miss benbow simon answered dey aint nobody here aint nobody here atall cep de niggers i kep atellin you he moaned again pawing at bayard dey aint no blood dough come to de sofa and lay down mist bayard bayard moved again and simon supported him and bayard lurched around the chair and slumped into it clutching his chest dey aint no blood simon babbled keys bayard said again get the keys yessuh ill git um simon flapped his distracted hands about bayard bayard swore at him and still moaning dey aint no blood he turned and scuttled from the room bayard sat forward clutching his chest and heard simon mount the stairs heard him on the floor overhead then he was back and bayard watched him open the desk and extract the silverstoppered decanter and scuttle out again and return with a glass to find bayard leaning against the desk drinking from the decanter simon helped him back to the chair and poured him a drink into the glass then he fetched him a cigarette and hovered futilely and distractedly about him lemme git de doctuh mist bayard no gimme another drink simon obeyed thats three already lemme go git miss jenny en de doctuh mist bayard please suh no leave me alone get out of here he drank that one the nausea the mirage shapeswere gone and he felt better at every breath hisside stabbed him with hot needles so he was carefulto breathe shallowly if he could only rememberthatyes he felt much better so he rose carefully and went to the desk and had another drink yes that was the stuff for a wound like suratt had said like that time last year when he got that tracer in his belly and nothing would stay on his stomach except ginandmilk and this this wasnt anything just a few caved slats patch his fuselage with a little piano wire in ten minutes not like johnny they were all going right into his thighs damn butcher wouldnt even raise his sights a little hed have to remember to breathe shallowly he crossed the room slowly but steadily enough simon flitted in the dim hall before him and he mounted the stairs slowly holding to the rail while simon watched him with strained distraction he entered his room the room that had been his and johns and stood for a while until he could breathe shallowly again then he crossed to the closet and opened it and kneeling carefully with his hand to his side he opened the chest which was there there was not much in it a garment a small leatherbound book a shotgun shell to which was attached by a piece of wire a withered bears paw it was johns first bear and the shell with which he had killed it in the river bottom near maccallums when he was twelve years old the book was a new testament on the flyleaf in faded brown to my son john on his seventh birthday march from his mother he had one exactly like it that was the year grandfather had arranged for the morning local freight to stop and pick them up and carry them to town to start to school the garment was a canvas hunting coat stained and splotched with what had once been blood and scuffed and torn with briers and smelling yet faintly of saltpeter still kneeling he lifted the objects out one by oneand laid them on the floor he picked the coat up again and its fading stale acridity drifted in his nostriljohnny he whispered johnny suddenly he raised the garment toward his face but halted it as sharply and with the coat half raised he looked swiftly over his shoulder but immediately he recovered himself and turned his head and lifted the garment and laid his face against it defiantly and deliberately and knelt so for a time then he rose and gathered up the book and the trophy and the coat and crossed to his chest of drawers and took from the top of it a photograph it was a picture of johns princeton eating club group and he gathered this also tinder his arm and descended the stairs and passed put the back door as be emerged simon was just crossing the yard with the carriage and as he passed the kitchen elnora was crooning one of her mellow endless songs behind the smokehouse squatted the black pot and the wooden tubs where elnora did her washing in fair weather she had been washing today the clothes line swung with limp damp garments and beneath the pot smoke yet curled from the soft wood ashes he thrust the pot over with his foot and rolled it aside and from the woodshed he fetched an armful of rich pine kindling and laid it on the ashes soon a blaze pale in the sunny air and when the wood was burning strongly he lid the coat and the bible and the trophy and the photograph on the flames and prodded them and turned them until they were consumed in the kitchen elnora crooned mellowly as she labored her voice came rich and plaintful and sad along the sunny reaches of the air he must remember to breathe shallowly simon drove rapidly on to town but he had been forestalled the two negroes had told a merchant about finding bayard on the roadside and the news had reached colonel sartoris at the bank who had sent for dr peabody but dr peabody was gone fishing so he took dr alford instead and the two of them in dr alfords car passed simon just as he drove into town he turned around and followed them but by the time he arrived home they had young bayard anaesthetized and temporarily incapable of further harm and when miss jenny and narcissa benbow drove unsuspectingly up the drive an hour later he was bandaged and conscious again they had not heard of it and dr alfords car was the first intimation although miss jenny did not recognize the car she knew immediately what it meant that fool has killed himself at last she said and got out and sailed into the house bayard lay white and still and a little sheepish in his bed old bayard and the doctor were just leaving and miss jenny waited until they were out of the room then she raged and stormed at him and stroked his face and his hair while simon bobbed and mowed in the corner between bed and wall dasso miss jenny dasso i kep atellinim and so having eased her soul she descended to the veranda where dr alford stood in impeccable departure old bayard sat in the car waiting for him and on miss jennys appearance he became his stiff self again and completed his departure and he and old bayard drove away miss jenny also looked up and down the veranda then into the hall where she said then she called narcissa a reply and she added where are you the reply came again and miss jenny reentered the house and saw narcissas white dress inthe gloom where she sat on the piano bench hes awake miss jenny said you can come up and see him the other rose and turned into the light why whats the matter you look lots worse than he does youre white as a sheet nothing narcissa answered i she stared at miss jenny a moment clenching her hands at her sides i must go she said and she emerged from the parlor its late and horace you can come in and speak to him cant you miss jenny asked watching the other curiously theres not any blood if thats what you are afraid of it isnt that narcissa answered im not afraid but she was rigid with repressed trembling miss jenny could see her teeth clenched upon her lower lip why all right miss jenny agreed kindly if youd rather not i just thought perhaps youd like to see he is all right as long as you are here but dont if you dont feel like it yes yes i feel like it i want to she passed miss jenny and went on down the hall at the foot of the stairs she halted until miss jenny came up behind her and they mounted together although she kept a step ahead and with her face averted from miss jennys probing eyes whats the matter miss jenny demanded still watching the other what happened to you have you fallen in love with him in lovehim bayard she swayed against the rail beside her and paused and slid her hand along the rail and drew herself onward she began to laugh thinly repressing hysteria miss jenny mounted beside her piercing and curious and cold narcissa hurried on at the stair head she stoppedagain holding to the railing and permitted miss jenny to precede her and just without the door to bayards room she stopped yet again and leaned against it throttling her laughter and her trembling then she entered the room where miss jenny stood beside the bed with head reverted for a moment she could see nothing for the swelling convolutions of laughter in her throat and she was conscious only of her need to repress them and of a sicklysweet lingering of ether as she approached the bed and stood blindly beside it with her hidden writhing hands on the pillow bayards head lay as she had remembered it on that former daypallid and calm like a chiseled mask brushed lightly over with the shadow of his spent violence he was watching her and for a while she gazed at him and miss jenny and the room and all swam away you beast you beast she said thinly why must you always do these things where ive got to see you i didnt know you were there bayard answered weakly with mild astonishment but this was gone soon nor did it return every few days by miss jennys request she came out and sat beside his bed and read to him bringing into the room her outward untroubled serenity he cared nothing at all about books it is doubtful if he had ever read a book on his own initiative but he would lie motionless in his cast while her grave contralto voice went on and on in the drowsy room sometimes he tried to talk to her but she ignored his attempts and read on if he persisted she went away and left him so he soon learned to lie usually with his eyes closed voyaging alone in the bleak and barren regions of his despair while her voice flowed and ebbed above the remoter sounds that surrounded themmiss jenny scolding simon or isom downstairs or in the garden the twittering of birds in the tree just beyond the window the ceaseless rhythmic monotone of the water pump below the barn at times she would cease and look at him and find that he was peacefully sleeping old man falls came through the lush green of early june came into town through the yet horizontal sunlight of morning and in his dusty neat overalls he now sat opposite old bayard in immaculate linen and a geranium like a merry wound the room was cool and still reposeful with dingy light and the casual dust of a negro janitors casual and infrequent disturbing now that old bayard was aging and what with the deaf tenor of his stiffening ways he was showing more and more a desire to surround himself with things of a like undeference showing an incredible aptitude for choosing servants who circled about him in a sort of pottering and bland futility the janitor who dubbed old bayard general and whom old bayard and the other clients for whom he performed seemingly interminable duties of a slovenly and minor nature addressed as dr jones was one of these he was black and stooped with querulousness and age and he took advantage of everyone who would permit him and old bayard swore at him constantly and permitted him to steal his tobacco and the banks winter supply of coal and peddle it to other negroes the windows behind which old bayard and hiscaller sat gave upon a vacant lot of rubbish and dusty weeds it was bounded by the weathered rears of sundry onestory board buildings within which small businessesrepair and junk shops and suchhad their lowly and ofttimes anonymous being the lot itself was used by day by country people as a depot for their wagons and teams already some of these were tethered somnolent and ruminant there and about the stale ammoniac droppings of their patient generations sparrows swirled in garrulous clouds or pigeons slanted with sounds like rusty shutters or strode and preened in burnished and predatory pomposity crooning among themselves with guttural unemphasis old man falls sat on the opposite side of the trashfilled fireplace mopping his face with a bluefigured bandana its my damned old legs he explained faintly apologetic use to be id walk twelvefifteen mile to a picnic or a singin with less study than that ere little old three mile into town gives me now he mopped the handkerchief about that face of his browned and cheerful these many years with the ample and abounding earth looks like theyre fixin to give out on me and i aint but ninetythree neither he held his parcel in his other hand but he continued to mop his face making no motion to open it nor to ascertain its contents why didnt you wait on the roadside until a wagon came along old bayard demanded in that overloud tone of the deaf always some damn feller with a field full of weeds coming to town i reckon i mought the other agreed but gittin here so quick would spile my holiday i aint like you townfolks i aint got so much time i kin hurry it he stowed the handkerchief away and rose and laidhis parcel carefully on the mantel and from his shirt he produced a small object wrapped in a clean frayed rag beneath his tedious and unhurried fingers there emerged a tin snuffbox polished long since to the dull soft sheen of satin or silver by handling and age old bayard sat in his white linen and watched watched him quietly as he removed the cap of the box and laid this too carefully aside now turn yo face to the light old man falls directed loosh peabody says that stuff will give me blood poisoning will the other continued his slow preparations his blue innocent eyes steadily following the movement of his hands loosh peabody never said that he corrected quietly one of them young doctors told you that bayard lean yo face to the light but old bayard sat yetwell back in his chair his hands on the arms of it watching the other with his piercing old eyes soberly a little wistful eyes filled with unnameable things like the eyes of old lions and intent old man falls poised a dark gob of his ointment on one finger and raised his head then he set the box carefully on his vacated chair and he put his hand on old bayards face put old bayard still resisted though passively watching him with his unutterable things and the other drew him firmly but gently nearer the light come on here im too old to waste any time hurtin folks hold still now so i wont spot yo face my hand aint steady enough to lift a rifle ball offen a hot stove no mo he submitted then and old man falls patted the salve onto the wen with small deft touches then he took up the bit of cloth and removed the surplus from the wen and wiped his fingers and dropped therag onto the hearth and knelt stiffly and touched a match to it we allus do that he explained my granny got that ere from a choctaw woman nigh a hundred year ago aint none of us never told what hit air nor left no after trace he rose stiffly again and dusted his knees he recapped the box with the same unhurried laborious care and put it away and raised his parcel from the mantel and resumed his chair hitll turn black and longs hits black hits workin dont put no water on yo face befo mawnin andill come in again in ten days and dose hit again and on the he brooded a moment computing slowly on his gnarled fingers his lips movedbut with no sound ninth day of july hitll drop off and dont you let miss jenny nor none of them doctors worry you about it he sat with his over ailed knees close together the package lay on his knees and he now opened it after the ancient laborious ritual picking with a sort of patient indomitability at the pink knot of the cord until a younger person would have screamed old bayard merely lit a cigar and propped his feet on the fireplace and in good time old man falls solved the knot and removed the string and laid it across his chairarm it fell to the floor and lie bent and fumbled it into his blunt fingers and laid it again across the chairarm and watched it a while lest it fall again then he opened the parcel first was his carton of tobacco and he removed a plug and sniffed it turned it about in his hand and sniffed it again but without biting into it he laid it and its fellows aside and delved further yet lie spread open the throat of the resulting paper bag and his innocent boys eyes gloated soberly into it ill declare he said sometimes im rightashamed for havin sech a consarned sweet tooth hit dont give me no rest atall still carefully guarding the other objects on his close knees he tilted the sack and shook two or three of the striped shrimplike things into his palm returned all but one which he put into his mouth im afeard now ill be loosin my teeth someday and ill have to start gumminem or eatin soft ones i never did relish soft candy his leathery cheek bulged slightly with slow regularity like a respiration as he chewed against the hard substance he peered into the sack again and he sat weighing it in his hand they was times back in sixtythree and fo whena feller could a bought a section of land and a niggerwith this yere bag of candy lots of times i mindwith everything goin agin us like and sugar andcawfee gone and food scace eatin stole cawn whenthey was any to steal and ditch weeds ef they wantbivouacin at night in the rain moren like hisvoice trailed away among ancient phantoms of thesouls and the bodys tribulations into those regionsof glamqrous and useless endeavor where such ghostsabide then he chuckled and chewed his peppermintagain i mind that day we was adodgin around grants army headin nawth grant was at grenada then and colonel had rousted us boys out and we taken hoss and jined van dorns cavalry down thataway that was when colonel had that ere silver stallion grant was still at grenada but van dora lit out one day headin nawth why us boys didnt know colonel mought have knowed but he never told us not that we keered much longs we was headin tods home so our compny was ridin along to ourselves goin to jine up with the balance of em later leastways the rest of em thought we was goin to jine em but colonel never had no idea of doin that his cawn hadnt been laid by yit and he was goin home fer a spell we wasnt runnin away he explained we knowed van dorn could handle em all right fer a week or two he usually done it he was a putty good man old man falls said a putty good man they were all pretty good men in those days old bayard agreed but you damn fellers quit fighting and went home too often well old man falls replied defensively even ef the hull countrys overrun with bears a feller cant hunt bears all the time hes got to quit once in a while ef hits only to feed and rest up the dogs and hosses but i reckon them dogs and bosses could stay on the trail long as any course everybody couldntkeep up with that ere mistcolored stallion they want but one animal in the confedrit army could tech himthat last hoss zeb fothergill fotch back outen one of shermans cavalry pickets on his last trip into tennessee nobody never did know what zeb done on them trips of hisn colonel claimed hit was jest to steal hosses but he never got back with lessen one one time he come back with seven of the orneriest critters that ever walked i reckon he tried to swap em fer meat and cawnmeal but wouldnt nobody have em then he tried to give em to the army but even the army wouldnt have em so he finally turned em loose and requisitioned to joe johnstons haidquarters fer ten hosses sold to forrests cavalry i dont know ef he ever got an answer nate forrest wouldnt a had them hosses i doubt ef theyd even a et em in vicksburgi never did put no big reliability in zeb fothergill him comin and goin by hisself likehe done but he knowed hosses and he usually fotch a good un home ever time he went away tods the war but he never got anothern like this befo the bulge receded from his cheek and he produced his pocket knife and cut a neat segment from his plug of tobacco and put it in his mouth then he rewrapped his parcel and tied the string about it again the ash of old bayards cigar trembled delicately about its glowing heart but did not fall his crossed elasticsided boots gleamed against the hearth edge old man falls spat neatly and brownly into the cold fireplace that day we was in calhoun county he continued hit was as putty a summer mawnin as you ever see men and hosses rested and fed and feelin peart trottin along the road through the woods and fields whar birds was asingin and young rabbits lopin across the road colonel and zeb was ridin along side by side on them two hosses colonel on jupiter and zeb on that sorrel twoyearold and they was abraggin as usual we all knowed colonels jupiter but zeb kep acontendin he wouldnt take no mans dust the road was putty straight across the bottom tods the river and zeb kep on aggin the colonel fer a race until colonel said all right he told us boys to come on and him and zeb would wait fer us at the river bridge bout fo mile ahead and him and zeb lit out them hosses was the puttiest livin things i ever seen they went off together like two birds neck and neck they was outen sight in no time with dust swirlin behind but we could foller em fer a ways by the dust they left watchin it kind of suckin on down the road like one of these here ottomobiles was in the middle of it when they come to whar the road drapped down to the river colonel had zeb beatby about three hundred yards thar was a crick jest under the ridge and when colonel sailed over the rise and come in sight of the crick thar was a compny of yankee cavalry with their hosses picketed and their muskets stacked eatin dinner by the bridge colonel says they was asettinthar gapin at the rise when he come over hit holdin cupsofcawfee and hunks of bread in their hands and their muskets stacked abo forty foot away buggin their eyes and mouths at him it was too late fer him to turn back anyhow but i dont reckon he would ef theyd been time he jest spurred down the ridge and in amongst em scatterin cookfires and guns and men shoutinsurround em boys ef you move you are dead men one or two of em made to break away but colonel drawed his pistols and let em off and they come back and scrouged in amongst the others and thar they setstill aholdin their cups and dinner when zeb come up and that was the way we found em when we got thar ten minutes later old man falls spat again neatly and brownly and he chuckled his eyesshone like periwinkles that cawfeewas sho mighty fine he said and thar we was with a passel of prisoners we didnt have no use fer we held em all that day and et their grub and when night come we taken and throwed their muskets into the crick and taken their ammunition and the rest of the grub and put a guard on their hosses then the rest of us laid down and all that night we laid thar in them fine yankee blankets listenin to them prisoners sneakin away one at a time slippin down the bank into the crick and wadin off time to time one would slip or make a splash ersomething then theyd all git right still fer a spell but pretty soon wed hear em at it againcrawlin through the bushes tods the crick and us layin with blanket aidges held to our mouths hit was nigh dawnfore the last one had snuck off in a way that suited him then colonel from whar he was alayin let out a yell them pore critters could hear fer a mile go it yank he says and look out fer moccasins next mawnin we saddled up and loaded our plunder and ever man taken him a hoss and lit out fer home wed been home two weeks and colonel had his cawn laid by when we heard bout van dorn ridin into holly springs and burnin grants stos seems like he never needed no help from us noways he chewed his tobacco for a time quietly retrospective reliving in the company of men now dust with the dust for which they had unwittingly perhaps fought those gallant pinchbellied days into which few who now trod that earth and drew breath could enter into with him old bayard shook the ash from his cigar will he said what the devil were you folks fighting about anyhow bayard old man falls answered damned ef i ever did know after old man falls had departed with his small parcel and his innocently bulging cheek old bayard sat and smoked his cigar he knew now a sense of finality of peace like that of the man who has made his final cast with the dice and from whom all initiative is lifted leaving him no more than a vegetable until they cease rolling let them show what they may he had crossed the rubiconbut had he he raised his hand and touched the wen again but lightly recalling old man falls parting stricture and recalling this the thought that it might not yet be too late that he might yet remove the paste with water followed he rose and crossed to the lavatory in the corner of the room above it was fixed a small cabinet with a mirror in the door and in it he examined the black spot on his face touching it again with his fingers then staring at his hand yes it might still come offbut be damned if he would be damned to a man who didnt know his own mind and will falls too will falls hale and sane and sound asa dollar will falls who as he himself had said was too old to have any reason for injuring anyone he flung his cigar away and quitted the room and tramped through the lobby toward the door where his chair sat but before he reached the door he stopped and turned and came up to the tellers window behind which the cashier sat in a green eyeshade res he said the cashier looked up yes colonel who is that damn boy that hangs around here looking through that window all the time old bayard demanded lowering his voice within a pitch or so of an ordinary conversational tone what boy colonel old bayard pointed and the cashier raised himself on his stool and peered over the partition and saw without the indicated window a boy of ten or twelve watching him with an innocently casual air oh thats will beards boy from up at the boarding house he shouted friend of byrons i think whats he doing then every time i walk through here there he is looking in that window what does he want maybe hes a bank robber the cashier suggested what old bayard cupped his ear fiercely in his palm maybe hes a bank robber the other shouted leaning forward on his stool old bayard snorted and tramped violently away and slammed his chair back against the door the cashier sat lumped and shapeless on his stool rumbling deep within his gross body he said without turning his head colonels let will falls treat that thing on his face with that salve the snopes at his desk made no reply did not raise his head after a time the boy moved and drifted casually and innocently away virgil beard now possessed besides the air rifle a pistol that projected a stream of ammoniac water excruciatingly painful to the eyes a small magic lantern and an excandy showcase in which he kept birds eggs and an assortment of insects that had died slowly on pins and a modest hoard of nickels and dimes and quarters with a childs innocent pleasure he divulged to his parents the source of this beneficence and his mother took snopes to her gray heart fixing him special dishes and performing trifling acts to increase his creature comfort with bleak and awkward gratitude at times the boy already dressed and with his bland shining face would enter his room and waken him from his troubled sleep and sit on a chair while snopes donned his clothing talking politely and vaguely of certain things he aimed to do and of what he would require to do them successfully with or if not this he was on hand at breakfast while his harried gray mother and the slatternly negress bore dishes back and forth from the kitchen quiet but proprietorial blandly and innocently portentous and all during the banking day it was summer now and school was out snopes never knew when he would look over his shoulder and find the boy lounging without the plate glass window of the bank watching him with profound and static patience presently he would take himself away and for a short time snopes would be able to forget him until wrapped in his mad unsleeping dream he mounted the boarding house veranda at supper time and found the boy sitting there and waiting patiently his return innocent and bland steadfast and unassertive as a minor but chronic disease got another business letter to write tonight mr snopes and sometimes after he had gone to bed and his light was out he lay in the mad darkness against his sleepless desire moiled in obscene images and shapes and heard presently outside his door secret ratlike sounds and lay so tense in the dark expecting the door to open and preceded by breathing above him sourceless and invisible going to write another letter mr snopes and he waked sweating from dreams in which her image lived and moved and thwarted and mocked him with the pillow crushed against his mean halfinsane face while the words produced themselves in his ears got air other letter to write yet mr snopes so he changed his boarding house he gave mrs beard an awkward stumbling explanation vague composed of sentences with frayed ends she was sorry to see him go but she permitted him to pack his meagre belongings and depart without dither anger or complaint as is the way of country people he went to live with a relation that i o snopes who ran the restauranta nimble wiry little man with a talkative face like a nutcracker and false merry eyesin a small frame house painted a sultryprodigious yellow near the railway station snopeses did not trust one another enough to develop any intimate relations and he was permitted to go and come when he pleased so he found this better than the boarding house the single deterrent to complete satisfaction being the hulking but catlike presence of ios son clarence but what with his secretive nature it had even been his custom to keep all his possessions under lock and key so this was but a minor matter mrs snopes was a placid mountain of a woman who swung all day in a faded wrapper in the porch swing not reading not doing anything just swinging he liked it here it was more private no transients appearing at the supper table and tramping up and down the hallways all night no one to try to engage him in conversation on the veranda after supper now after supper he could sit undisturbed on the tight barren little porch in the growing twilight and watch the motor cars congregating at the station across the way to meet the train could watch the train draw into the station with its rows of lighted windows and the hissing plume from the locomotive and go on again with bells trailing its diminishing sound into the distant evening while he sat on the dark porch with his desperate sleepless lust and his fear thus until one evening after supper he stepped through the front door and found virgil beard sitting patiently and blandly on the front steps in the twilight so he had been run to earth again and drawn and hounded again into flight yet outwardly he pursued the even tenor of his days unchanged performing his duties with his slow meticulous care but within him smoldered something of which he himself grew afraid and at times he found himself gazing at hisidle hands on the desk before him as though they were not his hands wondering dully at them and at what they were capable nay importunate to do and day by day that lust and fear and despair that moiled within him merged becoming desperationa thing blind and vicious and hopeless like that of a cornered rat and always if he but raised his head and looked toward the window there was the boy watching him with bland and innocent eye beneath the pale straw of his hair sometimes he blinked then the boy was gone sometimes not so he could never tell whether the face had been there at all or whether it was merely another face swum momentarily from out the seething of his mind in the meanwhile he wrote another letter miss jennys exasperation and rage when old bayard arrived that afternoon was unbounded you stubborn old fool she stormed cant bayard kill you fast enough that youve got to let that old quack of a will falls give you blood poisoning after what dr alford told you when even loosh peabody who thinks a course of quinine or calomel will cure anything from a broken neck to chilblains agreed with him ill declare sometimes i just lose all patience with you folks wonder what crime i seem to be expiating by having to live with you soon as bayard sort of quiets down and i can quit jumping every time the phone rings you have to go and let that old pauper daub your face up with axle grease and lamp black im a good mind to pack up and get out and start life over again in some place where they never heard of a sartoris she raged andstormed on old bayard raged in reply with violent words and profane and their voices swelled and surged through the house until simon and elnora in the kitchen moved about with furtive hushed sounds finally old bayard tramped from the house and mounted his horse and rode away leaving miss jenny to wear her rage out upon the empty air and then therewas peace for a time but at supper the storm brewed and burst again simon within the butlers pantry could hear them beyond the swing door and young bayards voice too trying to shout them down let up let up he howled for gods sake i cant hear myself chew and youre another one miss jenny turned promptly on him youre just as trying as he is you and your stiffnecked sullen ways helling around the country in that car just because you think there may be somebody who cares whether or not you break your worthless neck and then coming into the supper table smelling like a stablehand just because you went to a war do you think nobody else ever went to a war do you reckon that when my bayard came back from the war he made a nuisance of himself to everybody that had to live with him but he was a gentleman he raised the devil like a gentleman not like you mississippi country people clodhoppers look what he did with just a horseshe added he didnt have any flying machine look at the little twobit warhewent to young bayard rejoined a war that was so sorry that grandfather wouldnt stay up there in virginia where it was even and nobody wanted him at it miss jenny retorted a man that would get mad just because his men deposed him and elected a better colonel in hisplace got mad and came back to the country to lead a bunch of brigands little twobit war young bayard repeated and on a horse anybody can go to a war on a horse no chance for him to do anything much atleast he got himself decently killed miss jenny snapped he did more with a horse than you could do with that aeroplane sho simon breathed against the pantry door aint dey gwine it takes white folks to shonoughquoil and so it surged and ebbed through the succeeding days wore itself out then surged again when old bayard returned home with another application of old man falls paste but by this time simon was having troubles of his own troubles which he finally consulted old bayard about one afternoon young bayard was laid up in bed with his crushed ribs with miss jenny mothering him with violent and cherishing affection and miss benbow to visit with him and read aloud to him and simon came into his own again the tophat and the duster came down from the nail and old bayards cigars depleted daily by one and the fat matched horses spent their accumulated laziness and insolence between home and the bank before which simon swung them to a halt each afternoon as of old with his clamped cigar and his smartly furled whip and all the theatrics of the fine moment de ottomobile simon philosophized is all right for pleasure and excitement but fer de genuwine genlmun tone dey aint but one thing dats hosses thus simons opportunity came ready to his hand and once they were clear of town and the team had settled into its gait he took advantage of it well cunnel he began looks lak me en yous got to make some financial rangements what old bayard brought his attention back from where it wandered about the familiar landscape of planted fields and blue shining hills beyond them i says it looks lak me en yous goin ter have to arrange about a little cash money much obliged simon old bayard answeredbut i dont need any money right now im muchobliged though simon laughed heartily from the teeth outi declare cunnel you sho is comical rich man lak you needin money and he laughed again with unctuous arid abortive heartiness yes suh you sho is comical then he ceased laughing and became engrossed with the horses for a momenttwins they were roosevelt and taft with sleek hides and broad comfortable hips you taf lean on dat collar laziness gwine go in on you someday and kill you sho old bayard sat watching his apelike head and the swaggering tilt of the tophat then simon turned his wizened plausible face over his shoulder but shonough now we is got to quiet dem niggers somehow what have they done cant they find anybody to take their money well suh hits lak dis simon explained hits kind of all round cuis you see dey been collectin buildin money fer dat church whut burnt down and ez dey got de money up dey turnt hit over to me whut wid my ficial position

and the whip caught smartly back in his hand glancing now and then at the field niggers laboring among the cotton rows with tolerant and easy scorn oldman falls replaced the cap on his tin of salve wiped the tin carefully with the bit of rag then knelt on the cold hearth and held a match to the rag i reckon them doctors air still atellin you hits gwine to kill you aint they he said old bayard propped his feet against the hearth cupping a match to his cigar cupping two tiny matchflames in his eyes he flung the match away and grunted old man falls watched the rag take fire sluggishly with a pungent pencil of yellowish smoke that broke curling in the still air ever now and then a feller has to walk up and spit in deestructions face sort of fer his own good he has to kind of put a aidge on

standin thar jest like this he crossed his arms on his breast his hands in sight and for a moment old bayard saw as through a cloudy glass that arrogant and familiar shape which the old man in shabby overalls had contrived in some way to immolate and preserve in the vacuum of his own abnegated self then when they was gone on back down the road cunnel reached around inside the do and lifted out the ballot box and sot hit between his feet you niggers come hyer to vote did you he says all right come up hyer and vote when they had broke and scattered he let off that ere dernger over their haids a

bayard old man falls said i sort of envied them two nawthuners be damned ef i didnt a feller kin take a wife and live with her a long time but after all they aint no kin but the feller that brings you into the world or sends you outen hit lurking behind the pantry door simon could hear the steady storming of miss jennys and old bayards voices later when they had removed to the office and elnora and isom and caspey sat about the table in the kitchen waiting for simon the concussion ofmiss jennys raging and old bayards rocklike stubbornness came in muffled surges as of faraway surf what dey quoilin about now caspey asked is you been and done something he demanded of his nephew isom rolled his eyes quietly above his steady jaws naw suh he mumbled i aint done nothin seems like deyd git wo out after a while whats pappy doin elnora up dar in de hall listenin go tell im to come on and git his supper so i kin git done isom isom slid from his chair still chewing and left the kitchen the

who dyin pappy aint nobody dyin does anybody soun dead you git on outende house now together they returned down the hall and entered the kitchen behind them the voices raged and stormed blurred a little by walls but dominant and unequivocal whut dey fighfin erbout now caspey chewing asked dats white folks bizness simon told him you tend to yon and deyll git erlong all right he sat down and elnora rose and filled a cup from the coffee pot on the stove and brought it to him white folks got dey troubles same as niggers is gimme dat dish o meat boy in the house the storm ran its nightly course ceased as though by mutual consent both parties still firmly entrenched resumed at the supper table the next evening and so on day after day until the second week in july and six days after young bayard had been fetched home with his chest crushed miss jenny and old bayard and dr alford went to memphis to consult a wellknownauthority on blood and glandular diseases with whom dr alford with some difficulty had made a formal engagement young bayard lay upstairs in his cast but simon and elnora would be about the house ill day and narcissa benbow had agreed to come out and keep him company between the two of them they got old bayard on the early train still pro testing profanely like a stubborn and bewildered ox there were others who knew them in the car these stopped and spoke to them and remarking dr alfords juxtaposition became curious and solicitous old bayard took these opportunities to assert himself again with violent rumbling but miss jenny hushed him coldly and implacably they took him like a sullen small boy in a cab to the clinic where the specialist waited them and in a room resembling an easy and informal hotel lobby they sat among other consultants and an untidy clutter of magazines and papers waiting for the specialist to arrive they waited a long time meanwhile dr alford from time to time assaulted the impregnable affability of the woman at the telephone switchboard was repulsed and returned and sat stiffly beside his patient aware that with every minute they waited he was losing ground in miss jennys opinion of him old bayard was cowed too by this time though occasionally he rumbled at miss jenny with stubborn and hopeless optimism oh stop swearing at me she interrupted him you cant walk out now here heres the morning papertake it and be quiet then the specialist entered briskly and crossed to the switchboard woman where dr alford saw him and rose and crossed to him the specialist turneda brisk dapper man who moved with arrogant jerky motions as though he were exercising with a small sword and who in turning almost stepped on dr alford he shook dr alfords hand and broke into a high desiccated stream of rapid words on the dot i see promptness promptness thats good patient here asked for a room yet yes doctor hes good good undressed her already eh the patient is a m just a moment the specialist turned oh mrs smith yes doctor the woman at the switchboard did not raise her head and at that moment another specialist of some sort a large one with a profound surreptitious air like a royal undertaker entered andstopped dr alfords and for a while the two of them alternately rumbled and rattled at one another while dr alford stood ignored nearby fuming stiffly and politely feeling himself sinking lower and lower in miss jennys opinion of his professional status thai the two specialists had done and dr alford led his man toward his patient got the patient all ready you say good good save time lunching down town today had lunch yourself no doctor but the patient is a daresay not the specialist agreed plenty of time though he turned briskly toward a curtained exit but dr alford took his arm firmly but courteously and halted him old bayard was reading the paper miss jenny was watching them with cold and smoldering disapproval mrs du pre colonel sartorisdr alford said this is dr brandt colonel sartoris is your p how dye do how dye do the specialist said affably come along with the patient eh daughter granddaughter old bayard looked up what he said cupping his ear and found the specialist staling at his face with abrupt interest whats that on your face he demanded jerking his hand forth and touching the blackened scabby excrescence when he did so the thing came off in his fingers leaving on old bayards withered but unblemished cheek a round spot of skin rosy and fair as anybabys on the train that evening old bayard who had sat for a long time in deep thought spoke suddenly jenny what day of the month is this the ninth miss jenny answered why old bayard sat for a while longer then he rose think ill go up and smoke a cigar he said ireckon a little tobacco wont hurt me will it doctor three weeks later they got a bill from the specialist for fifty dollars now i know why hes so well known miss jenny said acidly then to old bayard youd better thank your stars it wasnt your hat he lifted off toward dr alford her manner is fiercely and belligerently protective to old man falls she gives the briefest and coldest nod and sails on with her nose in air but to loosh peabody she does not speak at all she passed from the fresh hot morning into the cool hall where simon uselessly and importantly proprietorial with a duster bobbed his head to her dey done gone to memphis today he told her but mist bayard waitin fer you walk right up missy thank you she said and she went on and mounted the stairs and left mm busily wafting dust from one surface to another and then back again the stairs curved onward into the upper hall and she mounted into a steady drift of air that blew through the open doors at the end of the hall through these doors she could see a segment of blue dissolving lulls and saltcolored sky at bayards door she stopped and stood there for a time clasping the book to her breast the house despite simons activity in the hall below was a little portentously quiet without the reassurance of miss jennys bustling presence and the cold ubiquity of her scolding faint sounds reached her from far awayoutofdoors sounds whose final drowsy reverberations drifted into the house on thevivid july air sounds too somnolent and remote to the away but from the room before her no sound came at all perhaps he was asleep and the initial impulseher given word and the fortitude of her desperate heart which had enabled her to come out despite miss jennys absencehaving served its purpose and deserted her she stood just without the door hoping that he was asleep that he would sleep all day thus she found that she could still hope and found in this fact a thin and derisive amusement but she would have to enter the room in order to find out if he slept so she touched her hands to her face as though by that she would restore to it its wonted serene repose for him to see and entered simon bayard said having felt her presence through that sharpened sixth sense of the sick he lay onhis back his hands beneath his head gazing out the window and she paused again just inside the door at last roused by her silence he turned his head and jus bleak gaze well ill be damned i didnt believe youd come out today yes she answered how do you feel not after the way you sit with one foot in the hall all the time aunt jennys out of the room he continued did she make you come out she asked me to come out she doesnt want you tobe alone all day with just simon in the house do you feel better today so he drawled wont you sit down then she crossed to where her customary chair had been moved into a corner and drew it across the floor he lay with his head cradled in his hands watching her as she turned the chair about and seated herself what do you think about it about what about coming out to keep me company ive brought a new book she said evasively one hone i just got i hope youll like this one i hope so he agreed but without conviction seems like id like one after a while doesnt it but what do you think about coming out here today i dont think a sick person should be left alone with just negroes around the name of this one is why not send a nurse out then no use your coming way out here she met his gaze at last with her grave desperate eyes why do you come when you dont want to he persisted i dont mind she answered hopelessly she freed her gaze with an effort and opened the book the name of this one is dont he interrupted ill have to listen to that damn thing all day lets talk a while but she presented him now the dark crown of her head and her hands were motionless upon the book on her knees what makes you afraid to talk to me he demanded afraid she repeated with her head bent above the book had you rather id go what no dammit i want you to be human for one time and talk to me come over here she would not look at him but she could feel the moody leashed violence of him like a steady glare of light beneath which she shrank and recoiled and despite the assurance of his helpless immobility she was swept by sudden and unreasoning fear and she raised her hands between them though he lay two yards away and helpless on his back come over here closer he commanded she rose clutching the book im going she said ill tell simon to stay where he can hear you call goodbye here he exclaimedshe went swiftly to the door goodbye after what you just said about leaving me alone with just niggers on the place she paused at the door and he added with cold cunning after what aunt jenny told you whatll i tell her tonight why are you afraid of a man flat on his back in a damn castiron straitjacket anyway but she only looked at him with her desperate hopeless eyes all right dammit lie said violently go then and he jerked his head savagely on the pillow and stared again out the window while she returned to her chair he said mildly whats the name of this one she told him let her go then i reckon ill be asleep soon anyway she opened the book and began to read swiftly as though she were crouching behind the screen of words her voice raised between them she read steadily on her head bent over the book she finished a sentence and stopped and sat utterly still above the book but almost immediately he spoke go on im still here better luck next time the forenoon passed on somewhere a clock rang the quarter hours but saving this there was no sound from the other parts of the house simons activity below stairs had long ceased but a murmur of voices reached her at intervals from somewhere murmurously indistinguishable the leaves on the tree beyond the window did not stir in the hot air and upon it a myriad noises blended in a drowsy monotone the negroes voices sounds of stock from the barnyard the rhythmic groaning of the water pump a sudden cacophony of fowls in the garden beneath the window interspersed with isoms meaningless cries as he drove them out he was asleep now and as she realized this she realized also that she did not know just when she had stopped reading and she sat with the page open upon her knees a page whose words left no echoes whatever in her mind watching his calm face it was again like a bronze made purged by illness of the heat of its violence yet with the violence still slumbering there and only refined a little she sat with the book open upon her lap her hands lying motionless upon the opened page gazing out the window the curtains stirred faintly and in the branches of the tree athwart the window the leaves twinkled lighdy beneath the intermittent fingers of the sun the clock rang again a sound cool as stroked silver in the silent house and preceded by cautious stertorious breathing someone crept up the stairs and after more surreptitious sounds simon peered his disembodied head like that of the curious and wizened grandfather of all apes around the door is you sleep mist bayard he said in a loud rasping tone shhhhhhhh she cautionedhim what is it ef he sleep i dont reckon he wants no dinnernow do he simon rasped be quiet youll have to keep it until he wakes yessum i speck so simon agreed lowering his voice a little he entered on tiptoe and while narcissa watched him in mounting exasperation arid alarm he scuffed across to the table with sounds as of a huge rat what are you going to do she whispered youd better go and tell elnora to keep his dinner for him ill call you when he wakes yessum i speck so simon agreed again he now busied himself at the table upon which the books they had read during the past two weeks werestacked one upon another and as she rose swiftly and quietly he toppled the stack over and lunged clumsily at it and succeeded in knocking it to the floor with a random crash bayard opened eyes good lord he said why cant you stay out of here well now simon exclaimed in ready dismay ef we aint woke im up yes suh me en miss benbow done woke im up we wuz gwine save yo dinner mist bayard but i reckon you mought jes well eat it long ez you wake i reckon so bayard agreed bring it up then but damned if i wouldnt like to know what objection you have to my sleeping thank god you were not born in a drove like mosquitoes des lissen at im wake up quoilin youll feel better when you et some dinner he told the patient then to narcissa elnora got a nice dinner fer yall bring miss benbows up too bayard directed she can eat here unless youd rather go down in all his movements simon was a caricature of himself and he paused in an attitude of shocked reproof dinin room mo suitable fer compny he said yes ill go down she decided promptly i wont put simon to that trouble taint no trouble simon disclaimed i jes thought you mought like to git out fer a while whar he cant quoil at you im gwine put it on de table right away missy you can walk right down yes ill come right down he departed and she laid the book aside tried to keep i know bayard interrupted he wont let anybody sleep through mealtime and youd better goand have yours or hell carry everything back to thekitchen and you dont have to hurry back just onmy account he added dont have to hurry back she paused at the door and looked back at him what do you mean i thought you might be tired of reading oh she said and looked away and stood fora moment clothed in her grave tranquility look here he said suddenly are you sick or anything had you rather go home no she answered rousing ill be back soon she had her meal in lonely state in the sombre dining room while simon having dispatched bayards tray by isom moved about the table and pressed dishes upon her with bland insistence or leaned against the sideboard and conducted a rambling monologue that seemed to have had no beginning and held no prospect of an end it still flowed easily behind her as she went up the hall as she stood in the door it was still going on volitionless as though entranced with its own existence and feeding on its own momentum the salvia bed lay in an unbearable glare of white light in clamorous splashes beyond it the drive shimmered with heat until arched over with locust and oak it descended in a cool green tunnel to the gates and the sultry ribbon of the highroad beyond the road fields stretched away shimmering broken here and there by motionless clumps of trees on to the hills dissolving bluely behind the july haze she leaned for a while against the door in her white dress her cheek against the cool smooth plane of the jamb in a faint draft that came steadily from somewhere though no leaf stirred simon had finished in the dining room and a drowsy murmur of voices came up the hall from the kitchen borneupon a thin stirring of air too warm to be called a breeze and upon which not even the cries of birds came at last she heard a movement from above stairs and she remembered isom with bayards tray and she turned and did the parlor door ajar and entered the shades were drawn closely and the crack of light that followed her but deepened the gloom she found the piano and stood beside it for a while touching its dusty surface and thinking of miss jenny erect and indomitable in the gloom beside it she heard isom descend the stairs soon his footsteps died away down the hall and the drew out the bench and sat down and laid her arms along the closed lid simon entered the dining room again mumbling to himself and followed presently by elnora and they clashed dishes and talked again with a mellow rise and fall of consonantless and indistinguishable words then they went away but still she sat with her arms along the cool wood in the dark quiet room where even time stagnated a little the clock rang again and she moved ive been crying she thought ive been cryingshe said in a sad whisper that savored its own loneliness arid its sorrow at the tall mirror beside the parlor door she stood and peered at her dim reflection touching her eyeswith her fingertips then she went on but paused again at the stairs listening then she mounted briskly and entered miss jennys room and went on to her bathroom and bathed her face bayard lay as she had left him he was smoking a cigarette now between puffs he dabbed it casually at a saucer on the bed beside him well he said youre going to set the house on fire that way she told him removing the saucer you know miss jenny wouldnt let you do that i know it he agreed a little sheepishly and she dragged the table over and set the saucer on it can you reachit now yes thanks did they give you enough to eat oh yes simons very insistent you know shall iread some more or had you rather sleep read if you dont mind i think ill stay awake thistime is that a threat he looked at her quickly as she seated herself and took up the book say what happened to you he demanded you acted like you were all in before dinner simon give you a drink or what no not that bad and she laughed a little wildly and opened the book i forgot to mark the place she said turning the pages swiftlydo you rememberno you were asleep shall i go back to where you stopped listening no just read anywhere its all about alike i guess if youll move a little nearer i believe i can stayawake sleep if you want to i dont mind she answered meaning you wont come any nearer he asked watching her with his bleak gaze she moved her chair nearer and opened the book again and turned the pages on slowing and scanning them i think it was about here she said with indecision yes she read to herself for a line or two then she began aloud read to the end of the page where her voice trailed off and she creased her brow turned the nest page then flipped it back i read this once i remember it now and she turned onward again with frowning indecision i must have been asleep too she said and she glanced at him with ludicrous and friendly bewilderment i seem to have read pages and pages oh begin anywhere he repeated no wait here it is she read again and he lay watching her at times she raised her eyes swiftly and found his eyes upon her face bleakly but quietly after a while he was no longer watching her and at last finding that his eyes were closed she thought he slept she finished the chapter and stopped no he said drowsily not yet then when she failed to resume he opened his eyesand asked for a cigarette she laid the book aside and struck a match for him then picked up the book again so the afternoon wore away the negroes had gone and no sound was in the house save that of her voice arid the clock at quarter hour intervals outside the shadows slanted more and more peaceful harbingers of evening bayard was asleep now despite his contrary conviction and after a while she ceased and laid the book away the long shape of him lay stiffly in its cast beneath the sheet and she examined his bold immobile face with a little shrinking and yet with fascination and her own patient and hopeless sorrow overflowed there was enough of it to anneal the world in pity for him he was so utterly without any affection for any place or person or thing at all tootoohard no thats not the wordbut cold eluded her she could comprehend hardness but not coldness to find relief by crying even better to have lost it than never to have had it at all at all the afternoon drew on evening was finding itself she sat musing and still and quiet gazing out of the window where no wind yet stirred the leaves as though she were waiting for someone to tell her what to do next and she lost all account of time other than as a dark unhurrying stream into whichshe gazed until the mesmerism of water conjured the water itself away lost lost yet never to have had itstall he made an indescribable sound and she turned her head quickly and saw his body straining terrifically in its cast and his clenched hands and the snarl of his teeth beneath his lifted lip and as she sat blanched and incapable of further movement he made the sound again his breath hissed between his teeth and he screamed a wordless sound that sank into a steady violence of profanity and when she rose at last and stood over him with her hands against her mouth his body relaxed and from beneath his sweating brow he watched her with wide intent eyes in which terror lurked and mad cold fury and questioning despair he damn near got me then he said in a dry light voice still watching her from beyond the facing agony in his widely opened eyes there was a sort of loop of em around my chest and every time he fired he twisted the loop a little tighter he fumbled at the sheet and tried to draw it up to his face can you get me a handkerchief some in that top drawer there yes she said yes and she crossed to the chest df drawers and held her trembling body upright by clinging to it and found a handkerchief and returned she tried to dry his brow and face but finally he took the handkerchief from her and did it himself you scared me she moaned you scared me so bad i thought sorry he said shortly i dont do that on purpose i want a cigarette she gave it to him and struck the match and he had to grasp her hand to hold the flame steady andstill holding her wrist he drew deeply several times she tried to free her wrist but he held it in his hard fingers and her trembling body betrayed her and she sank into her chair again staring at him with ebbing terror and dread he consumed the cigarette in deep troubled draughts and still holding her wrist he began talking of his dead brother without preamble brutally it was a brutal tale without beginning and crassly and uselessly violent and at times profane and gross though its very wildness robbed it of offensiveness just as its grossness kept it from obscenity and beneath it all the bitter struggling of his stubborn heart and she sitting with her arm taut in his grasp and tier other hand pressed against hei mouth watching him with terrified fascination he was zigzagging that was the reason i couldnt get on the hun every time i got my sights on him johnd barge in the way again then he quit zigzagging soon as i saw him sideslip i knew it was all over then i saw the flame streaming out along his wing and he was looking back at me the hun stopped shooting then and all of us just lay there for a while i couldnt tell what john was up to until saw him swing his legs outside then he thumbed his nose at me like he always was doing and flipped his hand at the hun and kicked his machine out of the way and jumped he jumped feet first you cant fall farfeet first you know and so pretty soon he sprawled out flat there was a bunch of cloud right under us by that time and he smacked on it right on his belly eke what we used to call gutbusters in swimming but i never could pick him up below the cloud i know i was below it before he could have come out because after i was down there his machine came diving out right at me burning good i pulled away from it but the damn thing did a splitturn and rushed at me again and i had to dodge and so i never could pick him up when he came out of the cloud i went down fast until i knew i was below him then i looked again but i couldnt find him and i thought maybe i hadnt gone low enough so i dived again but i couldnt pick him up then they started shooting at me from the ground he talked on and her hand came away from her mouth and slid down her other arm and tugged at his fingers pleaseshe whispered please he ceased and looked at her and his fingers shifted and just as she thought she was free they clamped again and now both of her wrists were prisoners she struggled staring at him dreadfully but he grinned his white cruel teeth at her and pressed her crossed arms down upon the bed beside him please please she implored struggling she could feel the flesh of her wrists feel the bones turn in it like a loose garment could see his bleak eyes and the cruel derision of his teeth and suddenly she swayed forward in her chair and her head dropped between her prisoned arms and she wept with hopeless and dreadful hysteria after a while there was no sound in the room again and he looked at the dark crown of her head and he lifted his hand and saw the braised discolorations where his hands had gripped her but she did not move even then and he dropped his hand upon her wrists again and lay quietly and after a while even her trembling had ceased im sorry he said i wont do it again he could see only the top of herdark head and her hands lay quietly beneath his im sorry he repeated i wont do that anymore you wont drive that car fast again she asked with infinite small pains and slowly he turned himself cast and all by degrees onto his side chewing his lip and swearing under his breath and laid his other hand on her hair what are you doing she said but without moving youll break your ribs again yes he agreed stroking her hair awkwardly thats the trouble right there she said thats the way you act doing things thatthatyou do things to hurt yourself just to worry people you dont get any fun out of doing them no he agreed and he lay with his chest full of hot needles stroking her dark head with his hard awkward hand far above him now the peak among the black and savage stars and about him the valleys of tranquility and of peace it was later still already shadows were growing in the room and beyond the window sunlight was a diffused radiance sourceless yet palpable from somewhere cows loved one to another placidly and mournfully at last she sat up youre all twisted youll never get well if you dont behave yourself turn on your back now he obeyed slowly and painfully his lip between his teeth and faint beads on his forehead while she watched him with grave anxietydoes it hurt no he answered and his hand shut again on her wrists that made no effort to withdraw then the sun was gone and twilight fosterdam of quietude and peace filled the fading room and evening had found itself and you wont drive that car fast anymore she persisted from the dusk no he answered meanwhile she had received another letter from her anonymous correspondent horace when he came in one night had brought it in to her as she lay in bed with a book tapped at her door and opened it and stood for a moment diffidently and for a while they looked at one another across the barrier of their estrangement and their stubborn pride excuse me for disturbing you he said stiffly she lay beneath the shaded light with the dark splash of her hair upon the pillow and only her eyes moved as he crossed the room and stood above her where she lay with her lowered book watching himwith sober interrogation what are you reading he asked for reply she shut the book on her finger with the jacket and its colored legend upward but he did not look at it ibs shirt was open beneath his silk dressing gown and jus thin hand moved among the objects on the table beside the bed picked up another book never knew you to read so much it have more time for reading now she answered yeshis hand stillmoved about the table touching things here and there she lay waiting for him to speak but he did not and she said what is it horry then he ceased and he came and sat on the edge of the bed but still her eyes were gravely interrogatory and the shadow of her mouth was stubbornly cold narcy he said she lowered her eyesto the book and he added first i want to apologize for leaving you alone so often at night yes he laid his hand on her knee look at me she raised her face and the antagonism of her eyesi want to apologize for leaving you alone at night he repeated does that mean you arent going to do it anymore or that youre not coming in at all for a time he sat brooding upon the wild repose of his hand upon her covered knee then he rose and stood beside the table again touching the objects there then he returned and sat on the bed she was reading again and he tried to take the book from her hand she resisted what do you want horace she asked impatiently he mused again while she watched him then he looked up belle and i are going to be married he blurted why tell me harry is the one to tell unless you all are going to dispense with the formality of divorce yes he said he knows it he laid his hand on her knee again stroking it through the covers you arent even surprised are you im surprised at you but not at belle belle has a backstairs nature yes he agreed then who said that to you you didnt think of that she lay with her book half raised watching him he took her hand roughly she tried to free it but he held on who was it he demanded nobody told me dont horace he released her hand i know who it was it was mrs dupre it wasnt anybody she repeated go away and leave me alone horace and behind the antagonismher eyes were hopeless and desperate dont you see that talking doesnt help any yes he said wearily but he sat for a while yet stroking her knee then he rose but turning he paused again heres a letter for you i forgot it this afternoon sorry but she was reading again put it on the table she said without raising her eyes he laid it on the table and went out at the door he looked back but her head was bent over her book as he removed his clothes it did seem that that heavy fading odor of belles body clung to them and to his hands even after he was in bed and clinging shaped in the darkness beside him belles rich voluption until within that warm notyetsleeping region where dwells the mother of dreams belle grew palpable in ratio as his own body slipped away from him and harry top with his dogged inarticulateness and his hurt groping which was partly damaged vanity and shock yet mostly a boys sincere bewilderment that freed itself terrifically in the form of movie subtitles just before he slept his mind with the minds uncanny attribute of irrelevant recapitulation reproduced with the startling ghostliness of a dictaphone an incident which at the time he had considered trivial belle had freed her mouth and for a moment with her body still against his she held his face in her two hands and stared at him with intent questioning eyes have you plenty of money horace and yes he had answered immediately of course i have and then belle again enveloping him like a rich and fatal drug like a motionless and cloying sea in which he watched himself drown the letter lay on the table that night forgotten it was not until the next morning that she discovered it and opened it i am trying to forget you i cannot forget you your big eyes your black hair how white your black hair will make you look and how you walk i am watching you and a smell you give off like a flower your eyes shine with mystery and how you walk makes me sick like a fever all night thinking how you walk i could touch you you would not know it every day but i can not i must pore out on paper must talk you do not know who your lips like cupids bow when the day comes when i will press them to mine like i dreamed like a fever from heaven to hell i know what you do i know more than you think i see men visiting you with bitter twangs be careful i am a desperate man nothing is any more to me now if you unholy love a man i will killhim you do not answer i know you got it i saw one in your hand you better answer soon i am a desperate man eat up with fever i can not sleep for i will not hurt you but i amdesperate do not forget i will not hurt you but i am a desperate man meanwhile the days accumulated not sad days nor lonely they were too feverish to be sorrowful what with the violated serenity of her nature torn in two directions and the walls of her garden cast down and she herself like a night animal or bird caught in a beam of light and trying vainly to escape horace had definitely gone his way they could no longer hear one anothers feet on the dark road and like two strangers they followed the routine of theirdays in an unbending estrangement of long affection and similar pride beneath a shallow veneer of polite trivialities she sat with bayard almost every day now but at a discreet distance of two yards at first he tried to override her with bluster then with cajolery but she was firm and at last he desisted and lay gazing quietly out the window or sleeping while she read from time to time miss jenny would come to the door and look in at them and go away her shrinking her sense of dread and unease while with him was gone now and at times instead of reading they talked quietly and impersonally with that ghost of that other afternoon between them though neither referred to it miss jenny had been a little curious about that day but narcissa was gravely and demurely noncommittal about it nor had bayard ever talked about it and so there was another bond between them but unirksome miss jenny had heard gossip about horace and belle but on this subject also narcissa would not talk have it your own way miss jenny said tardy i can draw my own conclusions i imagine belle and horace can produce quite a mess together and im glad of it that man is making an old maid out of you it isnt too late now but if hed waited five years later to play the fool there wouldnt be anything left for you except to give music lessons but you can get married now would you advise me to marry narcissa asked i wouldnt advise anybody to marry you wont be happy but women havent got civilized enough yet to be happy unmarried so you might as well try it we can stand anything anyway and change is good for folks they say it is that is but narcissa didnt believe that i shall never marry she told herself menthat was where unhappiness lay and if i couldnt keep horace loving him as i didbayard slept she picked up the book and read on to herself about antic people in an antic world where things happened as they should the shadows lengthened eastward she read on lost from mutable things after a while bayard waked and she fetched him a cigarette and a match you wont have to do this anymore he said i reckon youre glad his cast would come off tomorrow he meant and he lay smoking his cigarette and talking of what he would do when he was about again he would see about getting his car repaired first thing have to take it to memphis probably and he planned a trip for the three of themnarcissa miss jenny and himselfwhile the car was in the shop itll take about a week he added she must be in pretty bad shape hope i havent hurt her guts any but you arent going to drive it fast anymore she reminded him he lay still his cigarette burning in his fingers you promised she insisted when did i promise dont you remember thatafternoon when they were when i scared you she sat watching him with her grave troubled eyes come here he said she rose and went to the bed and he took her hand you wont drive it fast again she persisted no he answered i promise and they were still so her hand in his the curtains stirred in the breeze and the leaves on the branch beyond the window twinkled and turned and lisped against one another sunset was not far away it would cease then he moved narcissa he said and she looked at him lean your face down here she looked away and for a while there was no movement no sound between them i must go she said at last quietly and he released her hand his cast was gone and he was up and about again moving a little gingerly it is true but already miss jenny was beginning to contemplate him a little anxiously if we could just arrange to have one of his minor bones broken every month or so just enough to keep him in the houseshe said that wont be necessary narcissa told her hes going to behave from now on how do you know miss jenny demanded what in the world makes you think that he promised he would hell promise anything when hes flat on his back miss jenny retorted they all will always have but what makes you think he will he promised me he would narcissa answered serenely his first act was to see about his car it had been pulled into town and patched up after a fashion until it would run under its own power but it would be necessary to take it to memphis to have the frame straightened and the body repaired bayard was all for doing this himself freshknit ribs and all but miss jenny put her foot down and after a furious half hour he was vanquished and so the car was driven in to memphis by a youth who hung around one of the garages in town narcissall take you driving in her car if you must ride miss jenny told him in that little peanut parcher bayard said derisively it wont do more than twentyone miles an hour no thank god miss jenny answered and ive written to memphis and asked em to fix yours so itll run just like that too bayard stared at her with slow and humorless bleakness did you do any such damn thing as that oh take him away narcissa miss jenny exclaimedget him out of my sight im so tired of looking at you but he wouldnt ride in narcissas car at first he missed no opportunity to speak of it with heavy facetious disparagement but he wouldnt ride in it dr alford had evolved a tight rubber bandage for his chest so that he could ride a horse but he had developed an astonishing propensity for lounging about the house when narcissa was there and narcissa came quite often miss jenny thought that it was on bayards account and pinned the guest down in her forthright way whereupon narcissa told her about horace and belle while miss jenny sat indomitably erect on her straight chair beside the piano poor child she said and lord aint they fools and then well youre right i wouldnt marry one of em either im not narcissa answered i wish there werent any of them in the world miss jenny said hmph and then one afternoon they were in narcissas car and bayard was driving over narcissas protest atfirst but he was behaving himself quite sensibly and at last she relaxed they drove down the valley road andturned off toward the hills where the road mounted presently in long curves among dark pines in the slanting afternoon the road wound on with changing sunshot vistas of the valley and the opposite hills beyond at every turn and always the sombre pines and their faint exhilarating odor at last they topped a hill below them the road sank then flattened away toward a line of willows crossed a stone bridge and rose again curving redly from sight among the pines theres the place he said the place she repeated dreamily rousing then as the car rolled forward again gaining speed she understood you promised she cried but he jerked the throttle all the way down its ratchet and she clutched him and tried to scream but she could make no sound nor could she shut her eyes as the harrow bridge hurtleddancing toward them and then her heart stopped and her breath as they flashed with a sharp reverberation like hail on a tin roof between willows and a crashing glint of water and shot on up the next hill the small car swayed on the curve lost its footing and went into the ditch bounded out and hurled across the road then bayard straightened it out and with diminishing speed it rocked on up the hill and at the top he stopped it she sat beside him with her bloodless mouth open beseeching him with her wide hopeless eyes then she caught her breath wailing i didnt mean he began awkwardly i just wanted to see if i could do it and he put his arms around her and sheclung to him moving her hands crazily about his shoulders i didnt mean he essayed again and then her crazed hands wereon his face and she was sobbing wildly against his month through the morning hours and following his sleepless night he bent over his desk beneath the greenshaded fight penning his neat meticulous figures into the ledgers the routine of the bank went on old bayard sat in his tilted chair in the fresh august morning while passers went to and fro greeting him with florid cheerful gestures and receiving in return his half military salutepeople cheerful and happy with their orderly affairs the cashier served the morning line of depositors and swapped jovial anecdote with them for this was the summer cool spell and there was a vividness in the air a presage of the golden days of frost and yellowing persimmons in the wornout fields and of sweet small grapes in the matted vines along the sandy branches and the scent of cooking sorghum upon the smoky air but the snopes crouched over his desk after his sleepless night with jealousy and thwarted desire and furious impotent rage in his vitals egs head felt hot and dull and heavy and to the cashiers surprise he offered to buy the cocacolas ordering two for himself drank them one after the other and returned to his ledgers so the morning wore away his neat figures accumulated slowly in the ruled columns steadily and with a maddening aloofness from his own turmoil and without a mistake although his mind coiled and coiled upon itself tormenting him with fleeing obscene images in which she moved with another he had thought it dreadful when he was not certain that there was another but now to know it to find knowledge of it on every tongueand young sartoris at that a man whom he had hated instinctively with all his sense of inferiority and all the venom of his wormlike nature married married adultery concealed if suspected he could have borne but this boldly in the worlds face flouring him with his own impotencehe dug a cheap soiled handkerchief from his hip pocket and wiped the saliva from his jaws by changing his position a little he could see old bayard could catch a glint of his white suit where he sat oblivious in the door there was a sort of fascination in the old fellow now serving as he did as an object upon which thesnopes could ventthe secret vicarious rage of his halfinsane mind and all during the morning he watched the other covertly once old bayard entered the cage and passed within arms length of him and when he moved his hand to wipe his drooling mouth he found that the page had adhered to his wrist blotting the last entry he had made with his knife blade he erased the smear and rewrote it so the morning wore away he ordered more cocacolas and consumed his and returned to his desk toward midmorning the first fury that had raged in him had worn itself away the images still postured in his mind but they were now so familiar as to be without personal significance or rather his dulled senses no longer responded so quickly and one part of him labored steadily on with steady neat care while the other jaded part reviewed the coiling shapes with a sort of dull astonishment that they no longer filled his blood with firemaenads it was a sort of stupor and he wrote on and on and it was some time before his dulled nerves reacted to a fresh threatand caused him to raise his head virgil beard was just entering the door he slid hurriedly from his stool and slipped around a cabinet and darted through the door of old bayards office he crouched within the door heard the boy ask politely for him heard the cashier say that he was there a minute ago but that he reckoned he had stepped out heard the boy say well he reckoned hed wait for him and he crouched within the door wiping his drooling mouth with his handkerchief after a while he opened the door cautiously and peered out the boy squatted patiently and blandly on his heels against the wall and snopes stood again with his clenched trembling hands he did not curse his desperate fury was beyond words but his breath came and went with a fast ahahah sound in his throat and it seemed to him that his eyeballs were being drawn back and back into his skull turning further and further until the cords that drew them reached the snapping point then he opened the door and went out hi mr snopes the boy said genially rising but snopes strode on and into the cage and approached the cashier res he said in a voice scarcely articulate gimme five dollars what the cashier said gimme five dollars he repeated hoarselythe cashier did so scribbled a notation and speared it on the file at his elbow the boy had come up to the second window but snopes passed on without looking at him and he followed the man to the rear and into the office again his bare feet hissing on the linoleum floor i tried to find you last night he explained butyou warnt at home then he looked up and saw snopes face and after a moment he screamed and broke his trance and turned to flee but snopes caught him and he writhed and twisted screaming steadily with utter terror as the man dragged him across the office and opened the door that gave onto the vacant lot snopes was trying to say something in his mad shaking voice but the boy screamed steadily he had lost all control of his body and he hung limp in the mans hand while snopes thrust the bill into his pocket then he released the boy who staggered away found his legs and fled what were you whuppin that boy for the cashier asked curiously when he returned to the desk for not mindin his own business snopes snapped opening his ledger again during the hour the cashier was out to lunch the snopes was his outward usual selfuncommunicative but efficient a little covertly sullen with his mean closeset eyes and his stubby features patrons remarked nothing unusual in his bearing nor did the cashier when he returned sucking a toothpick and belching at intervals but instead of going home to dinner snopes repaired to a street occupied by negro stores and barber shops and inquired from door to door after a halfhour search he found the negro he sought held a few minutesconversation with him then returned across town to his cousins restaurant and had a platter of hamburger steak and a cup of coffeeattwooclock hewasbackathisdesk the afternoon passed three oclock came he went around and touched old bayards shoulder and he rose and dragged his chair inside and the snopes closed the doors and drew the green shades upon the windows then he totaled his ledgers while thecashier counted the cash in the meantime simon drove up to the door and presently old bayard stalked forth and got in the carriage and was driven off snopes and the cashier compared notes and struck a balance and while the other stacked the money away in receptacles he carried his ledgers one by one into the vault the cashier followed with the cash and put it away and they emerged and the cashier was about to close the vault when snopes stopped him forgot the cashbook he explained the cashier returned to his window and snopes carried the book into the vault and put it away and emerged and clashed the door to and hiding the dial with his body herattled the knob briskly the cashier had his back turned rolling a cigarette see its throwed good he said snopes rattled the knob again then shook the door thats got it they took their hats and emerged from the cage and locked it behind them and passed through the front door which the cashier closed and shook also he struck a match to his cigarette see you tomorrow he said all right snopes agreed and he stood looking after the others shapeless back in its shabby alpaca coat he produced his soiled handkerchief and wiped his mouth again that evening about eight oclock he was back down town he stood for a time with the group that sat nightly in front of the drug store on the corner stood quietly among them listening but saying nothing as was his way then he moved on without being missed and walked slowly up the street and stopped at the bank door one or two passers spoke to him while he was finding his key and opening thedoor he responded in his flat country idiom and entered and dosed the door behind him a angle bulb burned above the vault he raised the shade on the window beside it and entered the grilled cage and turned on the light above his desk here passers could see him could have watched him for several minutes as he bent over his desk writing slowly it was his final letter in which he poured out his lust and his hatred and his jealousy and the language was the obscenity which his jealousy and desire had hoarded away in his temporarily halfcrazed mind and which the past night and day had liberated when it was finished he blotted it carefully and folded it and put it in his pocket and snapped his light off he entered the directors room and in the darkness he unlocked the door which gave onto the vacant lot closed it and left it unlocked he returned to the frontand drew the shade on the window and drew the other shades to their full extent until no crack of light showed at their edges emerged andlockedthe door behind him on the street he looked casually back at the windows the shades were close the interior of the bank was invisible from the street the group still talked in front of the drug store and he stopped again on the outskirts of it people passed back and forth along the street and in or out of the drug store one or two of the group drifted away and newcomers took their places an automobile drew up to the curb was served by a negro lad drove away the clock on the courthouse struck nine measured strokes soon with a noise of starting engines motor cars began to stream out of a side street and onto the square and presently a flux of pedestrians appeared it was the exodus from the picture show and carsone after another drew up to the curb with young men and girls in them and other youths and girls inpairs turned into the drug store with talk and shrill laughter and cries one to another with slender bodies in delicate colored dresses shrill as apes and awkward divinely young then the more sedate groupsa man with a child or so gazing longingly into the scented and gleaming interior of the store followed by three or four womenhis wife and a neighbor or sotalking sedately among themselves more childrenlittle girls in prim and sibilant clots and boys scuffling and darting with changing adolescentshouts a few of the sitters rose and joined passing groups more belated couples came up the street and entered the drug store and other cars other couples emerged and strolled on the night watchman came along presently with his star on his open vest and a pistol and a flashlight in his hip pockets he too stopped and joined in the slow unhurried talk the last couple emerged from the drug store and the last car drove away and presently the lights behind them flashed off and the proprietor jingled his keys in the door and rattled it and stood for a moment among them then went on ten oclock the snopes rose to his feet well i reckon ill turn in he said generally time we all did another said and they rose also goodnight buck goodnight gentlemen the night watchman replied the snopes turned into the first street he went steadily on beneath the spaced arc lights and turned into a narrower street and followed it from this street he turned into a lane between massed honeysuckle higher than his head and sweet upon the nightair the lane was dark and he increased his pace on either hand the upper stories of houses rose above the honeysucklewith now and then a lighted window among the dark trees he kept close to the wall arid went swiftlyon he went now between back premises lots and gardens but before him another house loomed and aserried row of cedars on the lighter sky and he stole beside a stone wall and so came opposite thegarage he stopped here and sought in the lush grass beneath the wall and stooped and raised a pole which he leaned against the wall with the help of the pole he mounted to the top of the wall and so onto the garage roof but the house was dark and presently he slid tothe ground and with the desperate courage of his despair he stole across the lawn and stopped beneath awindow there was alight somewhere toward thefront of the house but no sound no movementand he stoodfor a time listening darting his eyes thisway and that covert and ceaseless as a cornered animal the screen responded easily to his knife blade and he raised it and listened again then with a single scrambling motion he was in the room crouching with his thudding heart still no sound and the whole house gave off that unmistakable emanation of temporary desertion he drew out his handkerchief and wiped his mouth the light was in the next room and he went on the stairs rose from the end of this room and he scuttled silently across it and mounted swiftly into darkness again and groped through the darkness until he touched a wall then a door the knob turned under his fingers it was the right room he knew that at once her presence was all about him and for a time his heartthudded and thudded in his throat and fury and lust and despair shook him like a rag but he pulled himself together he must get out quickly and he groped his way across to the bed and lay face down upon it his head buried in the pillows writhing and making smothered animallike moanings but he must get out and he rose and groped across the room again what little light there was was behind him now and instead of finding the door he blundered into a chest of drawers and stood there a moment then with sudden decision he opened a drawer and fumbled in it it was filled with a faintly scented fragility of garments but he could not distinguish one from another he found a match in his pocket and struck it beneath the shelter of his palm and by its light he chose one of the soft garments discovering as the match died a packet of letters in one corner of the drawer he recognized them at once and he threw the dead match to the floor and removed the letter he had just written from his pocket and put it in the drawer and put the other letters in his pocket and he stood for a time with the garment crushed against his face remained so for some time until a sound caused him to jerk his head up a car was coming up the drive and as he turned and sprang to the window its lights swept beneath him and fell full upon the open garage and he crouched at the window in utter panic then he turned and sped to the door and stopped again crouching panting and snarling in indecision he turned and ran back to the window the garage was dark and two darkfigures were coming toward the house and he crouched within the window until they had passed from sight then still clutching the garment he climbed out the windowand swung from the sill for a moment closed his eyes and dropped there was a crash of glass and he sprawled in a dusty litter with other lesser crashes he had fallen into a shallow glassed flower pit and he scrambled out someway and tried to get to his feet and fell again while nausea swirled in him it was his knee and he lay sick and with snarling teeth while his trouser leg sopped slowly and damply clutching the garment he had stolen and scaring at the dark sky with wide mad eyes he heard voices in lite house and a light came on in the window above him and he dragged himself erect again restraining his vomit and at a scrambling hobble he crossed the lawn and plunged into the shadow of the cedars beside the garage where he lay staring at the house where a man leaned in a window peering out and moaning a little while his blood ran between his clasped fingers he drove himself onward again and dragged his bleeding leg over the wall and dropped into the lane and cast the pole down a hundred yards further he stopped and drew his torn trousers aside and tried to bandage the long gash in his leg but the handkerchief stained over almost at once and still his blood ran and randown his leg and into his shoe once in the back room of the bank he rolled his trouser leg up and removed the handkerchief and bathed the gash with cold water it still bled though not so much and he removed his shirt and bound it as tightly as he could he still felt an inclination toward nausea and he drank long of the tepid water from the lavatory tap immediately it warmed salinely inside him and he dung to the lavatory sweating trying not to vomit until the spell passed hisleg felt numb and dead he entered the grilled cage his left heel showedyet a bloody print on the floor but no blood ran from beneath the bandage the vault door opened soundlessly without striking a match he found the key to the cash box and opened it he took only banknotes which he stowed away in his inner coat pocket drat he took all he could find then he closed the vault and locked it returned to the lavatory and wetted a towel and removed his heel prints from the linoleum floor he passed out the rear door threw the latch so it would lock behind him the dock on the courthouse rang midnight in an alley between two negro stores he found the negro whom he had met at noon with a battered ford car he gave the negro a bill and the negro cranked the car and came and stared curiously at his torn trousers and the glint of white cloth beneathwhut happened boss yaint hurt is you run into some wire he answered shortly and drove on as he crossed the square he saw the night watchman buck standing beneath the light before the post office and cursed him with silent and bitter derision he drove on and passed from view and presently the sound of his going had died away he drove through frenchmans bend at two oclock without stopping the village was dark varners store the blacksmith shop now a garage too with a gasoline pump mrs littlejohns huge unpainted boarding houseall the remembered scenes of his boyhoodwere without life he went on he drove now along a rutted wagon road between swampy jungle at a snails pace after a half hour the road mounted a small knoll wooded with scrub oak and indiscriminate saplings and faded into a barrensunbaked surface in the middle of which squatted alow brokenbacked log house his lights sweptacross its gaping front and a huge gaunt hound descended from the porch and bellowed at him hestopped and switched the lights off his leg was stiff and dead and when he descended he was forced to cling to the car for a time moving it back and forth until it would bear his weight the hound stood ten feet away and thundered at him in a sober conscientious fury until he spoke to it whereupon it ceased its clamor but stood yet in an attitude of watchful belligerence he limped toward it and it recognized him and together they crossed the barren plot in the soundless dust and mounted the veranda turpin he called in a guarded voice the dog had followed himonto the porch and it flopped noisily and scratched itself the house consisted of two wings joined by an open hall through the hall he could see sky and another warped roof tree on the slope behind the house his leg tingled and throbbed as with pins of fire i got that ere bandage too tight he thought turpin a movement from the wing at his left and into the lesser obscurity of the hall a shape emerged and stood in vague relief against the sky in a kneelength nightshirt and a shotgun whos thar the shape demanded byron snopes the man leaned the gun against the wall and came onto the porch and they shook hands limply what you doin this time of night thought you was in town on a trip for the bank snopes explained just drove in and i got to git right on might be gone some time and i wanted to see minnie sue the other tabbed the wild shock of his head then he scratched his leg shes asleepin caint you wait till daylight i got to git on he repeated got to be pretty nigh alabama by daybreak the man brooded heavily rubbing his flankwell he said finally ef you caint wait till mawnin he padded back into the house and vanished the hound flopped again at snopes feet andsniffed noisily from the river bottom a mile away anowl hooted with its mournful rising inflectionsnopes thrust his hand into his coat and touched thewadded delicate garment in his breast pocket themoney bulked against his arm another figure stepped soundlessly into the hall against the lighter sky a smaller figure and even more shapeless that stood for a moment then came out to him he put his arms around her feeling her free body beneath the rough garment she had hastily donned byronshe said what is it byron he was trying to kiss her and she suffered him readily but withdrew her face immediately peering at him he drew her away from the door come on he whispered his voice was shaking and hoarse and his body was trembling also he led her to the steps and tried to draw her on but she held back a little peering at him lets set on the steps she said whats the matter byron you got a chill imallrightlets get away where we can talk she let him draw her forward and down the steps but as they moved further and further away from the house she began to resist with curiosity and growing alarm byron she said again and stopped his hands were trembling upon her moving abouther body and his voice was shaking so that she could not understand him you aint got on nothing under here but your nightgown have you he whispered what he drew her a little further but she stopped firmly and he could not move her she was as strong as he you tell me what it is now she commandedyou aint ready fer our marryin yet are you but he made no answer he was trembling more than ever pawing at her they struggled and at last he succeeded in dragging her to the ground and he sprawled beside her pawing at her clothing whereupon she struggled in earnest and soon she held him helpless while he sprawled with his face against her throat babbling a name not hers when he was still she turned and thrust him away and rose to her feet you come back tomorrer when you git over this she said and she ran silently toward the house and was gone he sat whereshe had left him for a long time with his halfinsane face between his knees and madness and helpless rage and thwarted desire coiling within him the owl hooted again from the black river bottom its cry faded mournfully across the land beneath the chill stars and the hound came silently through the dust and sniffed at him and went away after a time he rose and limped to the car and started the engine four it was a sunny sunday afternoon in october narcissa and bayard had driven off soon after dinner and miss jenny and did bayard were sitting on the sunny end of the veranda when preceded by simon the deputation came solemnly around the corner of the house from the rear it consisted of six negroes in a catholic variety of sunday raiment and it was headed by a huge neckless negro in a prince albert coat and a hindpartbefore collar with an orotund air and a wild compelling eye yere dey is cunnelsimon said and without pausing he mounted the steps and faced the deputation leaving no doubt in the beholders eye as to which side he was aligned with the deputation halted and milled a little solemnly decorous whats this miss jenny demanded that you unclebird yessum miss jenny one of the deputation uncovered his grizzled wool and bowed how you gittin on the others shuffled their feet and one by one they removed their hats the

floor how much is it the leader swelled impressively in his prince albert brudder mo he said will you read out de total emoluments owed to de pupposed secon baptis church by de late deacon strother in his capacity ez treasurer of de church boad brother moore in the rear of the group genuflected himself thai ready hands pushed him into the foregrounda small ebon negro in sombre overlarge blackwhere the parson majestically made room for him he laid his hat on the earth at his feet and from the righthand pocket of his coat he produced in the following order a red bandana handkerchief a shoe horn a plug of chewing tobacco and holding these in his hand he delved yet further with an expression of mildly conscientious alarm then he replaced the objects and from his lefthand pocket he produced a pocket knife a stick on which was wound a length of dingy string a short piece of leather strap attached to a rusty buckle and lastly a greasy dogeared notebook he crammed the other things back into the pocket dropping the leather strap which he stooped and recovered then he and the parson held a brief whispered conversation he opened the notebook and fumbled the pages over fumbled at them until the parson leaned over hisshoulder and found the proper page and laid his finger upon it how much is it reverend old bayard asked brudder mo will now read out de amount theparson said brother moore stared at the page andmumbled something in a weak indistinguishablevoice what old bayard demanded make im talk up simon said cant nobody tell whut he sayin louder the parson rumbled with just a trace of impatience sixtysevum dollars en fawty cents brother moore articulated at last old bayard sat and swore for a time then rose and tramped into the house still swearing simon sighed and relaxed the deputation milled again politely and brother moore faded briskly into the rear rank of it the parson however still retained his former attitude of fateful and solemn profundity what became of that money simon miss jenny asked curiously you had it didnt you datswhutdey claims simon answered what did you do with it hits all right simon assured her ijes put it out sort of i bet you did she agreed drily i bet it never even got cool while you had it who did you put it outto oh me and cunnel done fix dat up he said long time ago old bayard tramped in the hall again and emerged flapping a check in

back im going to have you arrested and prosecute you myself you hear get those niggers out of here the deputation stirred again with a concertedmovement but the parson halted than with a commanding

churchcommittee had taken dar now he said whutyou reckon dey wants now for the deputation hadreturned and it now peered diffidently around the corner well old bayard said violently what is it now they were trying to thrust brother moore forward again but he would not be thrust at last the parson spoke you fergot de fawty cents whitefolks what he says you lef out de extry fawty cents simon shouted old bayard exploded miss jenny chapped her hands over her ears and the committee rolled its eyes in fearsome admiration while he soared to magnificent heights alighting finally upon simon you give him

deymought leave me dis give em that money old bayard thundered i reckon you can pay forty cents of it at least simon rose reluctantly and the minister approached to meet him whars my dime change he demanded nor would he surrender the coin until the two nickels were in his hand then the committee departed now old bayard said i want to know what you did with that money well suh simon began it wuz like dis i put dat money out miss jenny rose my lord she said are you all going over that again and she left them in her room where she sat in a sunny window she could still hear themold bayards stormy rage and simons bland and ready evasion rising and falling on the drowsy sabbath air there was a rose a single remaining rose through the sad dead days of late summer it had continued tobloom and now though persimmons had long swung their miniature suns among the caterpillarfestooned branches and gum and maple and hickory had flaunted four goldandscarlet weeks and the grass where grandfathers of grasshoppers squatted sluggishly like sullen octogenarians had been pencilled twice delicately with frost and the sunny noons were scented with sassafras it still bloomed overripe now and a little gallantly blowsy like a fading burlesque star miss jenny worked in a sweater nowadays and her trowel glinted brightly in her earthy glove its like some women ive known she said it just dont know how to give up gracefully and be a grandmamma let it have the summer out narcissa in her dark woolen dress protested she had a trowel too and she pottered serenely after miss jennys scolding brisk impatience accomplishing nothing worse than isom because she demoralized isom who had immediately given his unspoken alliance to the left or passive wing its entitled to its summer some folks dont know when summers over miss jenny rejoined indian summers no excuse for senile adolescence it isnt senility either all right youll see someday oh someday im not quite prepared to be a grandmother yet youre doing pretty well miss jenny trowelled a tulip bulb carefully and expertly up and removed the clotted earth from its roots we seem to have pretty well worn out bayard for the time being she continued i reckon wed better name him john yes yes miss jenny repeated well name him john you isom the gin had been running steadily for a month now what with the sartoris cotton and that of other planters further up the valley and of smaller croppers with their tilted fields among the hills the sartoris place was farmed on shares most of the tenants had picked their cotton and gathered the late corn and of late afternoons with indian summer upon the land and an ancient sadness sharp as woodsmoke on the still air bayard and narcissa would drive out to where beside a dilapidated cotton house on the edge of a wooden ravine above a spring the tenants brought their cane and made their winter supply of sorghum molasses one of the negroes a sort of patriarch among them owned the mill and the mule that furnished the motive power he did the community grinding and superintended the cooking of the juice for a tithe and when bayard and narcissa arrived the mule would be plodding in a monotonous circle its feet rustling in the dried canepith drawing the long wooden beam which turned the mill into which one of the patriarchs grandsons fed the cane round and round the mule went setting its narrow deerlike feet delicately down in the hissing canepith its neck bobbing limber as a section of rubber hose in the collar with its tracegalled flanks and flopping lifeless ears and its halfclosed eyes drowsing venomously behind pale lids apparently asleep with the monotony of its own motion some cincinnatus of the cotton fields should contemplate the lowly destiny some homer should sing the saga of the mule and of his place in the south he it was more than any one creature or thing who steadfastto the land when all else faltered before the hopeless juggernaut of circumstance impervious to conditions that broke mens hearts because of his venomous and patient preoccupation with the immediate present won the prone south from beneath the iron heel of reconstruction and taught it pride again through humility and courage through adversity overcome who accomplished the wellnigh impossible despite hopeless odds by sheer and vindictive patience father and mother he does not resemble sons and daughters he will never have vindictive and patient it is a known fact that he will labor ten years willingly and patiently for you for the privilege of kicking you once solitary but without pride selfsufficient but without vanity his voice is his own derision outcast and pariah he has neither friend wife mistress nor sweetheart celibate he is unscarred possesses neither pillar nor desert cave he is not assaulted by temptations nor flagellated by dreams nor assuaged by visions faith hope and charity are not his misanthropic he labors six days without reward for one creature whom he hates bound with chains to another whom he despises and spends the seventh day kicking or being kicked by his fellows misunderstood even by that creature the nigger whodrives him whose impulses and mental processes most closely resemble his he performs alien actions among alien surroundings he finds bread not only for a race but for an entire form of behavior meek his inheritance is cooked away from him along with his soul in a glue factory ugly untiring and perverse he can be moved neither by reason flattery nor promise of reward he performs his humble monotonous duties without complaint and his meed is blows alive he is haled through the world an object of general execration unwept unhonored and unsung he bleacheshis awkward accusing bones among rusting cans and broken crockery and wornout automobile tires on lonely hillsides while his flesh soars unawares against the blue in the craws of buzzards as they approached the groaning and creaking of the mill would be the first intimation unless the wind happened to blow toward them then it would be the sharp subtly exciting odor of fermentation and of cooking molasses to greet them bayard liked the smell of it and they would drive up and sit for a time while the boy rolled his eyes covertly at them as he fed the mill watching the patient unceasing mule and the old man stooped above the simmering pot sometimes bayard got out and went over and talked to him leaving narcissa alone in the car lapped in the ripe odors of the failing year and all its vague rich sadness her gaze brooding quietly upon bayard and the old negrothe one lean and tall and fatally young and the other stooped with time while her spirit went out in serene and steady waves surrounding him unawares then he would return and get in beside her and she would touch his rough clothing but so lightly that he was not conscious of it and they would drive back along the faint road beside the flaunting woods and soon above turning oaks and locusts the white house simple and huge and steadfast and the orange disc of the harvest moon beyond the trees halved like a cheese by the ultimate hills sometimes they went back after dark the mill was still then its long motionless arm like a gesture across the firelit scene the mulewas munching somewhere in stable or stamping and nuzzling its empty manger or asleep standing boding not of tomorrow and against the firelight many forms moved the negroes had gathered now old men andwomen sitting on crackling cushions of cane about the blaze which one of their number fed with pressed stalks until its incenseladen fury swirled licking at the boughs overhead making more golden still the twinkling golden leaves and young men and girls and children squatting and still as animals staring into the fire sometimes they sangquavering wordless chords in which sad monotonous minors blent with mellow bass in passionless suspense and faded along the quivering golden air to be renewed but whenthe white folks arrived the singing ceased and they sat or lay about the crackling scented blaze on which the blackened pot simmered talking in broken phrases murmurous with overtones ready with sorrowful mirth while in shadowy beds among the dry whispering canestalks youths and girls murmured and giggled always one of them and sometimes both stopped in the office where old bayard and miss jenny sat there was a fire of logs on the hearth now and they would sit in the glow of itmiss jenny beneath the light with her lurid daily paper old bayard with his slippered feet propped against the fireplace his head wreathed in smoke and the old setter dreaming fitfully beside his chair reliving proud and ancient stands perhaps or further back still the lean gawky days of his young doghood when the world was full of scents that maddened the blood in him and pride had not yet taught him selfrestraint narcissa and bayard between themnarcissa dreaming too in the firelight grave and still and serene and young bayard smoking his cigarettes in his leashed and moody repose at last old bayard would throw his cigar into the fire and drop his feet to the floor and the dog would raise its head and blink and yawn with such gapingdeliberation that narcissa watching him invariably yawned also well jenny then miss jenny would lather paper aside andrise let me narcissa would saylet me go butmiss jenny never would and presently she would return with a tray and three glasses and old bayardwould unlock his desk and fetch the silverstoppereddecanter and compound three toddies with ritualistic care once bayard persuaded narcissa into khaki and boots and carried her possum hunting caspey with a streaked and blackened lantern and a cows horn slung over his shoulder and isom with a gunny sack and an axe and four shadowy restless hounds waited for them at the lot gate and they set off among ghostly shocks of corn where every day almost bayard kicked up a covey of quail toward the woods where we going to start tonight caspey bayard asked back of unc henrys days one in dat grape vine behind de cotton house blue treed im down dar las night how do you know hes there tonight caspey narcissa asked he be back caspey answered confidently he right dar now watchin dis lantern wid his eyes scrooched up listenin to hear ef de dawgs wid us they climbed through a fence and caspey stooped and set the lantern on the ground the dogs moiled and tugged about his legs with sniffings and throaty growls at one another as he unleashed them you ruby stan still dar hole up here you potlickin fool they whimpered and surged their eyes melting in fluid brief gleams then they faded soundlessly and swiftly into the darkness give um a little time caspey said let um see ef he dar yit fromthe darkness ahead a dog yapped three times on a high note dats dat young dawg caspey explained jes showinoff he aint smelt nothin overhead the stars swam vaguely in the hazy sky the air was not yet chill and theearth was warm yet they stood in a steady oasis of lantern light in a world with but one dimension a vague cistern of darkness filled with meagre light and topped with an edgeless canopy of ragged stars it was smoking and emanating a faint odor of heat caspey lifted it and turned the wick down and set it at his feet again then from tie darkness there came a single note resonant and low and grave darheisomsaid hits ruby caspey agreed picking up the lantern she got im the young dog yapped again with fierce hysteria then the single low cry chimed once more narcissa slid her arm through bayards and they hurried on taint no rush caspey told her dey aint treed yit whooy hmon dawg the young dog had ceased its yapping but still at intervals the other one bayed her single timbrous note and they followed it hmon dawg they stumbled a little over fading plowscars after caspers bobbing lantern and the darkness ahead was suddenly crescendic with short steady cries in four keys dey got im isom said dats right caspey replied les go hold im dawg they trotted now narcissa clinging to bayards arm and plunged through rank grass and over another fence and so among trees eyes gleamed fleetingly from the darkness ahead and another gust of barking interspersed with tense and eager whimperings and among stumbling halflit shadows dogs surged about them he up dar caspey said ole blue sees im he raised the lantern and set it uponhis head peering up into the vinematted sapling and bayard drew a flashlight from his jacket and turned its beam into the tree the three older hounds sat in a tense circle about the tree whimpering or barking in short spaced gusts but the young one yapped steadily in mad hysterical rushes kick dat puppy stillcaspey commanded you ginger hush yo mouf isom shouted helaid his axe and sack down and caught the puppy andheld it between his knees caspey and bayard movedslowly around the tree among the tease dogs narcissa followed them dem vines is so thickcaspey said here he is bayard said suddenly ive got im he steadied his light and caspey moved behind him and stared over his shoulder where narcissa asked dats right caspey agreed dar he is ruby dont lie when she say he dar he dar where is he bayard narcissa repeated he drew her before him and trained the light over her head into the tree and presently from the massed vines two reddish joints of fire not a matchbreadth apart gleamed at her winked out then shone again he moving caspey said he young possum git up dar and shake im out isom bayard held his light on the creatures eyes and caspey set his lantern down and herded the dogs together at his knees isom scrambled up into the tree and vanished in the vine but they could follow his progress by the shaking branches and his panting as he threatened the animal with a mixture of cajolery and adjuration hah he panted aint gwine hurt you aint gwine do nothin ter you but thow you in de cookpot look out mister ise coming up dar he stopped they could hear him moving the branchescautiously here he he called suddenly hole dem dawgs now little un aint he caspey asked cant tell cant see nothin but his face watch dem dawgs the upper part of the tree burst into violent and sustained commotion isoms voice whooped louder and louder as he shook the branches here he comes he shouted and something dropped sluggishly and reluctantly from branch to branch stopped and the dogs set up a straining clamor then fell again and bayards light followed a lumpy object that dropped with a resounding thud to the earth and vanished immediately beneath a swirl of hounds caspey and bayard leaped among them and at last narcissa saw the creature in the pool of the flashlight lying on its side in a grinning curve its eyes closed and its pink babylike hands doubled against its breast she watched the motionless thing with a little loathingsuch a contradiction its vulpine skulllike grin and those tiny humanlooking hands and the long ratlike tail of it isom dropped from the tree and caspey turned the two straining clamorous dogs he held over to him and picked up the axe and while narcissa watched in shrinking curiosity he laid the axe across the things neck and put his foot on either end of the axe and grasped the animals tailshe turned and fled her hand to her mouth but the wall of darkness stopped her and she stood trembling and a little sick watching them as they moved about the lantern then caspey drove the dogs away and isom picked up the lumpy sack and swung it to his shoulder and bayard turned and looked for her narcissa here she answered he came to her thats one we ought to get a dozen tonight no she said shuddering no he peered at her in the darkness not tired already are you no she answered i justcome on theyre going caspey led than on through the woods now they walked in a dry sibilance of leaves and crackling undergrowth trees loomed out of the darkness above them among the thinning branches stars swam in the hushed vague sky the dogs were on ahead and they went on over the uneven ground sliding down into washes and ditches where sand gleamed in the pale glow of the lantern and the scissoring shadow of caspeys legs was enormous struggled up the other side we better head away fum de creek bottom caspey suggested deymought strike a coon and den dey wont git home fo day he bore away toward the fields againhmon dawg they went on narcissa was beginning to tire but bayard strode on with a fine obliviousness of that possibility and she followed without complaint at last from far away came that single ringing cry caspey stopped les see which way he gwine they stood in the darkness in the sad faintly chill decline of the year among the dying trees whooy caspey shouted mellowly go git im the dog replied and they moved again slowly pausing at intervals to listen the hound bayed again there were two voices now and they seemed to be moving in a circle across their path whooy caspey called his voice ebbing in falling echoes among the motionless trees they went on again the dogs gave tongue this time from a direction opposite that where the first one had bayed he cayinum right back whar he come fum caspey said we betterwait twell dey gits im straightened out he set the lantern down and squatted beside it and isom sloughed his burden and squatted also and bayard sat against a tree trunk and drew narcissa down beside him the dogs bayed again nearer caspey turned his head and stared off into the darkness toward the sound he headin fer dat holler tree aint he isom asked soun like it they listened motionless we have a job den whooy there was a faint chill in the air now as the days sunlight cooled from the ground and narcissa moved closer to bayard he took a packet of cigarettes from his jacket and gave caspey one and lit his own isom squatted on his heels his eyesrolling whitely in the lantern light gimme one please suh he said you aint got no business smoking boy caspey told him but bayard gave him one and he squatted leanly on his heels holding the white cylinder in his black diffident hand the dogs bayed again mellow and chiming and timbrous in the darkness yes suh caspey repeated he headin fer dat down tree you know this country like you do the back yard dont you caspey narcissa said yessum i ought to i been over it a hunded times since i wuz bawn mist bayard do too he been huntin it long ez i is him and mist johnny bofe miss jenny send me widum when de had dey fust gun me and dat ere single barl gun i used to have to tie together wid a string you member dat ole single barl mist bayard but hit ud shoot manys de fox squirl we shot in dese woods rabbits too bayard was leaning against the tree he was gazing off into the treetops and the soft sky beyond his cigarette burning slowly in his hand she looked at his bleak profile against the lantern glow then she moved closer against him but he did not respond and she slid her hand into his but it too was unresponsive and again he had left her for the bleak and lonely heights of his frozen despair caspey was speaking again in his slow consonantless voice with its overtones of mellow sadness mist johnny now he sho could shoot you member dat time me and you and him wuz bayard rose he dropped his cigarette and crushed it carefully with his heel lets move on he said they aint going to tree he drew narcissa to her feet and turned and went on ahead of them caspey got up and unslung his horn and put it to his lips the sound swelled about them grave arid clear and prolonged then it died into echoes and so into silence again leaving no ripple it was near midnight when they left caspey and isom at their cabin and followed the lane toward the house after a while the barn loomed before them and the house among its thinning trees against the hazy sky he opened the gate and she passed through and he followed and closed it and turning he found her beside him arid stopped bayard she whispered leaning against him and he put his arms around her and stood so staring above her head into the sky she took his face between her hands and drew it down but his lips were cold and upon them she tasted fatality and doom and she clung to him for a time her head bowed against his chest after that she would not go with him again so he went alone returning anywhere between midnight and dawn ripping his clothing off quietly in the darkness and sliding cautiously into bed but when he was still she would touch him and speak his namein the darkness beside him and turn to him warm and soft with deep and they would lie so holding each other in the darkness and the temporary abeyance of his despair and the isolation of that doom he could not escape well miss jenny said briskly above the soup your girls gone and left you and now you can find time to come out and see your kinfolks cant you horace grinned a little to tell the truth i came out to get something to eat idont think that one woman in ten has any aptitude for keeping house but my place is certainly not inthe home you mean miss jenny corrected that not one man in ten has sense enough to marry a decent cook maybe they have more sense and consideration for others than tospoil decent cooks he suggested yes young bayard said even a cookll quit work when she gets married dats de troof simon propped in a slightly florid attitude against the sideboard in a collarless boiled shirt and his sunday pants it is thanksgiving day and reeking a little of whisky in addition to his normal odors agreed i had to find euphrony fo new cookin places de fust two mont we wuz maied dr peabody said simon must have married somebody elses cook id rather marry somebody elses cook than somebody

removed the soup plates but laggardly still giving his interested attention to the altercation yes miss jennyfinished on just because that old fool of a will falls put axle grease on a little bump on his face without killing him dead you have to go around swelled up like a poisoned dog what did you have to do with it you certainly didnt take it off maybe you conjured it on his face to begin with havent you got a piece of bread or something miss jenny can put in her mouth simondr peabody added mildly miss jenny glared at him a moment then flopped back in her chair you simon are you dead simon removed theplates and bore them out and the guests sat avoidingone anothers eyes a little while miss jenny behindher barricade of cups andjugs and urns and thingscontinued to breathe fire and brimstone will falls old bayard repeated jenny tell simon when he fixes that basket to come to my office ivegotsomething to go in it this something was the pint flask of whisky which he included in old man falls thanksgiving and christmas basket and which the old man divided out in spoonsful asfar as it would go among his ancient and homeless cronies on those days and invariably old bayard reminded her to remind isom of what neither of them ever forgot or overlooked all right she answered simon reappeared with a huge silver coffee urn set it at miss jennys hand and retreated kitchenward how many of you want coffee now she asked generally bayard will no more sit down to a meal without his coffee than hed fly will you horace he declined and without looking at dr peabody she said i reckon youll have to have some wont you if its no trouble he answered mildly he winked at narcissa then he assumed an expression of lugubrious diffidence miss jenny drew two cups and simon appeared with a huge platter borne gallantly and precariously aloft and set it before old bayard with a magnificent flourish my god simon young bayard said where did you get a whale this time of year dats a fish in dis worl mon simon agreed and it was a fish it was three feet long and broad as a saddle blanket it was ajolly red color and it lay gaping on the platterwith an air of dashing and rollicking joviality dammit jenny old bayard said pettishly what did you want to have this thing for who wants to clutter his stomach up with fish in november with a kitchen full of possum and turkey and squirrel there are other people to eat here beside you she retorted if you dont want any dont eat it we always had a fish course athome she added but you cant wean these mississippi country folks away from bread and meat to save your life here simon simon set a stack of plates before old bayard and he now came with his tray and miss jenny set twocoffee cups on it and he served them to old bayard and dr peabody miss jenny drewa cup for herself and simon passed sugar and cream old bayard carved the fish still rumbling heavily i aint ever found anything wrong with fish at any time of yeardr

asked yes but the fishin aint been so good this year abe had the flu last winter and ever since hes been goin to sleep on me and i have to sit there and wait until he wakes up and takes the fish off

to bring yo wife out someday bayard she aint never seen my pond you havent bayard asked narcissa she had not hes got a row of benches around it with footrests and a railing just high enough to prop

hogshead and living on cold fish and turnip greens miss jenny snapped he passed his cup and she refilled it oh shut up aunt jenny young bayard commanded simon appeared again with isom in procession now and for the next few minutes they moved steadily between kitchen and dining room with a roast turkey and a cured ham and a dish of quail and another of squirrel and a baked possum in a bed of sweet potatoes and irish potatoes and sweet potatoes and squash and pickled beets and rice and hominy and hot biscuit and beaten biscuit and long thin sticks of combread and strawberry and pear preserves and quince and apple jelly and blackberry jam and stewed cranberries then they ceased talking for a while and really ate glancing now and then across the table at one another in a rosy glow of amicability and steamy odors from time to time isom entered with hot bread while simon stood overlooking the field somewhat as caesar must have stood looking down into gaul once he had it well in hand or the lord god himself when he looked down upon his latest chemical experiment and said it is well after this simondr peabody said and he sighed a little i reckon i can take you on and find you a little side meat now and then i speck you kin simon agreed watching them like an eagleeyed general who rushes reserves to the threatened points pressing more food upon them as they faltered but even dr peabody allowed himself vanquished after a time and then simon brought in pies of three kinds and a small deadly plum pudding and cake baked cunningly with whisky and nuts and fruit and treacherous and fatal as sin and at last with an air sibylline and gravely profound a bottle of port the sun lay hazily in the glowing west failing levelly through the windows and upon the silver arrayed upon the sideboard dreaming in hushed mellow gleams among its placid rotundities and upon the colored glass in the fanlight high in the western wall but that was november the season of hazy languorous days when the first flush of autumn was over and winter beneath the sere horizon breathed yet a spell november when the year like a shawled matron among her children dies peacefully without pain and of no disease early in december the rains came and the year turned gray beneath the season of dissolution and of death all night and all day it whispered upon the roof and along the eaves the leafless trees gestured their black and sorrowful branches in it only a lone stubborn hickory at the foot of the park kept its leaves yet gleaming like a sodden flame against the eternal azure beyond the valley the hills were hidden within chill veils of it almost daily despite miss jennys strictures and commands and the grave and passive protest in narcissas eyes bayard went out with a shotgun andthe two dogs to return just before dark wet to the skin and cold his lips would be chill on hers and his eyesbleak and haunted and in the yellow firelight of their room she would cling to him or lie crying quietly in the darkness beside his rigid body with a ghost between them look here miss jenny said coming upon her as she sat brooding before the fire in old bayards den you spend too much time this way youre getting moony stop worrying about him hes spent half his life soaking wet yet he never had a cold that i can remember hasnt he the answered listlessly miss jenny stood beside her chair watching her keenly then she laid her hand on narcissas head quite gently for asartoris are you worrying because maybe he dont love you like you think he ought to it isnt that she answered he doesnt love anybody he wont even love the baby he doesnt seem to be glad or sorry or anything no miss jenny agreed the fire crackled and leaped among the resinous logs beyond the window the day dissolved endlessly listen miss jenny said abruptly dont you ride in that car with him any more you hear no it wont make him drive slowly nothing will of course not nobody believes it will not even bayard he goes along for the same reason that boy himself does sartoris its in the blood savages every one of em no earthly use to anyone together they gazed into the leaping flames miss jennys hand still lying on narcissas head im sorry i got you into this you didnt do it nobody got me into it i did it myself hm miss jenny said and then would you do it over again the other didnt answer and she repeated the question would you yes narcissa answered dont you know i would again there was silence between them in which without words they sealed their hopeless pact with that fine and passive courage of womenthroughput the worlds history narcissa rose ibelieve ill go to town and spend the day with horace if you dont mind she said all right miss jenny agreed i believe i would too horace probably needs a little looking after by now he looked sort of gaunt when he was out here last week like he wasnt getting proper food when she entered the kitchen door eunice the cook turned from the bread board and lifted her daubed hands in a soft dark gesture well miss narcy she said we aint seed you in a month is you come all de way in de rain i came in the carriage it was too wet for the car she entered the kitchen eunice watched her with grave pleasure how are you all getting along he gits enough to eat all right eunice answered i sees to dat but i has to make im eat it he needs you back here im here for the day anyhow what have you got for dinner together they lifted lids and peered into the simmering vessels on the stove and in the oven oh chocolate pie i has to toll im wid dat eunice explained hell eat anything ef i jes makes im a chocolate pie she added proudly i bet he does narcissa agreed nobody can make chocolate pies like yours dis one aint turnt out so well eunice said deprecatory i aint so pleased wid it why eunice its perfect nom it aint up to de mark eunice insisted but she beamed gravely diffident and for a few minutesthe two of them talked amicably while narcissa pried into cupboards and boxes then she returned to the house and mounted to her room the dressing table was bare of its intimate silver and crystal and the drawers were empty and the entire room with its air of still and fading desolation reproached her chill too there had been no fire in the grate since last spring arid on the table beside the bed in a blue vase was a small faded bunch of flowers forgotten and withered and dead touching them they crumbled in her fingers leaving a stain and the water in the vase smelled of rank decay she opened a window and threw them out the room was too chill to stop in long and she decided to ask eunice to build a fire on the hearth for the sake of that part of her which still lingered here soberly and a little sorrowful in the chill and reproachful desolation at her chest of drawers she paused again and remembered those letters fretfully and with a little brooding alarm deprecating anew her carelessness in not destroying them but maybe she had and so entered again into the closed circle of her first fear and bewilderment tryingto remember what she had done with them but she was certain she had left them in the drawer with her underthings positive that she had put them there yet she had never been able to find them nor had eunice nor horace seen them the day she had missed them was the day before her wedding when she packed her things that day she had missed them finding in their stead one in a different handwriting which shedid not remember having received the gist of it was plain enough although she had not understood some of it literally but on that day she read it with tranquil detachment it and all it implied was definitelybehind her now and lacking even this she would not have been shocked if she had comprehended it curious a little perhaps at some of the words but that is all but what she had done with those other letters she could not remember and not being able to gave her moments of definite fear when she considered the possibility that people might learn that someone had thought such things about her and put them into words well they were gone there was nothing to do save hope that she had destroyed them as she had the last one or if she had not to trust that they would never be found yet that brought back the original distaste and dread the possibility that the intactness of her deep and heretofore inviolate serenity might be the sport of circumstance that she must trust to chance against the eventuality of a stranger casually raising a stray bit of paper from the ground but she would put this firmly aside for the time being at least this should be horaces day and her own too a surcease from that ghostridden dream to which she clung waking she descended the stairs there was a fire in the living room it had burned down to embers however and she put coal on it and punched it to a blaze that would be the first thing hed see when he entered perhaps hed wonder perhaps hed know before he entered having sensed her presence then she considered phoning him and she mused indecisively for a moment before the fire then decided to let it be a surprise but supposing he didnt come home to dinner she considered this and pictured him walking along a street in the rain and immediately and with instinctive foreknowledge of what she would find she went to the closet beneath the stairs and opened the door it was as she hadknown his overcoat and raincoat both hung there the chances were he didnt even have an umbrella and again irritation and exasperation and untroubled affection for him welled in her and it was as it had been of old again and all that had since happened to them rolled away heretofore her piano had always been moved into the living room when cold weather came but this year it stood yet in the smaller alcove there was a fireplace here but no fire had been lighted yet and the room was chilly beneath her hands the cold keys gave forth a sluggish chord accusing reproving too and she returned to the fire again and stood before it where she could see through the window the drive beneath its sombre dripping trees the small clock on the mantel behind her chimed twelve and she went to the window and stood with her nose touching the chill glass and herbreath misting it over soon now he was erratic in his hours but never tardy and every time an umbrella came into sight her heart leaped a little but it was not he and she followed the bearers plodding passage until he shifted the umbrella enough for her to see who it was and so did not see horace until he was half way up the drive his hat was turned down around his face and his coat collar was hunched to his ears and as she had known he didnt even have an umbrella oh you idiot she said and ran to the door and through the curtained glass she saw his shadowy shape come leaping up the steps he flung the door open and entered whipping his sodden hat against his leg andso did not see her until she stepped forth you idiot she said wheres your raincoat for a moment he stared at her with his wild and diffident repose then he said narcy and his face lighted and he swept her into his wet arms dont she cried youre wet but he swung her from the floor against his sodden chest repeating narcy narcy then his cold nose was against her face and she tasted rain narcy he said again tagging her and she ceased trying to free herself and clung to him then abruptly he released her and jerked his head up and stared at her with sober intensity narcy he said still staring at her has that surly blackguard no of course not she answered sharply haveyou gone crazy then she clung to him again wetclothes and all asthough she would never let him gooh horry she said ive been a beast to you i was hoping he saidthey had eaten the chocolate pie and horace now stood before the livingroom fire his coffee cup on the mantel striking matches to his pipe that you might have come home for good that they had sent you back no she answered i wish what but she only said youll be having somebody soon and then when is it to be horry he sucked intently at his pipe in his eyes little twin matchflames rose and fell i dont know next spring i suppose whenever she will you dont want to she stated quietly not after what its all got to be now shes in reno now he added puffing at his pipe his face averted a little little belle wrote me a letter about mountains she said poor harry she sat with her chin in her palms gazing into the fire hell have little belle he reminded her he cares more forher than be does for belle anyway you dont know she told him soberly you just say that because you want to believe it dont you think hes well off rid of awoman who doesnt want him who doesnt even love his child very much you dont know she repeated people cantcantyou cant play fast and loose with the way things ought to go on after theyve started off oh people he raised the cup and drained it and sat down barging around through a lifetime clotting for no reason breaking apart for no reason still chemicals no need to pity a chemical chemicals she mused her serene face rosy in the firelight chemicals maybe thats the reason so many of the things people do smell bad well i dont know that i ever thought of it in exactly that way he answered gravely but i daresay youre right having femininity on your side he brooded himself restlessly but i suppose its all sort of messy living and seething corruption glossed over for a while by smoothly colored flesh all foul until the clean and naked bone he mused again she quietly beside him but its something there something you go after must driven not always swine a plan somewhere i suppose known to whoever first set the fermentation going perhaps ifs just too big to be seen like a locomotive is a porous mongrel substance without edges to the grains of sand that give it traction on wet rails or perhaps he has forgotten himself what the plan was but do you like to think of a woman wholl willingly give up her child in order to marry another man a little sooner of course i dont but neither do i like to remember that i have exchanged you for belle or that she has red hair and is going to be fat someday or that she has lain in another pans arms and has a child that isnt mine even though she did voluntarily give it up yet there are any number of virgins who love children walking the world today some of whom look a little like you probably and a modest number of which i allow myself to believe without conceit that i could marry and yet he struck another match to his pipe but he let it go out again and sat forward in his chair the pipe held loosely in his joined hands that may be the secret after all not any subconscious striving after what we believed will be happiness contentment but a sort of gadfly urge after the petty ignoble impulses which man has tried so vainly to conjure with words out of himself nature perhaps watching him as he tries to wean himself away from the rank and richly foul old mire that spawned him biding her time and flouting that illusion of purifaction which he has foisted upon himself and calls his soul but its something there somethingyouyou he brooded upon the fire holding his cold pipe she put her hand out and touched his and he clasped it and looked at her with his groping and wid intensity but she was gazing into the fire her cheek in her palm and she drew his hand to her and stroked it on her face poor horry she said not happiness he repeated im happier now than ill ever be again you dont find that when you suddenly swap the part of yourself which you want least for the half of someone else that he or she doesnt want do you did you find it but she only said poor horry again she stroked his hand slowly against her cheek as she stared intothe shaling ruby of the coals the clock chimed again with blent small silver bells she spoke without moving arent you going back to the office this afternoon no his tone was again the grave lighter casual one which he employed with her tin taking a holiday next time you come i may have a case and cant you never have cases you have functions she answered but i dont think you ought to neglect your business she added with grave reproof neither do i he agreed but whatever else is business for then dont besillyput on some coal horry but later he reverted again to his groping and tragic premonitions they had spent the afternoon sitting before the replenished fire later she had gone to the kitchen and made tea the day still dissolved ceaselessly and monotonously without and they sat and talked in a sober and happy isolation from their acquired ghosts and again their feet chimed together upon the dark road and their faces turned inward to one anothersthe sinister and watchful trees were no longer there but the road was in reality two roads become parallel for a brief mile and soon to part again and now and then their feet stumbled its having been younger once he said being dragged by time out ofa certain day like a kitten from a tow sack being thrust into another sack with shreds of the first one sticking to your claws like the burro that the prospector keeps on loading down with a rock here and a rock there until it drops leaving him in the middle of his desert surrounded by waiting buzzards he added musing in metaphors plunder thats all it is if you could just betranslated every so often given a blank fresh start with nothing to remember dipped in lethe every decade or so or every year she added or day yes the rain dripped and dripped thickening the twilight the room grew shadowy the fire had burned down again its steady fading glow fell upon their musing faces and brought the tea things on the low table beside them out of the obscurity in quiet rotund gleams and they sat hand in hand in the fitful shadows and the silence waiting for something and at last it came a thundering knock at the door and they knew then what it was they waited for and through the window they saw the carriage curtains gleaming in the dusk and the horses stamping and steaming on the drive in the ceaseless rain horace had seen her on the street twice his attention caught by the bronze splendor of her hair and by an indefinable something in her air her carriage it was not boldness and not arrogance exactly but a sort of calm lazy contemptuousness that left him seeking in his mind after an experience lost somewhere within the veils of years that swaddled his dead childhood an experience so sharply felt at the time that the recollection of it lingered yet somewhere just beneath his consciousness although the motivation of its virginal clarity was lost beyond recall the wakened ghost of it was so strong that during the rest of the day he roused from periods of abstraction to find that he had been searching for it a little fearfully among the crumbled and long unvisited corridors of his mind and later as he sat before his fire at home witha book then as he lay in bed thinking of belle and waiting for sleep he remembered it he was five years old and his father had taken him to his first circus and dinging to the mans hard reassuring hand in a daze of blaring sounds and sharp cries and scents that tightened his small entrails with a sense of fabulous and unimaginable imminence and left him a little sick he raised his head and found a tiger watching him with yellow and lazy contemplation and while his whole small body was a tranced and soundless scream the animal gaped and flicked its lips with an unbelievably pink tongue it was an old tiger and toothless and it had doubtless gazed through these same bars at decades and decades of horaces yet in him a thing these many generations politely dormant waked shrieking and again for a red moment he dangled madly by his hands from the lowermost limb of a tree that was it and though that youthful reaction was dulled now by the years he found himself watching her on the street somewhat as a timorous person is drawn with delicious revulsions to gaze into a window filled with knives he found himself thinking of her often wondering who she was a stranger he had never seen her in company with anyone who might identify her she was always alone and always definitely going somewhere not at all as a transient a visitor idling about the streets and always that air of hers lazy predatory and coldly contemptuous the sort of woman men stare after on the street and who does not even do them the honor of ignoring them the third time he saw her he was passing a store a newly opened department store just as she emerged at that free purposeful gait he had come to know in the center of the door all was a small iron ridge ontowhich the double doors locked and she caught the heel of her slipper on this ridge and emerged stumbling in a cascade of small parcels and swearing it was a mans bold swearing and she caught her balance and stamped her foot and kicked one of her dropped parcels savagely into the gutter horace retrieved it and turning saw her stooping for the others and together they gathered them up and rose and she glanced at him briefly with level eyes of a thick dark brown and shot with golden lights somehow paradoxically cold thanks she said without emphasis taking the packages from him they ought to be jailed for having a mantrap like that in the door then she looked at him again a level stare without boldness or rudeness youre horace benbow arent you she asked yes that is my name but i dont believe she was counting her packages one more yet she said glancing about her feet must be in the street he followed her to the curb where she had already picked up the other parcel and she regarded its muddy side and swore again now ill have to have it rewrapped yes too bad isnt it he agreed if youll allow me ill have it done at the drug store come along if youre not too busy i want to talk to you she seemed to take it for granted that he would follow and he did so with curiosity and that feeling stronger than ever of a timorous person before a window of sharp knives when he drew abreast of her she looked at him again she was almost as tall as he from beneath her level brows her face was rather thin with broad nostrils her mouth was flat though full and there was in the ugly distinction of her facein indescribable something a something boding and leashed yet untamed carnivorous he thought a lady tiger in a tea gown and remarking something of his thoughts in his face she said i forgot of course you dont know who i am im belles sister oh of course youre joan i should have known how nobody yet ever said we look alike and you never saw me before no he agreed but ivebeen expecting for the last three months that some of belles kinfolks would be coming here to see what sort of animal i am they wouldnt have sent me though she replied you can be easy on that they went onlong the street horace responded to greetings buthe strode on with that feline poise of hers he was aware that men turned to look after her but in her air there was neither awareness nor disregard of it conscious or otherwise and again he remembered that tiger yawning with bored and lazy contempt while round and static eyes stared down its cavernous pink gullet i want to stop here she said as they reached the drug store do you have to go back to the store or whatever it is office he corrected not right away thats right she agreed and he swung the doorpen for her youre a dentist arent you belle told me then im afraid shes deceiving us both he angered drily she glanced at him with her level speculative gaze and he added shes got the names confused arid sent you to the wrong man you seem to be clever she said over her shoulder and i despise clever men dont you know any better than to waste cleverness on women save it for your friends a youthful clerk in a white jacketapproached staring at her boldly she asked him with contemptuous politeness to rewrap her parcel horace stopped beside her women friends he asked women what she stooped down peering into a showcase of cosmetics well maybe so she said indifferently but i never believe em though cheap sports she straightened up belles all right ifthats what you want to ask its done her good she doesnt look so badhumored and settled down now sort of fat and sullen im glad you think that but what i am wondering is how you happened to come here harrys living at the hotel isnt he hes opened the house again now he just wanted somebody to talk to i came to see what you look like she told him what i look like yes to see the man that could make old belle kick over the traces her eyeswere coldly contemplative a little curious what did you do to her ill bet you havent even got any money to speak of horace grinned a little i must seem rather thoroughly impossible to you then he suggested oh theres no accounting for the men women pick out i sometimes wonder at myself only ive never chosen one i had to nurse yet the clerk returned with her package and she made a trifling purchase and gathered up her effectsi suppose you have to stick around your office all day dont you yes its the toothache season now you know you sound like a college boy now she said coldly i suppose belles ghost will let you out at night though it goes along too he answered well im not afraid of ghosts i carry a few around myself you mean dripping flesh and bloody bones dont you she looked at him again with her flecked eyes that should have been warm but were not i imagine you could be quite a nuisance she told him he opened the door and she passed through it and gave him a brief nod and while he stood on the street with his hat lifted she strode on without even a conventional thank you or goodbye that evening while he sat at his lonely supper shetelephoned him and thirty minutes later she came in harrys car for him andforthe next three hours she drove him about while he sat hunched into his overcoat against the raw air she wore no coat herself and appeared impervious to the chill and she carried him on short excursions into the muddy winter countryside the car sliding and skidding while he sat with tensed anticipatory muscles but mostly they drove monotonously around town while he felt more and more like a faded and succulent eatingcreature in a suave parading cage sometimes she talked but usually she drove in a lazy preoccupation seemingly utterly oblivious of him later when she had begun coming to his house coming without secrecy and with an unhurried contempt for possible eyes and ears and tonguesa contempt that also disregarded horaces acute unease on that score she still fell frequently into those periods of aloof and purring repose then sitting before the fire in his living room with the bronze and electric disorder of her hair and the firelight glowing in little red points in her unwinking eyes she was like a sheathed poniard like chablis in a tallstemmed glass at these times she would utterly ignore himcold and inaccessible then she would rouse and talk brutally of her lovers never of herself other than to give him the salient points in her history that belle had hinted at with a sort of belligerent prudery the surface history was brief and simple enough married at eighteen to a man three times her age she had deserted him in honolulu and fled to australia with an englishman assuming his name was divorced by her husband discovered by firsthand experience that no englishman out of his native island has any honor about women was deserted by him in bombay and in calcutta she married again an american a young man an employee of standard oil company a year later she divorced him and since then her career had been devious and alittleobscure due to her restlessness her family would know next to nothing of her whereabouts receiving her brief infrequent letters from random points half the world apart her first husband had made a settlement on her and from time to time and without warning she returned home and spent a day or a week or a month in the company of her fathers bitter reserve and her mothers ready tearful uncomplaint while neighbors older people who had known her all her life girls with whom she had played in pinafores and boys with whom she had sweethearted during the spring and summer of adolescence and newcomers to the town looked after her on the street forthright and inscrutable and unpredictable sometimes she stayed an hour motionless before the fire while he sat nearby and did not dare touch her sometimes she lay beside him while the firelight fallen to a steady glow of coals filled his bedroom with looming and motionless shadows until midnight or later talking about her former lovers with a brutality that caused him hopeless and despairing angerand something of a childs hurt disillusion speaking of them with that same utter lack of vanity and conventional modesty with which she discussed her body asking him to tell her again that he thought her body beautiful asking him if he had ever seen a match for her legs then taking him with a savage and carnivorous suddenness that left him spent yet all the while remote beyond that barrier of cold inscrutability which he was never able to break downs and rising at last again that other feline and inaccessible self and departing without even the formality of a final kiss or a goodbye and leaving him to wonder despite the evidences of her presence whether he had not dreamed it after all she made but one request of him that he refrain from talking to her of love im tired of having to listen to it and talk and act a lot of childish stupidity she explained i dont know anything about it and i dont care to you dont think there is any such thing he asked ive never found it and if we can get anything from each other worth having whats the use in talking about it and itll take a race of better people than we are to bear it if theres any such thing save that for belle youll probably need it one night she did not depart at all that was the night she revealed another feline trait that of a prowling curiosity about dark rooms she had paused at narcissas door and although he tried to draw her onward she opened the door and found the light switch and pressed it on whose room is this narcissas he answered shortly come away oh your sisters the one that married that sartoris she examined the room quietly id like to have known that man she said in a musing tone ithink id be good for him marrying women then leaving them after a month or two only one man ever left me she stated calmly i was practically a child or that wouldnt haveyes id have been just the thing for him she entered the room he followed and took her arm again come away joan but i dont know she added maybe its a good thing hes gone after all for both of us yes come away she turned her head and stared at him with her level inscrutable eyes beneath the bronze disorder of her hair men are funny animals she said you carry so much junk around with you there was in her eyes a cold derisive curiosity what do you call it sacrilege desecration come away he repeated next day in the gray december forenoon among the musty books in his office the reaction found him it was more than reaction it was revulsion and he held a spiritual stocktaking with a sort of bleak derision for a moment in company with the sinister gods themselves he looked down upon horace benbow as upon an antic and irresponsible worm it was worse it was conduct not even becoming a college sophomorehe who had thought to have put all such these ten years behind him and he thought of his sister and he felt unclean on the way home at noon he saw harry mitchell approaching and he ducked into a store and hida thing belle had never caused him to do he would not go to hisroom where the impact of her presence must yet linger and eunice served his meal with her face averted emanating disapproval and reproach and he angered slowly and asked herthe direct question has mrs heppleton gone yet eunice i dont know suh eunice answered still without looking at him she turned doorward you dont know when she left i dont know suh eunice repeated doggedly and the swing door slapped behind her in dying oscillations but he would not mount to his room and soon he was back down town again it was a gray raw day following the two recent weeks of bright frosty weather christmas was not a week away and already the shop windows bloomed in toy fairylands with life in its mutations in miniature among cedar branches and cotton batting and dusted over with powdered tinsel amid which santa claus in his myriad avatars simpered in fixed and rosy benignance and with fruit and cocoanuts and giant sticks of peppermint and fireworks of all kindsroman candles and crackers and pinwheels and about the muddy square fetlockdeep horses stood hitched to wagons laden with berried holly and mistletoe he was too restless to remain in one place and through the short afternoon on trivial pretexts or on no pretext at all he descended the stairs and walked along the streets among the slow throngs of black and white in the first throes of the long winter vacation and at last he realized that he was hoping to see her realized it with longing and with dread looking along the street before him for a glimpse of her shapeless marten coat and the curbed wild blaze of her hair and the lithe and purposeful arrogance of her carriage ready to flee when he did so but by the time he reached home in the early dusk the dread was still there but it was only the savor ofthe longing and without even pausing to remove his hat and coat he went to the telephone in its chill and darkling alcove beneath the stairs and he stood with the chill receiver to his ear and watching the cloudy irregularity of his breath upon the nickel mouthpiece waiting until out of the twilight and the chill the lazy purring of her voice should come after a time he asked central to ring again with polite impatience he could hear the other instrument shrill again and he thought of her long body rising from its warm nest in her chair before a fire somewhere in the quiet house imagined lie could hear her feet on stairs nearer and nearer now now she is lifting her hand to the receiver now now but it was rachel the cook naw suh miz heppleton aint here yes suh she gone away suh naw suh she aint comin back she went off on de evenin train naw suh rachel didnt know where she was going it used to be that hed fling his coat and hat down and narcissa would come along presently and hang them up but already bachelordom was getting him housebrokeaccomplishing what affection never had and never wouldand he hung his coat in the pocket of which an unopened letter from belle lay forgotten carefully in the closet beneath the stairs fumbling patiently with his chilled hands until he found a vacant hook then he mounted the stairs and opened his door and entered the cold room where between the secret walls she lingered yet in a hundred palpable waysin the mirror above his chest of drawers in the bed the chairs on the deep rug before the hearth where she had crouched naked and drowsing like a cat the fire had burned out the ashes were cold and the room was icy chill outside the graying twilight he built up the fire and drewhis chair close to the hearth and sat before it his thin delicate hands spread to the crackling blaze this time it was a ford car and bayard saw its wild skid as the driver jerked it across the treacherous thawing road and the drivers gaping mouth and in the rushing moment and with brief amusement between the mans cravatless collar and the womans stocking wrapped about his head beneath his hat and tied under his chin his adams apple like a scared puppy in a tow sack then this flashed past and bayard wrenched the wheel and the stalled ford swam sickeningly into view again as the big car slewed greasily upon the clay surface its declutched engine roaring then the other car swam away again as he wrenched the wheel over and slammed the clutch out for more stability and again that sickening unhurried rush as the car refused to regain its feet and the depthless december world swept laterally across his vision old bayard lurched against him again from the corner of his eye he could see the fellows hand clutching at the edge of the door now they were facing the bluff on which the cemetery lay directly over them john sartoris effigy lifted its florid stone gesture and from among motionless cedars gazed out upon the valley where for two miles the railroad he had built ran beneath his carven eyes bayard wrenched the wheel again on the other side of the road a ravine dropped sheer away amongscrub cedars and corroded ridges skeletoned brittly with frost and muddy ice where the sun had not yet reached the rear end of the carhung timelessly over this before it swung again with the power full on swung on until its nose pointed downhill again with never a slackening of its speed but still it would not come into the ruts again and it had lost the crown of the road and though they had almost reached the foot of the hill bayard saw they would not make it just before the rear wheel slipped off he wrenched the steering wheel over and swung the nose straight over the bank and the car poised lazily for a moment as though taking bread hang on he shouted to his grandfather then they plunged an interval utterly without sound and in which all sensation of motion was lost then scrub cedar burst crackling about them and whipping branches of it exploded upon the nose of the car and slapped viciously at them as they sat with braced feet and the car slewed in a long bounce another vacuumlike interval then a shock that banged the wheel into bayards chest and wrenched it in his tight hands wrenched his armsocket beside him his grandfather lurched forward and he threw out his arm just in time to keep the other from crashing through the windshield hang on he shouted again the car had never faltered and he dragged the leaping wheel over and swung it down the ravine arid opened the engine again and with the engine and the momentum of the pilings they crashed on down the ravine and turned and heaved up the now shallow bank and onto the road again bayard brought it to a stop he sat motionless for a moment whew he said and then great god in the mountain his grandfather sat quietly beside him his hand still on the door and his head bent a little think ill have a cigarette after that bayard added he found one in his pocket and a match his hands were shaking ithought of that damn concrete bridge again just as she went over he explained a little apologetically he took a deep draught at his cigarette and glanced at his grandfather yall right old bayard made no reply and with the cigarette poised bayard looked at him he sat as before his head bent a little and his hand on the door grandfather bayard said sharply still old bayard didnt move even when his grandson flung the cigarette away and shook him roughly up the last hill the tireless pony bore him and in the low december sun their shadow fell longly across the hardwood ridge and into the valley from which the high shrill yapping of the dogs came again upon the frosty windless air young dogs bayard told himself and he sat his horse in the faint scar of the road listening as the high breathless hysteria of them swept echoing across his aural field though the race itself was hidden beyond the trees motionless he could feel frost in the air above him the pines though there was no wind in them made a continuous dry wild sound above them against the high evening blue a shallow v of geese slid therell be ice tonight he thought thinking of black backwaters where they would come to rest of rank bayonets of dead grasses about which the water would shrink soon in the brittle darkness in fixed glassy ripples behind him the earth rolled away ridge on ridge blue as woodsmoke on into a sky like thin congealed blood he turned in his saddle and stared unwinking into the bloody west against which the sun spread like a crimson egg broken upon the ultimate hills that meant weather he snuffed the motionless tingling air hoping he smelled snow the pony snorted and tossed ins head experimentally and found the reins were slack and lowered his head and snorted again into the dead leaves and the delicate sere needles of pine at his feet come up perry bayard said jerking the reins perry raised his head and broke into a stiff jolting trot but bayard lifted him out of it and curbed him again into his steady foxtrot the sound of the dogs had ceased but he had not gone far when they broke again into clamorous uproar to his left and suddenly near and as he reined perry back and peered ahead along the quiet fading scar of it he saw the fox trotting sedately toward him in the middle of the road perry saw it at the same time and laid his fine ears back and rolled his young eyes but the animal came on placidly unawares at its steady unhurried trot glancing back over its shoulder from time to time well pu be damned bayard whispered holding perry rigid between his knees the fox was not forty yards away yet still it came on seemingly utterly unaware of the man and horse then bayard shouted the fox glanced at himthe level sun swam redly and fleetingly in its eyes then with a single modest flash of brown it was gone bayard expelled his breath his heart was thumping against his ribs whooy he yelled come on dogs the dogs heard him and their din swelled to a shrill pandemonium and the pack swarmed wildly into the road in a mad chaos of spotted hides and flapping ears and tongues and surged toward him none of them was more than half grown and ignoring the horse and rider they burst still clamoring into the undergrowth where the fox had vanished and shrieked frantically on and as bayard stood in his stirrups and peeredafter them preceded by yapping in a yet higher and more frantic key two even smaller puppies moiled out of the woods and galloped past him on their short legs with whimpering cries and expressions of ludicrous and mad concern then the clamor died into hysterical echoes and so away he rode on on either hand were hills the one darkling like a bronze bastion upon the other the final rays of the sun lay redly the air crackled with frost and tingled in his nostrils and seared his lungs with fiery exhilarating needles the road followed the valley but half the sun now showed above the western wall and among trees stark as the bars of a grate he rode stirrupdeep in shadow like cold water he would just about reach the house before dark the clamor of the dogs swelled again ahead of him approaching the road again and he lifted perry into a canter presently before him lay a gladean old field sedgegrown its plowscars long healed over the sun filled it with dying light and he pulled perry short upstanding there at the corner of the field beside the road sat the fox it sat there like a tame dog watching the woods across the glade and bayard shook perry forward again the fox turned its head and looked at him with a covert fleeting glance but without alarm and bayard stopped again in intense astonishment the clamor of the dogs swept nearer through the woods yet still the fox sat on its haunches watching the man withcovert quick glances it revealed no alarm whatever not even when the puppies burst yapping madly from the trees they moiled at the woods edge for a time while the fox watched them the largest one evidently the leader saw the quarry immediately they ceased their noise and trotted across the glade andsquatted in a circle facing the fox their tongues lolling then with one accord they all faced about and watched the darkening woods from which and nearer and nearer came that spent yapping in a higher key and interspersed with whimpering the leader barked once the yapping among the trees swelled with frantic relief and the two smaller puppies burst forth and burrowed like moles through the sedge and came up then the fox rose and cast another quick covert glance at the horseman and surrounded by the amicable weary calico of the puppies trotted across the glade and vanished among the darkening trees well ill be damned bayard said come up perry at last a pale and windless plume of smoke stood above the trees against the sky and in the rambling mudchinked wall a window glowed with ruddy invitation across the twilight dogs had already set up a resonant belllike uproar above it bayard could distinguish the dear tenor of puppies and a voice shouting at them and as he pulled perry to a halt in the yard the fox was vanishing diffidently but without haste beneath the back porch a lean figure faced him in the dusk with an axe in one hand and an armful of wood and bayard said what the devils that thing buddy that fox thats ethel buddy answered he put the wood down deliberately and the axe and he came and shook bayards hand once limply in the country fashion but his hand was hard and firm how you all right bayard answered i came out to get that old fox rafe was telling me about sure buddy agreed in his slow infrequent voice we been expectin you git down and lemme take yopony no ill do it you take the wood on in ill putperry up but buddy was firm without insistence or rudeness and bayard surrendered the horse to him henry buddy shouted toward the house henry a door opened upon jolly leaping flames a figure stood squatly in itheres bayard buddy said go on in and warm he added leading the horse away dogs surrounded him he picked up the wood and the axe and moved toward the house in a ghostly surge of dogs and the figure stood in the door while he mounted the veranda and leaned the axe against the wall how you henry said and again the handshake was limp again the hand was firm and kind harsher though than buddys hard young flesh he relieved bayard of the wood and they entered the house the walls were of chinked logs upon them bung two colored outdated calendars and a patent medicine lithograph the floor was bare of handtrimmed boards scuffed with heavy boots and polished by the pads of generations of dogs two men could lie side by side in the fireplace in it now fourfoot logs blazed against the clay fireback swirling in wild plumes into the chimneys dark maw and in silhouette against it his head haloed by the fine shaggy disorder of his hair virginius maccallum sathyers bayard sartoris pappy henry said the old man turned in his chair with grave leonine deliberation and extended his hand without rising in he was sixteen and he walked to lexington virginia and enlisted served four years in the stonewall brigade and walked back to mississippi and built himself a house and got married his wifes dot was a clock and a dressed hog his own father gave them a mule his wife was dead these many years and her successor was dead but he satnow before the fireplace at which that hog had been cooked beneath the roof he had built in and on the mantel above him the clock sat deriding that time whose creature it had once been well boy he said you took yo time about comin hows yo folks pretty well sir bayard answered he looked at the old mans hale ruddy face intently and sharply no they hadnt heard yet we been expectin you ever since rafe seen you in town last spring hyer henry tell mandy to set another plate four dogs had followed him into the room three of them watched him gravely with glowing eyes the other one a blueticked hound with an expression of majestic gravity came up and touched its cold nose to his head hi genral he said rubbing its ears whereupon the other dogs approached and thrust their noses against his hands pull up a cheermr maccallum said he squared his own chair around and bayard obeyed and the dogs followed him surging with blundering decorum about his knees i keep sendin word in to git yo granpappy out hyer the old man continued but hes too tarnal proud or too damn lazy to come hyer genral git away from thar kick em away bayard henry he shouted henry appeared take these hyer damn dawgs out till after supper henry drove the dogs from the room mr maccallum picked up a long pine sliver from the hearth and fired it and lit his pipe and smothered the sliver in the ashes and laid it on the hearth again rafe and lee air in town today he said you could have come out in the waggin with them but i reckon youd ruther have yoown hoss yes sir he answered quietly then they would know he stared into the fee for a time robbing his hands slowly on his knees and for an instant he saw the recent months of his life coldly in all their headlong and heedless wastefulness saw it like the swift unrolling of a film culminating in that which any fool might have foreseen well dammit suppose it had was he to blame had he insisted that his grandfather ride with him had he given the old fellow a bum heart and then coldly you were scared to go home you made a nigger sneak your horse out for yon yon who deliberately do things your judgment tells you may not be successful even possible are afraid to face the consequences of your own acts then again something bitter and deep and sleepless in him blazed out in vindication and justification and accusation what he knew not blazing out at what whom he did not know you did it you caused it all you killed johnny henry had drawn a chair up to the fire and after a while the old man tapped his clay pipe carefully out against his palm and drew a huge turnipshaped silver watch from his corduroy vest half after five he said aint them boys come yet theyre here henry answered briefly heard em takin out when i put out the dawgs git the jug then his father ordered henry rose and departed again and feet clumped heavily on the porch and bayard turned in his chair and stared bleakly at the door it opened and rafe and lee entered well well rafe said and his lean dark face lighted a little got here at last did you he shook bayards hand and lee followed him lees face like all of them was a dark saturnine mask he was not so stocky as rafe and least talkative of them all hiseyes were black and restless behind them livedsomething quick and wild and sad he shook bayardshand without a word but bayard was watching rafe there was nothing in rafes face no coldness no questioningwas it possible that he could have been to town and not heard or had bayard himself dreamed it but he remembered that unmistakable feel of his grandfather when he had touched him remembered how he had suddenly slumped as though the very fibre of him knit so erect and firm for so long by pride and by his unflagging and hopeless struggling against the curse of his name had given way all at once letting his skeleton rest at last mr maccallum spoke did you go by the express office we never got to town rafe answered axle tree broke just this side of vernon had to uncouple the wagon and drive to vernon and get it patched up too late to go in then we got our supplies there and come on home well no matter youll be goin in next week for christmas the old man said and upon a breath of vivid darkness buddy entered and came and squatted leanly in the shadowy chimneycorner got that fox you were telling me about hid out yet bayard asked rafe sure and well get im this time maybe tomorrow weathers changin snow might be whats it goin to do tonight pappy rainthe old man answered tomorrow too scent wont lay good until wensday henry after a moment he shouted henry again and henry entered with a blackened steaming kettle and a stoneware jug and a thick tumbler with a metal spoon in it there was somethingdomestic womanish abouthenry with his squatslightly tubby figure and his mild brown eyes and his capable unhurried hands he it was who superintended the kitchen he was a better cook now than mandy and the house where he could be found most of the day pottering soberly at some endless task he visited town almost as infrequently as his father he cared little for hunting and his sole relaxation was making whisky good whisky in a secret fastness known only to his father and to the negro who assisted him after a recipe handed down from lost generations of his dour and uncommunicative forbears he set the kettle and the jug and the tumbler on the hearth and took the clay pipe from his fathers hand and put it on the mantel and reached down a cracked tumbler of sugar and seven glasses each with a spoon in it the old man leaned forward into the firelight and made the toddies one by one with tedious and sober deliberation when he had made one around there were two glasses left aint them other boys come in yet he asked nobody answered and he corked the jug henry set the two extra glasses back on the mantel mandy came to the door presently filling it with her calico expanse yall kin come in now she said and as she turned waddling bayard spoke to her and she paused as the men rose the old man was straight as an indian and with the exception of buddys lean and fluid length he towered above his sons by a head mandy waited beside the door until they had passed and gave bayard her hand you aint been out in a long while now she said and i bet you aint fergot mandy neither sure i havent bayard agreed but he had money to mandy did not compensate for some trinket of no value which john never forgot to bring her when he came he followed the others into thefrosty darkness again beneath his feet the ground was already stiffening overhead the sky was brilliant with stars he stumbled a little behind the clotted backs until rafe opened a door into a separate building upon a room filled with warmth and a thin blue haze in which a kerosene lamp burned steadily and odors of food and stood aside until they had entered in the middle of the floor the table was laid on it the lamp stood and at one end was placed a chair the two sides and the other end were paralleled by backless benches against the further wall was the stove and a huge cupboard of split boards and a woodbox behind the stove two negro men and a halfgrown boy sat their faces shining with heat and with white rolling eyes about their feet five puppies snarled with mock savageness at one another or chewed damply at the negroes static ankles or prowled about beneath the stove and the adjacent floor with blundering aimless inquisitiveness howdy boys bayard said calling them by name and they bobbed at him with diffident flashes of teeth put dem puppies up richud mandy ordered the negroes gathered the puppies up one by one and stowed them away in a smaller box behind the stove where they continued to move about with scratchings and bumpings and an occasional smothered protest from time to time during the meal a head would appear suddenly staring over the box edge with blinking and solemn curiosity then vanish with an abrupt scuffling thump and more protests and moiling infantlike noises rose again hush up dawgs gawn to sleep now richard would say rapping the box with his knuckles at last the noise ceased the old man took the chair his sons around him and the guest some coatless all collarless with theirdark saturnine faces stamped all clearly from the same die they ate sausage and spare ribs and a dish of hominy and one of fried sweet potatoes and cornbread and a molasses jug of sorghum and mandy poured coffee from a huge enamelware pot in the middle of the meal the two missing ones came injackson the eldest a man of fiftyfive with a broad high forehead and thick brows and an expression at once dreamy and intensea sort of shy and impractical cincinnatus and stuart fortyfour and rafes twin yet although they were twins there was no closer resemblance between them than between any two of them as though thediewas too firm and made too clean an imprint to be either hurried or altered even by nature stuart had none of rafes easy manner rafe was the only one of them that by any stretch of the imagination could have been called loquacious on the other hand he had much of henrys placidity he was a good farmer and a canny trader and he had a respectable bank account of his own henry fiftythree was the second son they ate with silent and steady decorum with only the barest essential words but amicably mandy moved back and forth between table and stove before the meal was finished a sudden belllike uproar of dogs floated up and seeped muted by the tight walls into the room dar now the negro richard cocked his head buddy poised his coffee where are they dick right back of de spring house dey got im too buddy rose and slid leanly from his corner ill go with you bayard said rising also the others ate steadily richard got a lantern down from the cupboard top and lit it and the three of them stepped out into the chill darkness across which the baying of the dogs came in musical gusts ringing asfrosty glass it was chill and dark the house loomed its rambling low wall broken by the ruddy glow of the window grounds about hard already bayard remarked twont freeze tonight buddy answered will itdick naw suh gwine rain go on bayard said i dont believe it pappy said sobuddy answered warmern twas at sundown dont feel like it to me bayard insisted they passed the wagon motionless in the starlight its tires glinting like satin ribbons and the long rambling stable from which placid munchings came and an occasional snuffing snort as the lantern passed the lantern twinkled among tree trunks as the path descended the clamor of the dogs swelled just beneath them and in a sapling just behind the spring house they found the possum curled motionless and with its eyes tightly shut in a fork not six feet from the ground buddy lifted it down by the tail unresisting hell bayard said buddy called the dogs away and they mounted the path again in a disused shed behind the kitchen what seemed like at least fifty eyes gleamed in matched red points as buddy swung the lantern in and flashed it onto a cage screened with chicken wire from which rose a rank warm odor and in which grizzled furry bodies moved sluggishly or swung sharp skulllike faces into the light he opened the door and dumped his latest capture in among its fellows and gave the lantern to richard they emerged already the sky was hazing over a little losing its brittle brilliance the others sat in a semicircle before the fire at theold mans feet the blueticked hound dozed they made room for bayard and buddy squatted again in the chimney corner git immr maccallum asked yes sir bayard answered like lifting your hat off a nail in the wall the old man puffed again well give you a shonough hunt befoyou leave rafe said how many you got now buddy aint got but foteen buddy answered foteen henry repeated we wont never eat foteen possums turn em loose and run em again then buddy answered the old man puffed slowly at his pipe the others smoked or chewed also and bayard produced his cigarettes and offered them to buddy buddy shook his head buddy aint never started yet rafe said you havent bayard asked whats the matter buddy dont know buddy answered from his shadow just aint had time to learn i reckon the fire crackled and swirled from time to time stuart nearest the box put another log on the dog at the old mans feet dreamed snuffed soft ashes swirled on the hearth at its nose and it sneezed and woke raised its head and blinked up at the old mans face then dozed again they sat without word or movement their grave aquiline faces as though carved by the firelight out of the shadowy darkness shaped by a angle thought and smoothed and colored by the same hand the old man tapped his pipe carefully out upon his palm and consulted his fat silver watch eight oclock weuns git up at fooclock bayard he said but you dont have to git up till daylight henry git the jug four oclock bayard repeated as he and buddy undressed in the lamplit chill of the leanto room in which in a huge wooden bed with a faded patchwork quilt buddy slept i dont see why you bother to go to bed at all as he spoke his breath vaporized in the chilly air yes buddy agreed ripping his shirt over his head and kicking his lean racehorse shanks out of his shabby khaki pants dont take long to spend the night at our house youre compny though buddys preparations for sleeping were simple he removed his boots and pants and shirt and went to bed in his woolen underwear and he now lay with only his round head in view watching bayard who stood in a sleeveless jersey and short thin trunks you aint goin to sleep warm thataway buddy added you want one o my heavy uns ill sleep warm i guess bayard answered he blew the lamp out and groped his way to the bed his toes curling away from the icy floor and got in the mattress was filled with corn shucks it rattled beneath him drily sibilant and whenever he or buddy moved at all or took a deep breath even the shucks shifted with small ticking sounds git that ere quilt tucked in good over there buddy advised from the darkness emitting his breath in a short explosive sound of relaxation and contentment he yawned audible but invisible aint seen you in a long while he suggested thats right lets see when was it twothree years wasnt it nineteen fifteen buddy answered last timeyou and him he ceased suddenly then he added quietly i seen in a paper when it happened the name kind of knowed right off twas him it was a limey paper you did where were you up there buddy answered where them limeys was where they sent us flat country dont see how they ever drained it enough to make a crop with all that rain yes bayard said his nose was like a lump of ice he could feel his breath warming his nose a little could almost see the pale smoke of it as he breathed could feel the inhalation chilling his nostrils again it seemed too that he could feel the planks of the ceiling as they sloped down to the low wall on buddys side could feel the atmosphere packed into the low corner bitter and chill and thick too thick for breathing like invisible slush and he lay beneath ithe was aware of the dry ticking of shucks beneath him and discovered so that he was breathing in deep troubled draughts and he wished dreadfully to be up moving before a fire light anywhere anywhere buddy lay beside him in the oppressive halfcongealed solidity of the chill talking in his slow inarticulate idiom of the war it was a vague dreamy sort of tale without beginning or end and with stumbling reference to places wretchedly pronouncedyou got an impression of people creatures without initiation or background or future caught tunelessly in a maze of solitary conflicting preoccupations like bumping tops against an imminent but incomprehensible nightmare howd you like the army buddy not much buddy answered aint enough to do good life for a lazy man he mused a moment they gimme a medal he added in a burst ofshy diffident confidence and sober pleasure i aimed to show it to you but i fergot do it tomorrow that ere flos to dang cold to tech till i have to ill watch a chance when pappys outen the house why dont he know you got it he knows buddy answered only he dont like it because he claims its a yankee medal rafe says pappy and stonewall jackson aint never surrendered yes bayard repeated after a while buddy ceased and sighed again emptying his body for sleep but bayard lay rigidly oh his back his eyes wide open it was like being drunk and whenever you close your eyesthe room starts going round and round and so you sit rigid in the dark with your eyes wide open not to get sick buddy had ceased talking presently his breathing became longer steady and regular and the shuck shifted with sibilant complaint as bayard turned slowly onto his side but buddy breathed on in the darkness steadily and peacefully bayard could hear his own breathing also but above it all around it surrounding him that other breathing as though he were one thing breathing with restrained laboring within himself breathing with buddys breathing using up all the air so that the lesser thing must pant for it meanwhile the greater thing breathed peacefully and steadily and unawares asleep remote ay perhaps dead perhaps he was dead and he recalled that morning relived it again with strained and intense attention from the time he had seen the first tracer smoke until from his steep sideslip he watched the flame burst like the gay flapping of an orange pennon from johns camel and saw his brothers familiar gesture and the sudden awkward sprawl of his plunging body as it lost equilibrium in midair relived itagain as you might run over a printed tale trying to remember feel a bullet going into his body or head that might have slain him at the same instant that would account for it would explain so much that he too was dead and this was hell through which he moved forever and ever with an illusion of quickness seeking his brother who in turn was somewhere seeking him never the two to meet he turned onto his back again the shucks whispered beneath him with dry derision the house was full of noises to his sharpened senses the silence was myriad the dry agony of wood in the black frost the ticking of shucks as he breathed the very atmosphere itself like slush ice in the vice of the cold oppressing his lungs his feet were cold his limbs sweated with it and about his hot heart his body was rigid and shivering and he raised his naked arms above the covers and lay for a time with the cold like a lead cast about them and all the while buddys steady breathing and his own restrained and labored breath both sourceless yet involved one with the other beneath the covers again his arms were cold across his chest and his hands were like ice upon his ribs and he moved with infinite caution while the chill croached from his shoulders downward and the hidden shucks chattered at him and swung his legs to the floor and his curling toes he knew where the door was and he groped his way to it it was fastened by a wooden bar smooth as ice he fumbled this out of its slots carefully and without noise the door had sagged from the hinges and after the first jarring scrape he grasped the edge of it in his chill fingers and raised it and swung it back and stood in the door in the sky no star showed and the sky was the sagging corpse of itself it lay upon the earth like a deflated balloon into it the dark shape of the kitchen rose without depth and the trees beyond and homely shapes like chill ghosts in the cold corpselightthe woodpile a farming tool a barrel beside the broken stoop at the kitchen door where he had stumbled supperward the gray chill seeped into him like water into sand with short trickling runs halting groping about an obstruction then on again trickling at last along his unimpeded bones he was shaking slowly and steadily with cold beneath his hands his flesh was rough and without sensation yet still it jerked and jerked as though something within the dead envelope of him strove to free itself above his head upon the wooden roof there sounded a single light tap and as though at a signal the gray silence began to dissolve he shut the door silently and returned to bed in the bed he lay shaking more than ever to the cold derision of the shucks under him and he lay quietly on his back hearing the winter rain whispering on the roof there was no drumming as when summer rain falls through the buoyant air but a whisper of unemphatic sound as though the atmosphere lying heavily upon the roof dissolved there and dripped sluggishly and steadily from the eaves his blood flowed again and the covers felt like iron or like ice but while he lay motionless beneath the rain his blood warmed yet more until at last his body ceased trembling and he lay presently in something like a tortured and fitful doze surrounded by coiling images and shapes of stubborn despair and the ceaseless striving fornot vindication so much as comprehension a hand no matter whose to touch him out of his black chaos he would spurn it of course but it would restore his cold sufficiency again the rain dripped on dripped and dripped beside him buddy breathed placidlyand steadily he had not even changed his position at times bayard dozed fitfully dozing he was wide awake waking he lay in a hazy state filled with improbable moiling and in which there was neither relief nor rest drop by drop the rain wore the night away wore time away but it was so long so damn long his spent blood wearied with struggling moved through his body in slow beats like the rain wearing his flesh away it comes to allbiblesome preacher anyway maybe he knew peace it comes to all at last from beyond walls he heard movement it was indistinguishable yet he knew it was of human origin of people he knew waking again into the world he had not been able even temporarily to lose people to whom he wasand he was comforted the sounds continued and at last and unmistakably he heard a door and a voice which he knew that with a slight effort of concentration he could name and best of all that he could rise and go where they were gathered about a crackling fire arid he lay at ease at last intending to rise the next moment and go to them putting it off a little longer while his blood beat slowly through his body and his heart was quieted buddy breathed steadily beside him and his own breath was quiet now as buddys while the human sounds came murmurously into the cold room with grave and homely reassurance it comes to all it comes to all his tired heart comforted him and at last he slept he waked in the gray morning his body wearyand heavy and dull his sleep had not rested him buddy was gone and it still rained though now it was adefinite sound on the roof and the air was warmer with a rawness that probed into the very bones of him and in his stockings and carrying his scarred expensive boots in his hands he traversed the cold room where lee and rafe and stuart slept and found rafe and jackson before the livingroom fire we let you sleep rafe said then he said good lord boy you look like a hant didnt you sleep lastnight yes i slept all right bayard answered he sat down and stamped into his boots and buckled the thongs below his knees jackson sat at one side of the hearth in the shadowy corner near his feet a number of small living creatures moiled silently and still bent over his boots bayard said what you got there jackson what sort of puppies are them new breed tin trying jackson answered and rafe approached with a half a tumbler of henrys pale amber whisky thems ethels pups he said git jackson to tell you about em after you eat here drink this you look all wore but buddy must a kept you awake talkin he added with dry irony bayard accepted the glass and emptied it and lit a cigarette mandys got yo breakfast on the stove rafe added ethel bayard repeated oh that fox i aimed to ask about her last night yes jackson aims to revolutionize the huntin business with her aims to raise a breed of animals with a hounds wind and bottom and a foxs smartness and speed bayard approached the shadowy corner and examined the small creatures with interest and curiosity i never saw many fox pups he said at last but i never saw any that looked like them thats what genral seems to think rafe answered jackson spat into the fire and stooped over the creatures they knew his hands and the moiling of them became more intense and bayard then noticed that they made no sound at all not even puppy whimperings hits a experiment jackson explained the boys makes fun of em but they haint no moren weaned yet you wait and see dont know what youll do with em rafe said brutally they wont be big enough for work stock better git yo breakfast bayard you wait and see jackson repeated he touched the scramble of small bodies with his hands in a gentle protective gesture you cant tell nothinbout a dawg twell hits at least two months old can you he appealed to bayard looking up at him with his vague intense gaze from beneath his shaggy brows go git yo breakfast bayard rafe repeated buddys done goneand left you he bathed his face with icy water in a tin pan on the porch and ate his breakfastham and eggs and flapjacks and sorghum and coffeewhile mandy talked to him about his brother when he returned to the house old mr maccallum was there the puppies moiled inextricably in their corner and the old man sat with his hands on his knees watching them with bluff and ribald merriment while jackson sat nearby in a sort of covering concern like a hen come hyerboy the old man ordered when bayard appeared hyer rafe git me that ere bait line rafe went out returning presently with a bit of pork rind on the end of a string the old man tookit and rose and hauled the puppies ungently into the light where they crouched abjectly moilingas strange a litter as bayard had ever seen no two of them looked alike and none of them looked like anything else neither fox nor hound partaking of both yet neither and despite their soft infancy there was about them something monstrous and contradictory and obscene here a foxs keen cruel muzzle between the melting sad eyes of a hound and its mild ears there limp fears tried valiantly to stand erect and failed ignobly in flapping points shoebutton eyes in meek puppy faces and limp brief tails brushed over with a faint golden fuzz like the inside of a chestnut burr as regards color they ranged from pure reddish brown through ail indiscriminate brindle to pure ticked beneath a faint dun cast and one of them had feature for feature old generals face in comical miniature even to his expression of sad and dignified disillusion watch em now the old man ordered he got them all facing forward then he dangled the meat directly behind them not one noticed it he swept it back and forth above their heads not one looked up then he swung it directly before their eyes still they crouched diffidently on their young unsteady legs and gazed at the meat with curiosity but without any interest at all and fell again to moiling soundlessly among themselves you cant tell nothin about a dawg jackson began his father interrupted him now watch he held the puppies with one hand and with the other he forced the meat into their mouths immediately they surged clumsily and eagerly over his hand but he moved the meat away and at the length of the string he dragged it along the floor just ahead of them until they had attained asort of scrambling lope then in midfloor he flicked the meat slightly aside but without seeing it the group blundered on and into a shadowy corner where the wall stopped them and from which there rose presently the patient voiceless confusion of them jackson left his chair and picked them up and brought them back to the fire now what do you think of them for a pack of huntin dogs the old man demanded cant smell cant bark and damn ef i believe they kin see you cant tell nothin about a dawg jackson essayed patiently genral kin his father interrupted hyer rafe call genral in hyer rafe went to the door and called and presently general entered his claws hissing a little on the bare floor and his ticked coat beaded with rain and he stood and looked into the old mans face with grave inquiry corne hyermr maccallum said and the dog moved again with slow dignity at that moment he saw the puppies beneath jacksons chair he paused in midstride and for a moment he stood looking at them with fascination and bafflement and a sort of grave horror then he gave his master one hurt reproachful look and turned and departed his tail between his legs mr maccallum sat down and rumbled heavily within himself you cant tell about dawgs jackson repeated he stooped and gathered up his charges and stood up mr maccallum continued to rumble and shake well i dont blame the old feller he said ef i had to look around on a passel of chaps like them and say to myself thems my boys but jackson was gone the old man sat and rumbled again with enjoyment yes suh i reckon id feel bout as proud as he does rafe han me down my pipe all that day it rained and the following day and the day after that the dogs lurked about the house all morning underfoot or made brief excursions into the weather returning to sprawl before the fire drowsing and malodorous and steaming until henry came along and drove them out twice from the door bayard saw the fox ethel fading with brisk diffidence across the yard with the exception of henry and jackson who had a touch of rheumatism the others were somewhere out in the rain most of the day but at mealtimes they gathered again shucking their wet outer garments on the porch and stamping in to thrust their muddy smoking boots to the fire while henry was fetching the kettle and the jug and last of all buddy soaking wet buddy had a way of getting his lean length up from his niche beside the chimney at any hour of the day and departing without a word to return in an hour or six hours or twelve or twentyfour or fortyeight during which periods and despite the presence of jackson and henry and usually lee the place had a vague air of vacancy until bayard realized that the majority of the dogs were absent also hunting they told bayard when buddy had been missingsince breakfast why didnt he let me know he demanded maybe he thought you wouldnt keen to be out in the weather jackson suggested buddy dont mind weather henry explained one days like another to him nothing aint anything to buddy lee put in in his bitter passionate voice he sat brooding in thefire his womanish hands moving restlessly on his knees hes spent his whole life in that ere river bottom with a hunk of cold cawnbread to eat and a passel of dawgs fer compny he rose abruptly and quitted the room lee was in the late thirties as a child he had been sickly he had a good tenor voice and lie was much in demand at sunday singings he was supposed to be keeping company with a young woman living in the hamlet of mount vernon six miles away hespent much of his time tramping moodily and alone about the countryside henry spat into the fire and jerked his head after tie departing brother he been to vernon lately him and rale was there two days ago jackson answered bayard said well i wont melt i wonder if i could catch up with him now they pondered for a while spitting gravely into the fire i misdoubt it jackson said at last buddys liable to be ten mile away by now you ketch im next time fo he starts out after that bayard did so and he and buddy tried for birds in the ragged skeletoned fields in the rain in which the guns made a flat mournful sound that lingered in the streaming air like a spreading stain or tried the stagnant backwaters along the river channel for duck and geese or accompanied now and then by rafe hunted coon and wildcat in the bottom at times and far away they would hear the shrill yapping of the young dogs in mad career there goes ethel buddy would remark then toward the end of the week the weather cleared and in a twilight imminent with frost and while the scent lay well upon the muddy earth old general started the red fox that had baffled him so many times all through the night the ringing belllike tonesquavered and swelled and echoed among the hills and all of them save henry followed on horseback guided by the cries of the hounds but mostly by the old mans and buddys uncanny and seemingly clairvoyant skill in anticipating the course of the race occasionally they stopped while buddy and his father wrangled about where the quarry would head next but usually they agreed apparentlyanticipating the animals movements before it knew them itself and once and again they halted their horses upon a hill and sat so in the frosty starlight until the dogs voices welled out of the darkness mournful and chiming swelled louder and nearer and swept invisibly past not half a mile away faded diminishing and with a falling suspense as of bells into the darkness again thar now the old man exclaimed shapeless in his overcoat upon his white horse aint that music feramannow i hope they git im this time jackson said hit hurts genrals conceit so much everytime he fools im they wont git im buddy said soons he gits tired hell hole up in them rocks i reckon well have to wait till them pups of jacksons gits big enough the old man agreed unless theyll refuse to run they own granpappy they done refused ever tiling else excep vittles you jest wait jackson repeated indefatigable when them puppies git old enough to listen the talking ceased and again across the silence the dogs voices rang among the hills long ringing cries fading falling with a quavering suspense like touched bells or strings repeated and sustained by belllike echoes repeated and dying among the darkhills beneath the stars lingering yet in the ears crystalclear mournful and valiant and a little sad too bad johnny aint here stuart said quietly hed enjoy this race he was a feller far huntin now jackson agreed hed keep up with buddy even john was a fine boy the old man said yes suh jackson repeated a right warmhearted boy henry says he never come out hyer withouten he brung mandy and the boys a little stobought somethin he neve sulled on a hunt stuart said no matter how cold and wet it was even when he was a little chap with that ere single barlhe bought with his own money that kicked im so hard every time he shot it and yit hed tote it around instead of that ere sixteen old colonel give im jest because he saved his money and bought hit hisself yes jackson agreed ef a feller gits into somethin on his own accord he ought to go through with hit cheerful he was sho a feller fer singin and shoutinmr maccallum said skeer all the game in ten mile i mind that night he headed off a race down at samsons bridge and next we knowed here him and the fox come afloatin down river on that ere drift lawg that uz johnny all over jackson agreed gittin a whoppin big time outen ever thing that come up he was a fine boymr maccallum said again listen again the hounds gave tongue in the darkness below them the sound floated up upon the chill air died into echoes that repeated the sound again until its source was lost and the very earth itself mighthave found voice mournful and sad and wild with all regret christmas was two days away and they sat again about the fire after supper again old general dozed at his masters feet tomorrow was christmas eve and the wagon was going into town and although with that grave and unfailing hospitality of theirs no word had been said to bayard about his departure he believed that in all their minds it was taken for granted that he would return home the following day for christmas and since he had not mentioned it himself a little curiosity and quiet speculation also it was cold again with a vivid chill that caused the blazing logs to pop and crackle with vicious sparks and small glowing embers that leaped out upon the floor to be crushed out by a lazy boot and bayard sat drowsily in a drowse of heat his tired muscles relaxed in the cumulate waves of it as in a warm bath and the stubborn struggling of his heart glozed over too for the time time enough tomorrow to decide whether to go or not perhaps hed just stay on without offering that explanation that would never be demanded of him then he realized that rafe lee whoever went would talk to people would learn about that which he had not the courage to tell them buddy had come out of his shadowy niche and he now squatted in the center of the semicircle his back to the fire and his arms around his knees with his motionless and seemingly tireless ability for sitting timelessly on his heels he was the baby twenty years old his mother was the old mans second wife and his hazel eyes and the reddish thatch cropped closely to his round head was a noticeable contrast to the others brown eyes and black hair but the oldman had stamped buddys face as clearly as ever a one of the other boys and despite its youth it too was like the othersaquiline and spare reserved and grave though a trifle ruddy with his fresh coloring and finer skin the others were of medium height or under ranging from jacksons faded vaguely ineffectual lankness through henrys placid rotundity and rafes raphael semmes he was and stuarts poised and stocky muscularity to lees thin and fiery unrepose but buddy with his saplinglike leanness stood eye to eye with that father who wore his eightytwo years as though they were a thin shirt long spindlin scoundrel the old man would say with bluff assumed derogation keeps hisself wore to a shadder totin around all that ere grub he eats and they would sit in silence looking at buddys lean jackknifed length with the same identical thought a thought which each believed peculiar to himself and which none ever divulgedthat someday buddy would marry and perpetuate the name buddy also bore his fathers name though it is doubtful if anyone outside the family and the war department knew it he had run away at eighteen and enlisted at the infantry concentration camp in arkansas to which he had been sent a fellow recruit called him virge and buddy had fought him steadily and without anger for seven minutes at the new jersey embarkation depot another man had done the same thing and buddy had fought him again steadily and thoroughly and without anger in europe still following the deep but uncomplex compulsions of his nature he had contrived unwittingly perhaps to perpetrate something which was later ascertained by authority to have severely annoyed the enemy for which buddy had received his charm as he calledit what it was he did he could never be brought to tell and the gaud not only failing to placate his fathers rage over the fact that a son of his had joined the federal army but on the contrary adding fuel to it the bauble languished among buddys sparse effects and his military career was never mentioned in the family circle and now as usual buddy squatted among them his back to the fire and his arms around his knees while they sat about the hearth with their bedtime toddies talking of christmas turkey the old man was saying with fine and rumbling disgust with a pen full of possums and a river bottom full of squirls and ducksand a smokehouse full of hawg meat you damn boys have got to go clean to town and buy a turkey fer christmas dinner christmas aint christmas lessen a feller has a little somethin different from ever day jackson pointed out mildly you boys jest wants a excuse to git to town and loaf around all day and spend money the old man retorted ive seen a sight mo christmases than you have boy and ef hits got to be stobought hit aint christmas how bout townfolks rafe asked you aint allowin them no christmas atall dont deserve none the old man snapped livin on a little twobyfo lot jam right up in the next fellers back do eatinouten tin cans sposin they all broke up in town stuart said and moved out here and took up land youd

cocoanuts and yankeemade popguns and sich yes suh rafe said and he winked at bayard that was the biggest mistake the world ever made when lee surrendered the country aint never got over it the old man snorted again ill be damned ef i aint raised the damdest smartest set of boys in the world cant tell em nothin cant learn em nothin cant even set in front of my own fire fer the whole passel of em tellin me how to run the whole damn country hyer you boys git on to bed next morning jackson and rafe and stuart and lee left for town at sunup in the wagon still none of them had made any sign expressed any curiosity as to whether they would find him there when they returned that night or whether it would be another three years before they saw him again and bayard stood on the frostwhitened porch smoking a cigarette in the chill vivid air while the yet hidden sun painted the eastern hills and looked after the wagon and the four muffled figures in it and wondered if it would be three years again or ever the hounds came and nuzzled about him and he dropped his hand among their icy noses and the warm flicking of their tongues gazing after the wagon hidden now among the trees from which the dry rattling of it came unimpeded upon the soundless clear morning ready to go buddy said behind him and he turned and picked up his shotgun where it leaned against the wall the hounds surged about them witheager whimperings and frosty breaths and buddy led them across to a shed and huddled them inside and fastened the door upon their surprised protests from another kennel he unfastened the young pointer dan behind them the hounds continued to raise their baffled and mellow expostulations until noon they hunted the ragged fallow fields and woodsedges in the warming am the frost was soon gone and the air warmed to a windless languor and twice in brier thickets they saw redbirds darting like arrows of scarlet flame at last bayard lifted his eyes unwinking into the sun i must go back buddy he said tin going home this afternoon all right buddy agreed without protest and he called the dog in you come back next month mandy got them some cold food and they ate and while buddy went to saddle perry bayard went into the house where he found henry laboriously soling fr pair of shoes and the old man reading a weekold newspaper through steelbowed spectacles i reckon yo folks will be lookin fer youmr maccallum agreed well be expectin you back nest month though to git that ere fox ef we dont git im soon genral wont be able to hold up his head befothem puppies yes sir bayard answered i will and try to git yo granpappy to come with you he kin lay around hyer and eat his head off well as he kin in town yes sir i will then buddy led the pony up to the door and the old man extended his hand without rising and henry put aside his cobbling and followed him onto the porch come out again he said diffidently giving bayards hand a single pumphandle shake andfrom a slobbering inquisitive surging of halfgrown hounds buddy reached up his hand be lookin fer you he said briefly and together they stood and watched bayard wheel away and when he looked back they lifted their hands gravely then buddy shouted after him and he reined perry about and returned henry had vanished and he reappeared with a weighted tow sack i nigh fergot it he said jug of cawn pappys sendin in to yo granpaw you wont git no better in looeyvul or nowhar else neither he added with quiet pride bayard thanked him and buddy fastened the sack to the pommel where it lay solidly against his leg there thatll ride so long solong perry moved on and he looked back they still stood there quiet and grave and steadfast beside the kitchen door the fox ethel sat looking at him covertly near her the halfgrown puppies moved about in the sun the sun was an hour above the western hills the road wound on into the trees he looked back again the house sprawled its rambling length against the further trees its smoke like a balanced plume against the windless sky the door was empty again he shook perry into his easy tireless foxtrot the jug of whisky jouncing a little against his knee where the dim infrequent road to maccallums left the main road rising he halted perry and sat for a while in the sunset jefferson miles rafe and the other boys would not be along for some time yet what with christmas eve in town and the slow festivegathering of the county still they may have left town early so as to get home by dark might not be an hour away the suns rays slanting away released the chill they had held prisoned in the ground during the perpendicular hours and it rose slowly and gradually about him as he sat perry in the middle of the road and slowly his blood cooled with the cessation of perrys motion he turned the ponys back to town and shook him into his foxtrot again darkness overtook him soon but he rode on beneath the leafless trees along the pale road in the gathering starlight already perry was thinking of stable and supper and he went on with tentative inquiring tossings of his head but obediently and without slackening his gait knowing not where they were going nor why save that it was away from home and a little dubious though trustfully the chill grew in the silence and the loneliness and the monotony of their progress he reined perry to a halt and produced the jug and drank and fastened the sack to the saddle again the hills rose wild and black about him no sign of any habitation no trace of mans hand did they encounter on all sides the hills rolled blackly away in the starlight or when the road dipped into valleys where the ruts were already stiffening into ironlike shards that rattled beneath perrys hooves they stood about him darkly towering and sinister feathering their leafless branches against the spangled sky where a stream of winter seepage trickled across the road perrys feet crackled brittly in this ice and bayard slacked the reins while the pony snuffed at the water and drank again from the jug he fumbled a match clumsily in his cold angers and lit a cigarette and pushed his sleeve back from his wrist well perry his voice soundedloud and sudden in the stillness and darkness and the cold i reckon we better look for a place to hole up till morning perry raised his head and snorted as though he understood the words as though he would enter the bleak loneliness in which his rider moved if he could they went on mounting again the darknessspreadaway lessening a little presently where occasional fields lay in the vague starlight breaking the monotony of trees and after a time during which he rode with the reins slack on perrys neck and his hands in his pockets seeking warmth between leather and groin a cotton house squatted beside the road its roof dusted over with a frosty sheen as of hushed silver not long he said to himself leaning forward and laying his hand on perrys neck feeling the warm tireless blood there house soon perry if we look sharp again perry whinnied alittle as though he had understood and presently he swerved from the road and as bayard reined him up he too saw the faint wagon trail leading away toward a low vague dump of trees good boy perry he said slackening the reins again the house was a cabin it was dark but a hound came gauntly from beneath it and bayed at him and continued its uproar while he reined perry to the door and knocked upon it with his numb hand from within the house at last a voice indistinguishable and he repeated hello then he added tm lost open the door the hound continued to bellow at him and the door cracked upon a dying glow of embers emitting a rank odor of negroes and against the crack of warmth a head you jule the head commanded shut yo mouf the hound ceased obediently and retired beneath the house growling who dar im lost bayard repeated can i sleep in your barn tonight aint got no barn the negro answered deys anudder house down de road a piece ill pay yon bayard fumbled in his trousers with his numb hand my horse is tired out the negros head peered around the door against the crack of firelight come on uncle bayard added impatiently dont keep a man standing in the cold who is you whitefolks bayard sartoris from jefferson here and he extended his hand banker sartoriss folks yes here wait a minute the door closed but bayard tightened the reins and perry moved readily and circled the house confidently and went on among froststiffened cotton stalks that clattered drily about his knees as bayard dismounted onto frozen rutted earth beneath a gaping doorway a lantern approached swung low among the bitten stalks and the shadowy scissoring of the mans legs and he came up with a shapeless bundle under his arm and stood with the lantern while bayard stripped the saddle and bridle off how you manage to git so fur fum home dis time of night whitefolks he asked curiously lost bayard answered briefly where can i put my horse the negro swung the lantern into a stall perry stepped carefully over the sill and turned into the lantern light again his eyes rolling in phosphorescent gleams bayard followed and rubbed him down with the dry side of the saddle blanket the negro vanished and reappeared with a few ears of corn and dumped them into the manger beside perrys eagernuzzling you gwine be keerful about fire aint you boss sure i wont strike any matches at all i got all my stock and tools and feed in here the negro explained i cant affod to git burnt out insuance dont reach dis fur sure bayard repeated he shut perrys stall and drew the sack forth from where he had set it against the wall and produced the jug got a cup here the negro vanished again and bayard could hear him in the crib in the wall opposite then he emerged with a rusty can from which he blew a bursting puff of chaff they drank behind them perry crunched his corn the negro showed him the ladder to the loft you wont fergit about no fire boss he repeated anxiously sure bayard said goodnight he turned to mount again the negro stopped him and handed him the shapeless bundle he had brought out with him aint got but one to spare but hitll help some you gwine to sleep cole tonight it was a quilt ragged and filthy to the touch and impregnated with that unmistakable odor of negroes thanks bayard answered much obliged to you goodnight goodnight whitefolks the lantern winked away to the crisscrossing of the negros legs and bayard mounted into darkness and the dry pungent scent of hay here in the darkness he made himself a bed of it and lay down and rolled himself into the quilt filth and odor and all and thrust his icy hands inside his shirt against his flenching chest after a time and slowly his hands began to warm tingling a little but still his body lay shivering with weariness and with cold below himperry munched steadily and peacefully in the darkness and gradually the shaking of his body ceased before he slept he uncovered his arm and looked at the luminous dial on his wrist one oclock it was already christmas the sun waked him falling in red bars through the cracks in the wall and he lay for a time in his hard bed with vivid chill upon his face like fresh city water wondering where he was then he remembered and moving found that he was stiff with stale cold and that his blood moved through his arms and legs in small pellets like birdshot he dragged his legs from his odorous bed but within his boots his feet were dead and he sat flexing his knees and ankles for some time before his feet waked as with stinging needles his movements were stiff and awkward and he descended the ladder slowly and gingerly into the red sun that fell like a blare of trumpets into the hallway the sun was just above the horizon huge and red and housetop fenceposts the casual farming tools rusting about the barnyard and the dead cotton stalks where the negro had farmed his land right up to his back door were dusted over with frost which the sun changed to a scintillant rosy icing like that on a festive cake perry thrust his slender muzzle across the stall door and whinnied at his master with vaporous fading puffs of frosty breath and bayard spoke to him and touched his cold nose then he uncovered the jug again and drank and the negro with a milk pail appeared hi the doorway mawnin whitefolks you gawn to de house to de fire ill feed yo hawss de ole woman got yo breakfus ready he was eyeing the jug and bayard gave him another drink and picked up the sack atthe well he stopped and drew a pail of icy water and splashed his face a fire burned on the broken hearth amid ashes and charred woodends and a litter of cooking vessels bayard shut the door behind him upon the bright cold and warmth and rich stale rankness enveloped him a woman bent over the fire replied to his greeting diffidently three pickaninnies became utterly still in a corner and watched him with rolling white eyes one of them was a girl in greasy nondescript garments her wool twisted into tight knots of soiled wisps of colored cloth the second one might have been either or anything the third one was practically helpless in a garment made from a mans suit of wool underclothes it was too small to walk and it crawled about the floor in a sort of intense purposelessness a glazed path running from either nostril to its chin as though snails had crawled there without looking at him the woman placed a chair before the fire and bayard seated himself and thrust his boots to the blaze had your christmas dram yet aunty he asked nawsuhaint got none dis year he swung the sack across his legs and set it on the floor help yourself he said plenty in there the three children squatted against the wall watching him steadily without movement and without sound christmas come yet chillen he asked them but they only stared at him with the watchful gravity of animals until the woman returned and spoke to than in a chiding tone show de whitefolks yo sandy claus she prompted thanky suh she added putting a tin plate on his lap and setting a cracked china cup on the hearth at his feet show im she repeated you want folks to think sandy claus dont know whar you lives at the children stirred then and from the shadow behind them where they had hidden them when he entered they produced a small tin automobile a string of colored wooden beads a small mirror and a huge stick of peppermint candy to which trash adhered and which they immediately fell to licking gravely turn and turn about the woman filled the cup from the coffee pot set among the embers and she uncovered an iron skillet and forked a thick slab of sizzling meat onto his plate and raked a grayish object from the ashes and dusted it off and put that too on his plate bayard ate his side meat and hoecake and drank the thin tasteless liquid the children now played quietly with their christmas but from time to time he looked up and found them watching him again presently the man entered with his pail of milk ole oman give you a snack he asked ye whats the nearest town on the railroad he inquired the other told himeight miles away can you drive me over there this morning and take my horse back to maccallums some day this week my brudderinlaw bord my mules the negro answered readily i aint got but de one span and he done bord dem ill pay you five dollars the negro set thepail down and the woman came and got it he scratched his head slowly five dollars bayard repeated yous in a powful rush fer chrismus whitefolks ten dollars bayard said impatiently cant you get your mules from your brotherinlaw i reckon so i reckon hell bring um back by dinnertime we kin go den why cant you get em now take my horse and go getem i want to catch a train i aint had no chrismus yit whitefolks feller workin evy day of de year wants a little chrismus bayard swore beneath his breath but he said all right then after dinner but you see your brotherinlaw hasem back here in time hell be here dontyou worry about dat all right you and aunty help yourselves to the jug thankysuh the stale airtight room dulled him the warmth was insidious to his bones wearied and stiff after the chill night the negroes moved about the single room the woman busy at the hearth with her cooking the pickaninnies with their frugal and sorry gewgaws and filthy candy bayard sat in his chair and dozed the morning away not asleep but time was lost in a timeless region where he lingered unawake and into which he realized after a long while that something was trying to penetrate watched the vain attempts with peaceful detachment but at last it succeeded a voice dinner ready the negroes drank with him again amicably a little diffidentlytwo opposed concepts antipathetic by race blood nature and environment touching for a moment and fused within the illusion of a contradictionhumankind forgetting its lust and cowardice and greed for a day then dinner possum with yams more gray ashcake the dead and tasteless liquid in the coffee pot a dozen bananas and jagged shards of cocoanut the children crawling about his feet like animals scenting food he realized that theywere holding back until he ate but he overrode them and at last the mules having been miraculously returned by a yet incorporeal brotherinlaw with his depleted jug between his feet in the wagon bed he looked once back at the cabin with the woman standing in the door and a pale windless drift of smoke above its chimney against the mules gaunt ribs the broken harness rattled and jingled the air was warm yet laced too with a thin distillation of chill that darkness would increase the road went on across the bright land from time to time across the shining sedge or from beyond brown and leafless woods came the flat reports of guns occasionally they passed other teams or horsemen or pedestrians who lifted dark restful hands to the negro buttoned into an army overcoat with brief covert glances for the white man on the seat beside him heyo chrismus beyond the yellow sedge and the brown leafless ridges the ultimate hills stood bluely against the immaculate sky heyo they stopped and drank and bayard gave his companion a cigarette the sun behind them now no cloud no wind in the serene pale cobalt shawt days fo mile mo come up mules between motionless willows stubbornly green a dry clatter of loose planks above water in murmurous flashes the road lifted redly pines stood against the sky they crested this and a plateau rolled away before them with its pattern of burnished sedge and fallow fields and brown woodland and now and then a house on into a shimmering azure haze and low down on the horizon smoke two mile now behind them the sun was a balloon tethered an hour above the trees they drank again it had touched the horizon when they lookeddown into the final valley where the railroads shining threads vanished among houses and trees and along the air to them distantly there came a slow heavy explosion still celebratin the negro said they descended the finalhill among houses in the windows of which hung wreathes and paper bells and whose stoops were littered with spent firecrackers and went along streets where children in bright sweaters and jackets sped on shiny coasters and skates and wagons again a heavy explosion from the dusk ahead and they debouched into the square with its sabbath calm littered too with shattered scraps of paper it looked like that at home he knew with men and youths he had known from boyhood lounging the holiday away drinking a little and shooting fireworks giving nickels and dimes and quarters to negro boys who shouted chrismus gif chrismus gif as they passed and after dark somewhere a dance with holly and mistletoe and paper streamers and the girls he had always known with their new bracelets and watches and fans amid warmth and lights and music and glittering laughter a small group stood on a corner and as they passed and preceded by a sudden scurry among the group yellow flame was stenciled abruptly on the twilight and the heavy explosion reverberated in sluggish echoes the mules quickened against their collars and the wagon rattled on there were lights within the houses now behind the wreathes and the rotund bells and through the dusk voices called with mellow insistence childrens voices replied expostulant reluctantly regretful then the station where a bus and four or five cars stood aligned and bayard descended and the negro lifted down the sack much obliged bayard said goodbye goodbye whitefoiks in the waiting room a stove glowed red hot and about the room stood cheerful groups in sleek furs and overcoats but he did not enter he set the sack against the wall and tramped up and down the platform warming his blood again in both directions along the tracks green switch lights were steady in the dusk a handsbreadth above the western trees the evening star was like an electric bulb he tramped back and forth glancing now and then into the ruddy windows into the waiting room where the cheerful groups in their furs and overcoats gesticulated with festive though soundless animation and into the colored waiting room whose occupants sat patiently and murmurously about the stove in the dingy light as he turned here a voice spoke diffidently from the shadow beside the door chrismus gif boss he took a coin from his pocket and went on again from the square a firecracker exploded heavily and above the trees a rocket arced hung for a moment then opened like a closed fist spreading its golden and fading fingers upon the serene indigo sky without a sound then the train came and brought its lighted windows to a jarring halt and he picked up his sack again and in the midst of a cheerful throng shouting goodbyes and holiday greetings to one another he got aboard unshaven in his scarred boots and stained khaki pants and his shabby smokecolored tweed jacket and his disreputable felt hat and found a vacant seat and stowed the jug away beneath his legs five and since the essence of spring is loneliness and a little sadness and a sense of mild frustration i suppose you do get a keener purifaction when a little nostalgia is thrown in for good measure at home i always found myself remembering apple trees or green lanes or the color of the sea in other places and id be sad that i couldnt be everywhere at once or that all the spring couldnt be concentrated in one place like byrons ladies mouths but now i seem to be unified and projected upon one single and very definite object which is something to be said for me after all horaces pen ceased and he gazed at the sheet scrawled over with his practically illegible script while the words he had just written echoed yet in his mind with a little gallant and whimsical sadness and for the time being he had quitted the desk and the room and the town and all the crude and blatant newness into which his destiny had brought him and again that wild and delicate futility of his roamed unchallenged through the lonely region into which it had at last concentrated its conflicting parts already the thick cables along the veranda eaves would be budding into small lilac matchpoints and with no effort at all he could see the lawn below the cedars splashed with randomnarcissi among random fading jonquils and gladioli waiting to bloom in turn but his body sat motionless its hand with the arrested pen upon the scrawled sheet the paper lying upon the yellow varnished surface of his new desk the chair in which he sat was new too as was the room with its dead white walls and imitation oak woodwork all day long the sun fell upon it untempered by any shade in the days of early spring it had been pleasant falling as it now did through his western window and across the desk where a white hyacinth bloomed in a bowl of glazed maroon pottery but as he sat musing staring out the window where beyond a tarred roof that drank heat like a sponge and radiated it against a brick wall a clump of ragged heaven trees lifted shabby diffident bloom he dreaded the long hot summer days of sunlight upon the roof directly above him remembered his dim and musty office at home in which a breeze seemed always to move with its serried undisturbed rows of dusty books that seemed to emanate coolness and dimness even on the hottest days and thinking of this he was again lost from the harsh newness in which his body sat the pen moved again perhaps fortitude is a sorry imitation of something worthwhile after all to the so many who burrow along like moles in the dark or like owls to whom a candleflame is a surfeit but not those who carry peace along with them as the candleflame carries light i have always been ordered by words but now it seems that i can even restore courage to my own cowardice by cozening it a little i daresay you cannot read this as usual or reading it it will not mean anything to you but you will have served your purpose anyway thou still unravished bride of quietude thou wast happier in thy cage happier horace thought looking at the words he had written and in which as usual he was washing one womans linen in the house of another a thin breeze blew suddenly into the room there was locust upon it faintly sweet and beneath it the paper stirred upon the desk rousing him and suddenly as a man waking he looked at his watch and replaced it and wrote rapidly we are very glad to have little belle with us she likes it here there is a whole family of little girls near door stair steps of tow pigtails before whom it must be confessed that little belle preens just a little patronizes them children make all the difference in the world about a house too bad agents are not wise enough to supply rented houses with them particularly one like little belle so grave and shining and sort of irrelevantly and intensely mature you know but then you dont know her very well do you but we both are very glad to have her with us i believe that harry the pen ceased and still poised he sought the words that so rarely eluded him realizing as he did so that though one can lie about others with ready and extemporaneous promptitude to lie about oneself requires deliberation and a careful choice of expression then he glanced again at his watch and scratched that out and wrote belle sends love o serene and blotted it and folded it swiftly into an envelope and addressed and stamped it and rose and took his hat thou wast happier in thy cage happierthe corridor with its rubber mat and identical closed doors expensively and importantly discreet the stairway with its brassbound steps and at each turning a heavy brass receptacle in which cigarette butts and scraps of paper reposed upon tobaccostained sand all new all smelling of recent varnish there was afoyer of imitation oak and imitation marble the street in an untempered glare of spring sunlight the building too was new and an imitation of something else or maybe a skillful and even more durable imitation of that as was the whole town the very spirit the essence of which was crystallized in the courthouse buildingan edifice imposing as a theatre drop flamboyant and cheap and shoddy obviously built without any definite plan by men without honesty or taste it was a standing joke that it had cost and the people who had paid for it retailed the story without anger but on the contrary with a little frankly envious admiration ten years ago the town was a hamlet twelve miles from the railroad then a hardwood lumber concern had bought up the cypress swamps nearby and established a factory in the town it was financed by eastern capital and operated by as plausible and affable a set of brigands as ever stole a county they robbed the stockholders and the timber owners and one another and spent the money among the local merchants who promptly caught the enthusiasm and presently widows and orphans in new york and new england were buying stutz cars and imported caviar and silk dresses and diamond watches at three prices and the town bootleggers and the moonshiners in the adjacent swamps waxed rich and every fourth year the sheriffs office sold at public auction for the price of a hollywood bungalow people in the neighboring counties learned of all this and moved there and chopped all the trees down and built themselves mile after mile of identical frame houses with garage to match the very air smelled of affluence and burning gasoline yes there was money there how much no two estimates ever agreed whose at any one given time god himselfcould not have said but it was there like that afflatus of rank fecundity above a foul and stagnant pool on which bugs dart spawning die are replaced in middarting in the air in mens voices and gestures seemingly to be had for the taking that was why belle had chosen it but for the time being horace was utterly oblivious of its tarnished fury as he walked along the street toward the new ugly yellow station carrying his letter the words of which yet echoed derisively in his mind belle sends love belle sends love he had made acquaintances in spite of yourself belle told him harshly thinking you are better than other people yes he had answered yes with a weariness too spent to argue with its own sense of integrity but he had made a few some of whom he now passed was greeted replied merchants another lawyer his barber a young man who was trying to sell him an automobile naturally belle would belle sendslove belle sends he still carried his letter in his hand and glancing at the bulletin board on the station wall he saw that the train was a little late and he went on down the platform to where the mail car would stop and gave the letter to the mail carriera lank goosenecked man with a huge pistol strapped to his thigh thou wast happier the express agent came along dragging his truck in thy cage happier got another un today he asked greeting horace what horace said oh good afternoon got another un today the other repeated yes horace answered watching the other swing the truck skillfully into position beside the rails happier the sun was warm already there was something of summers rankness in ita quality which at home where among green and ancient treesand graver and more constant surroundings dwelt quietude and the souls annealment it had not even in july soon soon he said and again he went voyaging alone from where his body leaned against a strange wall in a brief hiatus of the new harsh compulsions it now suffered this will not last always i have made too little effort to change my fellow mans actions and beliefs to have won a place in anyones plan of infinity in thy cage happier the locomotive slid past rousing him he had not heard it and the cars on rasping wheels and from the door of the express car the cleric with a pencil stuck jauntily beneath his cap flipped his hand at him here you are professor he said handing down first to the agent a small wooden crate from which moisture dripped smelling a little stout today but the fish wont mind that will they horace approached his nostrils tightening a little the clerk in the car door was watching him with friendly curiosity say he asked what kind of city fish you got around here that have to have mailorder bait its shrimp horace explained shrimp the other repeated eat em yourself do you he asked with interest yesmywifesveryfondofthem well ill be damned the clerk said heartily ithought it was some kind of patent fishbait youwere getting every tuesday well every man to histaste i reckon but ill take steak myself all rightbud grab it horace signed the agents receipt and lifted the crate from the truck holding it carefully away from himself the smell invariably roused in him a faint but definite repulsion which he was not able to overcome though belle preferred shrimp above all foods and it always seemed to him for hours afterwardthat the smell clung about his clothing despite the fact that he knew better knew that he had carried the package well clear of himself he carried it so now his elbow againsthis side and his forearm at a slight tense angle with the dripping weight behind him the bell rang and with the bitten deep snorts of starting the train moved he looked back and saw the cars slide past gaining speed carrying his letter away and the quiet the intimacy the writing and the touching of it had brought him but day after tomorrow he could write again belle sends love belle sends ah well we all respond to strings and she would understand it and the necessity for it the dreadful need she in her serene aloofness partaking of gods belle sends the street from curb to curb was uptorn it was in the throes of being paved along it lines of negroes labored with pick and shovel swinging their tools in a languid rhythm steadily and with a lazy unhaste that seemed to spend itself in snatches of plaintive minor chanting punctuated by short grunting ejaculations which tied upon the sunny air and ebbed away from the languid rhythm of picks that struck not shovels that did not dig further up the street a huge misshapen machine like an antediluvian nightmare clattered and groaned it dominated the scene with its noisy and measured fury but against this as against a heroic frieze the negroes labored on their chanting and their motions more soporific than a measured tolling of faraway bells his arm was becoming numb but the first mark a water plugwhere he changed hands for the first time was still a hundred yards away and when he reached it and swapped the crate to the other hand his fingers were dead of all sensation and his biceps was jumping a little within his sleeve which goes toprove the fallacy of all theories of physical training according to that every succeeding tuesday he should be able to go a littlefurther without changing until by christmas he would be able to carry the package all the way home without changing hands and by christmas ten years all the way back to gulfport where they came from prize maybe more letters behind his name anyway cs carrier of shrimp h benbow ma lld cs thou wast happier the next mark was the corner where he turned and he went on along the treeless street between smug rows of houses identical one with another cheap frame houses patently new each with a garage and a car usually a car that cost as much again as the house did he reached the corner and changed hands again and turned into a smaller street trailing spaced drops of melting ice behind him he lived on this street and it was still open motors could run on it and he went on dripping his trailing moisture along the sidewalk with a motor car now he could have soon perhaps next year then things but naturally belle would miss her car after having had one always a new one every year harry and his passion for shiny wheels which some would call generosityyou lied to me you told me you had plenty of money lied lied took me away from my well it would be better now with little belle and harry would find who functioned in movie subtitles harshly what else do you want of mine my damn blood mans life no apparent explanation for it save as an opportunity for doing things hed spend the rest of it not being very proud of well she had her child again anyway he told himself thinking how women never forgive the men who permit them to do thethings which they later have any cause to regret and remembering that day when with little belles awkwardly packed suitcase in the rack overhead and little belle primly beside him in a state of demure and shining excitement at the prospect of moving suddenly to a new town he had shrank into his corner like a felon until the familiar station and that picture of harrys ugly dogged head and his eyes like those of a stricken ox were left behind he wondered if little belle too would someday but that last picture of harrys face had a way of returning its only injured vanity he argued with himself hes hurt in his own estimation because he couldnt keep the female he had chosen in the worlds sight but still his eyes and their patient bloodshot bewilderment to be exorcised somehow hes a fool anyway he told himself savagely and who has time to pity fools then he said god help us god help us all and then at last humor saved him and lie thought with a fine whimsical flash of it that probably belle would send him to harry next for a motor car mans very tragedies flout him he has invented a masque for tragedy given it the austerity which he believes the spectacle of himself warrants and the thing makes faces behind his back dead alone he is not ridiculous and even then only in his own eyes thou wast happier a voice piped with thin familiarity from beyond a fence it was little belle playing with the little girls next door to whom she had already divulged with thebland naiveté of children that horace was not her real daddy he was just the one that lived with them how because her real daddys name was daddy and he lived in another town it was a prettier town than this while the little girls listened with respect coldly concealed little belle had gained a sort of grudging cosmopolitanish glamor what with her uniquely diversified family at the next gate he paused and opened it and entered his rented lawn where his rented garage stared its empty door at him like an accusing eye and still carrying his package carefully away from him he went on between the two spindling poplars he had set out and approached his rented frame house with its yellow paint and its naked veranda knowing that from behind a shade somewhere belle was watching him in negligee the heavy mass of her hair caught up with studied carelessness and her hot suspicious eyesand the rich and sullen discontent of her mouth lied lied took me away from my husband what is to keep the wild bronze flame of her hair her injury yes inexcusable because of the utter lack of necessity or reason for it giving him nothing taking nothing away from him obscene yes obscene a deliberate breaking of the rhythm of things for no reason to both belle and himself an insult to narcissa in her home where her serenity lingered grave and constant and steadfast as a diffused and sourceless light it was an adolescent scribbling on the walls of a temple reason in itself confounded if what parts can so remaini didnt lie i told you did what she would not have had the cowardice to do what is to keep ay obscene if you will but there was about her a sort of gallantry like a swordsman who asks no quarter and gives none slays or is slain with a fine gesture or no gesture at all tragic and austere and fine with the wild bronze flame of her hair and he he not only hadnt made a good battle he hadnt even made a decent ghost thou wast happier in thy cage happier nor oceans and seas she had ghosts in her bed horace said mountingthe steps in january his aunt received a post card from bayard mailed at tampico a month later from mexico city a wire for money and that was the last intimation he gave that he contemplated being at any stated place long enough for a communication to reach him although from time to time he indicated by gaudy postals where he had been after the bleak and brutal way of him in april the card came from rio followed by an interval during which he seemed to have completely vanished and which miss jenny and narcissa passed quietly at home their days centered placidly about the expected child which miss jenny had already named john miss jenny felt that old bayard had somehow flouted them all had committed lese majesty toward his ancestors and the lusty glamor of the family doom by dying as she put it practically from the inside put thus he was in something like bad odor with her and asyoung bayard was in more or less suspense neither flesh nor fowl she fell to talking more and more of john soon after old bayards death in a sudden burst of rummaging and prowling which she called winter cleaning she had found among his mothers relics a miniature of john done by a new orleans painter when john and bayard were about eight miss jenny remembered that there had been one of each and it seemed to her that she could remember putting them both away together when their mother died but the other she could not find so she left simon to gather up the litter she had made and brought the miniature downstairs to where narcissa sat in the office and together they examined it the hair even at that early time was of a rich tawny shade and rather long i remember that first day miss jenny said when they came home from school bloody as hogs both of em from fighting other boys who said they looked like girls their mother washed em and petted em but they were so busy bragging to simon and bayard about the slaughter they had done to mind it much you ought to seen the otters johnny kept saying bayard blew up of course said it was a damn shame to send a boy out with curls down his back and finally he bullied the poor woman into agreeing to let simon barber em and do you know what neither of em would let his hair be touched it seems they hadnt licked all the enemy yet and they were going to make the whole school admit that they could wear hair down to their heels if they wanted to and i reckon they did because after two or three days there wasnt any more blood on em and then they let simon cut it off while their mother sat behind the piano in the parlor and cried and that was the last of it the face was a childs face and it was bayards too yet there was already in it not that bleak arrogance she had come to know in bayards but a sort of frank spontaneity warm and ready and generous and as narcissa held the mall oval in her hand while the steady blue eyes looked quietly back at her and from the whole face among its tawny curls with its smooth skin and childs mouth there shone like a serene radiance something sweet and merry and wild she realized as she never had before the blind tragedy of human events and while she sat motionless with the medallion in her hand and miss jenny thought she was looking at it she was cherishing the child under her own heart with all the aroused constancy of her nature it was as though already shecould discern the dark silver shape of that doomwhich she had incurred standing beside her chairwaiting and biding its time no no she whisperedwith passionate protest surrounding her child withwave after wave of that strength which welledsoabundantly within her as the days accumulatedmanning the walls with invincible garrisons she waseven glad miss jenny had shown her the thing she was now forewarned as well as forearmed meanwhile miss jenny continued to talk about the child as johnny and to recall anecdotes of that other johns childhood until at last narcissa realized that miss jenny was getting the two confused and with a sort of shock she knew that miss jenny was getting old that at last even her indomitable old heart was growing a little tired it was a shock for she had never associated senility with miss jenny who was so spare and erect and brusque and uncompromising and kind looking after the place which was not hers and to which she had been transplanted when her own alien roots in a faraway place where customs and manners and even the very climate were different had been severedviolently running it with tireless efficiency and with the assistance of only a doddering old negro as irresponsible as a child but run the place she did just as though old bayard and young bayard were there but at night when they sat before tie fire in the office as the year drew on and the night air drifted in heavy again with locust and with the song of mockingbirds and with all the renewed and timeless mischief of spring and at last even miss jenny admitted that they no longer needed a fire when at these times she talked narcissa noticed that she no longer talked of her far off girlhood and of jeb stuart with his crimson sash and his garlanded bay and his mandolin but always of atime no further back than bayards and johns childhood as though her life were closing not into the future but out of the past like a spool being rewound and as she would sit serene again behind her forewarned and forearmed bastions listening she admired more than ever that indomitable spirit which born with a womans body into a heritage of rash and heedless men and seemingly for the sole purpose of cherishing those men to their early and violent ends and this over a period of history which had seen brothers and husband slain in the same useless mischancing of human affairs had seen the foundations of her life vanish as in a nightmare not to be healed by either waking or sleep from the soil where her forbears slept trusting in the integrity of mankind and had had her own roots torn bodily and violently from that soila period at which the men themselves for all their headlong and scornful rashness would have quailed had their parts been passive parts and their doom been waiting and she thought how much finer that gallantry which never lowered lance to foes no sword could ever find that uncomplaining steadfastness of those unsung ay unwept too women than the fustian and useless glamor of the men that theirs was hidden by and now she is trying to make me one of them to make of my child just another rocket to glare for a moment in the shy then dieaway but she was serene again and her days centered more and more as thetime drew nearer and miss jennys voice was only a sound comforting but without significance each week she got a whimsical gallantly humorous letter from horace these she read too with serene detachmentwhat she could decipher that is she had always found horaceswriting difficult and parts that she could decipher meant nothing brit she knew that he expected that then it was definitely spring again miss jennys and isoms annual vernal altercation began continued its violent but harmless course in the garden they brought the tulip bulbs up from the cellar and set them out narcissa helping and spaded up the other beds and unswaddled the roses and the transplanted jasmine narcissadrove into town saw the first jonquils on the now deserted lawn blooming as though she and horace were still there and later the narcissi but when the gladioli bloomed she was not going out any more save in the late afternoon or early evening when she and miss jenny walked in the garden among burgeoning bloom and mockingbirds and belated thrushes where the long avenues of gloaming sunlight reluctant leaned miss jenny still talking about johnny confusing the unborn with the dead late in may they received a request for money from bayard in san francisco where he had at last succeeded in being robbed miss jenny sent it you come on home she wired him not telling narcissa hell come home now she did tell her you see if he dont if for nothing else than to worry us for a while but a week later fie still had not come home and miss jenny wired him again a night letter to the former address but when the wire was dispatched he was in chicago and when it reached san francisco he was sitting among saxophones and painted ladies and middleaged husbands at a table littered with soiled glasses and stained with cigarette ash and spilt liquor accompanied by a girl and two men one of the men wore whipcord with an army pilots silverwings on his breast the other was a stocky man in shabby serge with gray temples and intense visionary eyes the girl was a slim long thing mostly legs apparently with a bold red mouth and cold eyes in an ultrasmart dancing frock and when tile other two men crossed the room and spoke to bayard she was cajoling him to drink with thinly concealed insistence she and the aviator now danced together and from time to time she looked back to where bayard sat drinking steadily while the shabby man talked to him she was saying fm scared of him the shabby man was talking with leashed excitability using two napkins folded lengthwise into narrow strips to illustrate something his voice hoarse and importunate against the meaningless pandemonium of the horns and drums for a while bayard had half listened staring at the man with his bleak chill eyesbut now he was watching something across the room letting the man talk on unminded he was drinking whisky and soda steadily with the bottle beside him his hand was steady enough but his face was dead white and he was quite drunk and looking across at him from time to time the girl was saying to her partner tin scared i tell you god i didnt know what to do when you and your friend came over promise you wont go and leave us you seared the aviator repeated in a jeering tone but he too glanced back at bayards bleak arrogant face i bet you dont even need a horse you dont know him the girl rejoined and she clutched his hand and struck her body shivering against his and though his arm tightened and his hand slid down her back a little it was under cover of the shuffling throng into which they were wedged and a little warily and he said quickly ease off sister hes looking this way i saw himknock two teeth out of an australian captain that just tried to speak to a girl he was with in a london joint two years ago they moved on until the band was across the room from them whatre you scared of hes not an indian he wont hurt you as long as you mind your step hes all right ive known him a long time in places where you had to be good believe me you dont know she repeated i the music crashed to a stop in the sudden silence the shabby mans voice rose from the nearby table could just get one of these damn yellowlivered pilots to his voice was drowned again in a surge of noise drunken voices and shrill womanlaughter and scraping chairs but as they approached the table the shabby man still talked with leashed insistent gestures while bayard stared across the room at whatever it was he watched raising his glass steadily to his mouth the girl clutched her partners arm youve got to help me pass him out she begged swiftly im scared to leave with him i tell you pass sartoris out the man dont wear hair nor the woman either run back to kindergarten sister then struck with her sincerity he said say whats he done anyway i dont know hell do anything he threw an empty bottle at a traffic cop as we were driving out here youve got hush it he said the shabby man ceased and raised his face impatiently bayard still gazed across the room brotherinlaw over there he said speaking slowly and carefully dont speak to family mad at us they turned and looked where the aviator asked then he beckoned a waiter here jack man with diamond headlight bayard said brave man cant speak to him though might hit me friendwith him anyway the aviator looked again looks like his grandmother he said he called the waiter again then to the girl another cocktail he picked up the bottle and filled his glass and reached it over and filled bayards and turned to the shabby man wheres yours the shabby man waved it impatiently aside look he picked up the napkins again dihedral increases in ratio to air speed up to a certain point now what i want to find out tell it to the marines buddy the aviator interrupted i heard a couple of years ago they got a airyplane here waiter bayard was watching the shabby man bleakly you arent drinking the girl said she touched the aviator beneath the table no bayard agreedwhy dont you fly his coffin for him monaghan me the aviator set his glass down like hell my leave comes due next month he raised the glass again heres to windup he said and no heeltaps yes bayard agreed not touching his glass his face was pale and rigid a metal mask again i tell you theres no danger at all as long as you keep the speed below the point ill give you the shabby man said ive tested the wings with weights and proved the lift and checked all my figures all you have to do wont you drink with us the girl insisted sure he will the aviator said say you remember that night in amiens when that big irish devil comyn wrecked the clocheclos by blowing thatapms whistle at the door the shabby man sat smoothing the folded napkins on the table before him then he burst forth again his voice hoarse and mad with the intensity of his frustrated dream ive worked and slaved and begged and borrowed and now when ive got the machine and a government inspector i cant get a test because you damn yellowlivered pilots wont take it up a service full of you drawing flying pay for sitting in twostory dancehalls swilling alcohol you overseas pilots talking about your guts no wonder you couldnt keep the germans from shut up bayard told him without heat in his bleak careful voice youre not drinking the girl repeated wont you she raised his glass and touched her lips to it and extended it to him taking it he grasped her hand too and held her so but again he was staring across the room not brotherinlaw he said husbandinlaw no wifes brothers husbandinlaw wife used to be wifes brothers girl married now fat woman hes lucky whatre you talking about the aviator demanded come on lets have a drink the girl was taut at her arms length with the other hand she raised her glass and she smiled at him with brief and terrified coquetry but he held her wrist in his hard fingers and while she stared at him widely he drew her steadily toward him turn me loose she whispered dont and she set her glass down and with the other hand she tried to unclasp his fingers the shabby man was brooding over his folded napkins the aviator was carefully occupied with his drink dont she whispered again her body was wrung in her chair and she put her otherhand out quickly lest she be dragged out of it and for a moment they stared at one anothershe with wide and mute terror he bleakly with the cruel cold mask of his face then he released her and rose and kicked his chair away come on you he said to the shabby man he drew a wad of bills from his pocket and laid one beside her on the table thatll get you home he said but she sat nursing the wrist he had held watching him without a sound the aviator was discreetly interested in the bottom of his glass come on bayard repeated and he stalked steadily on the shabby man rose and followed rapidly in a small alcove harry mitchell sat on his table too were bottles and glasses and he now sat slumped in his chair his eyesclosed and his bald head in the glow of an electric candle was dewed with rosy perspiration beside him sat a woman who turned and looked full at bayard with an expression of harried desperation above them stood a waiter with a head like that of a priest and as bayard passed he saw that the diamond was missing from harrys tie and he heard their bitter suppressed voices as their hands struggled over something on the table between them behind the discreet shelter of their backs and as he and his companion reached the door the womans voice rose with a burst of filthy rage into a shrill hysterical scream cut sharply off as if someone had clapped a hand over her mouth the next day miss jenny drove in to town and wired him again but when this wire was dispatched bayard was sitting in an aeroplane on the tarmac of the government field at dayton while the shabby man hovered and darted hysterically about and a group ofarmy pilots stood nearby politely noncommittal the machine looked like any other biplane save that there were no viable cables between the planes which were braced from within by wires on a system of tension springs and hence motionless on the ground dihedral was negative the theory was that while in level flight dihedral would be eliminated for the sake of speed as in the spad type and when the machine was banked side pressure would automatically increase dihedral for maneuverability the cockpit was set well back toward the fin so you can see the wings when they buckle the man who loaned him a helmet and goggles said drily its an old pair he added but bayard only glanced at him bleakly humorless look here sartoris the man added let that crate alone these birds show up here every week with something that will revolutionize flying some new kind of mantrap that flies fineon paper if the co wont give him a pilot and you know we try anything here that has a prop on it you can gamble its a washout but bayard took the helmet and goggles and went on across the aerodrome toward the hangar the group followed him and stood quietly about with their bleak windgnawed faces while the engine was being warmed up but when bayard got in and settled his goggles the man approached and thrust his hand into bayards lap here he said brusquely take this it was a womans garter and bayard picked it up and returned it i wont need it he said thanks just the same well you know your own business of course but if you ever let her get her nose down youll lose everything but the wheels i know bayard answered ill keep her upthe shabby man rushed up again still talking yesyes bayard replied impatiently you told me allthat contact he snapped the mechanic spun thepropeller over and as the machine moved out theshabby man still clung to the cockpit and shouted athim soon he was running to keep up and still shouting until bayard lifted his hand off the cowling andopened the throttle but when he reached the end ofthe field and turned back into the wind the man wasrunning toward him and waving his arms bayard opened the throttle full and the machine lurched for ward and when he passed the shabby man in midfielddie tail was high and the plane rushed on in longbounds and he had a fleeting glimpse of the mansopen mouth and his wild arms as the boundingceased there was not enough tension on the wires he decided at once watching them from the v strut out as they tipped and swayed and he jockeyed the thing carefully on gaining height also he realized that there was a certain point beyond which his own speed would rob him of lifting surface he had about two thousand feet now and he turned and in doing so he found that aileron pressure utterly negatived the inner planes dihedral and doubled the outer one and he found himself in the wildest skid he had seen since his hun days the machine not only skidded it flung its tail up like a diving whale and the air speed indicator leaped thirty miles past the dead line the inventor had given him he was headed back toward the field now in a shallow diveand he pulled the stick back but only the wingtips responded by tipping sharply upward he flung the stick forward before they ripped completely off and he knew that only the speed of the dive kept him from falling like an inside out umbrella and the speed was increasing itseemed an eternity before the wingtips recovered and already he had overshot the field under a thousand feet high he pulled the stick back again again the wingtips buckled and he slapped the stick over and kicked again into that skid trying to check his speed again the machine swung its tail in a soaring arc but this time the wings came off and he ducked his head automatically as one of them slapped viciously past it and crashed into the tail shearing it too away that day narcissas child was born and the following day simon drove miss jenny in to town and set her down before the telegraph office and held the horses leashed and champing with gallant restiveness by a slight and surreptitious tightening of the reins while beneath the tilted tophat and the voluminous duster he swaggered sitting down though he was sitting and you would not have thought it possible simon contrived by some means to actually strut so dr peabody found him when he came along the street in the june sunlight in his slovenly alpaca coat carrying a newspaper you look like a frog simon he said wheres miss jenny yessuh simon agreed yessuh deys swellin en rejoicin now de little marster donearrive yessuh de little marster done arrive and de ole times comin back wheres miss jennydr peabody repeated impatiently she in dar tellygraftin dat boy ter come on back byer whar he belong atdr peabody turned awayand simon watched him a little fretted at his apathy in the face of the event takes it jes like trash simon mused aloud with annoyed disparagement nummine we gwine wake um all up now yessuh de olden times comin back again sho like in marse johns time when de cunnel wuz de young marster en de niggers fum de quawtuhs gethered on de front lawn wishin mistis en de little marster well and he watched dr feabody enter the door and through the plate glass window he saw him approach miss jenny as she stood at the counter with her message come home you fool and see your family or i will have you arrested the message read in her firm lucid script its more than ten words she told the operator but that dont matter this time hell come now you watch or ill send the sheriff after him sure as his names sartoris yes maam the operator said he was apparently having trouble reading it and he looked up after a time and was about to speak when miss jenny remarked his distraction and repeated the message briskly and make it stronger than that if you want to she added yes maam the operator said again and he ducked down behind his desk and presently and with a little mounting curiosity and impatience miss jenny leaned across the counter with a silver dollar in her fingers and watched him count the words three times in a sort of painful flurry whats the matter young man she demanded the government dont forbid the mentioning of a dayold child in a telegram does it the operator looked up yes maam its all right he said at last and she gave him the dollar and as he sat holding it and miss jenny watched himwith yet more impatiencedr peabody came in and touched her arm come away jenny he said good morning she said taming at his voice well ifs about time you took notice this is the first sartoris youve been a day late on in how many years loosh and soonsi get that fool boy home itll be like old times again as simon says yes simon told me come away let me get my change she turned to the operator who stood with the yellow sheet in one hand and the coin in the other well young man aint a dollar enough yes maam he repeated turning upon dr peabody his dumb distracted eyes dr peabody reached fatly andtook the message and the coin from him come away jenny he said again miss jenny stood motionless for a moment in her black silk dress and her black bonnet set squarely on her head staring at him with her piercing old eyes that saw so much and so truly thensheturned and walked steadily to the door and stepped into the street and waited until he joined her and her hand was steady too as she took the folded paper he offered mississippi boy it said in discreet capitals and she returned it to him immediately and from her waist she took a small sheer handkerchief and wiped her fingers lightly i dont have to read it she said they never get into the papers but one way and i know that he was somewhere he had no business being doing something that wasnt any affair of his yesdr peabody said he followed her to the carriage and put his hands clumsily upon her as she mounted dont paw me loosh she snapped im not acripple but he supported her elbow with his huge gentle hand until she was seated then he stood with his hat off while simon laid the linen robe across her knees here he said and extended her the silver dollar and she returned it to her bag and clicked it shut and wiped her fingers again on her handkerchief well she said thank god thats the last one for a while anyway home simon simon sat with leashed magnificence but under the occasion he unbent a little when you gwine come out en see de young marster doctuh soon simon he answered and simon clucked to the horses and wheeled away with a flourish his hat tilted and the whip caught smartly back dr peabody stood in the street a shapeless hogshead of a man in a shabby alpaca coat his hat in one hand and the folded newspaper and the yellow unsent message in the other until miss jennys straight slender back and the squarely indomitable angle of her bonnet had passed from sight but that was not the last one one morning a week later simon was found in a negro cabin in town with his grizzled head crushed ir by a blunt instrument anonymously wielded in whose house miss jenny demanded into the telephone in that of a woman named meloney harris the voice told her meloneymelbelle mitchells face flashed before her and she remembered the mulatto girl whose smart apron and cap and lean shining shanks had lent such an air to belles parties and who had quit belle in order to set up a beauty parlor miss jenny thanked the voice and hung up the receiver the old grayheaded reprobate she said and she went into the office and sat down so thats what became of that church money he put out i wondered she sat stiffly and uncompromisingly erect in her chair her hands idle on her lap well that is the last one of em she said but no he was hardly a sartoris he had at least had some shadow of a reason while the others i think miss jenny said who had not spent a day in bed since she was forty years old that ill be sick for a while and she did just exactly that went to bed where she lay propped on pillows in a frivolous lace cap and would permit no doctor to see her save dr peabody who called once informally and who sat sheepishly andmountainously for thirty minutes while miss jenny vented her invalids spleen and the recurred anger of the salve fiasco upon him and here she held daily councils with isom and elnora and at the most unexpected times she would storm with unimpaired vigor from her window at isom or caspey in the yard beneath the child and the placid gaily turbaned mountain who superintended his hours spent most of the day in this room and presently narcissa herself and the three of them would sit for rapt murmurous hours in a sort of choral debauch of abnegation while the object of it slept digesting waked stoked himself anew and slept again hes a sartoris all right miss jenny said but an improved model he hasnt got that wild look of em i believe it was the name bayard we did well to name him johnny yes narcissi said watching her sleeping son with grave and tranquil serenity and there miss jenny staid until her while was up three weeks it was she set the date before she went to bed and held to it stubbornly refusing even to rise and attend the christening that day fell on sunday it was late in june and jasmine drifted into the house in steady waves narcissa and the nurse in an even more gaudy turban had brought the baby bathed and garnished and scented in his ceremonial robes in to her and later she heard them drive away and the house was still again the curtains stirred peacefully at the windows and all the peaceful scents of summer came up on the sunny breeze and soundsbirds and somewhere a sabbath bell and elnoras voice chastened a little with her recent bereavement but still rich and mellow as she went about getting dinner she sang sadly and endlessly and without words as she moved about the kitchen but she broke off short when she looked up and saw miss jenny looking a little frail but fully dressed and erect as ever in the door miss jenny whut in de worl you git on back to yo bed here and elnora crossed the kitchen but miss jenny came firmly on wheres isom she demanded he atde barn you come on back to bed im gwine tell miss narcissa on you im tired staying in the house miss jenny stated im going to town call isom elnora protested still but miss jenny insisted coldly and elnora called isom from the door and returned still portentous with pessimistic warnings and presently isom entered here miss jenny said handing him the keys get the car out isom departed and miss jenny followed more slowly and elnora would have followed too solicitous but miss jenny drove her back to herkitchen and unassisted she crossed the yard and got in beside isohl and you drive this thing careful boy she told him or ill get over there and do it myself when they reached town from slender spires rising among trees against the puffy summer clouds church bells rang lazily upon the ebbing reaches of the sunny air but at the edge of town miss jenny bade isom turn into a narrow lane and they followed this and stopped presently before the iron gates to the cemetery i want to see if they fixed simon all right she explained im not going to church today ive been shut up between walls long enough just from the prospect she got a mild exhilaration like that of a small boy playing out of school the negro ground lay beyond the cemetery proper and its orderly plots and isom led her to simons grave simons burying society had taken care of him and after two weeks the mound was still heaped with floral designs from which the blooms had fallen leaving a rank lean mass of stems and peacefully rusting wire skeletons elnora someone bad also been before her and the grave was bordered with tedious rows of broken gaudy bits of crockery and of colored glass i reckon hell have to have a headstone too miss jenny said aloud and turning saw isom hauling his overalled legs into a tree about which two catbirds whirled and darted in scolding circles you isom yessum isom answered and he dropped to the ground and the birds threatened him with a final burst of hysterical profanity and followed her they went on and into the white folks section and passed now between marble shapes bearing names that she knew well and dates in a stark and peaceful simplicity in the impervious stone now and then they weresurmounted by symbolical urns and doves and surrounded by dipped tended sward green against the blanched marble and the blue dappled sky and the black cedars from among which doves crooned endlessly reiterant here and there bright unfaded flowers lay in random bursts against the pattern of green and white and presently john sartoris lifted his stone back and his fulsome gesture amid a clump of cedars beyond which the bluff sheered sharply away into the valley bayards grave too was a shapeless mass of withered flowers and miss jenny had isom clear them off and carry them away the masons were just beginning to lay the curbing around it and the headstone itself sat nearby beneath a canvas cover she lifted the cover and read the clean new lettering bayard sartoris march june that was better simple no sartoris man to invent bombast to put on it cant lie dead in the ground without strutting and swaggering beside the grave was a second headstone like the other save for the inscription but the sartoris touch was there despite the fact that there was no grave to accompany it and the whole thing was like a boastful voice in an empty church yet withal there was something else as though the merry wild spirit of him who had laughed away so much of his heritage of humorless and fustian vainglory managed somehow even yet to soften the arrogant gesture with which they had said farewell lieut john sartoris raf killed in action july i bare him on eagles wings and brought him unto me a faint breeze soughed in the cedars like a long sigh and the branches moved gravely in it across the spaced tranquility of the marble shapes the doves crooned their endless rising inflections isom retained for another armful of withered flowers and bore it away old bayards headstone was simple too having been born as he had too late for one war and too soon for the next one and she thought what a joke they had played on him denying him opportunities for swashbuckling and then denying him the privilege of being buried by men who would have invented vainglory for him the cedars had almost overgrown his son johns and johns wifes graves sunlight reached them only in fitful splashes dappling the weathered stone with brief stipplings only with difficulty could the inscription have been deciphered but she knew what it would be what with the virus the inspiration and the example of that one which dominated them all which gave to the whole place in which weary people were supposed to rest a hushed orotund solemnity having no more to do with mortality than the bindings of books have to do with that of the characters and beneath which the headstones of the wives whom they had dragged into their arrogant orbits were despite their pompous genealogical references modest and effacing as the song of thrushes beneath the eyrie of an eagle he stood on a stone pedestal in his frock coat and bareheaded one leg slightly advanced and one hand resting lightly on the stone pylon beside him his head was lifted a little in that gesture of haughty arrogance which repeated itself generation after generation with a fateful fidelity his back to the world and his carven eyes gazing out across the valley where hisrailroad ran and beyond it to the blue changeless hills and beyond that the pedestal and effigy were mottled with sessions of rain and sun and with drippings from the cedar branches and the bold carving of the letters was bleared with mold yet easily decipherable colonel john sartoris csa soldier statesman citizen of the world for marts enlightenment he lived by mans ingratitude he died pause here son of sorrow remember death this inscription had caused some furor on the part of the slayers family and a formal protest followed but in complying with opinion old bayard had his revenge he caused the line by mans ingratitude he died to be chiseled crudely out and added beneath it fell at the hand of redlaw aug miss jenny stood for a time musing a slender erect figure in black silk and a small uncompromising black bonnet the wind drew among the cedars in long sighs and steadily as pulses the sad hopeless reiteration of the doves came along the sunny air isom returned for the last armful of dead flowers and looking out across the marble vistas where shadows of noon moved she watched a group of children playing quietly and a little stiffly in their bright sunday finery among the tranquil dead well it was the last one at last gathered in solemn conclave about the dying reverberation of their arrogant lusts their dust moldering quietly beneath the pagan symbols oftheir vainglory and the carven gestures of it in enduring stone and she remembered something narcissa had said once about a world without men and wondered if therein lay peaceful avenues and dwellings thatched with quiet and she didnt know isom returned and as she turned away dr peabody called her name he was dressed as usual in his shabby broadcloth trousers and his shiny alpaca coat and a floppy panama hat and his son was with him well boy miss jenny said giving young loosh her hand his face was bigboned and roughly molded he had a thatch of straight stiff black hair and his eyes were steady and brown and his mouth was large and in all his ugly face there was reliability and gentleness and humor he was rawboned and he wore his clothing awkwardly and his hands were large and bony and with them he performed delicate surgical operations with the deftness of a hunter skinning a squirrel and the celerity of a prestidigitator he lived in new york where he was associated with a surgeon whose name was a household word and once a year and sometimes twice he rode thirtysix hours on the train spent twenty hours with his father which they passed walking about the town or riding over the countryside in the sagging buckboard all day and sitting on the veranda or before the fire all the following night took the train again and ninetytwo hours later was at his clinic again he was thirty years old only child of the woman dr peabody had courted for fourteen years before he was able to marry her the courtship was during the days when he physicked and amputated the whole county by buckboard often after a years separation he would drive thirty miles to see her to be met on the way and deflected to a childbed or a mangledlimb with only a scribbled message to assuage the interval of another year so youre home again are you miss jenny asked yes maam and find you as spry and handsome as ever jennys too badtempered to ever do anything but dry up and blow awaydr peabody said youll remember i never let you wait on me when im not well she retorted i reckon youll be tearing off again on thenext train wont you she asked young loosh yessum im afraid so my vacation hasnt comedue yet well at this rate youll spend it at an old mens home

em besides ill have to spend this afternoon fishing he added yes his father put in and choppin up good fish with a pocket knife just to see what makes em go lemme tell you what he did this mawnin he grabbed that old lame hound of abes and operated on its shoulder so quick that abe not only didnt know what he was doing but even the dawg didnt only you forgot to look for his soul he added you dont know if he hasnt got one young loosh said unruffled dr straud is trying to find the soul by electricity he says fiddlesticksmiss jenny snapped you better get a jar of will falls salve and give it to him loosh well she glanced at the sun id better be going if you wont come out to dinner thank youmaam young loosh answered his father said i brought him in to show him that collection of yours we didnt know we looked that underfed help yourself miss jenny answered she went on and they stood and watched her trim back until it passed from view and now theres another one young loosh said musingly another one to grow up and keep his folks in a stew until he finally succeeds in doing what they all expect of him well maybe that benbow blood will sort of hold him down theyre quiet folks that girl and horace sort ofand just women to raise him dr peabody grunted hes got sartoris blood in him too all of narcissis instincts had been antipathetic to him his idea was a threat and his presence a violation of the very depths of her nature in the headlong violence of him she had been like a lily in a gale which rocked it to its roots in a sort of vacuum without any actual layingon of hands and now the gale had gone on the lily had forgotten it as its fury died away into fading vibrations of old terrors and dreads and the stalk recovered and the bell itself was untarnished save by the friction of its own petals the gale is gone and though the lily is sad a little with vibrations of ancient fears it is not sorry miss jenny had arrived home looking a little spent and narcissa had scolded her and at last prevailed on her to lie down after dinner and here she had dozed while the drowsy afternoon wore away and waked to lengthening shadows and a sound of piano keys touched softly from downstairs ive slept all afternoon she told herself rising in narcissas room the child slept in his crib beside him the nursedozed placidly miss jenny tiptoed out and descended the stairs and drew her chair out from behind the piano narcissa ceased do you fed restednarcissa asked you shouldnt have done that fiddlesticks miss jenny said it always does me good to see all those fool pompous men lying there with their marble mottoes and things thank the lord none of them will have a chance at me i reckon the lord knows his business but i declare sometimes play somethingnarcissa obeyed playing softly and miss jenny sat listening for a while but presently she began to talk of the child narcissa played quietly on her white dress with itsv black ribbon at the waist vaguely luminous in the gloom jasmine drifted steadily in and miss jenny talked on about little johnny narcissa played with rapt inattention as though she were not listening then without ceasing and without turning her head she said he isnt john hes benbow sartoris what his name is benbow sartoris she repeated miss jenny sat quite still for a moment twilight thickened slowly about them narcissas dress was pale as wax in the next room elnora moved about laying the table for supper and do you think thatll do any good miss jenny demanded do you think you can change one of em with a name the music went on in the dusk the dusk was peopled with ghosts of glamorous and old disastrous things and if they were just glamorous enough there would be a sartoris in them and then they were sure to be disastrous pawns but the player and the game he playswho knows he must have a name for his pawns though but perhaps sartoris isthe name of the game itselfa game outmoded and played with pawns shaped too late and to an old dead pattern and of which the player himself is a little wearied for there is death in the sound of it and a glamorous fatality like silver pennons downrushing at sunset or a dying fall of horns along the road to roncevaux do you think miss jenny insisted that because his name is benbow hell be any less a sartoris and a scoundrel and a fool narcissa played on as though she were not listening then she turned her head and without ceasing her hands she smiled at miss jenny quietly a little dreamily with serene fond detachment beyond miss jennys trim fading head the window curtains hung motionless
