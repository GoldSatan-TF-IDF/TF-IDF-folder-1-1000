joseph kanon stardust a man rides into town as it happened sol lasner was also on the train ben spied him first on the red carpet at grand central posing for photographers like one of his stars shorter than ben remembered his barrel chest wobbling on thin legs storklike but with the same tailored look natty he gave a quick obligatory smile to the flashbulbs then herded a group of men in suits onto the train back to business at croton where they switched over to the steam engine most of the suits got off for the ride back to the city but two stayed on through dinner so ben didnt have a chance to talk to him until they were past albany when the landscape had already turned dark and there was nothing to observe from the observation car but blurs of street lamps and platform lights streaking past hed been sitting near the rounded back of the car smoking and staring out at nothing when lasner came in holding a cigar he nodded to ben not recognizing him and for a moment ben was tempted to let it wait talk later on the armys time the next few days were supposed to be his little shrouds of time to wrap himself up in prepare for the funeral stare out windows get used to it the longdistance call to dannys wife has taken hours to put through her voice scratchy with bad connections or grief what kind of accident a fall its in the papers as an accident you know anyone can fall so they put it in that way but it wasnt ben had asked disconcerted feeling his way listening to the precious seconds tick by look shed said finally you should know youre his only family but then went quiet again you mean he tried to take his life take his life shed said confusing him until he realized that it was a translation problem an idiom she hadnt picked up hans ostermanns daughter tried to kill himself he said yes she said reluctantly then drew a breath moving past it but they didnt want to say you know what its like here everything for the good name nothing bad ever happens its better if its an accident in the papers so i said it too there was a snort of air like a shrug over the phone but his brother you have a right rambling on making no sense to him now or maybe he had just stopped listening his head dizzy with it not a crash a virus some act of fate but something willed a scream of unhappiness im sorry for this news shed said before he could ask more is it possible for you to come now hes in a coma so still alive i dont know how long they dont expectso if you could come and then the reserved time was running out and instead of questions there were logistics and plans but what answers could anyone have something that only made sense to danny the most private act there was to his surprise there had been no problem having the army move up the trip the problem was getting there with the trains the way they were then something last minute opened up on the chief if he was willing to sleep sitting up on the century to meet it so hed packed a duffel sent the wire and now found himself riding with sol lasner who could waitthe armys assignmentwhile he took his personal leave brooding days to think about it all the way to california meanwhile lasner was lighting the cigar looking out the window and then at his watch checking some invisible schedule any idea where we are just past schenectady lasner drew on the cigar looking out again upstate he said goldwyns from here gloversville they made gloves thats what he was a glove man well why not just talking to himself not really expecting a reply but suddenly ben took the opening anyway the meeting had fallen into his lap personal leave or not mr lasner lasner turned peering at him sorry you probably dont remember we met last month overseas on the army trip ben collier he held out his hand i was one of the liaison officers translator lasner took his hand looking closely still trying to place him the guy with the rooms right the one got eddie mannix the ritz in paris ben smiled and zanuck and balaban colonel mitchell arranged it he figured theyd want the ritz kind of people used to it i got news for you lasner said pointing with the cigar you think harry cohns used to the ritz some hotsheet place down on flowerthats what hes used to he shook his head i still dont know what that trip was a stunt army puts a bunch of us in uniform takes us around what did they get out of it what did they harry cohn played poker in his suite ignoring paris everywhere the jockeying for the best hotel rooms the special transports ben remembered the winding road up to berchtesgaden lined with jeeps a new tourist attraction gis hunting for souvenirs while the executives stood at hitlers vast picture window little tyrants finally humbled a ride on hitlers yacht hamburg where people had melted into the pavement during the firebombing the camps even worse a few survivors still there too emaciated and stunned to be moved in town packs of children foraging how much had they seen from their requisitioned rooms it was ikes idea thinks people should see it what happened so the state department sends groups over that was the studio tour there was another for the newsreel editors see what its like at the ritz and dachau for a moment there was no sound but the click of wheels beneath them i was there ben said quietly watching lasner stagger against a building his face in his hands sobbing i know it made an impression on you lasner rounded his cigar in the standup tray smoothing off the ash were making a picture about it whos making im in the signal corps we shot film there what the newsreels didnt you personally no i collect the film see its put together for briefings whether we can do something more information length maybe features if not v shorts depending on the footage what you do in a way produce lasner waved his hand and now youre out of a job not yet the battle of san pietro got a lot of play and the tokyo film did okay on general release so the exhibitors are still interested and theres ikes film coming whos releasing lasner said quickly columbia lasner grunted you know how it works war activities committeefreeman at paramountassigns the pictures on a rotating basis all the majors it was columbias turn the majors what am i they still think continentals a poverty row shop next year well outgross rko but me they give the training films you know what it costs me we get four to five thousand a reel but we throw in the production the overhead the salaries for chrissake add it up its more like seven thousand a reel and we just eat the difference he tapped the cigar again calmer not that i mind you know for the war but you dont hear freeman calling me with a feature either he will be lasner glanced up at him whats this a pitch ben leaned forward were sitting on a ton of footage theyre setting up trials this is what theyre all about people need to see this we want to work with a studio to put it together lasner shook his head let columbia do it you think people want to see this nobody wants to see this they should should you know freeman asks it doesnt mean we have to do it these war filmsits all strictly voluntary and now after the war nobodys going to make this picture i thought youd want to lasner looked at him for a long minute then sighed let me tell you something nobody needs a picture about killing jews what else have they been doing since forever not like this ben said quietly so that lasner busied himself putting the cigar out avoiding him wonderful he said finally cohn gets eisenhower and i getill think about it let freeman call well see a dodge ill be at the signal corps base in culver city a local call fort roach he caught bens look hal roachs old studio the army took it over theyve got some of my people down there drafted my best cutter splicing film on vd how does your prick look with crabs talk about a waste of a good technician he glanced up you want to make the picture there fort roach no i want to make it at continental with you because we were such good pals in germany looking at things freeman said you were the first call to make you were there for the relief fund you hired refugees in forty you so back to the well he said the others think theyre republicans lasner snorted since when did frank get funny if i heard two cracks from him my whole life its a lot he shook his head then snorted again mayer keeps a picture of hoover in his office hoover and now with the horses a jew with horses so hes fooling everybody he paused dont push me on this well talk in an office we make a picture if it makes sense to make a picture not just someone tells me its good for the jews anyway what kind of name is collier ben smiled from kohler my father it means the same thing so why change it who changes names actors my mother after the divorce we went to england she wanted us to have english names my father stayed in germany stayed he was a mischling half and that saved him he thought it would lasner looked away im sorry so its personal with you thats no good you know in pictures you get things mixed up not personal that way i just want to get this done and get out of the army same as everybody lasner picked up the cigar again and lit it settling in whyd you pick the signal corps they picked me my father was in the business maybe they thought it got passed down like flat feet anyway i got listed with an mos for the signal corps whats mos military occupational specialty civilian skill the military can use which i didnt have but the army doesnt have to make sense they probably wanted guys with german but everybody did so they grabbed me with an mos and once youre assigned well at least it kept you out of combat until last winter then they needed german speakers with the field units so you saw some action the standard welcomeback question some the camera crews got the worst of it they had to work the front lines we lost a lot of them sometimes just yards away ed singer so glued to his lens that he never saw the shell that ripped his arm off just turned and looked down amazed to see blood gushing out ben scooting over to do what dam the blood with a wad of shirt a stump spraying blood as it moved even the camera covered with it ed looking at him frantic knowing until his eyes got calmer as shock set in then closed no longer there to watch his life run out i was lucky ben said the closest i came was in a plane when nothing was supposed to happen you see target berlin some of the night footage in that they told us the aas had been wiped out but they forgot to tell the germans our gunner was hit we get back the plane is full of holes he stopped embarrassed then took out a cigarette sorry what am i doing now telling war stories he inhaled then blew smoke up toward the round observation roof in this light oddly like the glass bubble of the lancaster the thing was i used to live there berlin so it was the enemy but also someplace you knew its a funny feeling bombing someplace you know you think what it must be like on the ground lasner stared at him for a minute saying nothing and thenwhat youre showing zanuck around europe in uniform he had it made you know that a tailor almost a wink a joke between them and for that they neededwhats it again an mos because your father was in pictures where germany uh huh ben said casually sorry now that he had brought it up he came here for a while years ago i was born here in fact california but he went back collier lasner said thumbing a mental file kohler then otto kohler he was a director the old hesitancy as if the name once his own would somehow brand him otto my god why didnt you say so wait a minute i thought his kid was already over hereat republic or some place we were going to do something with him once but then it didnt work out i forget why he stopped confused same name though as otto kohler my brother ben said about to say more and then the moment was gone why not tell him but why would lasner care something still private and somehow not real he changed it back kids pick sides in a divorce he was closer to my father moving away from it you knew him otto of course i knew him he worked for me you didnt know that he glanced at ben a slight suspicion we made two husbands you must have seen that ben spread his hands i was only that picture was a classic he didnt keep a print never mind ill run it for you you should see it the talent that man had lasner was off now waving his cigar to draw ben along with him he was the one that got away the ufa directors who came over the great ones he raised three fingers murnauwell he got away too that car crash lang weve still got and otto his trouble expensive sets he thought we were making intolerance he looked again at ben why didnt you tell me before now i know who you are he said leaning back and opening his jacket visibly relaxing ben smiled to himself an industry but still a family business he was ahead of his time with those sets you know lasner was saying but they were all like that the ufa people even the ones who came later you know why no westerns they never learned to shoot outside it was all controlled light with them of course they had the facilities in those days what they had in berlinim still knocking my brains out in gower gulch trying to borrow arc lamps and over there theyre making cities otto he said shaking his head i can see the resemblance now around the eyes i knew your mother too a looker so what happened they split you said another woman i guess thats what i heard my mother never talked about it well he was like that he always had an eye so thats why he stayed there some skirt i dont know he probably thought hed get through itthats what people thought then he was making pictures with monika hoppe goebbels liked her maybe he thought that would protect him theyd look the other way anyway they didnt he was arrested in thirtyeight they sent a notice to my mother this was when they still thought they had to explain it so lasner said looking away some story with everything ben remembered left out the good days in the big house on lutzowplatz the parties sometimes with just a piano but sometimes with a whole band the air full of perfume and smoke ben looking down through the banister faces even a child recognized hertzberg the comedian with the surprised round eyes jannings jowly and grave even with a glass in his hand and afterward sometimes the quarrelswere there women even then sunday mornings the room still smelling of stale ashtrays his father got them ready for their walk scarves in winter umbrellas if it rained but the walk without fail because thats what you did on sundays in berlin down budapesterstrasse to the zoo afterward a cake at kranzlers his father desperate by now for a drink later when they were too old for the zoo they would head straight for the cafes where his father met friends and danny tried to sneak cigarettes then a few years after that they were on a train for bremen an american woman with her two boys their father back on the platform at lehrter bahnhof they were meant to go home but stayed in london did his mother think otto would follow that it was somehow important to be near him at least on a map when it didnt matter anymore after the official letter she lacked the will to leave and they stayed longer by the time ben finally did get back to america to the army training camp he was grown up the accent they teased him about now was english so he lost that one too and then full circle the army wanted the old language of his boyhood they polished off the rust and it came back as fluent as memory bringing everything else with it even the smell of the cakes until finally the war took him to berlin and he saw that it was gone for goodkranzlers the zoo all of it just rubble and dust as insubstantial now as his father all ghosts then what lasner said an old hand at story conferences she remarried a woman like that no she died during the war he caught lasners expectant look and shook his head she got sick no drama a daily wearing away medicines to keep the retching down then a final exhaustion so now its just the brother lasner said suddenly sentimental let me tell you something stay close what else have we got family you trust blood dont be like he took a puff on the cigar moving farther away drifting into anecdote again look at harry warner jack makes him crazy screaming shouting sometimes theyre in the same room you dont even want to watch dont be like that but theyre still lasner shrugged who else would work with jack he is crazy you know i said to him once you hate him so much come work with me partners your name first i dont care at the time this is worth a fortune to him you know what he said you want that bastard to run my studio his studio so theyre stuck with each other till one of them keels over you put that kind of pressure here he said touching his heart and sooner or later they wheel you out on a stretcher well he stood up glancing at his watch again then out the window what i hate this time of night is you never know where you are he put his hand on bens shoulder an uncle remember what i said dont be like jack stay close and what was there to say to that danny had gone to california in using ottos name to get a second unit job at metro just to see what it was like and then the war had closed the door behind him eight thousand miles away so that all theyd had for years were sheets of blue tissue vmail danny playing parent keep safe out of combat their mothers health war news but still dannys voice the same wink in it stories he knew ben would like could pass on to his friends meeting lana turner going to hear the king cole trio you have to come out here the whole makebelieve world real when danny wrote about it the same kid sneaking cigarettes talking late at night from his bed across the room about what anything ben wrapped up in the sound of it he got up feeling lasners hand still on his shoulder dont forget to call freeman i dont forget anything lasner said peering at him ill tell you one thing i dont forget your father cost me a bundle so maybe id better watch outyoure an expensive family no sets this time ben said lasner nodded finally dropping his hand well talk where are you staying in chicago im just changing trains the chief thats seven fifteen that gives you what nine hours to kill everything measured and counted whatre you going to do for nine hours see chicago i guess lasner waved his hand youve seen it you need a place to rest up im at the ambassador east they get me a suite plenty of room he started to move toward the end of the car ottos kid you live long enough he turned he was shot thats what the letter said but who knows with the nazis the unspoken question a quick bullet or days of pain clubs and wires and screams years ago now anyway hes dead ben said so it doesnt matter lasner nodded no its just my age you think about the how he was silent for a minute then looked up you got a budget on this thing ben held up his hand checking items off his fingers hard costs the footage weve got prints i can req the raw stock from the war production board you do the prints and the soundan engineer for the track some bridge scoring somebody to do the narration american fonda maybe lasner shook his head use contract frank cabot fine all i need is a cutting room and a couple of hands we can do it either place but yours would be betterarmy studio someones always taking your equipment you provide the space i can get the hands from fort roach the stock would be an army expense ben said looking at him directly well make it for you if you put it out nobody makes pictures for me lasner said looking back the rhythm of negotiation at my studio he held bens eyes for another second then smiled you know if your father had been like you hed still be he looked away at a loss i mean ben said nothing waiting lasner held up a finger dont take advantage people dont forget that he lowered the hand a dismissal and walked away followed by his moving reflection on the glass roof well talk in the morning he said the words in a slipstream over his shoulder but when the train pulled into lasalle street it was the scene from grand central all over againlasner surrounded by hats tips given out telegrams handed over the group moving down the platform in a huddle ben followed behind not wanting to interrupt then lost him outside in the line of waiting taxis dearborn street where the chief would pull out was only a few blocks away but what would he do there he turned east instead past the murky bars and shadowy streets under the el light poking through the girders in latticework patches off the train things seemed to pass in a plodding slow motion nothing whizzed by the window he had all day he crossed michigan to the lakefront hoping for a breeze but the lake was flat a sheet of hot tin in the park dogs panted under bushes he thought of warner being wheeled out on a stretcher in lasners imagination but anyone could have an attack even someone as young as danny except he hadnt what had his life been like maybe the same pressure cooker the warners steamed in not the easy california you saw in magazines men in opennecked shirts did he look like that his wife would have pictures hans ostermanns daughter the only thing ben knew about her shed be at the hospital now waiting things out he got up from the park bench restless how could he not know dannys life ben had followed him everywhere just wanting to be part of things wild just like your father his mother had said meaning impulsive but he wasnt a letter every week staying in touch still taking care of him and now gone without even a note maybe he hadnt really meant to do it not at the very end a fall how did she know for sure it hadnt been like that he stopped in the street caught not just by the heat and the night of half sleep but a deeper weariness tired of thinking about it going round in circles on state street he saw an air cooled banner running along a marquee and went inside the picture was a betty grable on second run something with snow caesar romero danced charlotte greenwood did her split high kick right over her head betty was put out over some romantic mixup with john payne all of it so airy that it melted away as you saw it like touching beer foam the newsreel brought him back with a jolt europe in grainy black and white where hed been just two weeks ago people going through px garbage cans then war criminals passing sentences on themselves before the courts couldcyanide capsules for the privileged amateur nooses for the others not a botched accident a hollywood indulgence meaning it in the camps they threw themselves on electric fences you never asked why not over there he stood up desperate to move again outside there was everything hed been too preoccupied to notice before taxis buildings with glass stores no debris in the street doormen walking dogs the bar at the drake with silver dishes of nuts a country so rich it didnt even know its own luck where anyone could be happy at the station busy with redcaps pushing luggage carts he saw flashbulbs near the chief not lasner this time real stars paulette goddard carole landis two girls he didnt recognize all of them smiling holding up a bond drive poster as they perched on the compartment car steps other passengers stopped to watch youll never guess who was on the train they left at seven fifteen exactly sliding out so smoothly that it wasnt until they began clicking over the points in the yard that ben looked up to see they were moving past sidetracked box cars then clotheslines and coal sheds and scrap metal yards the backside of the city until finally the open country of the prairie another day before they saw mountains los angeles monday morning half a continent in under forty hours he opened his bag to change people dressed up for dinner on the chief a wash a drink in the club car he looked out again at the late summers light on the unbroken fields a pale gold farther away from the newsreel with every mile and then not paying attention he nicked his finger on his razor and watched dismayed as blood welled out of the cut had there been blood she hadnt said a pool spreading under his head where had he fallen but there must have been blood there always was they were three deep at the bar in the club car talking over each other a party roar of indistinct voices and ice tinkling against glass just a few uniforms officers with their own money one of the starlets hed seen on the platform lipstick refreshed was taking a light from a man shed obviously just met all eyes and whataremyodds the way every trip should begin ben thought the air bubbling like the tonic in his drink so what happened to you ben turned to the finger poking at his shoulder i thought you were coming up talk some more lasner had changed suits but seemed to have kept the same cigar now just a stub between his fingers he was with a young man whose eyes darted around the car a quick sweep before they settled on ben he stuck out his hand lou katz morris agency lou works with abe lastfogel lasner explained im his number two katz said evidently a point youre with continental the army lasner said hes making pictures for the army oh katz said his eyes beginning to move away you know who this is lasner said otto kohlers kid really katz said uneasily not sure he could admit the name meant nothing the director lasner said silents right silents katz said relieved let me get us some drinks youre fine he nodded at bens hand and without waiting for an answer headed into the bar crowd watch this lasner said you want a drink right away always travel with the morris office sorry about today i thought youd be busy so come now he glanced at his watch weve got the eight seating itll be a help to me you have dinner with katz you always feel a hand in your pocket look at this what did i tell you katz was slipping through the crowd drinks in hand looks like a full train he said you see julie sherman over there he nodded toward the starlet from the bond drive you know fox isnt picking up her option lou dont peddle lasner said anyway what would i do with her nobody ever lost money showing tits your health he said raising his glass then what happened at fox too much like tierney who needs two she should be somewhere they work with the talent you know she can sing test her see what she can do you cant run a studio on loanouts how many times lou contract talents okay for the programmers thats your base he said demonstrating with his hands up here you dont want

the loanouts look at selznickhes living on his contract list every time he loans out bergman hes making what a couple of hundred theres a name for that producer producer whats he doing now some farkakte western with that girl played the saint one picture you know how many pictures continentals releasing this year thats my point youre not a small studio anymore people should be coming to you for the talent lasner held up his hand you got something going with her is that what just ten percent do you believe this guy lasner said to ben shes gone down on half the fox lot and with him its still business youve got her wrong she can sing you remind me of gus adler the way he was with rosemary all he could talk about test her test her and you did and signed her katz said smiling sending a ball over the net lasner shrugged all right set it up with bunny then well see katz started to speak but lasner stopped him with a hand on his shoulder now take a step back you push too hard you knock people over learn from abe you know what he decided act like a gentleman people always take your calls there are ways to do things jesus sol i was just trying to say thank you there was a stirring in the car a shift in the air as if someone were holding a door open paulette goddard was walking toward them people pretending not to notice as they let her pass the bond drive dress was gone traded up for a dark silk top that glittered with sequins almost as bright as the diamond earrings setting off her face it wasnt just being beautiful ben thought amusedshe seemed to have brought her own lighting with her a spot following her through the car sol i had no idea you were on the train she said kissing him the air denser now with perfume you look like a million he said fondly i should she said holding up her wrist to show off a strand of diamonds you like if i dont have to pay for it what is it from charlie are you kidding he still has the first dollar well from him in a way the settlement she laughed an infectious giggle imagine his face so everythings friendly lasner said a concerned relative darling it was ages ago you know charlie hes wonderful hes just impossible to live with you two go way back lasner said not that far sol she said laughing again then turned to katz hi lou hows abe busy he said almost blushing grateful to be recognized ben smiled to himself no one was immune to stardust not even those who lived on it can i get you a drink cant date with the major to celebrate the end of the drive sol would you believe it we set a record and it was just me and carole and a few other girls julie sherman katz said getting the name in yes julie she had turned her head to him and now took in ben her smile as bright as the bracelet im sorry ben kohler lasner said the way he now remembered it otto kohlers boy ben could tell from the fixed smile that the name meant as little to her as it had to katz he makes pictures for the army really a glance to the other wrist another flash of diamonds god look at the time ill call fay evidently mrs lasner we dont start shooting for another week she looked up at him suddenly serious milland what do you think youll make him look good lasner said then leaned over and kissed her forehead liar she said smiling love to fay if you want to buy a bond im in car twentytwo at least i think its twentytwo just go to the end and holler lovely to meet you she said to ben grazing his hand with the tops of her fingers and then to katz give my best to abe and she was off turning heads again thats a nice girl lasner said ben looked at him surprised at the word paramount signed her to seven years seven years sol katz said so let freeman buy the bracelets im just saying besides shes a friend who hires friends everybody i dont mean relatives she and fay started out together for chrissake another round katz said letting it drop a porter had started the first dinner chimes one for the road he said beating the rush to the bar your wife was an actress ben said curious actress they were goldwyn girls on the cantor picture the kid from spain whatever it was called thats how we met the wrap party im meeting with sam and he says ive got to go put in an appearance so we met thirteen years now thanks he said taking a new drink from katz but paulette that was something different she wanted itpictures after goldwyn she was with hal roach then chaplin found her or maybe she found him anyway charlies a great teacher and she learned but freshthat you cant teach you look at modern times thats just the way she was before the bracelets lasner glanced up theres nothing wrong with bracelets depends how you get them he made a face as if he were stifling a belch the porter came through again with the chimes i dont know about you but this drink is going right through me katz said i gotta take a leak sol ill see you in the dining car he took bens hand nice talking to you ben watched him head for the restroom then heard a gasp and turned lasner was looking at the floor bent over you okay another gasp ben took lasners arm not just the drink he felt a clenched spasm lasner reached behind with his other hand grabbing onto the window curtains for support geometric flowers around them the cocktail buzz went on not noticing lasner looked up his face contorted white sweat forming on his forehead help me he whispered dont let him see ben grabbed lasners elbow propping him up and hiding him from the rest of the car do you need a bathroom lasner shook his head heart get me out of here his mouth tight a grimace dont move ill get a chair but lasner was already stepping forward leaning on ben next car he said hoarsely before he sees they started toward the other end away from the crowd moving into the dining car away from the restrooms each step heavy as lead his whole weight falling on ben only the bartender seemed aware of them a blank expression taking in another onetoomany at the end of the car another gasp and shudder as ben fumbled with the door handle ill get a doctor lasner sank into a porters jump seat his face tight with strain no make some excuse he said short of breath waving toward the dining car make some excuse with katz before he comes looking then come back ben opened the top of the window a rush of air lean back he said he started to undo lasners tie but did it matter it occurred to ben for the first time a moment of panic that lasner might really be in trouble the chimes went again in the next car over people were sitting down to dinner i have pills lasner said as if that answered anything come back after he looked over at ben eyes large please the word so completely unexpected had the force of an order ben nodded just try to breathe normally dont force it okay which came from where an old first aid manual how to tie a tourniquet he waited until lasner had taken a breathsteady not a rattlethen hurried back into the club car and what excuse could he make an agent expecting dinner ben looked into the dining car not there yet no one he recognized in fact the major must be hosting the bond drive table in the other dining car maybe a private party behind him he heard the bathroom door close with a whoosh there you are sol asked me to wait look hes sorry but he has to beg off dinner miss goddard came back for him you know sol he cant say no to her this all in a rush as if he were short of breath he said hell make it up to you its just what just now ben shrugged i think she didnt want to be alone with the major sol couldnt say no no katz said evidently used to excuses he said hed make it up to you he left katz standing in the dining car wondering how and raced back through the club car pushing past the crowd at the bar lasner hadnt moved leaning against the window holding on to the rail underneath still white all right now lets get you a doctor next one lasner said pointing down the corridor toward a drawing room car presumably his own he leaned again on ben no porters they tip them who ben said as they started to move was lasner becoming confused did that happen polly all of them they tip the porters meaning paulette ben glanced at him then let it go the pills are in your room lasner nodded clutching the handrail as they moved down the car what did you tell him that miss goddard sent for you he buy it i think so you shouldnt even be moving so they can lay me out in the club car were almost there it was a twochair drawing room top of the line the settee already extended and made up crisp white sheets folded over at the head ben lay him down taking off his tie his shoes then suddenly went shy not ready to draw the pants off the birdlike legs dopp kit lasner said pointing to the bathroom ben rummaged through the leather case and pulled out a brown pill bottle hillcrest pharmacy as needed he splashed some water in a glass these lasner took two then lay back half closing his eyes as if he expected instant results ben stood for a minute helpless then put the water down next to lasner and went to the door ill find a doctor i dont need ill be right back ben said ignoring him no porters lasner said raising his voice so ben could hear it after he closed the door but in fact how could he find a doctor without one another story a sick wife the porter too polite to contradict by the time he got the doctor back to the compartment the pills seemed to have had some effect lasners breathing was deeper pushing some color back into his face the doctor glanced with a quick nod at the pill bottle and took out a stethoscope at the same time there still some pain he reached into the shirt placing the metal disc on lasners chest not as much this happen before must have if you have these he nodded again at the pills and you kept walking around dont you know better than that im here youre lucky he leaned over listening more carefully with doctors lasner said its like lawyers its all private you should be in a hospital to be on the safe side i can ask them to stop the train he said glancing out at the open prairie or wait until we get to kansas city we can wire ahead have things ready lasner shook his head carry me out in front of the morris office no whats he talking about the doctor said to ben nothing ben said not bothering is he really in danger he could be listen to me lasner said his voice steady i know what this is it gets better or it doesnt you ride it out what are they going to do in a hospital put me in bed im in bed well i cant take the responsibility then the doctor said sounding so exactly like george brent that for an instant thrown ben almost laughed kohler will keep an eye on me lasner said the doctor sighed anyway youre not in bed here give me a hand will you what do i do ben said to the doctor as they undressed the head of continental pictures the stork legs just as imagined boxer shorts the suit hung up neatly wispy gray hair laid back against the propped pillows nothing hes right about that you ride it out just keep him quiet ill check in again in the morning he wagged his finger at lasner stay in bed or they will carry you out in kansas city he turned back to ben ill leave these he said handing him a small envelope with pills in case he cant sleep if it gets bad again you know where to find me he picked up a cigar from the standing ashtray wonderful he said to lasner just what you need another brent line shaking his head as he left fascist lasner said when the door closed theyre all fascists ben looked at him for a second then dropped into one of the chairs drained holding on to the armrests to calm his hands whats the matter i give you a scare lasner said a faint smile now on his face its not funny you should do what he says get off in kansas city hes just covering his ass if im going to peg out ill do it at cedars heres what we do kansas city thats two twentytwo ben looked over at him impressed again on schedule we get five minutes there not enough to call and get through anyway that hour shes asleep so send an overnight are you getting this theres some paper over there tell fay to meet the train in pasadena not downtown pasadenas eight thirtyfive she always forgets and tell her to bring rosen then another wire to jenkins at the studio tell him not to meet the train tell him fays meeting me otherwise hell start calling people anything else ben said playing secretary youre not supposed to be talking you know im not supposed to be breathing either he said but his voice was softer winding down dont forget the wires okay the address is in my wallet id better go let you get some rest no sit sit stick around lasner said trying to sound casual ben turned off the overhead leaving just a small side lamp and the faint light from the sky outside the land below was already dark anonymous at least till kansas city make sure they dont take me off okay he said asking something else okay ben said taking a chair and turning it so that he was facing both lasner and the window a clean horizon line flat the dark beginning to take over the sky too he lit a cigarette watching the red tip glow in the window reflection you want something to eat we can have something brought no im fine go to sleep who could sleep now you just wonder if youll wake up but he half closed his eyes ben said nothing listening to the wheels talk to me lasner said after a while still there what did you mean about the porters who tips them the columns hedda polly marks all of them polly not paulette what for items whos in whose compartment who got tossed out of the bar whos on the train you know ny to la everybody meets the chief like the boats in new york ben said looking at the land outside now as black as the night sea soon they would cross the mississippi something out of books and you dont want them to know what does it matter i mean what if katz sees you any of them lasner said nothing for a minute then grunted youre not in pictures you dont know the first thing about it not the first goddam thing ben sat back in the chair waiting for more but lasner was quiet drifting when he spoke again even his voice had changed pitched to a different role you know how i got started how ben said the expected response fourteenth street on the east side near third ben looked over surprised to start with an address but lasner was smiling to himself his voice stronger buoyed up by memory as if the past already known could steady his irregular heart by luchows where the cheap beer gardens were next to one of them theres a dry goods store like a shoe box you know just a long counter some drawers for notions lousy space for retail long but at night they clear the counter and put a projector in theres a sheet at the end of the room for this the space is perfect so a nickel on benches the first time ill never forget it i didnt even have english yet just off the boat and im sitting there laughing like everybody else an american this thing i thought here is something so wonderful everybody will want it a nickel you couldnt move in the place i wonder sometimes what if i hadnt gone in on fourteenth street but you know what i would have gone in somewhere else and after that you wanted to make pictures make no show you rent the stores at nightwho was using them at night and you rent some chairs you got a film from the exchange and you were in business get a little ahead you take over the store in the day too people came of course im not the only one seeing this then its theaters and its serious money banks fox that prick is squeezing right and left zukor how do you compete with this you dont i thought i dont want to be in the real estate business they can gobble up everybody and then what they still need something to show so i sold the theaters and came out here to make pictures already out here ben noticed still two thousand miles away the right place ben said well not then that all came later there was nothing here then oranges goyim with asthma nothing but every kind of country sun every day it was all outside then you put up walls and hung cheesecloth over it to cut the glare right out in the open we used a ranch out in the valley for westerns for years the same ranch thats how you started with westerns everybody started with westerns whats to know a man rides into town thats it just go from there ben smiled but what happens what happens guns chase gets the girl its a picture he stopped distracted for a moment then picked up the thread again enjoying himself and ben sat back letting the words circle around him the lasner style growls and purrs and easy intimacy under the sharp eye the first place we had was on gower in the gulch right across from where cohn was with all the flybynights they go out of business wed pick them up just kept moving down the street those days it was handtomouth sometimes not even he looked up at the ceiling absentmindedly smoothing the blanket you know what you miss that age you never think about being sick dead maybe the idea of it but not sick your bodys just something you carry around with you then one day youre lying here with a bomb in your chest waiting for it to go off just when things are goingsince the war everythings doing business then something you never figured im on two kinds of pills and you know what rosen says slow down in pictures you show weakness for five minutes and he let the words hang in the room ben got up and went over to the wash basin well it wouldnt be a weakness to get some rest here take this he handed him a pill from the small envelope lasner held it in front of his mouth a bargaining chip but youll stick around ben nodded watching him lift the water glass dont worry ill stay till youre asleep and after that childlike pressing ben took the glass away after that youll be asleep if anything happens ring for the porter i dont care whos tipping him you dont want to take any more chances with that he pointed to lasners chest lasner grunted people try to see me all day long and here you are and all you can say is go to sleep mr lasner sol for chrissake you took my pants off ben sat down there was nothing to do but wait for the pill to kick in all day long lasner said no wonder i get episodes you think its a picnic running a studio maybe you should think about retiring hah then who would call me said so simply that for a second ben thought he was joking but if youre sick what do you think its something you can just walk away i built the studio all of it he sat back against his pillow nobody sees the work they think it just happens but its work look at paulette he raised a finger youre wrong about her i saw it in your face you thought she was a peggy joyce who gold digger she had a career for about two minutes you never heard of peggy joyce she was in a song for chrissake ben shrugged his shoulders before my time i forget youre a kid she marriedwell who remembers her they remembered or did he said with an exasperated look at ben paulette never married for that you know how old she was she started to work fourteen shes fourteen and making a living on the stage lasner nodded chorus then ziegfeld next thing shes out here pretty but that wasnt it pretty you can get anywhere she was raring to go fun thats what charlie spotted in her not just pretty you know where they met joe schencks boat so another girl for charlie but no he works with her and the way he works every little thing perfect and she does it even now you see the picture shes terrific casual like shes not working but shes working since she was fourteen and now shes a star he lowered his voice suddenly pragmatic but not to carry a picture not yet and they want to put her in a hoop skirt wheres the sense in that the way she wears clothes what do you see in a period picture shoulders whats wrong with shoulders whats wrong with you im trying to tell you something here you have to know what youre doing you make a bad picture thats one thing you make a few he spread his fingers letting the thought slip through them like luck itself running out ben stared at the hand curious every gamblers fear that it might all go away dannys world nothings the way you think out here lasner said his voice weaker drifting again ben looked over at him not sure what he was talking about now some earlier thought and saw that the eyes had finally closed his chest moving slowly night breathing resting comfortably nurses would say after his scare five minutes of weakness their secret he could go now leaving only the dim nightlight but he stayed listening to the wheels keeping watch sure somehow that lasner felt his presence felt safer what happened in a deeper sleep did you hear anything in a coma voices faint rustling sounds around you would danny even know he was there had come all this way to see him maybe lasner didnt know either breathing steadily now but when ben woke hours later and finally left he tiptoed to the door and opened it quietly without a click lasner was still in bed in the morning now propped up against pillows in a patterned silk bathrobe whereve you been the doctor was here an hour ago and im great he tell you to stay in bed lasner waved his hand in dismissal but made no move to get up you want some breakfast i already had what do you keep bankers hours lets talk about the picture theres nothing to see till new mexico anyway ben looked out the windowendless yellow fields silos and telegraph poles a hot bright day lasner held up a finger its not because i owe you i dont want you to get that idea ben nodded and sat down sure youre up to this how much footage have you got lots and some captured nazi filmthey actually filmed it we can also get stock from artkino the russian agency you want to use russian film they were the first ones in the qualitys okayive seen it never mind the quality its russian you use it that prick tenney will be all over you who jack tenney youve been away for a while he used to write songs mexicali rose one hit now hes a politician with a bug up his ass about reds hes got a committee up in sacramento making lists you dont want him making trouble for you over some footage if the russians shot it hell say its a lie which leaves you where saying its not people wondering dont go near it you got plenty of army film right why buy trouble the knock came before he could answer a light rap then a tentative opening sol you there paulette come in sweetheart youre up early she took in ben with a quick smile to cover her surprise then frowned at lasner what are you doing in bed you all right she said crossing the room she was wearing creamcolored slacks and a dark jersey top with a single strand of pearls day wear something i ate lasner said when at the dinner you ate with me except you didnt you saw katz dont worry i covered next time im the excuse let me in on it will you i had to have a drink with him so he could tell me his troubles what troubles does he have lasner said goddard laughed whats going on she turned to ben who had already caught lasners signal doctor says its probably just flu you had a doctor she sat down on the edge of the bed looking at him closely you want me to call fay its done its done ben took care of it in kansas city shes meeting me in pasadena dont make such a big deal she put her hand on his forehead the bright red tips touching his hair tough guy she said then looked at ben raising her eyebrows no fever some flu its a bug is all lasner said now let me get dressed how about i take you to lunch she smoothed back his hair well have it in ill bring some cards what do you say whats my end you stay in bed and dont cheat she tapped a finger on his nose then stood up not waiting for an answer help me find his porter will you she said to ben blowing lasner a kiss in the corridor her face was serious what did the doctor really say when ben hesitated she brushed past it i know you cant he thinks nobody knows fay would kill me if anything happened and i was right here she looked up at him whats the connection again were going to make a picture together for the army she shook her head youll have to explain that to me sometime right now hes taken a shine to you so help me keep him in bed how he cant resist a game theyre all like that ben thought of cohn in his paris suite throwing chips on the pile get a deck from the club car ill order lunch i know what he likes she was right about the cards lasner only picked at his chicken sandwich but brightened when the trays were cleared and she brought out the cards and score pad kicking off her espadrilles and sitting crosslegged on the bed indian style to make a circle outside there was nothing but fields and ben lost track of where they must be cut off even from the rest of the train in their private party a million miles from europe playing cards with a movie star the first shadows made him look up they were finally leaving the steady glare of the flat landscape for the real west mountains and stretches of old conifers dirt the color of bright rust lasner checked his watch we hit albuquerque in ten minutes four thirtyfive my god the hairdresser paulette said getting up why dont you get some beauty sleep ill check in later i do not want to see you in the dining car use room serviceyou can afford it now im an invalid lasner said a mock pout she picked up the cards no more of these either come on ben lets take a hike you rest you deserve milland lasner said then turned to ben see if they got papers on the platform anything even local ben nodded already one of the suits on the red carpet a lasner man the los angeles paper was yesterdays but he bought it anyway while he was waiting for change he noticed a bundle of old papers tied up to be sent back his eye stopped not even a big headline just a story near the bottom easy to miss he slipped the paper out from under the twine director in freak fall daniel kohler director and head writer of the partners in crime series was rushed to hollywood presbyterian hospital after an accidental fall at the cherokee arms hotel in hollywood kohler who was alone at the time of the accident had a long history of dizzy spells according to his wife kohler used the hotel room as a writing office neighbors in the building summoned police after hearing sounds of the fall in the adjacent alley kohler son of the late silent film director otto kohler had been a second unit director at metro before originating the detective series at republic pictures herbert yates president of republic said the studio intended to continue production while kohler recovers partners in crime features larry burke and bruce hudson ben looked up at the metal sides of the chief shining like coins not even about him really an industry item was anyone fooled not the reporter his skepticism poking out between the lines why rent a hotel room to write didnt he have an office on the lot not really about him at all he got back on the train just as it was leaving his mood seesawing back down to where it had been when the first telegram had arrived a quiet panic but lasner was too busy dressing to see it his attention focused on the mirror dont start he said nodding down to the clothes two nights and they notice get the paper take the pills with you just in case ben said putting the paper on the bed you know partners in crime the series over at republic if herb had any brains hed fold it i heard the last one did soso oh he said stopping embarrassed thats your i mean whats it like boston blackie except two brothers one chases girls gets into trouble you know the other one solves the crime the good ones bruce hudson no its me ben thought suddenly lightheaded the way theyd been as boys you never saw it ben shook his head they never sent it overseas he tucked the other paper under his arm and turned to leave dont forget the pills lasner looked at ben in the mirror i dont forget things a kind of thankyou back in his roomette relieved to be alone ben opened the paper again a piece with everything between the lines except why because a b series was failing outside they were heading up through cactus and sage into the wild high desert at this time of day even the rocks glowed golden with trapped heat the shadows around them streaked with violet and terra cotta as if the chief had planned it all for dramatic effect a show before dinner he imagined lasner on that other train forty years ago the dry goods store behind him no aircooled compartment then just hot gritty air and something new at the end maybe thats what all of them had wanted not just sunlight for film a new place what danny wanted too and didnt find ben looked down at the paper disturbed everything about it was wrong not just between the lines but in the lines themselves he thought of the high railing along the embankment danny perched on it like on a balance beam arms outstretched and fearless a boy who had never been dizzy in his life ben saw lasner once more before they arrived this time by accident hed been up since dawn watching the last of the desert slip by the brick sand turning white in the mojave they passed barstow houses without shade then over the ridge to san bernardino and the miles of orange groves planted straight to the san gabriels at this hour still smelling of the night perfume the guidebooks promised ben had lowered the window leaning out in the morning air in europe there had been no oranges at all not for years here the land was bursting with them an almost supernatural abundance royal palms began to appear in front yards rows of peeling eucalyptus along the tracks on the rest of the train he knew suitcases were being snapped shut lipstick dabbed on for the last half hour to union station but the morning held him at the window head stuck out like a childs it was still there as they pulled into pasadena sliding by tubs of bright flowers so lasner saw him when he stepped onto the platform he came over to the window his face troubled oddly hesitant that was your brother that fell you didnt say anything all this time ben looked for a response feeling caught but said how did you hear katz said it was in the trades ben imagined the news spreading through presses across wires all the way to tables on the chief katz bending forward to gossip a montage of rumor but at least danny hadnt been ignored forgotten news for five minutes it wasnt your trouble he said finally i figured you had enough of your own a shame lasner said shaking his head i never heard he was a drinker they must have had some party him and the skirt its a hell of a thing he gonna be all right so now he drank the rumor swelling branching a drunken party something lasner could understand where did the woman come from his own invention an inside tip from katz but before ben could say anything else paulette goddard got off the train with a group of porters and a cartload of suitcases her hair was brushed out shiny every inch of her in place she doesnt trust me to find my own car he said as she came up putting her hand on his arm im just cadging a lift she said the lift or at least its colored driver was moving toward them on the platform behind a blonde in a wideshouldered dress and spectator pumps still trim but thickening a little now paulette she said with a quick hug then turned to lasner and put her arms around his neck and held him not caring who saw dr rosens in the car she said nodding toward a black chrysler waiting at the curb i feel fine big shot she said fondly just get in the car stanleys sniffing around somewhere florabel muirs old leg manhes working for polly now you want to talk to him or to rosen thats the choice oh god paulette said not stanley hes been after me since charlie fay i know i know henry get her to the car will you she turned to lasner you send a telegram from kansas city and now you dont even want to see him he sent it lasner said pointing at ben fay looked up puzzled then went back to lasner i was worried sick i just hired him we met in germany this seemed to make even less sense but she smiled up blankly polite the bosss wife lasner held his eye for a minute what ben took as a last silent exchange about the train then moved on call bunny jenkins at the studio he said to ben hell fix everything for you and order the stock nowthey say tomorrow its always next month check the list at roach see if theyve still got a cutter hal jasper the vd guy lasner smiled yeah tell him i bet they were his crabs sol i mean it no more business ill walk right out of here ive been worried sick this is the second time tell the world she bit her lip then sighed and fixed him with an orelse stare this isnt a house call i had to get him out of bed to come here now are you coming or what he shrugged beginning to move off then paused and looked back to ben if you need a few days thats okay you know to visit at the hospital at first scanning the crowd all he saw were the dark glasses and thick blond hair pinned up in a pile on her head then she came toward him a smooth stride and he recognized the woman in her photograph the same long face as her father the high forehead what it hadnt shown was the skin a tawny cream that held the sun in it she was in a white shortsleeved blouse slacks and canvas shoes as if shed just stepped off a tennis court liesl he said peering at her yes she said extending her hand then excuse me taking off her sunglasses so rude sometimes i forget so we meet how is he the same what do the doctors say hes not responding its a long time now were just waiting you understand theres no recovery i dont want you to expect her eyes uncovered now darted sharply flecked with light she seemed to be wearing no makeup at all lips bare not even a hint of paulette goddards glossy red just the flush of anger or worry that made her movements jerkyhandshake to questioning glance all quick angular only the voice was smooth held a second too long in her throat still with a trace of accent when she said this is all nodding to his bag he heard the rhythm of german not quite forgotten yet thats it im sorry to get you down here so early no i was glad to get a break she said colloquial fully american now its been she let the phrase finish itself youre sure its all right to stay if its not convenient no no she said dismissing this we were expecting you another awkward pause of course later not so soon he was excited you were coming he was ben said unexpectedly pleased then he stopped before why catching himself danny wouldnt have thought about him about anyone they didnt something that happened only to you yes she was saying so many years liesl is that you a tiny woman teetering in high heels was hurrying toward them from the barrier she was wearing a suit with a matching hat the veil thrown back as if she didnt want to miss anything behind her trying to keep up was a man holding a camera polly liesl said taking a step backward my dear i cant tell you thank you said liesl anticipating her this is daniels brother ben you must be shell shocked polly said ignoring him i know herb yates is i talked to him she spoke in a rush that was a kind of suppressed giggle and the rest of her moved with it head turning to keep the passengers in sight so alert that her body actually seemed to be vibrating the effect ben noticed was to make liesl recede wary as prey did you see the column dear the item about dan i didnt mention the bottle i thought herb has enough on his plate withoutand you know it just gives the industry a black eye i was never one for that no liesl said noncommittal and how is that other man polly said almost winking some sort of joke between them such a shame about central station sometimes a book like that you wonder if its too rich but he must have been disappointed oh i think he was grateful for the money liesl said evading what is he working on now she stopped swiveling to look straight at liesl a reporter with an invisible pad you know he never says but youre his translator dear only at the end when hes finished but polly not really interested was looking around again oh theres carole landis ben followed her look to the end of the platform where landis julie sherman and the other girls were getting off the train they were all back in their bonddrive dresses as nextdoor as the andrews sisters youre meeting her liesl said eager to be off polly shook her head paulette goddards on the train no she got off in pasadena ben said polly whirled around surprised glaring at him we met on the train he said explaining himself the studio said union station stanleys in pasadena he doesnt do interviews now the best i can do for her is an item is that what she wants still fuming at ben somehow holding him responsible i dont think she knew maybe she thinks she doesnt need it anymore a good word here and there id be more careful given where shes been for a second ben thought she meant the chorus days less innocent than sol imagined but polly had gone elsewhere almost spitting now with irritation you know you lie down with a red a little pink always comes off if id been married to mr chaplin id be a little more careful before i threw away a friendly interview she looked over her shoulder to see landis getting nearer well i guess its caroles lucky day wont she be pleased wed better let you get on with it liesl said beginning to move away believe me dear shell wait nice running into you she patted liesls arm youll be all right you tell that other man id like to have a chat sometime as a friend you know hes been signing things and you have to be careful what you sign carole she stuck out her arm waving and without saying goodbye hurried over to the surprised landis the photographer trailing behind liesl stared at her for a minute face flushed my god you have to be careful what you sign she said her voice bitter who was that polly marks she caught bens blank look she writes for the newspapers one hundred and twentythree of them exactly one hundred and twentythree she smiled a little a slight softening my father told me hes always exact whos the other man him she nodded you know my father is hans ostermann so thomas mann is also here and she imagines they have a rivalrywell maybe its true a littleand so hes the other mann the names you see warners bought one of his books so now he exists for her otherwise she turned her head annoyed with herself im sorry she does that to me im sorry for such a greeting so welcome to paradise she said with an indifferent wave toward the station she started through the barrier leaving ben to follow on his own moving sideways with the bag through the crowd to keep up the main hall streamlined spanish colonial was noisy with leavetaking voices rising over the loudspeaker announcements so ben had to speak up what did she mean about the bottle they found one in the room she said slowing a little but not stopping they thinkyou know for courage i dont know who told her one of her little mice maybe the maid she pays them or the night clerk or porters on trains ben thought they were passing through a waiting hall with deep chairs and missionstyle chandeliers i dont understand about the hotel its an apartment hotel people live there but theres a switchboard and a maid to change the sheets a service considering you rent by the month and he used it as an office what do you think she said looking at him they reached the high arched entrance where ben had to stop blinded by the sudden glare she had moved aside to put on her sunglasses and now was rummaging through her bag for cigarettes i suppose it takes the guesswork out of getting a room they asked me if i was going to use up the month since it was already paid for they want to move someone else in collect twice she lit a cigarette her hand shaking a little then looked away embarrassed im sorry to involve you in this such a welcome but youll hear it anyway so it was like that he looked over at her not sure what to say a marriage he knew nothing about i didnt mean to pry he said finally you didnt know she shook her head isnt that the point cinq a sept like the french just get home in time for dinner she drew on the cigarette her expression lost behind the glasses or maybe he didnt want to come home so thats that she lifted her head i wonder what she felt when she saw it in the papers maybe she left him maybe it was that well she said the word like a thud so final that for a moment neither of them spoke then she stepped away from the wall so come with any luck well have the house to ourselves these last few days why do people bring food salka brought noodle pudding noodle pudding in this climate she turned to him still hidden behind the glasses please dont listen to me all thisbusiness its not your problem its good youre here she dropped the cigarette grinding it out and started for the parking lot lined with spindly palms then stopped again staring at the rows of cars gleaming with reflected sun you know whats the worst i didnt know he was unhappy isnt that terrible not to know that about someone maybe the woman was part of all that i dont know so maybe its my fault too no its nobodys fault i didnt even notice she said not hearing him i dont know what im supposed to feel one day one thing the next she put a hand up to her forehead covering her glasses im sorry i must sound like a crazy woman talking like this youre here five minutes its all right i dont know how to feel either she turned dropping her hand yes i forget its not just me is it he followed her to a convertible with the canvas roof down shining with chrome the metal handle already hot to the touch she opened the door then stood still for a second looking at him what just then with the bag you were like him not the looks you dont look alike but the gesture he got in flustered and watched her start the car i know its hard buttell me what happened i want to know the papers i mean dizzy spells that was their idea i said why not a stroke anybody can have a stroke even young but they said a doctor could tell if he looked a fall it doesnt matter who said the studio theyre superstitious bad things maybe they stick theyre not supposed to happen she glanced up at the bright sky just sunshine but how through a window he said still trying to picture it there was a balcony just enough to step on you know the kind a juliet he said automatically yes like the play so if you got dizzy you could fall if you got dizzy she looked at him then up at the rearview mirror backing out physically moving away look she said nodding toward the station doors as polly came out with carole landis arms linked she waved and moved the car forward in the line to the exit did you really meet paulette goddard on the train not wanting to talk about it what was she like nice he said forced to go along maybe you are no she was she wont be after pollys through with her what was that about with chaplin polly hates chaplin so he must be a communist everyone she hates is a communist she hated daniel too when he was in the union she thinks theyre all communists in the union then why is she doing him a favor covering its for yates daniel was important to him partners made money so he was giving him a big picture to do you know at metro you have to wait years for that thats why he left there you know what hes like everything today a skating picture but still a good budget not failing on his way up skating like sonja henie vera hruba ralston she said drawing out the name you know her yates is in love with her so it was a good job for daniel they paid him while they fixed the script hruba she skated out of czechoslovakia and into the hearts of america ben did a double take then smiled really she nodded on the posters she said lighting another cigarette at the stop sign whos mr ralston she got it off a cereal box youre making it up you dont have to not here she looked up at the sky again the fogs burning off early sometimes it takes all morning shall we go to the hospital first she pulled out of the lot looking straight ahead smoke curled up from the cigarette between her fingers on the steering wheel then flew back in the breeze as they sped up mixing with loose wisps of hair what california was supposed to be likea girl in a convertible but not the way he expected across the street they drove past a sleepy plaza of tile roofs and mexican rug stalls a village for tourists behind it just a block away the american city began office buildings coffee shops anywhere harold lloyd had dangled from a clock here and the kops had chased each other through pershing square and dodged streetcars red it turned out but all that had happened in some city of the mind the real streets used so often as somewhere else looked like nowhere in particular they drove out on wilshire the buildings getting lower driveins and car lots with strings of plastic pennants the first time you think how can it be like this she said noticing his expression the signs and then you get used to it even my father he likes it now well the climate not so much that hes hardly ever outside for him its a haven she said her voice so throaty that it came out heaven all those years moving one place another place then here finally safe and other germans are here so its good the sun i dont think it matters for him he lives in his study in his books what was central station i never anhalter before they changed it so it wouldnt sound german you know it anhalter bahnhof of course tell him hell be pleased she made a right on vermont pointing them now toward the hills do we pass continental on the way ben said we can if you like but if its out of our way it doesnt matter hes not conscious you know we just sit there maybe its better for him theres so much damage the brainif he were awake what would that be like for him sometimes i think it would be better ifand then i think how can you think that she bit her lower lip but he did i dont know why but thats what he wanted not this he looked away across the miles of bungalows did he leave a note he said finally no the crucial prop the writing of it sometimes a scene in itself looking up from the paper into a mirror eyes moist in the movies in real life you just did it just his effects i had to sign you know that word i didnt know it effects she looked at him they would have said if theyd found anything she turned on melrose thats paramount down there where the water tower is after a few blocks he could see the roofs of the sound stages humped like airplane hangars she slowed near a gate of swirling wrought iron so that he could get a glimpse behinda tidy factory yard with people in shirt sleeves gliding past the tall water tower rising above everything just like its mountaintop logo ringed with stars in front of the gate a thin line of pickets walked back and forth carrying signs theres a strike ben said a prewar image daniel said it was jurisdictional she said careful with the word one union against the other she looked away no longer interested he always wanted to work here more than any of them maybe if well thats rko at the end they turned onto gower under the model of a radio tower on a globe continentals up there she said pointing across from columbia this gate was modern no more than a break in the walls with streamlined trim beyond it unseen lasners empire built from nickels a private world made invisible by sentries and passes outside the street was emptyno pickets just a small cluster of people near the gate whos that ben said they wait here to see who drives through for autographs no just to see them for a minute hans ostermann was waiting for them in dannys room reading in the corner next to the window the shades were halfdrawn so that even the light seemed hushed a hospital quiet broken only by the nurses outside and the clank of a meal cart being wheeled down the hall ostermann stood when they came in taking bens hand he was wearing a suit and tie as natural to him as his perfect posture and formal nod ben wondered a darting moment if he wrote dressed this way erect at his desk in a white collar keeping german alive ben approached the bed his stomach tightening with shock not just sick dannys face was beaten in bruised one eye swollen shut jagged laceration marks crossing the rest what happens when you hit ben stared at him for a minute trying to see something familiar but all he could see was the fall itself the smash at the end why this way danny primping at the mirror for a date deliberately doing this to himself why not sleeping pills an easier hollywood exit why would he want to look this way ben stepped closer taking in the iv drip the monitor all the hospital tools to keep him alive bring him back but you only had to look at the broken face to see the truth the teases the grins were gone they were just waiting for the rest of him to go ben took his hand half expecting some response but nothing moved danny he said keeping his voice low waking someone whos just dozed off he turned to the others can he hear anything no liesl said we dont know that ostermann said theres no way of knowing talk if you like nonsense liesl said moving over to a vase of flowers no the doctor said head injurieswe dont know what really happens he looked over at ben his voice reassuring the first two days were the critical ones so perhaps but hes no better liesl said bluntly pragmatic facing it why do people send flowers when he cant see them the room ben noticed now was full of them covering side tables and window sills its a sign of concern ostermann said a gesture for you liesl said they send them for you youre tired ostermann said as close ben saw as he would come to a reprimand liesl was reading one of the cards attached to a vase from alma she said so shes forgiven you for now ostermann said a weak smile ben looked at the bruised face when youre unconscious where does the mind go functioning somewhere beyond pain or simply floating in white now that he was here what was there to do the usual business of a hospital visit seemed beside the pointfetching nurses chatting idly to keep up spirits plumping pillows instead they waited ostermann returning to his book ben sitting at the bedside gazing at dannys damaged face liesl pacing making lists of the flower cards for thankyou notes glancing over at the bed as if she were still deciding how to feel wearing herself out with it by lunch in the cafeteria she was visibly exhausted go home and rest ostermann said you were here all night how can i leave what if im not here if what would people say that the family was here get ben settled in ill stay how can i sleep she said putting things on her tray standing up ostermann looked at her fondly then have a swim he turned to ben as she left the table its no good being here day and night look at her all nerves take her home hell be here later you know what if he isnt i know how you feel when anna was dying in paris i never left nuns i didnt want to leave her with nuns leave her alone but it was for me not her when she died i was there and it didnt matter she was alone i didnt know it until then we die alone he looked up ill call if theres a change they drove up into the hills the narrow road twisting upward in a series of blind curves past tall bushes and steep hidden driveways with each turn the houses seemed to get bigger villas and a few white boxes that once must have been daring and modernist softened now by middleaged gardens the trees were bigger too mature oaks and tall needle pines as if the cooler air above the flats made it easier for them to grow the new cars parked along the side of the road were buffed and shiny like children after a bath here we are the house just visible through the driveway shrubs was mediterranean fronted with a row of french windows they pulled up next to a dodge coupe oh good iris is here i asked her to come in an extra day a maid with a car in germany bicycles were traded for food the house inside was light and open filled with books and contemporary furniture a piano covered with framed photographs in the corner iris a wiry pale woman in a dress not a uniform was in the dining room polishing silver i put the messages by the phone you better call the caterer again i told him no ham but he wants to talk to you ben looked at liesl surprised i thought id better start arranging things she said flushing just in case so we wont have to at the last minute iris this is mr kohlers brother benjamin reuben anyway ben he said distracted noticing her feet in pink bedroom slippers iris nodded im sorry about mr kohler she said formal but genuine then cocked her head to one side appraising him you dont look alike no he took after my father liesl started toward the hall youre down this way youll have your own bath so its private through an open door on their left he could see a big desk and more shelves dannys real workroom not rented by the month a club chair in the corner and next to it a day bed made up as a couch im here daniels dressing room opens from the hall too so you wont be bothering me if you use it that door she pointed still moving you better call the caterer iris shouted from the dining room all right i dont see whats so difficult i said poached salmon well he heard ham she opened a door at the end of the hall youre in here id better phone or shell nag me about it if youd like a swim just use those stairsthe pools out back i wont be long a swim something he hadnt had in four years he gestured toward his bag i didnt bring who had bathing suits use one of daniels hes got a drawer full of them just root around and pick what you like he threw his bag on the bed and went over to the window the pool was below blue and rippling catching the light in quick flashes it had been set off from the rest of the hill by a private wall of trees with the far end left open so that the land seemed suspended in air before falling away to the distant grid of streets around the edge were large pots of geraniums a few lemon trees and a row of trimmed oleanders high enough to flower but not block the view ben stared at the pool unsettled as if a wrong note of music had been hit jarring the whole piece hed thought of danny as somehow desperate not lying on a chaise in the sun picking fruit off trees how did they fit an acre of paradise and a room at the cherokee arms he went to the dressing room curious more money rows of sport jackets on hangers shoes laid out a drawer full of bathing suits tropical flowers chevron stripes finally a pair of navy blue trunks that could be anybodys he looked through the other drawers quietly feeling like a burglar socks rolled up a stack of handkerchiefs pressed and folded but dannys drawer at home had been neat too under the handkerchiefs there were old passports kept for some reason filled with the stamps of their childhood crossing into germany crossing out of germany dover and calais berlintempelhof the last with an eagle on a swastika just before the pages ran out he looked at the photo in his next passport hed be grown up but here he was still young the hair brushed to one side where would the other pictures be his study probably he crossed the hall carrying the trunks and surprised iris who was putting papers away in drawers im just cleaning up in here you get people in and out you know theyre going to come snooping they go looking for the bathroom and next thing theyre at the desk just happening to read whats on it ive seen it something i can help you with no im just snooping myself ben said trying to find some pictures you know we havent seen each other in a while she went over to the shelves where a few small frames rested against the books this is pretty recent she said handing him one ben looked down a group on the beach danny with his lopsided grin making a face at the camera the whole row smiling enjoying the day liesl wore a twopiece suit with polka dots like chili williams her hair blowing behind her you planning to stay long ben raised his head i only ask because of the food so i can plan i dont want to make things worse for her ben said a question iris shook her head far as thats concerned she could use the company you know what its like in an empty house shes already taking it hard its the suddenness of it and the way she stopped and went back to the desk dont mind me ben put the picture back then glanced down at the day bed he spend a lot of time in here what kind of question is that i just meant i know what you meant i suppose youve been hearing things people like to talk when its none of their business ill tell you i never saw it but people have different ways you take mr bakerthats my ex that man was a hound i threw him out i said i know you cant help it you got to chase anything runs in front of you but i dont want any part of it now mr kohler i never saw that two years ive been working here since they got the house so you live and learn she closed the drawer and looked up at him he seemed the same to me like always well she moved to the door you want to help people have to eat she hasnt touched a thing in days melon whats melon water is all get her to eat something when shed gone ben looked at the other pictures more wrong notes as jarring as the pool danny and liesl on a picnic blanket with another couple around a nightclub table covered with glasses hans ostermann unintentionally comic in his somber european suit surrounded by danny and a few other young men in tennis whites a croquet game a pool party danny smiling in all of them a happy life but everybody smiled for the camera he went over to the desk intending to start on the drawers but liesl came in carrying flowers oh good you found one she said nodding to the bathing suit ill be right down as soon as i deal with these i have to put them where shell see them shell ask otherwise now what she said as the phone rang why does everybody want to talk but she picked it up anyway not waiting for iris and immediately switched into german she had the rich fluid german he remembered from before the war before all the coarse shouting and her voice sounded relaxed at home in it salka wants to drop off a cake she said wryly hanging up but she wants to know if almas here theyre not speaking to each other alma who sent the flowers to danny liesl nodded mahler well werfel now but if you leave out the mahler she puts it back in and salka viertel bertholds wife well when hes around everyone goes to her on sundayslike a real salon so of course it makes alma crazy two queen bees in one hive i suppose theyll have to see each other if theres a funeral for five minutes anyway theyll all come its like a village theyll come to see who doesnt come so youll be all right she said gesturing again to the trunks then glanced at the desk were you looking for something she met his eyes her face suddenly soft he didnt leave a note you can look but he didnt the drawer was a mess of papers letters odd pages of scripts with margin notes bank statements with canceled checks more private than clothes an envelope with a doctors return address he pulled out the letter an annual physical boxes checked in columns blood pressure heart rateeverything had been fine in january perfect in fact except for the lazy eye that had got him a f he put the form down suddenly embarrassed what exactly was he looking for an explanation an apology he looked at dannys handwriting againswooping caps and then tight closed letters which meant what would he even have given it a thought a few days ago this was like looking at tea leaves or chicken entrails he shoved the paper back and closed the drawer downstairs sliding glass doors led out to the pool there was a wet bar some bright patio furniture and a galley kitchen with a serving window that opened to the terrace ben imagined parties with platters of food umbrella tables by day the million lights by night to the side was a closed door the garage no a screening room with red plush seats and musty velvet drapes so dated it must have come with the house he turned up the lights except for the sound speakers it was the kind of room lasner might have used to run two husbands maybe even for chaplin a lifetime before paulette did danny still use it the projection room at any rate was functional the equipment newer than some hed used in the signal corps a few cans of film lay next to the projector waiting to be put back on the metal shelf lined with hexagonal storage boxes ben went over to look expecting a row of republic serials but they were ufa films titles on the boxes inked in german drei madchen ein tag in berlin sag mir adieu all the silly comedies and shopgirl dramas their father had made out in babelsberg a kind of shrine to otto kohler all here even the ones from the thirties when otto still thought hed be safe ben ran his fingers across the boxes films he hadnt seen then never asked to see later all faithfully collected the fathers son even two husbands probably moldering away now in its canister he moved from the shelf his eye caught by a wall of framed photographs another kohler homage otto on the set with marika rokk a group picture with jannings lorre and conrad veidt dietrich showing him her leg a gag shot a formal premiere probably at the zoo palast in gowns and white ties withyes goebbels at the end of the row otto on a crane otto blocking a scene a wall of otto and finally at the end a picture of the family all four of them in lutzowplatz his mother smiling broadly her hand on bens shoulder danny making a face he took the picture from the wall and stared at it suddenly moved his life too how old had he been eight he remembered the day it had been taken frau weber telling danny to stand still and then not finding the shutter button so hed laughed at her again making another face the whole afternoon still so real that ben felt he could touch it right through the glass frame his face flushed a warm surge of recognition not someone else there you are i saw the light ive been looking liesl stopped seeing his face what why would he do it ben said flatly she had put a terrycloth wrap over her bathing suit and now pulled at one of the lapels a nervous drawing away ive been acting for days as if hes someone i dont know he held out the picture but i do know him its not something he would do dont she said softly it makes it worse i know i did it too but it doesnt make sense you want it to make sense it does to them somehow he wasnt sicki saw his physical he wasnt depressed either iris said he was the same as always oh iris you did too you said you didnt know he was unhappy but why should he be he waved his arm to take in the house dannys life we dont know what was in his mind we dont she turned and headed out toward the pool he glanced down at the picture again then followed but to do this what then do you think his girlfriend pushed him out like some cartoon somebody could have liesl shook her head no one else was there the police talked to the night clerk no one went up no one the door was locked there has to be a reason so what could it be maybe his marriage is that what you think the others do you can hear it in their voices how could he do such a terrible thing and then they look at me i didnt mean ouf she said cutting him off then tossing the robe on the chair enough liesl but she turned away stepping over to the edge of the pool and dove in a perfect arc slicing into the water then streaming under the surface out of hearing when she came up she swam the rest of the length in fast efficient strokes a quick sideways turn for air someone who swam every day he watched her as she turned for the second lap hair flowing the long golden legs scissoring effortlessly at home in it the kind of girl everyone noticed pretending not to but imagining the smooth body without the suit beads of water running off the tan skin all anyone could want but not enough for danny the fathers son in every way that same careless urge for the next thing not expecting any damage until families were broken up and what should have been held close had been let down he turned his head away flustered not just some girl in a pool there were cigarettes on a side table and he lit one looking away toward the hazy city behind him he could hear the regular splashes of her strokes then a pause and a noisy gathering of water as she lifted herself up the pool stairs she came over to where he was standing toweling her hair marta says i should wear a cap the chlorine burns the hair my hairdresser she said the change of subject a kind of apology moving on she glanced at him waiting then lit one of the cigarettes joining him would you like to know about me and daniel its none of my yes otherwise youll wonder thats how it is now she looked at him we need to be friends to get through this sit she said indicating the next chaise she sat back on hers lifting her face to the sun he got me out thats why he married me my father there was a visa for him you know for the culture they could get artists out on special visas especially if they were known here but not me i wasnt an artist i wasnt anything you know after we left germany we were officially stateless not even resident permits always temporary papers so no visa but of course my father wouldnt leave me and it was dangerous for him so daniel married me made me an american but i think he was fond of me too she turned to him her eyes direct it wasnt a mariage blanc dont think that she said then looked away again this was where he said after a minute germany no germany we would have been dead my father was one of the first to leave his name was already on a list because of the articles and you know my mother was jewish so it was for her too first vienna to keep the language then parisshe died there i think her heart gave out from the worry then after the nazis came we went south like everyone you dont know this thats where i met daniel in marseilles he was helping people get out you wouldnt think such a placeit was like here the good weatherbut it was a death trap who could trust vichy so daniel helped people get to spain sometimes over the mountains on foot he walked them out they never forgot it she paused taking in some smoke neither did i he was my hero she said staring at her burning cigarette she looked up selfconscious her wistful tone now shaded with irony almost bitter so it wasnt for love but we made a life he never asked to leave afterwards when it was safe for me we werecomfortable together she sat up rubbing out the cigarette and the others you seemed surprised she made a half smile maybe im like germany i didnt want to know so i didnt and now everyone will know she stopped but how can i be angry he didnt owe me that she covered her eyes with her hand a pretend sunshade for a moment neither of them said anything the air so quiet he could hear the drain flaps in the pool you know before when i said i didnt know he was unhappy i should have known because i see it now everybody says that after they should have seen no its true not unhappytroubled maybe this woman i dont know she looked at him i still dont want to know do you understand that he walked toward the pool thinking how long i mean when did you notice she got up gathering her robe the movement like a reluctant sigh not long the summer the end of the summer so now you can find the girl and ask her what happened this summer all right then maybe youll be satisfied she belted the robe but it wasnt us we were all right we were just the way we were the hospital seemed busier at nighttrays being collected nurses changing shifts danny was alone in the room oblivious he wouldnt just leave liesl said looking for her father then spied him at the end of the corridor in the smoking lounge with another man not as tall looking around hesitantly like someone trying to make small talk my uncle dieter she said look how they stand see how stiff his brother my mothers the truth is they dont like each other when my mother was alive it was different now he only comes when you have to for appearances my fathers birthday things like that or like this yes she said looking down but not only for that he liked daniel everybody did already in the past he lives here too pasadena come before they quarrel but when they joined the men the mood seemed polite not at all contentious dannys situation overriding whatever irritation there might have been introductions were made doctors visits discussedand then they were all back on watch drifting between dannys room and the hall fidgeting looking for something to do only ben stayed fixed holding dannys hand again convinced against all sense that danny could feel it use it to climb back when the two men got up to go to dinner liesl went out with them to the hall a family huddle leaving ben alone talk to me he thought tell me why before you go at least that the battered face had lost its power to upset him used to it now but the waiting itself had become oppressive making him logy his mind dense with still air when the first sound came he wasnt sure hed actually heard anything just his own wish but the second was real he lifted his head sharply as if someone had snapped fingers in his face ben still faint a little croaky but there he grasped dannys hand waiting for his eyes to flutter open yes im here ben the voice said again the tone slightly puzzled working things out danny my god the eyes open now but blinking against the light youre in the hospital do you remember anything the blinking stopped his eyes steadier wetting his lips focusing danny then his eyes closed a kind of resignation danny let me get the others theyre just outside everyoneliesl her father dieter we didnt know if youd make it he got up ready to bolt across the room but danny made a hiss an attentiongetter his mouth so dry it was difficult now to speak ben leaned close to his face dont leave me he whispered his voice raspy urgent ben lifted his head disconcerted did danny know it was him all these years and now suddenly clinging maybe what happened at the end any life raft dont he said again no i wont its going to be all right now elated by the unexpectedness of it ill just get liesl ben said excited racing across the room and flinging open the door hes awake they all looked at him stunned liesl got to the bed first daniel she said then when there was no response turned to ben youre sure of course im sure daniel but he looks the same he was awake ill get the doctor ben said still excited heading for the door ill go ostermann said but ben was already on his way racing down the hall to the nursing station everything around him a blur the nurse alone on duty looked up in alarm bens hands now pounding on the desk an emergency signal dr walters was on another floor she picked up the phone to call the station upstairs never mind ben said not waiting for the elevator leaping up the stairs his eyes looking for the recognizable white coat down the hall jotting notes on a clipboard he woke up ben said a little breathless dr walters startled put the clipboard down without a word and followed him to the stairs ben could hear their feet clumping an echo effect between floors ostermann and dieter were at the nursing station now then liesl everyone running the corridor filling with people the same blur as they raced back dr walters dodged past an aide not stopping till he pushed the door and ran across the empty room to the bed taking up dannys hand you said if he came to ben started watching the doctor lower his head to dannys face then take his wrist whats the matter the doctor took out a stethoscope and bent lower again a repeat check im sorry he said hes gone ben looked at danny winded his own body suddenly cool could you tell just by looking the body still mouth slightly open no movement at all but he cant he was just here ben said the doctor looked at him maybe he was saying goodbye a last effort nurse she hurried over turning off the monitor and drew up the sheet the doctor glanced at his watch already mentally filling out a certificate it may be for the best he said calmly an attempt to comfort this kind of injury a full recovery isnt possible its unusual to last this long if we do a complete examination maybe well know more next time mrs kohler ill need you to sign some forms liesl didnt answer staring at the bed dazed we can wait till tomorrow if you like you mean an autopsy ben said imagining the knives it can wait the doctor said liesl turned from the bed no ill come she said her voice a monotone he wanted to be cremated danny in a box thats not a hospital no i just meant it wont matter the examination she touched bens arm thats right isnt it you dont object ben shook his head he knew me he was conscious and then he wasnt when what everyone always said it happened so fast a part of a second mrs kohler the doctor said again and then he was leading her out ostermann following everybody even the duty nurse until ben was alone in the room in a minute orderlies would come and wheel the bed away ben went over and pulled back the sheet a last look shaken on the train hed thought of danny as already dead but that was an idea this was worse a flash of contact then gone actually cold now to the touch another body when he was a child death was something remote an event for old people then in the war it happened to everybody but you only got used to it when they were already dead dying itself was new each time something you could feel ed bleeding away now danny dont leave me hed said but he was the one whod left just the way he always did when it suited him leaving ben behind he was still standing by the bed when he heard the door open he turned expecting the orderlies but it was liesl she glanced toward the white sheet then away do you want more time she said youre finished a few papers only she walked over to the bed staring at the body for a minute eyes soft so its over she looked up what should we do with the flowers she said her voice shaky snatching the phrase out of the air something to say what happens to them i never thought about it maybe they give them to other people its true he was awake ben nodded she looked down then folded her arms across her chest as if she had caught a chill we should go all the arrangements therell be so much to do for the widow another glance to the bed her voice catching again so now this ive never been a widow before the phone started ringing early and continued for most of the morning through the deliveries and the extra help and iris directing the table setups the whole house in motion the mechanics of mourning had taken over no one sat and brooded or even mentioned danny youre about the same size liesl said handing him some of dannys suits they should fit he smiled to himself still wearing his handmedowns youll need something she said misinterpreting his look but if you feel funny he shook his head cutting her off its fine i thought you might like his watch ben took it his finger grazing the crystal not dannys their fathers another piece of the otto shrine when did danny get it on one of those last trips to germany probably a sentimental gift to the loyal son who stayed close thank you he said touched there must be something i can do except be in the way no really she stopped that place where he was she said hesitant somebody has to go there if he left things i dont know nobody said but i could send iris he shook his head again ill go take his car youll need one out here anyway two now and so hard to get but now you you have the key the key she said a new idea i dont know maybe here she went over to the desk and pulled out a ring with several keys they were in his pants so it must be one of these so many keys she said looking at them other parts of his life he missed a turn and had to backtrack west on hollywood boulevard past the pantages a name out of radio broadcasts then right on cherokee the cherokee arms was a fivestory pastel building with an alley along the side connected to a parking space behind not grand but not seedy either a place you used on the way up or the way down but not at either end ben parked across the street and looked at it for a minute fingering dannys keys if the fall could kill him he must have been on the top floor he got out and walked across an apartment building with a lawn in front quiet in the bright light no shadows he passed through the alley there were a few cars parked in back garbage cans he looked up to the top balcony the railing wasnt high if you staggered against it the back door was locked but it would be wouldnt it a convenience for residents on their way in from the parking lot no need to go through the front where the desk clerk would see you go up if you had a key the third one worked from here you could either go directly up the back stairs or down a hall on the right that led past mailboxes and what looked like an elevator door from this angle ben couldnt see the front desk switchboard where the clerk must be he went up the stairs walking quietly expecting to be stopped instead he found the landings empty the building still except for the sound of the elevator going down on the top floor he went to what he assumed was dannys door using a key that resembled the one that had worked downstairs the room a studio was neatbed made no dishes in the sink a hotel room just after maid service nothing in the bathroom nothing in the closet either he started opening cupboards glasses and dishes that came with the place on the counter there was an ice bucket and a bottle of brandy opened nothing on the desk but a message pad and pen no personal presence at all ben went over to the french windows and opened them looking at the balcony trying to imagine it he stepped out placing his leg against the railing if hed been wobbly possible but so was the other the leap off he went back in what was the point he took one last look around then opened the door to leave moving in the man was leaning against the opposite wall clearly waiting for him to come out young without a hat you the desk clerk the manthe kidshook his head and flipped open a press pass i saw you go in i was out back so i figured maybe theyd been giving me the brush about the room i mean you have a key mind if i look around what for they didnt tell you scene of the crime he said starting in last guy had the room went out the window mind all the way in now what are they charging you dont mind my asking i dont know im not moving in no whered you get the key he asked but almost off handedly moving over to the counter looking at everything im his brotherthe guy before the kid stopped sorry i didnt mean what do you want to see theres nothing here honest maids the kid said picking up the brandy bottle usually the liquors the first to go he went into the bathroom checking the medicine chest behind the door you come here to pick up his stuff he went over to the balcony retracing bens steps even putting his leg against the railing theres nothing to pick up i noticed funny isnt it somebody must have been here already what do you mean what do you think he used the room for we said writing office but what the hell be nice to the wife what would he use it for you ever meet a woman yet who didnt take over half the bathroom cream here powder there douche bag on the door and whats here nothing she must have cleaned it out i dont know when though ive been watching the building what for the kid looked at him to see who else had a key you think someone was with him not then shed have been spotted every windows got a head sticking out you know taking an interest cops had to use a passkey to get in theres no one in there with him it had to be later unless shed already moved out maybe thats why he i get it you think he jumped the breakup huh you dont ben said interested at first we get the police call nobody else is interested but my position you need the inches even the blotter stuff the cops are already here and the night clerks going ohmygod he must have fallenyou know dont make the place look badand the cops are going along with it but i can see theyre looking at it as a jump you know taking pictures and everything and its hollywood where you get this not hancock park or someplacepeople have been known to jump here but im thinking its a funny kind of jump why you know anything about jumpers i covered a few they like it a little higher to make sure maybe for the show of it why not just go to the roosevelt and jump off the roof four five stories you can i mean he did hes dead but you could also just wake up in a cast somewhere thats one thing then the angle of the fall all the jumpers ive seen they dont back out face forward so i figure the lapd are looking for a little excitement pick up a slow night i wouldnt let this get to you you believe what you want but my guess he was plastered and tripped he nodded toward the brandy bottle on the counter then why are you watching the building if thats all it was look why have a separate place anyway under a different name they got him as collins downstairs all right hes seeing somebody on the side not a onenight stand a longerterm thing still why not a hotel unless they dont want to be seen in public take that chance maybe shed be recognized so who is she im wondering about this and then something funny happens i know the cops wrote it up as a jump i was here but when im doing the story the next morning they got it as an accident how come the change thats when i get interested because that kind of change the only people in this town get favors like that are the studios so i figure theres a story why would a studio do that for danny him they wouldnt anyway he was a goner they look to the living and now what do we find he looked around at the clean apartment nobody was ever here but she must have been and she must have been more than a fuck ben looked at him sorting it out you dont know any of this he said finally youd rather have him as a jumper ben said nothing maybe we could help each other out how youre family go through his stuff if hes seeing somebody he has to call her there must be a number somewhere so you can find her and put her in the paper ben said thinking of liesl reading it if shes in pictures its a story dont you want to know seen enough ben said ducking it starting to leave ill do the legwork thats what i do the kid said a half grin on his face playing reporter the kind hed seen in the movies i just need a number he took a business card from his jacket pocket and handed it to ben day or night ben looked at it tim kelly a name youd forget without a card what if she isnt in pictures he said just a secretary or something a secretaryand he gets a place like this kelly said breezy still in character then id like to fuck her myself ben stood beside liesl and hans ostermann at the funeral the immediate family around and behind them all in black the emigre community sweltered in old high collars hats with veils mourning clothes that belonged in the drizzle and cloudy skies of middle europe thomas mann had come a courtesy to liesls father and ben recognized a few otherslion feuchtwanger slickedback hair and eager eyes behind rimless glasses brecht rumpled and smelling of cheap cigars they were standing in front of the plain marble wall where dannys box of ashes would be placed the rest of the cemetery was more elaborate carved headstones and obelisks and flamboyant tombs from the s valentino was somewhere over to the left beyond the cypresses and the high wall ben could see the water tower of the paramount back lot as close as danny would ever get now there were americans toopeople from the studio glancing at their watches expected backand while they all waited ben wondered what made it so easy to tell them apart not just the clothes or the haircuts maybe something in the way they held themselves an attitude or maybe like tim kelly everyone here slipped naturally into a part hitting marks under the giant arc lamp wasnt he the grieving brother liesl the stoic widow dryeyed behind her dark glasses leaning on ostermann all formal weimar dignity as publicly correct as the other mann ben saw that polly marks had come keeping close to a man in a doublebreasted suit whom ben assumed was herb yates who were all the others ben looked at the faces bored or genuinely sad and realized again that he knew nothing about dannys life he was still scanning the crowd when he caught someone doing the same thinga man in a gray suit standing near the edge looking at faces methodically as if he were counting when he met bens eyes he didnt even pretend to be embarrassed just looked then moved on ben stayed on him watching him fix on ostermann then on the others each in turn what part was he playing not from the studio certainly not an emigre holding a hat in his hand like a policeman he heard a crunch of tires and turned to see a black packard pulling up the others had had to park near the gates a driver hopped out to open the doors first a little man ben didnt know then alma mahler making her entrance she was dressed for a viennese funeral the emperor himself might have attended long black silk with a sizable hat and without hesitation made her way to the front of the crowd ben watched her approach fascinated everybodys mistress now broadened and grown outward a kind of pouter pigeon effect but still turning heads she put her hand on liesls arm as she took her place near the family then nodded to ben her eyes interested someone new her arrival seemed to give permission to start a man went to the wall and turned to face them opening his hands ben had been told there would be a rabbi but his dark suit was like all the others and the service was so secular no religion specified that ben wondered if the cemetery had rules about who could be buried there judenrein he looked at the flowers bouquets and wreaths with long name ribbons in the german style then at the open square where they would put the box after which everyone could move on he felt liesl next to him holding herself erect getting through it what would kelly find a tabloid love triangle with pictures of the cherokee nest bury him why not a tipsy fall what difference did it make heinrich kaltenbach will say a few words the little man whod come with alma opened a piece of paper then closed it visibly upset his round face drawn only a few not a speech he said his accent thick uncomfortable i speak also for alma and franz for many of us here there is for us a great debt we owe this man our lives he came with us on foot only a little farther he would say to the border you remember alma he said looking at her waiting for her nod a little drama and you know what shes carrying in the suitcase the manuscript bruckners fourth so not just lives culture hes saving culture for this everybody owes him please if you dont mind he said then switched into german his speech picking up pace fluent now the americans stood respectfully trying not to look blank but for the germans it was a release something real after the generic service with the heft of language ben looked at them just the sound could take them backthe lucky ones the ones whod left but what choice had there been if they had stayed theyd be dead like otto ashes too his mind wandered the sound of german fading into the background overheard but not distinct as if it were coming up the stairs from one of his fathers parties danny would be down in the kitchen sneaking drinks from the indulgent staff he froze he looked at the marble wall seeing danny as a teenager his head over a toilet bowl retching swearing hed never touch brandy again and never did an almost allergic reaction not his drink at all but there was the bottle sitting on the counter at the cherokee suggestive a prop which meant someone had put it there ben felt a prickling on his neck someone else in the room the door had been lockedthe police had needed a passkey but there could have been another a duplicate to lock the door behind you without thinking he turned looking back at the crowd for the man in the gray suit near the edge still watching like someone on duty but why come to the funeral if youd already filed it as an accident case closed unless it wasnt his mind darted to the stairs the alley trying to work out the logistics as if somehow that would make it all plausible but how could it be could someone really have killed him why why were people murdered jealousy revenge because they were in the way in stories not in real life then he thought of the film clips waiting to be assembled at continental why millions and millions for no reason at all kaltenbach finished the sudden quiet like a touch to bens shoulder his eyes went to the rabbi placing the box in the square then handing liesl a flower to put with it she stood still for a second then took bens hand drawing him with her to the wall he was given another flower and then as if it had been rehearsed they put them in together one on each side of the box when she finished she gave ben a weak smile her eyes confused still not sure how to feel he looked at the box suddenly overwhelmed feeling a loneliness hed resisted before danny was gone for good not just gone taken away by what right and it wasnt just danny a death spread out in shock waves touching other people changing them taking pieces of them too demanding some kind of justice you owed the dead that much how could he want it for millions and not this one only a few americans came back to the house afterward so the lunch turned into a german gathering the language floating warm and familiar around the buffet table like the wisps of steam from the chafing dishes the caterer had come through with the salmon and what looked like a dozen other dishes but people had brought things too brisket and cakes an unexpected homey touch all of it was being eaten heaping plates and seconds liesl who might have sat in a corner receiving instead was everywhere seeing to people playing hostess ben watched her waiting for signs of strain but he saw that the nervous activity with its chinhigh assurance was also a kind of protective screen like sunglasses there were no whispered concerns no side glances to see how she was holding up she was right in front of them busy in control instead to his surprise he found that he had become the center of attention new ears for old complaints the curfew during the war the fivemile restriction for aliens gas coupons all that over thank god and then in lower tones what was it really like now in germany you hear such stories and the newsreels you cant recognize things anymore that madman ben heard half of it distracted back at the cherokee his head noisy with questions a bottle that shouldnt be there someone else an idea once there you couldnt leave behind not for polite conversation so he nodded answering with only part of his mind and they backed away respecting what they took for grief not wanting to trouble him further but keeping an eye on him intrigued its like any colony liesl said when they got a moment they like to be with each other not the natives but they get a little bored too so youre something to talk about here comes heinrich be nice i dont know how he lives she leaned forward to kiss kaltenbachs cheek heinrich thank you it was lovely from here he said in german tapping his chest then turned to ben the rituals of introduction i didnt know ben said about his time in france getting people out yes many kaltenbach said still in german some by boat but that was difficult so spain over the pyrenees yes the mountain crossings were easier than the trains not so strict one guard maybe two sometimes you could walk in if you got up there imagine franz and alma at their age not hikers you know not young men like your brother its a very dramatic story excuse me liesl said theres salka very dramatic a film kaltenbach said i think so think of it everybody waiting to get out the noose tightening you know what we called the house villa espere visa but your brother acted it would be a tribute to him his story i have a treatment of this ill show it to you exit visa see what you think they could do it at continental thats where you are yes your brothers story it would be a gift to his memory ben looked at him feeling ambushed im not really at continental just putting something together there for the army and how had he heard about continental anyway ben marveled again at the speed of news here lasner in touch even on a train but youll read it youll see kaltenbach said an exciting film and you know i can work with another writer for the english but who knows the story better who lived it ben liesl said coming up to them a short plump woman in tow you have to meet salka shes everyones mother everyones cook the woman said taking bens hand they come for the chocolate cake not for me no your good heart kaltenbach said daniel liked it she said waving this off so maybe youll like it too come sunday any sunday you like thank you ill look forward even garbo comes sometimes kaltenbach said so lasner now hes letting people go to funerals on his time she said raising a finger make sure he pays you for the day he doesnt pay me for anything im still in the army youre at continental for free she said amused how did you know about continental i mean how does everybody hear these things salka looked at him puzzled its in polly you didnt know you should keep up she said a gentle tease of course she said catching herself on such a day who has time for papers she nodded to the room its too soon for this a young man but we dont pick our time do we no somebody else had i knew your father too tell me something ive always wondered why did he stay in germany the question mark of his life i dont know i suppose he thought hed be safe no one was safe she said a settled matter even then i dont think he thought about politics just movies otto children never know their parents when he was young he and berthold could argue for hours hours all the problems of the world no he knew she shook her head to make those comedies to stay for that he found the paper in the den already opened to pollys column off the chief ben kohler new at continental here early to attend funeral of brother dan after last weeks tragic accident the surprise death suspended production on the upcoming vera ralston picture which dan was slotted to helm word on the lot the pictures set to be a breakthrough for republics new star pollys prediction a new director and vera skates over this rough patch of ice to big box office the funeral just a plug for herb yates spell your name right ben looked up a burly man in a suit a little too tight for him stuck out his hand howard stein i just wanted to pay my respects i cant stay thank you ben said actually they got it wrong stein noticed the column logo polly she cant even spell her own used to be marx like groucho but also like karl somebody points this out to herone of the hitler youth she pals around withso the next day its marks ks youre not a fan that bitch ben smiled not a fan im with the csu you know her with the unions like another goon with a club he looked up at ben sorry for the language i dont think shes a joke is that how you knew dannythe union stein nodded he was a good friend to us when he first got here you dont forget that but not lately ben said no not lately he shrugged it happens people fall away its a hard place to hold on to something you want he looked around at the house you want a lot of things so you make some trades but he was a good man im sorry about this you just get in he said his voice gruffer moving away from anything soft few days those pickets i saw in front of paramountthat was you stein nodded studios want the union they already got not us why nottheyve been paying them off for years after willie bioff got sent up they tell everybody theyre cleaning house but nothing changes thats four years now sent up for what ben said not really paying attention a local dispute racketeering so youve got the head of the union behind bars its time for a change right your brother thought sowe all did and look four years later and were out there walking with signs and the studios are still paying off cheaper than paying the employees in a year like this when theyre making so much money its like sitting on a fucking oil well im sorry i didnt mean to get started this isnt the place he looked again at the newspaper and now weve got her making it worse now were all reds there werent any pickets at continental no you start with the majorsthe big five then everybody else comes in whos going to follow lasner he looked at ben not that hes any different dump the cash on some hotel bed and get yourself a new contract they like doing business that way its an outlaw town they still have that mentality you know one day theyre at a meeting the studio heads and i see them walking out of the commissary and i say to myself jesus fucking christ its the boys from chicago same look well this isnt the place he looked at ben hesitant i liked him he said shaking bens hand then glanced around the room its some place hes got here he turned back to ben i dont understand it he followed stein back into the busy main room halfhoping he could pass unnoticed out onto the terrace but liesl caught his eye flagging him down somehow the funeral had made them a temporary couple alert to each others signals she took his arm lightly lowering her voice as she steered him toward alma mahler eating pastry near the table she thinks youre ignoring her she whispered then to alma found but once they were past the introductions the sympathies there was little to say she was a woman of such regal selfabsorption that ben suspected she had no conversation outside herself so he fell back on the usual how she liked california for us it was very pleasant before franz died now i never go out but beforeyou know stravinsky is here schoenberg like europe with sunshine her eyes twinkled a little waiting for him to respond evidently a phrase that had worked before of course we were fortunate franzs success she let the rest of the thought hover there leaving ben to imagine the riches you know it was a promise he made he said if we survived he would write about lourdes and look so bernadette blessed us too who would have imagined it then such a success and the film she nodded accepting tribute of course not serious art like mahler gropius listing former lovers like credits but its important here to have a success its what they respect and of course its nice too to be comfortable look at poor heinrich in germany such an important name i remember passing a bookstore a whole window all kaltenbach no one else and here no one knows who he is the books arent translated no franz lion hans of course she said tipping her head toward liesl but heinrich its too european maybe so its hard for him we all help a little not charity we tell him a loan until better times but of course hes proud once in all the windows liesl said you were just in germany yes ben said surprised at the veering off its bad there everyone says heinrich wants to go back i want to be a writer again she said quoting but shaking her head well you know what its like i had a letter my friend beate she says people are like zombies numb theyre hungry ben said yes hungry alma said not even glancing at her own plate but not reading not reading heinrich they will again someday lets hope so anyway she looked up quickly as if she had been corrected but not here i think he doesnt have the popular touch heinrich like your brother he had the popular touch detectives she said airily sliding it in as easily as a pinprick heinrich is an artist they were rescued by kaltenbach slightly hunched like a courtier who came to say their car had arrived youll excuse us these cars they dont like to wait such delicious food he said to liesl but you must be tired all these people you should rest yes alma said it must be terrible for you she paused another prick so unexpected she patted liesls arm then nodded at ben and handed him her plate leading kaltenbach across the room tipping her head to people as she went just a hand on his elbow enough to move him along ben stared at it to push a man over youd need a tighter grip had danny screamed he must have at least a startled grunt only suicides made no noise grim with purpose not taken by surprise nobody had said but it might be in the police report is something wrong liesl said peering at him sorry he said snapping back is she always like that you dont like her liesl said a mock innocence then laughed the first time ben had seen her really smile she covered her mouth with her hand a girls gesture the police report tomorrow they went out on the terrace picking up wine glasses off a passing tray daniel didnt like her either what did they see in her stay on alma kokoschka mahler she had half the men in vienna she used to be a great beauty they say who says she laughed again she does mostly he looked at her caught by the laugh it seemed to come from some private part of her something you only saw in glimpses like her ease in the water i shouldnt she said putting the drink down theyve only started coffee its going by itself now he said you can sit one out she glanced up working out the idiom then took a sip of wine did you notice they dont talk about him anything else theyre embarrassed how are you doing he said a private question well almas gone so thats one thing she said evading it now theres only my father to worry about she nodded toward the end of the pool where two men were smoking cigars he always quarrels with my uncle well not always then its like this polite quarrels about what germany dieter says my father blames the people you know the article he wrote the german character and how can you blame the people it was hitler so back and forth theyre all like that she said looking around their house burned down and they argue about why it happened but its important to know why it happened you think so i dont know it doesnt change anything its gone they all want to go back but to the old days heimat do you me i almost died there once you dont get rescued twice i think who would marry me next time she tried to smile then looked away restive again well theres salka waving so mann must be leaving hell expectoh god not polly she was looking toward the pool again where polly marks had wedged herself between the brothersinlaw whos the guy in the gray suit do you know i saw him at the funeral he came with heri suppose he works for her ben smiled to himself i thought he was a cop a police why police she said her head jerking around but he wasnt just a legman why would you think that she said he looked at her but this wasnt the time not with people around them not with nothing more to offer than a feeling and the wrong bottle ill go play referee he said heading toward the pool the group at the end like actors in a silent were telling the story with their bodiesostermann leaning away from polly who was cornering him with attention her back to his brotherinlaw the legman off to the side smoking and watching them with the same quiet sweep hed used at the funeral hello again ben said to polly interrupting them she turned in midsentence caught slightly off guard trying to place him ben ostermann said cueing her but polly had already found him in her mental file and only gave him a quick nod before she went back to ostermann they sure sound like a front to me you think its all innocentim for world peace too who isnt and the next thing you know theyre using you your reputation the same rushed voice quivering do you think im so famous he said gently making light conversation no youre not just anybody you know that your name speaks i tell him he has to be careful dieter said polly didnt even turn brushing this off with a blink a relative from pasadena you listen to polly she said warners doesnt buy just anybody if you have any doubts people asking to use your name call me ive been here a long time turning over rocks thats very kind ostermann said flatly to take so much trouble its no trouble i love this country as we do he said a courtly half bow who took us in terrible about all this isnt it she said looking back at the house i dont know how liesl does it so strong she shook her head of course he was no angel but im not one to speak ill of the dead no she took his hand and patted it oddly flirtatious glad we could talk well have lunch soon she looked at ben you never mentioned you were going to continental she said a black mark holding out all that needed to be said without being signaled the man in the gray suit slipped away from the oleander and followed her so it begins ostermann said slowly enemies everywhere i wondered what would happen when they won now look like germany last time when we lost i love my country thats what they said in berlin remember this to dieter who looked at ben hans is writing about that time so its all he thinks about then to ostermann dont pack your bags yet its not the same it starts the same i remember it when youve been here as long as i have when did you come ben said thirtyseven with trude i wanted hans to bring anna too it was still possible then perhaps if they hadnt waited things would have turned out differently ostermann went stiff annoyed evidently a sore point between them the sister who died but were all here now dieter said making peace you dont want to go back ben said testing liesls theory now my work is here all my colleagues hitler was a catastrophe for german science but a gift to america youre a scientist ben said surprised not in pictures not even connected another california no no he said diffident a teacher mathematics a teacher ostermann said playfully very distinguished in germany a doctor doctor but not at cal tech dieter said pleasantly one doctor only thank you for being there ben said at the hospital dieter nodded you know what he liked the observatory on mount wilson not the science of it he was like hans hereeverything a mystery even the simplest numbers but he liked to see the stars its a good lens you know a hundred inches the largest would you like to go sometime it was hard during the war but now we can take visitors again you have to stay over the road is too dangerous at night you mean camp there no we have places to stay dormitories for the staff a few rooms for guests it used to be very popular with the other stars he said smiling hubble liked to take them up fairbanks pickford all of them you can see the pictures so if you like ill arrange it a family excursion but now he looked around ready to go a sad occasion its a pity you did not get a chance no only at the hospital for a minute he spoke ben shook his head not wanting to go back no last words im sorry dieter said taking bens hand so well make a trip hans he said now reaching for ostermanns hand be well you should listen to her you know that woman no petitions no letters in the paper it draws attention to all of us ostermann watched him leave a politer version of almas exit then sighed and busied himself relighting his cigar more american than the americans except for the accent he thinks no one hears it he nodded toward the city below spread across the flat basin look at that you know every building you see its the first there was nothing on this land before imagine in europe we live on layers here its only the first so what will it become its interesting but do any of us care we dont really live here im still in berlin my study even its like before writing you like the title just the year no one here will be interested its for me what happened to us manns writing bible stories bible stories after all this the conscience of his country i thought that was you he smiled a little the bad conscience maybe im sorry such gloomy talk your brother used to call it the exile mentality always halfempty but it was different for him he never had to worry about leaving being asked to leave he was born here sometimes i think we got out with our skins but our livestheyre somewhere inbetween still waiting for the knock not here were still watched he caught bens skeptical look and nodded were german we have a sixth sense for this now the phone i think sometimes the mail i know really theres a group more exiles in mexicoit was easier to get a visa there so they write to me sometimes and i think the letters are being read you know opened and resealed so a test i tell them to write in english and you know what the letters arrive three days earlierthe censor doesnt have to translate so i know but why did they think you were a nazi you ostermann smiled weakly anybody foreign theres no logic to this its like polly you start turning over rocks you have to find something or why did you start so you keep doing it im used to it in germany it was the samewell worse but you have to be careful you say things and it might go against you with immigration its better since the war but brecht says theyre still watching him even now he shook his head such a dangerous person in santa monica he moved away from the potted geraniums taking a chair and leaning back in it his eyes still on the view its an irony yes what we came to escape like poor connie veidt playing nazis they wanted to kill him there and then here it was all he can do be a nazi it was the voice like liesl like liesl ben said confused the accent you know she was an actress small theaters only but good i think of course the father says that but salka says she had talent and then we left and she lost her voice couldnt danny get her work here even lorre an actor like that couldnt play american he smiled mr moto a japanese a girl with a german accent not so many parts for her and you know i think daniel liked her at home so she gave it up became the hausfrau and your translator yes ostermann said looking up a help to me too i admit and now its a worry when someone dies this way you think i never knew him you turn it over and over in your mind trying to make sense of it yes ben said an almost involuntary response everything becomes a lie your own life i dont want that for her but everything wasnt no not everything but which he drew on the cigar how little we know about each other he said brooding even when we think we know gower gulch at the police station he was directed to a basement room that resembled a post office willcall window with rows of files behind accident report kohler youre with the insurance his brother companies usually get it direct not through the family but i could see it you could ask the clerk said then got tired of himself and went to get the folder in fact there was little ben didnt already know a more precise time no eyewitnesses to the fall itself neighbors alerted by the sounds of garbage cans knocked over when the body hit an unexpected detail no scream at least none reported police response time alcohol in the room dizzy spells not even necessary herealready unsteady taken to hollywood presbyterian with head injuries and multiple lacerations several boxes with numbers and acronyms for internal use everything consistent i was told there were pictures told how they took pictures the clerk stared at him annoyed then checked the report again glancing at one of the numbered boxes give me a minute he said going back to the file room a martyrs walk he returned opening a manila envelope we dont usually show these to family what do i need a court order the clerk passed them over just a good stomach danny in the hospital had been hard to look at but still a patient sanitized wrapped in bandages the lacerations stitched closed here his face was torn open and the gashes poured blood his head lying in a pool of it ben flipped through the picturesthe body from several angles limp legs twisted a shot of the balcony for a trajectory the alley crowded with onlookers and ambulance workers crime scene photographs why werent these in the file youre lucky theyre here at all shouldve been tossed no reason to keep them in an accident file can i have them police property which you were going to toss still police property what do you want them for genuinely puzzled looking at ben more carefully now a morbid souvenir how about some paper then i need to take some notes for the insurance the clerk reached below and brought up some paper next time bring your own thats taxpayer money im a taxpayer dont start he went over to his desk and lit a cigarette ben held up one photo then jotted down a note waiting for the clerk to get bored and turn away the one thing you learned in the army the answer was always no unless you could get away with it all bureaucracies were alike the clerk still smoking looked up at the clock ben drew out the rest of the photos negatives clipped to the last he copied another note then began feeding paper into the envelope when the clerk answered the phone he slid the pictures under his newspaper added some more paper to the envelope and closed it pushing it back along the counter thanks for your help he said turning away with the newspaper the cop waved back the day clerk at the cherokee could have been the policemans cousin the same wary indifference you here with the key i thought it was paid through the month youre going to use it the man said oddly squeamish i might i mean its paid for the clerk gave a yourchoice shrug anybody else have keys theyre not supposed to just the tenant otherwise we have to change the locks why just wondering if you ever saw anybody else use the apartment anybody else who a lady maybe im on days its quiet days you were on that night i saw you in the police pictures the clerk looked up a new scent in the air just the word police thats right i was filling in whats this all about im his brother i just want to know what happened he felli guess whatever it was it was a mess and you didnt see anyone go up that night the police asked me this i told them ill tell youno one i didnt even see him he used the back door i guess all i know is i didnt see anybody so she could have done that too without being seen if she had a key which shes not supposed to have shes not supposed to do a lot of things that i dont know i just run the board and collect the rent weve never had any trouble here you know never i got a lot of people upset about this maybe moving out many stay long more and more used to be people didnt want the extra service expense but the wars been great for us hard to find anything and we already had the phone lines you couldnt get a phone during the war so we did all right he make any calls that night id remember that you might no sure ben raised his eyes the cliche promise of a tip the clerk frowned im not looking for anything here i dont remember i dont keep tabs half the people i dont even know im on days right the only reason i knew him is i rented him the room so you wouldnt necessarily have recognized everybody not unless theyre here during the day youre asking more questions than the police did whats this about im trying to find out who else came here he didnt take the room to be alone the family need to know there might be money in it for her bait that bobbed back not even a nibble then i hope you find her now how about i get back to work are you going to keep the room or what hey al this to the mailman coming in with his bag joel hows life overrated hah the mailman said opening the front panel of the boxes with the post office key and beginning to fill them catalogues from bullocks a girl in a sundress ordinary life let me know if you want to extend joel said the lease its month to month and he was leaving at the end so i need to know you mean he gave you notice ben said surprised because the affair was over joel nodded end of the month involuntarily his eyes shifted toward the alley i guess he had other plans ben went over to the elevator then turned when he came in to renthow did he know there was an ad no we just use the window joel said jerking his thumb toward it put out a sign somebody always sees it like i say its been busy since the war what with the phone the apartment was exactly as hed left it tidy with the empty stillness of unoccupied rooms the brandy bottle was on the counter untouched not even moved for dusting he opened the french window looking down from the balcony just as he had before but imagining it differently you wouldnt need a lot of leverage with the low raileven a woman could have done it but wouldnt danny have reacted reached out grabbed something no marks on the rail he went out to the hall looking down the back stairs the door that led to the roof someone could have gone up there waited it out then slipped away after the excitement died down but why would she have to a transient buildingnot even the clerk knew all the tenants by sight shed be just another face in the crowd why bother with the roof walk down cherokee to hollywood boulevard and hop a red car unless shed been driving parked around the corner then no one would see her at all ben went back inside and sat in the quiet the empty bathroom the empty desk whatever prints thered been would have been wiped away by the maid the fact was there would never be any physical evidence the how was unknowable the only way in was the why downstairs he put the keys in his pocket then took them out againone for the room one for the back no mailbox key but why would danny get any mail an apartment registered to another name just a place where they changed the sheets still they must have given him one if only to clean out the catalogues and restaurant flyers he turned back to the clerk i dont have a mail key he said for c youd better find it well have to charge we cant keep making keys ben looked at the mailman he get mail here collins c mister you think i keep track if its us mail we deliver it but you might noticeif it piled up or if someone never got any never id buy him a beer he waved his hand toward the boxes everybody gets mail did you check his desk the clerk said sometimes people keep it there but it wasnt in his desk or in the desk at home at least not in any of the shallow paperclip trays in the top drawer where it logically should be and not in any of the boxes on top ben began taking papers out of the drawer not rummaging through as he had that first day but systematically putting them in pilescanceled checks bill receipts he started with the address book as if somehow a number would leap out at him but none did who would put his girlfriend in a book an odd scrap of paper that no one would see even a matchbook cover but not in a book the checks were more interesting like shards of pottery you piece together to reveal a whole society tree surgeons and pool tilers landscapers and caterers an account at magnins a life so far removed from bens that it seemed to be otherworldly like the thick terry robes by the pool the drawers of cashmere he thought of howard stein looking around and this was only someone with a b series about detectives mayer was the highest paid man in america still nobody had killed him because liesl kept a running account at magnins he flipped through the stubs no checks to the cherokee arms presumably a cash expense discreet the appointment book was even less revealing no coded notes m just straightforward studio meetings and doctors and dentists no wallet either but he must have had one maybe in his dresser with the tie clips and cuff links he crossed the hall to the dressing room and opened the door that covered the builtin shelves the inside panel a mirror to check your tie he reached for the top drawer then stopped standing motionless the mirror some optical trick reflected the mirror on the partly opened bathroom door a leg resting on the rim of the tub just one her hands moving up it slowly as if she were putting on nylons moving together toward her thigh then out of the mirror the hands again the same smooth drawing up rubbing not nylons some kind of cream maybe suntan oil he stood there unable to move his eyes fixed on the mirror a perfect leg arched he imagined his hands moving along it instead of hers slick with oil an image that came like a pulse beat fast involuntary now the leg leaned farther in more thigh showing the hands moving close the door instead he held his breath mesmerized wanting the hands to go farther he could feel himself fill with blood unexpected just like that without thought he wanted to see more where the leg met the body but it dropped and the other one came up the same hand motion just for him even more exciting because she was unaware what could he say if she saw him find the wallet and get out but he stayed still not breathing the other thigh now an almost unbearable second her sex just beyond the edge of the mirror and then it moved forward not hair a wedge of bathing suit then more her whole body bent over moving into the mirror her head turning looking toward her door he closed the cabinet a snap reflex and crossed back to the office his body flushed slightly shaky had she seen him the mirrors had to reflect each other didnt they what would she have seen standing there mouth halfopen looking where he shouldnt eyes fixed caught in a kind of trance he picked up the checkbook again pretending he could read the stub notes listening for footsteps what are you doing he looked up startled feeling caught she was pinning her hair on her way to the pool i was justgoing through his things i should have asked nervous waiting for her to say something but she seemed not to have seen him in the mirror no please somebody has to ive been putting it off ive been a coward a little bit in case i foundyou know if its somebody i know she said turning to go now anxious her movements as darting as theyd been that first day at union station a new idea did he leave a will the lawyer has it everything comes to me so that parts easy oh she said a handtomouth gesture i never thought is there anything you would like im sure he ben shook his head i dont need anything anyway youre his wife she smiled a little trying to be light its lucky were living now not like in the old days bible times you would have to take care of me the brothers wife like a sheep or a goat id belong to you he looked up at her thrown off balance then passed it off by smiling back i couldnt afford it he motioned to the check stubs magnins alone you think im extravagant really it was daniel he liked going out he liked me to dress and now how much is left i havent thought she stopped and came over to the desk for a cigarette her hands nervous i havent thought about anything really what im going to do since you wont take me she said smiling again blowing out smoke i should sell the house my fathers already asking come live with me but its enough the way it is miltons daughter an apartment somewhere i guess but id miss the pool all said quickly as if she were filling time avoiding something else you dont have to stay here i couldnt leave my father anyway i like it here maybe im lazy everyone complains so ugly so boring but i like it she started to put on her bathing cap then stopped i know why youre looking she said suddenly nodding to the desk you want to know who it was the other one but what does it matter now he took a breath because we need to know i dont think he killed himself i dont think he tripped she said nothing for a minute staring back her body almost weaving youre not serious she said finally her voice faint there was someone else in the room how can you know that its the only way it makes sense sense she said still trying to collect herself to think that things like that dont happen not in real life do you think he was a gangster thats not the only reason why then she was so jealous he was leaving her maybe it was the wife maybe you think that isnt it always the wife she said her voice rushed flighty not always he said calmly she took up the cap again fidgeting its not true think what it means it means he didnt kill himself her shoulders moved an actual shiver it changes everything to think this why would anyone kill him i dont know yet and you think its her shes so strong to push a man like daniel ouf she shook her head dismissive shes a lead he got the apartment for her she nodded at the desk what do you expect to find a number maybe clues like his detectives she said ben you think im imagining this no she said her face softer i think you want it to be true its easier for you she frowned but how could it be true she said not really talking thinking to make someone do that kill you he wasnt like that she looked back at him its so hard for you to accept this what he did he didnt the police think so the police made a mistake but not you just like him you get some idea and then you wont let go its not some idea because its better this way he didnt do it isnt it she said nothing at a loss then turned to go theres more she said flicking her hand toward the piles on the desk boxes from his office in the screening room the next installment of partners maybe itll give you an idea you think im crazy not crazy something i dont know what like him so sure you dont want to believe it i want it to be over its something you learn when you leave you cant look back not if you want to keep going hes gone she said and if im right we just walk away she held his gaze for a second her eyes troubled then turned again and started for the pool he looked at the piles on the desk check stubs and an address book receipts the life you could trace not the one that rented a room in cash he reached for his wallet and took out tim kellys card someone interested in the other one kelly answered on the second ring heard you had a talk with joel the day guy at the arms heard from who himself i told him to let me know if anyone came around wanting to have a chat and there you were the same breezy tilt to his voice like a hat pushed back on his head and he did this for free ben said curious there was a snort on the other end since you bring it up if were going to help each other out i could use a little contribution to the tip box i cant put everything on the paper he didnt know anything joel not much but you have to go through him to get to the others the maid say so its worth something spread the wealth how much im not keeping books buy me a drink some night and throw a twenty on the bar and im a happy guy okay ben said sitting back interested so what did the maid say her favorite tenant hardly ever there she doesnt even have to make the bed so he doesnt sleep over we knew that or do much of anything else not exactly a hot affair neat though no stains oh ben said a peephole world hed never imagined not in detail what about the usual night clerk joel said he was just filling in check night guy knew him saw him a few times never saw the playmate so she used the back or they arrived different times or she said she was going to some other room and didnt therere all kinds of ways to do this none of which so far had occurred to ben but if she didnt want to be seeni thought that was the idea that was the hope a face theyd know which is still the way it looks to me why this careful their own place back doors nobody sees them togetheryou go to this kind of trouble for who some dentists wife you still have any credit left with joel it wouldnt take much what could you get a list of the tenants why you think shes living there wheres the sense in that nowhere but maybe somebody she knows joel says he just sticks a sign in the window when a room comes up but how many times would danny be walking on cherokee so how did he know about the room for a second there was silence on the other end okay its an idea somebody she knows a helper like juliets nurse what nothing lets see whos there i dont know what else to do i cant find anything here forget there you got better places to look when do you start work what do you mean well while youre wasting time making joel nervous i spent a little time downtown always pays boys keep their ears open and like a drink after work and and its just like i thought he said almost a grin over the wire hes a jumper then he trips and who gets the report changed didnt i say studios but why would republic want to change it thats the beauty part they didnt the favor was for continental he first had to report to his commanding officer in culver city but that took less than an hour his reassignment had been waiting for days and the film hed shipped from the signal corps already sent over to continental along with hal jasper to cut it colonel hill in fact seemed eager to hurry him out too now that the war was over fort roach had the feel of a camp waiting for orders to pull out an uncertain mix of khaki uniforms and opennecked hawaiian shirts no one bothered to salute he was at the continental gate before noon this time there were pickets a handful with signs walking slowly back and forth more a polite show of force than a threat no shouting or heckling they let him pass through without a word you go to mr jenkins the guard said checking his clipboard admin room two hundred and one he pointed to an office building with florida jalousie windows that faced gower park over there in visitors till they get you a slot as a boy hed loved the surrealism of the babelsberg lot the street fronts and women in marie antoinette wigs and sailing ships beached against a wall at the end of a street now what struck him was the blur of activity outside in the dusty orange groves and parking lots things moved at a desert pace here everyone seemed to be running lategrips pushing flats and carpenters and extras filing out of wardrobe everyone hurrying while the sunny oasis over the wall stretched out for a nap the look was utilitarianno country club flower beds or moorish towers lasner hadnt even bothered with the spanish touches the other studios couldnt resist the arcades and fake adobe walls here buildings were whitewashed or painted a cheap industrial green the only visible trees were the bottle brush palms up in the hills and a few live oaks behind one of the sound stages probably the western set inside things were sleekermodern offices with metal trim and secretaries with bright nails and good clothes he thought of the offices in frankfurt the piles of unsorted papers and drip pails and girls with hungry pinched faces this was the other side of the world untouched not even a shortage of nail polish the war had only made it richer everyone in the hall smiled at him room was the corner presumably lasners office and jenkins was next door ben was shown in and announced without even a preliminary buzz clearly expected or had the guard called up from the gate jenkins was slight with a boyish unlined face sharp eyes and hair so thinned that he was nearly bald he came out from behind the desk with the easy grace of a cat as smooth as his camel hair sport jacket im bunny jenkins mr l asked me to get you settled hes on the phone with new york he said implying a daily ordeal ben looked at him more closely brian jenkins he said yes that brian jenkins he said wearily which dates you the kids on the lot havent the faintest not exactly a comfort but well we all change he said a puton archness ill bet you used to look younger too just the voice still english would have placed him faces wrinkle but voices never change he was still the boy in the orphan then the reworking of oliver twist and the other fancy dress adventures that had followed ruffled shirts and wide liquid eyes everybodys waif sorry i didnt mean never mind it has been a while they dont know freddie either funny isnt it they brought me over to keep jackie in line and then they brought freddie to keep me in line i mean really freddie they could have saved a ton and just let the hair do it he touched his head freddie batholomew mm he said glancing up as if ben hadnt been following with all his wavy curls still i hear and much good it did him they dont know him either he said nodding toward the window and the anonymous kids on the lot well lets get you started im the tour guide he wants me to show you japan which means the serious tour i gather youre here to give us some class he said that ive seen your budget you might want to explain the project to me a little ive already had polly marks on the horn i said darling if you dont know how would i he hasnt even arrived yet but shell be back walk with me oh and youre expected for dinner saturday that must have been some chat the two of you had on the train he never has line producers to the housenot this soon anyway thats what i am a line producer well you have your own budget and nobody seems to be in charge of you not you me oh im a glorified assistant technically vicepresident operations which is a nice way of saying i do whatever he needs me to do you know you grow up on a set theres not much you dont learn about the business i mean in other words you run the place bunny looked at him no mr l runs the place every nook you wouldnt want to make a mistake about that they were almost in the hall when the phone rang bunny stopped glancing over at his secretary she covered the receiver mouthing a name at him hold on a sec i have to take this he went over to the phone rosemary i thought you were being fitted he listened for a while concentrating but darling shes the best i asked for her have you looked at the sketches forget the mirror we never see ourselves not properly i tell you what ill swing by in an hour all right but meanwhile all smiles yes you dont want her to yes i know but she used to work for travis she sewed for him a pause travis banton he dressed marlene rosemary now go have a ciggie and calm down and ill be over later all smiles after another minute of reassurance he hung up facing ben again a little crise de nerfs he said lightly still thats the business i know youre going to make a documentary show us how ghastly it all was he said affecting a shiver but thats not the business you know what it is pictures attractive people thats all its ever been so you want to look your best he put his hand to his head again smiling slyly keep your hair come on ill show you japan they made it out of the building without another interruption bunny giving a running description as they went thats payroll and accounting youd get your check there but i gather you dont get a check a point to be cleared up the armys still paying me he looked at the closed door theyd have a list wouldnt they every employee if were paying them why in case i was looking for someone check the phone directory bunny said simply therell be one on your desk he looked over at ben as if he were hearing the question again then let it go weve got you in b building next door mr l wanted you in admin but theres no room at the inn so youre out in the stable be grateful in the endnobody looking over your shoulder i wish i were there sometimes im afraid youll have to share a secretary i wasnt sure how much help youd need thats fine bunny someone said waving hello howd you get the name ben said you know no ones ever asked all these years not rabbits pets i mean my mother when i was little because i got my lines right away you know quick as a anyway it stuck editing rooms over there i understand you got hal back for us hes a great favorite of mr ls an alist project he said leaving it open wanting to know how involved lasner would be how old were you when you started in the womb i dont know four or five before i could read shed say the lines and id have to remember them but then you grow up nobody makes it past that look at temple who wants to see her necking how did you end up here through fay mrs l he explained yes we met at the train station did you he said another opening then went back to the thread a great ladynot exactly thick on the ground out here and smart but she started late so she needed somebody to help you know which fork where how to do this and that so me anyway the more i did for her the more i got to know mr l and he figured there were things i could do for him too so it all just happened here we are he opened the door to a sound stage and flicked on the light ben had thought japan would mean a madame butterfly set tea house and garden but this was japan itselfa huge threedimensional model made of plaster set up table height on a series of trestles that covered most of the floor its built to scale bunny said every bay river took months mr ls very proud of it but what you set the camera up there on the crane and you move it along what would be the flight plan pilot watches the film he knows what hes going to see when he gets there the exact topography a craftsmans pride ben walked over mountains cities before you released the bombs up close just plaster and canvas like a train village under a christmas tree this must have cost bunny nodded it was the time we had special effects do it after hours so you run up overtime the army just paid for the materials he caught bens surprise our contribution to the war effort we didnt just hand out doughnuts at the canteen what are you going to do with it now well thats the question isnt it its just sitting here taking up space but mr l cant bring himself to get rid of it the army doesnt want it they can do actual aerial photography now funny thing is the film qualitys not as good they were better off with this they made a circle of the back lot past the prop department a hangar full of furniture and the new york set everyone nodded or acknowledged bunny as if he were taking roll call lasner caught up with them on sound stage in front of a plywood hellcat fighter sliced in half a few grips were adjusting lights fixed on the painted flat sky but everyone else had gone to lunch well at last lasner said putting his hand on bens shoulder everything all right at home yes thanks hell of a thing anyway youre here bunny have you all set up anything you need see him its like talking to me he turned to bunny whats this about rosemarys dress good news travels fast i happened to be over there what did you think what do i know youre the one knows this stuff he paused she never complains shes nervous thats all itll be fine he looked at lasner its already paid for dont pinch this is the picture we put her across so whats that worth ill look at the dress bunny said case closed ben watched the play between them a practiced volley its like talking to me lasner nodded then turned to the plane two more weeks on this think we can get it out before november we still have to score it the longer we wait who the hells going to want to see a war picture now would you he said to ben im asking you seriously these last two years you show any goddam thing you do business now we got all these guys coming back kids over there seeing things like you did what do they want maybe theyre sick of this he said gesturing to the plane war pictures not with dick marshall bunny said indicating the pilot seat hes had three in a row thats no guarantee maybe hayworth thats it and that prick cohn has her he cocked his head toward the studio across gower then looked at ben you got the message about saturday just a few people bring somebody nice he left them at the door heading back to his phones it makes him crazy bunny said cohn having hayworth why they both started out down here same street you dont expect to get a star like that not here well maybe rosemary will do it for him shes worked hard enough i thought it was all magic it helps if you help lets get you back i met cohn in europe ben said as they walked you get around bunny said raising an eyebrow having fun with it i was an interpreter cohn into english ben smiled almost hes a little rough around the edges and he speaks so warmly of you a policeman passed touching his fingers to his hat mr jenkins bert bunny said back not an actor studio police we have our own force under you operations ben said thinking its a small force and who deals with the outside police what do you mean you know runs interference if somebody gets in trouble you think this is metro benny thau and his house detectives there no wonder just handling mickeys a fulltime job the rest of us just toddle off to bed and say our prayers like good children why do you need to get a ticket fixed already ben shook his head thank somebody for what getting an accident report changed changed to make it an accident you know danny kohler was my brother bunny looked at him carefully mr l mentioned it somebody at continental got the report on him changed saved the family some embarrassment so according to whom the police ben shrugged people talk through their hats we dont have that kind of influence everybody says the studios have an in with the police look before you run away with yourself let me tell you how things work somebody drives when hes had a little too much to drink and naturally publicity wants to keep that out of the papers so we make a nice donation to the benevolent fund and people are nice back when they can be strictly parking ticket stuff the kind of thing youre talking aboutnobody here can do that not even you i thought you might not even me in fact not me i just wanted to thank and id hear about it i hear most things on the lot somebodys telling you stories anyway why would we your brother wasnt at continental maybe he had a friend here ben said looking directly at him bunny returned the look then sighed do you know what our police do they check the padlocks make sure the lights are turned off equipments where it should be not walking off the lot theyre guards theyre not on the phone with downtown fixing cases somebody was ben said bunny stared at him a standoff so you keep saying he turned away leading them around a corner here we are b building i gather you asked for frank cabot for the narration ill see what i can do but i cant take him off a picture if its shooting i put a contract player list on your pilein case hes not available when do you want to record its not written yet youll want to hop to then not really something for the hols is it and hal jasper likes to take his time its worth it but you cant hurry him youre just in here walking a little faster now eager to get away but then caught at the door bunny lou katz you remember julie julie sherman shes making a test julie nodded and smiled her lips moist with gloss she was in lowcut satin held up by a single diagonal strap lou hovering glanced nervously at ben not recognizing him but not wanting to offend of course bunny said nice to see you everything okay they take care of you in makeup yes everyones been wonderful she said meaning it a pleasant voice modulated not what ben expected youll be too sweetheart katz said bunny we appreciate this youre not going to be disappointed they said you didnt want the song lou musicals here i just thought to get the full range this is a real talent julie blinked her only sign of protest but otherwise kept smiling evidently used to being discussed you were on the train she said acknowledging ben with mr lasner yes and you were with paulette selling bonds right she smiled pleased to be remembered bunny glanced at them taking this in his attention diverted bunny well catch up with you later katz said checking his watch youre going to like this one maybe they can run it for you with the dailies im looking forward to it he said politely their cue to leave then turned to ben paulette is there anyone you havent met yet whoever called the police bunny stared at him so you can send a thankyou note just to be polite it means that much to you he cocked his head toward the building behind them third door down on the left nice to have you with us we could use something different mr ls right you know nobody on gods earth is going to want to see dick marshall shooting down zeros let me know if theres anything else you need he headed to the admin building glancing back once over his shoulder the office was adequate but basictypewriter couch venetian blindsa place for passing through not unlike the apartment at the cherokee ben sat down at the desk annoyed with himself for pressing bunny the studio stringpuller now wary protecting his flank things had been stacked on his desk in neat piles budget a provisional timeline schedule technician availabilities an inventory of film already sent over from fort roach the contract player list personnel forms the signal corps had had all the sloppy confusion of the army arrangements so haphazard they made the work itself feel improvised this was a precision machine waiting for him to set it in motion to make something important about millions and all he could fix on was a police favor worrying it like a sore tooth unable to leave it alone he picked up the phone and got an outside line meet any movie stars yet kelly said when he heard bens voice who made the call from continental you tell me he didnt give you a name whoever you talked to that would make it real i get a tip but that doesnt mean it ever happened my lucky guess and nobody asks how i got there anyway who would it be somebody in publicity whoever who do you think makes these calls it wouldnt be somebody further up the food chain not likely they like the cleaner air were down here with the messenger service the point is whod they call for who do they protect they protect themselves they protect the talent this case id go with the talent hes not renting an apartment for a business meeting just keep your ears open something like this happens theres always talk i like the makeup girls they always know whos been out the night before one look ask them out for a drink youll hear whats going on get in their pants youll hear everything you dont even have to pay speaking of which i could use a little contribution why i got the resident list you wanted from joel past year right he got all huffy why did i want it damned if i knew why do i i told you danny wasnt driving around looking for for rent signs he knew the building so how maybe she used to live there or somebody knew somebody or somebody heardhow far do you want to stretch it he had to know about it somehow if were lucky theres a match okay ill swing by and leave it for you at the gate maybeyou got me curiousmaybe ill run it by pollys files she never throws anything out every rumor since fattys coke bottle she lets you go through her files are you kidding but it so happens it takes her hours to drink her lunch and the secretarys a friend of mine you have friends all over and im just the lowlife run a studio you got the whole town in your pocket except the police according to bunny he sat for a minute looking at the desk then pulled over the contract list work backward who would they protect a woman worth making a call for he checked the credits at fox or metro there would have been a slew of names but lasner borrowed stars so the featured players here made a much shorter list speaking parts not hatcheck girls or window shoppers recognizable rosemary miller ruth harris someone who met danny on the side already married one of these few easy to check against the cherokee records assuming shed used her real name danny hadnt he thought of lasner on the train who changes names actors or danny with something to hide he spent the rest of the day with hal jasper a short wiry man still in uniform with a permanent five oclock shadow that suggested sprouting hair everywhere else he was one of those technicians for whom film was tactile a physical thing not another form of theater there was a reverence in the way he handled it each splice a weighed decision hed already screened most of the footage waiting for ben and now was full of ideas about it eager to start for the opening he said framing his hands there wasnt enough in the dachau reel but if you add some of the other materialbelsen i guess right you can go in just the way a gi would the fence the gates everything first time you see it walk in looking around what the hell happened here let it sink in the faces you dont say a word just look put a big chalk mark on the floor a crime story ben said its the way in i mean if you see it that way a crime ben said thinking why we need trials trials how the hell do you judge people like this i dont know unless you string them all up then youre doing what they did ben looked up at the intensity in his voice thinking of germans in greatcoats with attack dogs not the kids eating out of px garbage cans both things true signal corps said theres more footage coming but let me start with this ben nodded feeling like an assistant the machinery of the studio already whirring around him there were technician reqs to fill out and discarded film to be sorted and sent back to fort roach so it was late by the time the gate called to say there was a delivery for him kelly almost forgotten it was still light but the lot was quiet now only a few distant carpenter hammers banging on a set somewhere in the admin screening rooms theyd be setting up the rushes for lasner and the producers but most of continental had gone home the east sides of the sound stages were in shadows anything ben asked taking the manila envelope nada kelly said only a red if he is pollys got them under every bed so who knows a woman ben said interested no guy no connection probably some name she got from the tenney committee they feed her stuff they cant usecant prove then she runs it and they watch what happens what pops out of the hole cozy and nothing else not at the old cherokee you know what though shes got frank cabot as a fruit thatll come as a surprise to his exwives he grinned or maybe not where does she get this stuff anyway little birds chirp chirp and once in a while she gets hold of something real and makes him sing you wouldnt want me to and of course he doesnt cant so he feeds her someone else nice kelly shrugged hooray for hollywood dont work too late he said making a mock salute with one finger let me know if you get a match but no one on the cherokee list appeared in the continental directory ben looked at the short list of contract players hed set apart not even similar name changes like kohler becoming collins who changed names actors didnt any live at the cherokee grateful for the phone lines somebody there had to be in pictures he picked up the personnel form from his todo pile and stopped one box for name one for birth name the office files would have everyones real name maybe the one used to rent apartments he filled out his own form an excuse to hold in his hand then took the lists and walked over to the admin building it was dark behind the translucent glass panel but the door luckily was unlocked part of the protected village behind the studio gate ben turned on the light a wall of filing cabinets he started with the most likely featured players working quickly arlene moore used her real name but ruth harris had been herschel rosemary miller risa meyer ben smiled to himself hollywoods own aryanization program but neither of them nor any other birth name was on the cherokee list when he heard the voices outside in the hall he pushed the file back in the drawer closing it gently so it wouldnt slam a click inaudible to whoever was coming down the stairs how could he have explained it a clumsy snoop after hours he was almost at the door when it opened oh its you bunny said lasner behind him i saw the light i was just dropping off my personnel form ben said indicating the sheet on the desk so diligent and good bunny looked quickly over the room as if he expected to find someone else they should keep this locked he went over to the far filing case testpulling it open looking relieved when it didnt budge well the salaries are so thats all right we wouldnt want people dipping into that would we makes for ill feeling up and down he switched off the light following ben out into the hall youre here late lasner said pleased you meet hal weve already started hes just what i need thanks for what did i tell you hes got an instinct his father was a cutter you know with sennett its in the blood like you you on your way out come look at the rushes sol bunny said his tone suggesting a breach of some unspoken protocol if youre going to learn the business sol said bunny looked at ben annoyed then bowed to the inevitable mostly bridge shots tonight fair warning no comments to the directors understood theyre touchy about tourists but in fact slumped down in their chairs they seemed to expect a barrage of arrows at least fired by lasner eddie what the hells the light on the left what is that sun on the wing except he doesnt see it just us we can cover it sol the director said not bothering to turn around itll be fine sol and bunny were perched in the last row of the small screening room everyone else scattered at random leaving them a buffer zone of space lasner talked throughout a backandforth flow but bunny sat quietly looking over fingertips raised to his mouth in a pyramid a line manager carefully checking for scratch marks on the screen dick marshall was leaning forward in his pilot seat eyes squinting taking sights on an unseen fighter plane then a closeup his face registering the hit a cover shot another there was no sound of gunfire or people yelling or the popping of aa fire outsideall the things ben rememberedjust dick marshalls face taking aim taut with cold calculation after a few more cockpit shots they were in a western saloon the camera turning away from the bar to take in the front door the looming shadow behind it the same shot another angle there seemed to be no order to the sequence just what had come out of the lab first now a city street someone getting out of a cab the cab pulling away a womans back squaring her shoulders as she walks into an apartment building ben wondered how many pictures were in production who kept track of the output not just dialogue scenes but these bridge shots filler seconds of screen time the whole days work reduced to a few nuts and bolts then welded to other pieces of film like steel sections in the kaiser yard one ship a day rolling down the slipway when the clip ended lasner started squirming bored by the sudden lull wheres rosemary shes coming bunny said his head still resting on his fingertips the screen crackled to life the first clip with sound the snap of the clapper with the take number rosemary was standing at a bar smoking her lowcut dress lined with beads little darts of light dana andrews the star on loan was questioning her the kind of detective who didnt bother to take off his hat indoors we can do this hard or easy he said the rich baritone turned tough i dont know where he is rosemary said disillusioned not meeting his eye you expect me to believe that im telling you i dont know she rubbed out the cigarette in an ashtray he left me then one of you got lucky a new clip a fresh cigarette this time facing him im telling you i dont know the ashtray he left me then one of you got luck a second lucky one of you got fucking lucky laughing now the crew laughing behind him somebody yelling cut wonderful lasner said a thousand a week hes laughing another clip this time without a flub rosemary turning away a more sympathetic nuance the camera close on her better bunny said how do you like the dress another inch and her tits are in the shot thats her character no what you want here is she should show them but she doesnt want to show them eddie bunny said to the director a few rows down keep watching a voice said in the dark and there it was in the next clip andrews looking down a gesture with her arm the camera more aware of her body than before but her own feelings more ambivalent just what lasner seemed to have ordered up thats it he said christ eddie i dont have to tell you anything you know where i got that andrews he said lets try it i look down her dress but dont tell her im going to see how she reacts and hes right the arm goes up she doesnt even know shes doing it but now we know her nice actors lasner said there was more of rosemary reaction shots closeups all gleaming like her beads then a kiss with andrews which she first resisted then gave in to after that a series without andrews simply raising her head her hair swept up now the way liesls had been at union station ben leaned forward not unlike lieslharder her mouth thinner and her face lacquered tight in studio makeup but the same kind of look the same cheekbones men married the same woman over and over or was that just an old wives tale but shed be someone the studio would protect worth safety shots and endless closeups a simple phone call then she looked to the side a different profile not liesl grasping at straws still the woman whod got out of the taxi was back now fullface ruth harris on the buildings penthouse terrace confronting a gangster ben didnt recognize the picture was clearly a b shot for speed not star making no dewy closeups the scene seemed barely blocked out the man uncertain of his marks he had grabbed ruth by the shoulders a prelude to roughing her up pushing her against the balcony she fought back trying to scratch his face slipping out of his grasp when he reached for her again she pushed him hard and then before ben could react it happened the man staggered against the rail off balance from her push wheeled around his weight now plunging forward pulling the rest of him with it too late to reach out a scream falling over the side close on ruths eyes wide now with terror ben blinked could it have happened that way a fight a push the unintended pitch overthen appalled running ben looked away from the screen the way he wanted it not the way it had been this is a womans picture lasner said the da falls in love with her bunny said deadpan well heres your little friend he said to ben as the next clip appeared ben looked back at the screen but the terrace scene kept playing itself in his mind couldnt it be possible not intentional not someone coming up from behind a woman a love quarrel gone wrong two men struggling over what it might even have gone the other way danny left standing with the appalled face but it hadnt on the screen julie sherman was getting up from a piano and walking over to an older man in what looked like some variation of intermezzo she had been talking earlier but ben hadnt been paying attention now her voice caught him the same surprising modulation hed noticed when they said hello nothing remarkable happened she kissed the man patting his arm then walked across the room turned and said goodbye satin bunny said lou would dress his mother like a hooker forget the dress lasner said sam likes her he thinks he can do something with her she cant move her arms so she can practice yanking his dick sol bunny said then picked up the phone any more dailies okay he looked down toward the directors were done here thanks rosemary looked great eddie he watched them leave then turned to lasner sol he said the rest unspoken sams girlshe looks good lasner said stubbornly shes last year somebody you could get into the sack before you ship out youre an expert on this and now theyre coming back what do they want a quickie with a waitress or somebody you can bring home they want to fuck loretta young sol im serious we dont need her sam pilcers been with me a long time lasner said quietly a little embarrassed he doesnt ask much so let him slip her a fifty every time we can always use a girl fox dropped her zanuck doesnt see it it wouldnt be the first time lou doesnt see it eitherhe keeps saying she can sing we could get her for a hundred a week with steps and hed be grateful not as grateful as sam bunny said lasner turned to ben what do you think youre a guy off the boat she look good to you everybody looks good to me he glanced at bunny an offering she has a nice voice you want to sign her for her voice try a shorter option ben said the thought too sudden to be filtered you dont have to pick it up bunny looked at him surprised then waited for lasners reaction it never lasts long with sam lasner said finally staring at ben he turned to bunny tell lou you like her voice he said amused now start her with a voiceover bunny said thinking if we had any he looked at ben you could request her for your picture ben nodded an easy chance to make an ally that picture what voiceover one of the victims bunny said the voiceover tells her story lasner stared at him for a second then snorted youre going to tell lou you want her to play a dead jew let me know what he says he stood up shaking his head thats some pair of balls you got on you he said to bunny heading for the door bunny picked up a clipboard good night pete he yelled to the projectionist then turned to ben clever you he said his voice without edge as if he were trying to decide how he felt if it works with lou hell grab it it gets his foot in the door he sighed my new best friend he said then looked up its hard for sol to say no to sam they go back he hesitated you dont have to use her if shes not right for the picture i can find something maybe buy myself a favor i wonder what that could be ben looked at him it wouldnt be ruth harris not even worth safety shots anymore you do any favors for rosemary my whole life is doing favors for rosemary bunny said did you have a particular one in mind his tone a pretend innocence drew a line his eyes daring ben to cross it but what would be the point ben answered by saying nothing a kind of standoff i hope youre not still going on about people making calls you dont want to be a nuisance he paused rosemarys been seeing ty power since he got out of the marines shes been photographed seeing him they make an attractive couple shes going to keep seeing him until her picture comes out a oneman woman bunny tucked the clipboard under his arm and turned to the door then stopped looking back over his shoulder why rosemary shes dannys type oh bunny said his voice sliding an octave and here i thought you were just guessing and shes important to the studio everybodys important until theyre not he turned fully facing ben look i dont know where you think youre going with this but if i were you id park it outside the gate you dont want to be bothering people mr l likes to keep things running anything interferes with production right now he likes you he gets these little enthusiasms you could have a future here but he can blow hot and cold you should know that its a studio people come and go all the time except you bunny nodded i keep things running s he was in the pool when he got home he followed the faint sounds of splashes through the quiet house and out onto the terrace stopping for a second by the lemon tree near the door only the pool lights were on a grotto effect with blue light rising up not spilling down and he saw that she was naked her body gliding through the water with a mermaids freedom alone in her own watery world he knew he should make a sound but instead stood watching her the smooth legs the private dark patch in between when they opened out when she became aware of him a shadow at the end of the pool she swam toward him without embarrassment faintly amused at his own i thought i was alone she said smiling glancing toward the crumpled bathing suit on the edge of the pool sorry i didnt mean still looking only her head above water but the rest of her clear in the pool lights thats all right i was getting out anyway she reached for a towel more of her out of the water now her nipples hardening a little as the air touched them quiet as a mouse she looked at him still amused then began to climb the shallow end steps so that he finally had to turn away a show of modesty behind him he could hear the towel rubbing another rustling as she put on a robe watching her now by sound have a drink she moved to the open wine bottle on the table tying her belt iris left something in the fridge if youre hungry i didnt know i should have called no dont feel that come and go as you like she poured out two glasses from what he saw was an almost empty bottle did you have a good day she said handing him one he laughed a reflex what thats what people say in movies what wives said so how do i say it then she sat down on a chaise and lit a cigarette turning to sit back but keeping one leg up poking through the folds of the robe he shrugged same way i guess ha art and life like my fathers lectures so was it a good day he leaned back on the other chaise taking a sip of the wine this is nice mm maybe ill take to drink but he hadnt meant the wine the warm night the liquid light of the pool catching her bare leg dannys wonderful life is that how it had been comparing their days listening to night sounds the soft air rubbed with hints of chlorine and eucalyptus did you go to your fathers no he says its too soon she took another drink how long do people sit at home anyway do you know a week i think two more days then what ciros ha every night das susse leben how about dinner at sol lasners saturday she turned to him eyebrows raised he said to bring someone ben said who else do i know she sat back smiling such an invitation but youre in luck im free every day in fact well not sunday whats sunday my fathers birthday salka makes a big lunch dieter comes and makes a toasthe writes it out before a real speech my father thanks him then he says something it goes on like that every year then chocolate cake the one danny liked yes she said a sudden punctuation mark she stubbed out her cigarette then got up and poured more wine in their glasses they sent the medical report you asked for its on the desk what does it say he died she said sitting back down ill look at it later why he said nothing for a minute listening to the pool water hit against the drain flaps i dont know how he died its something we should knowits part of it all she looked over at him for a second about to speak then let it go if you say so she said wearily so what do we wear to lasners they dress up ill ask bunny she turned a question his right hand his i dont know what youd call him he used to be a child star thats what happens to them i never think of them grown up neither do they then they are and they have to do something else but they look the same just older remember wolf breslau the little boy in the harz mountain films he became a nazi they put him on trial for killing poles in open pits the same baby face she was quiet for a minute someone you saw in the kino she said to herself how can anybody go back she shook her head my father says heinrichs making plans to go back to that she took a sip of wine and what about you what are you going to do now that youre grown up make pictures no no lasner must like you inviting you to dinner he likes me this week one in the familys enough was my father always expected danny to but not you so another sip thinking did you like him my father no daniel the question never asked took him by surprise something tossed in the air that hung there incapable of being answered i mean families people dont always so many years you didnt see each other i just wondered that was the war ah she said the sound floating up to join the question still suspended he looked out toward the city i wanted to be him he said finally when you were boys yes when did that stop does it he smiled moving away from it he was good with girls and not you i got better they say in germany now you can get a girl for a pack of cigarettes one pack thats not all youd get so its not for you the easy ones i can see that it wouldnt be how do you say schicklich proper seemly seemly she said trying it then took another sip of wine the first time i met himhed undress you look right at you he wanted you to know he was doing it so people are different you look at me from the side you dont want me to know youre looking she waved her hand at him before he could say anything its all right its nice someone looking dont be embarrassed she paused i like you looking he turned to her not sure how to respond if it makes you uneasy my being here she shook her head no it doesnt matter thats not the way it would happen i know you a little now you look from the side youd wait youd wait for me to say to start it thats how it would happen she looked at him dont you think a direct look not from the side holding his he felt blood rise to his skin as if she had touched him dannys wife maybe he said and maybe youre having fun with me no she smiled looking down at her glass maybe the wine is she sat up a drowsy stretch gathering the robe anyway it wouldnt be seemly would it not yet no not even cold thats what theyd say yes well im going in she picked up the bottle to take with her have a swim if you like she said moving off then smiled at him i wont look he sat for a while his mind drifting but then like the water lapping back schicklich the inside of a marriage was unknowable curtained off he listened for sounds of her inside but only the crickets broke the quiet maybe she was already in bed not at all uneasy because she knew the way it would happen on his way in he stopped at the screening room to pick up some of the office papers republic had sent over scripts drafts what had been in his mind those last weeks not that partners in crime was likely to be revealingformula stuff two brothers having fun as frivolous as ottos comedies he went over to an open film can the film itself was still in the projector not yet run through and put away the last thing danny had seen maybe a continental picture with a young star someone he wanted to watch over and over ben flicked the switch halfexpecting to see ruth or rosemaryany girl youd want to spend an afternoon with at a residential hotel instead it was a fox movietone newsreel men shaking hands right after hiroshima ben rewound the film and started it again first the usual opening montage with the waterskiers then the airmen at tinian island the ground crew loading the bomb kneeling with the pilots in front of the plane a picture everybodyd seen now instant history according to the voiceover but the camera had been there too recording it making a movie and in the plane flying now through the clouds the flash and mushroom cloud the whole city rolled up in smoke the narrator excited by the scale of it the most powerful thing the world has ever known no voice though over the next segment shot later a silent sweeping pan of the charred flattened city a few figures picking their way through the landscape otherwise no movement at all more pan shots the frame of a domed building by the river the rest vaporized congratulations all around back home scientists and generals shaking hands theyd made a movie of it sent cameras up got flight crews to pose but so had the nazis filming atrocities with smiling faces thats how theyd identified wolf breslau caught on film on the rim of the mass grave smiling unable to resist one last closeup the newsreel went on to the surrender scene on the missouri but even the narrator booming with victory couldnt lift the film from the streets of ashes the voice wanted to celebrate throw a hat in the air like the relieved sailors but the words said one thing and the pictures showed anotherthis was the way it would be now the way we would die kissing couples the narrator announcing a world of hope but it wasnt ben thought not now just an endless dread ben took the reel off and put it in its canister not frivolous maybe partners wasnt the whole of him maybe the war had touched something deeper just as bens life had been upturned by the camps both of them alike under the skin he turned off the light and went into the house on the desk in the study just as shed said he found the autopsy report he glanced through it medical english not english at all nearly incomprehensible he heard a sound from her room a turning perhaps something dropped meaningless in itself except as a sign of life just behind the door he smiled to himself schicklich how do we decide whats right he looked down again at the sheet pulmonarysomething to do with the lungs but of course she was right all it said was that danny was dead w as there some problem dr walters said caught on the run in the hall not sure why ben had come i dont know the technical terms im not sure what they actually mean simple language he stopped breathing he halted midstep im sorry i know it sounds like a joke all i mean is that there were no signs of strokethats the usual cause after a head trauma edemal bleeding flooding the brain but not in this case no or heart damage there are only a few ways to die of course these are all connected he paused framing his hands explaining to a classroom think of the brain as a switchboard the operator pulled a line connected to the lungs like being cut off on a call he said looking up waiting to see if ben was following the board controls everything the lungs dont operate by themselves is that common yes mr kohler with a head injury like this the surprising thing is that he didnt die instantly i gather he was lucky in the response time the ambulance got to him before he lost too much blood so that bought him some time im sorry but if he regained consciousness we dont rule out miracles he said patiently but im a doctor you know not a priest this is what we expected to happen he waited for ben to reply was there anythingany sign that he may have been injured before he fell before knocked out anything like that im not sure i understand by someone else before dr walters peered at him disconcerted no but im not a policeman either is there any reason to think this happened i just wanted to look at everything every possibility dr walters nodded im sorry mr kohler these things can be hard to accept he looked down at the paper in bens hand maybe thats why we hide behind the language he had stopped by the hospital on his way to lunch and now found himself running late caught in the traffic west to fairfax kelly had suggested the farmers market somewhere away from the studio a pointless dick tracy feint but not worth arguing about the market had started as a collection of produce stalls for depression farmers but now had the look of a small studiopermanent buildings for the stalls and restaurants table seating on patios and its own logo clock tower looking over the parking lot like the rko globe everything was painted cream and light green and maroon what ben thought of as leftover colors the same ones lasner had used at continental maybe even from the same cheap supply kelly was already at a table under the trees nursing a beer so what have we got he said as ben sat down his eyes darting over bens shoulder not much no matches from the building list he pulled out a paper these are the top contract players the ones they might want to protect but that doesnt mean its one of them and theyre not big names lasner doesnt yeah i know the loanout king whos he got borrowed by the way hed want to take care of them at least until the pictures out listen he said abruptly you mention me to anyone tell them im looking at this no you said you sure ben nodded why he said aware now of the look in kellys eyes his quick movements maybe my imagination except it never is is it dont turn aroundno dont i mean it people always do that take a look when we get up for the food theres a guy over by the raw bar i notice hes casing the place and he looks familiar and then it comes to mehe was hanging around republic when im there checking the talent this is before i hear about continental some coincidence if you believe in that so maybe hes keeping an eye you know the guys a cop everything about himand im thinking what the hell the cops enforce for the studios so maybe someone i didnt say a word ben said beginning to turn no dont hell pick up on it lets eat you like seafood they have a great crab louis they got up and walked across the patio to the sales counter he spotted him immediatelythe man in the gray suit reading a paper almost hidden behind a tree but scanning the patio just as he had the crowd at the funeral the reception afterward ben gave a dontworry shake of his head to kelly and ordered the crab a huge plate enough for two i know him he said when they sat down again he works for polly no he doesnt he may feed her but he doesnt work for her i know all her runners so whats he feed her hes a cop maybe even bureau hes got that look he could be bureau calm down youre cop shows twice somethings up you learn these things so what the fuck does he want he came with polly to the funeral thats all i can tell you your name never came up at the studio youre sure hes a cop some kind of cop has to be im going to the head see if he watches he walked to the mens room past piles of oranges but the man in the gray suit seemed not to notice his gaze still fixed toward the other end of the dining patio an easier sight line than the side angle to kelly people in shirts having lunch big california salads a few suits liesls father ben stopped ostermann saw him at the same time and nodded impossible now not to go over ben signaled to kelly that hed only be a minute using the turn to check on the man in the gray suit absorbed again in his paper meanwhile kaltenbach was waving him to their table so you know this place he said standing playing host a coffee youll join us ben shook his head im with somebody just a hello a little bit of europe ostermann said gesturing to the patio not a real biergarten but still trees you can pretend ben looked down at their platessausages and deli potato salad what they might in fact have ordered at hechingers thats what everyone does here kaltenbach said waving his hands to take in the city pretend he looked over at ben excited do you know that i am going to berlin berlin ben said thinking of smashed bricks jagged walls yes i know its bad now you hear it from everyone but still berlin something survives i thought i would never see it again i thought i would die here he gestured to the sunny patio the healthy salad eaters seeing something else and now how did you arrange it ben said i thought nobody could get in except the army a few reporters you need a permit yes yes another exit visa but hans here will write a letter thomas mann too who would say no to them why would they keep me here on relief eighteen dollars and fifty cents a week a charity case you dont think theyll be happy to see me go one last visa and its over if erika were still alive think how happy maybe you should wait ben said until things are better its difficult now just to live no theyre giving me a flat who the university im invited to accept a chair at the university but its in the soviet sector yes of course thats who invites me ben glanced at ostermann who met his eye but then looked deliberately away toying with his fork they are going to print my books again the soviets my friend one conqueror or another whats the difference germany lost the war do you think the russians will leave now how else can i do this i can be a writer again i can be in berlin he said in a kind of rush emotional now almost touching it excuse me he said putting a fingertip to his eye so foolish old age and now the bladder ill be right back ben watched him head for the mens room hes not a political man ostermann said quietly he will be the minute he gets off the plane german writer returns to the east which makes them look legitimate they dont care about his books they just want him for show i know theyve asked some of the others even brecht is reluctant and he they ask you no he glanced up a slightly impish smile maybe they dont like my work too bourgeois you cant let him do this do you know what its like there what do i say to him he lives in one room on money we give him his friends each handout a humiliation his wife committed suicide for her it was too much and now they come to him a professor with a flat his books what do we offer instead not a prison at least here reuben he said using his full name as a kind of weight he doesnt even know hes here hes somewhere else waiting so let him go this isnt going to make him popular with the state department or you writing letters an act of friendship not politics or isnt that possible anymore i thought that time was over well it doesnt matter for me i dont want to go back the conscience of germany i dont think they want that now and maybe i dont want them either ben looked toward the other end of the patio the man in the gray suit paper down was now sipping coffee just having lunch a thousand apologies kaltenbach said joining them at the table and after so many kindnesses im not myself these days herr kaltenbach ben said a sudden thought how did the offer come from the university a letter its official yes yes hand delivered by the soviet consul all the way from san francisco so i would know it was genuine you know you dont trust the mails for such an offer ah the consul ben said someone who would certainly be watched everywhere each contact another string to follow well i hope everything works out berlin kaltenbach nodded you dont have to say ive seen the pictures a wreck but look at me so maybe well suit each other there was another minute of bowing farewells a european leavetaking before ben could go back across the patio kelly was waiting smoking over the debris of his crab louis but instead of turning to their table ben kept going an impulse toward the gray suit excuse me you were at my brothers funeral but we werent introduced he said extending his hand ben collier for a second the man simply stared as if the approach had violated some rule then lifted his hand to shake bens i didnt know who you were they told me later you had different names he said keeping his eyes on ben reading him my mother changed it how did you know danny we did some work together youre in pictures ben said surprised technical advisor to get the details right on the series police details my friend over there thought you might be maybe fbi the man said nothing he thought you might be tailing him yeah whatd he do he said playing with it then looked at ben and shook his head im retired from what the man hesitated thinking through a chess move then nodded the bureau you dont look old enough to i took a bullet that buys you a few years so what do you do now have lunch he said stretching his hand toward his finished plate implying long afternoons and work for danny i gave him advice thats all we helped each other out ben looked up an off phrase but so innocuous there was nowhere to take it well thanks for coming to the funeral funny running into you again no im here most days he got up to go taking his hat off the table im sorry about your brother that was a hell of a thing whatever it was the man stopped his eyes fixed on ben what do you mean its just a little fuzzy wouldnt you say what happened youre the pro he waited finally the man looked away putting on his hat i wouldnt know im retired he paused its tough to get over something like this you should take it easy everyone says would you your brother something worrying you you were close maybe he said something to you ben shook his head what would he say now a cat and mouse game but no longer sure who was which the man shrugged then took out his wallet sometimes you start something you dont know what youre getting into here he took out a card and handed it to ben if you need any technical advice ben looked at it dennis riordan no affiliation just a telephone number technical advice ben repeated maybe he left something might explain it maybe i could help figure it out he began to move off anyway tell your friend to keep his nose clean stop imagining things what about german writers riordan turned youre a suspicious guy he looked down at the table it was just lunch he crossed the patio to the exit near the vegetable stalls unhurried not even a backward glance what the hell was that kelly said at their table ben handed him the business card what you thought the bureau but retired they never retire they just find another pack of hyenas to sniff around with like polly kelly shook his head but somebody ill find out you know people at republic find out if he ever got a consultant fee on dannys pictures what if he wasnt paid then why do it kelly looked at the card again memorizing the name then handed it back christ all i wanted was the girlfriend an item and now ive got the bureau on my back i dont think so if he was tailing you youd never see him handing out cards he wants something else what i dont know but think where weve seen himrepublic the funeral you werent even at the funeral hes not tailing you its like hes tailing danny lasner lived in a chateau near the top of summit drive with enough land for a full set of tennis courts and a formal garden dannys house flowed easily outside and back the pool another room but here the effect was moated drawn up behind the gravel drive the high view just something framed by picture windows teenagers in uniforms had been hired to park the cars so that arriving felt like stepping out of a liveried carriage something lubitsch might have shot the inside rooms were du barry french high and ornate and formal with gilded side tables and silk fire screens and ormolu footed chairs ben wondered what lasner made of it all passing through each morning on his way to coffee or did they have breakfast in bed a proper levee still fay clearly loved playing chatelaine greeting people just inside the door with real warmth so where was the harm the money all those nickels would have been spent somehow why not on a french dream with a hostess once pretty enough to have been a goldwyn girl far more attractive than any of the originals even sol beaming by her side was an improvement at least a bulldog jaw not a weak bourbon chin my god look at the jewels liesl said bunny had said to dress but ben had expected country club cocktails in suits instead he felt he had walked into an apicture party scene everyone turned out by makeup and wardrobe evening dresses and sparkling necklaces the room like some velvet jewel case fake he said smiling no theyre not she put her fingers to her throat anyway the pearls are nothing to be ashamed of my mother wouldnt sell them not even in paris when we nothing to be ashamed of the rest of you looks good too oh yes in a roomful of movie stars he glanced around taking in what shed already noticed faces from covers people you saw in magazine ads recommending soap he thought of his mothers parties before the war gaunt women with hats and fur trim not beautiful using their jewels to light up the room here the faces themselves were luminous paulette goddard had come looking even better than she had on the train alexis smith was talking to the lasners her chin at a patrician tilt he recognized ann sheridan by the fireplace the full mouth not drawn in a glamour shot pout but smiling as down to earth as the girl next door if shed been beautiful they were all beautiful it seemed a kind of joke an ancien regime room finally filled with gloriouslooking people instead of pinchedfaced heirs theres marion wallace id better say something to her she sent a nice note let me buy you a drink first he lifted two champagne flutes from a waiters tray who else is here he said clinking her glass do you know anyone she smiled a few theres walter reisch daniel used to play tennis with him paul kohner you know him the agent he handles bruce hudson in the series she took another sip its a small town nobody ever believes that but it is they never see anyone else if my father walked in no one would know who he was alma used to complain about it after bernadette when people asked franz to parties she giggled people thought she was a character actress ah youre here lasner said not really in a receiving line but hovering near the door a clean shirt even you know fay so glad you could come she said sol tells me everythings great with the picture well the cutter is now all i have to do is listen to him you think youre kidding but ive seen it happen so maybe you are as smart as he says she smiled rolling her eyes toward lasner hello she said extending her hand to liesl im sorry fay liesl kohler talk about smart sol said quickly missing the introduction but taking liesls hand one week in town already a beautiful woman sol fay said then to liesl pay no attention he thinks hes a comedian no jack thinks hes a comedian he tells jokes to jessel the same jokes you meet jack he said to ben when we were over in europe he was with the group jack warner just to shake hands youre lucky he tells one tonight itll sound like the first time to you maybe even funny sol fay said but with a glint agreeing she looked at liesl your pearls are lovely i couldnt help noticing my mothers i knew it the old ones have that rich tone they say it comes from being worn next to the skin all those years do me a favor lasner said to ben i want to introduce you later fays cousin we just got her out over there all along were thinking she must be dead and then the red cross calls and says she gave them our name shes alive would we send for her so were crying thinking what are the odds and now shes here she just smokes sol she has been through something did i say no its a miracle shell be interestedyour picture sometimes you know its the last thing they want to talk about where was she poland not at first they shipped her around she doesnt say much she told you sol oranienburg then poland she turned to ben shes getting used to things thats all shes only here two days big shot here wants i dont know what she should be dancing id like to meet her ben said politely i figured lasner said youll have something to talk about is that why hed been invited to entertain survivors but shed only just arrived lasner was drawing him aside keeping his hand on his arm listen he said low as a secret i just want you to know i didnt want to say at the studio but i appreciateyou know on the train you feeling okay one hundred percent sol its jack and ann fay said drawing him away the warners were all smiles jack with a jaunty mustache and a tan so dark that it seemed to have shriveled his face like a walnut ben remembered him from the army tour paler and in uniform telling stories about errol flynn theyd been on hitlers boat a brief days outing on the rhine which reminded warner of his own yacht moored next to flynns at the marina so close you could hear what happened in the master bedroom not just every night two three times a night maybe different ones i dont know i said to him you keep it up its going to fall off laughter from the others watching the banks stream by now he shook bens hand without any hint of recognition just a new face at lasners so all i hear is rosemary miller he said to sol its going to happen for her your lips lasner said raising his eyes get it in the can before the goddam union closes everybody down warner said prompting a huddle cutting ben and liesl loose to drift waiters were still passing rich canapescaviar and asparagus tips in puff pastryso it would be a while before they sat down liesl had told him hollywood ate early to get up early but saturday must be the exception no one made any move to the several tables set up in the next room ben wondered how dinner would be announced a gong meanwhile more champagne was poured and the man at the grand piano in the corner probably someone from continental kept playing show tunes all the talk overheard in snippets as they walked around the room was about pictures an option picked up sturgess fight with paramount disappointing grosses on wilson de havilland taking jack to court over her suspension would there be a strike paramount having a record year but so was everybody knock wood there seemed to be no one from the outside at all the aircraft factories in northridge the oil companies downtown shipping offices in long beachall the rest of the new rich city was somewhere else at gentile dinners in pasadena maybe or out at the movies rosemary miller had just arrived giving sol a showy hug careful not to muss her lipstick then a broad smile to the rest of the group because it seemed to be her timeeven jack warner had heardand people were coming over to her after all those parties where nobody had even noticed her id better say something to marion liesl said whos that looking at you ben followed her gaze bunny the one i told you about he runs things she patted his arm then be nice i wont be long she moved away before bunny reached him who was that he said his eyes following her intrigued liesl kohler his wife he said slightly addled you brought her you might have said shes allowed to go out why is there something wrong its just that all the seatings beenwell never mind he said stopping ive put you next to paulette since youre such old pals thanks well thats your left right youve got a relative of sols fays actually genia hard g markowitz polish but lived in berlin sol asked she doesnt speak much english and i gather you can speak german he said his voice rising at the end a question i was brought up there partly anyway thats right the father quite a life more interesting by the day and thats just my childhood bunny smiled enjoying the play a kind of volley often the most interesting part he said mine was god rex morgan ben said distracted by a tall man near the corner i havent seen him since i was a kid hes not still a cowboy he must be real estate glendale youd be surprised how many people want to live there his pictures were continental ben said still trying to explain his being here every one locations out in simi valley his ranch now he bought it eventually so he and lasner are old friends well that and he owns a piece of the company he came through in thirty when the banks wouldnt mr l got through the crunch and rex got eight percent he said simply the details of the business like a file at his fingertips there was a burst of laughter near the door wonderful jacks here telling jokes you often have the competition over hes the reason for the party its not just dinner its never just dinner whats the occasion the honorable kenneth t minot he looked at ben our congressman he and jack need to meet why his district takes in burbank jacks in burbank they should know each other mr l thinks he might be useful with the consent decree he caught bens puzzled expression the justice department issued a consent decree before the war to separate the studios and the theaters force separate ownership a disaster for us nobody wanted to do anything while the war was onkick us while we were being so helpful but now its over theyre acting up again so were trying to put a stop to it minots been friendly but continental doesnt own theaters does it but jack does and we have a distribution agreement with him this goes through everybody suffers warner doesnt know his own congressman ben said a studio that size wrong party jacks funny that way after yankee doodle he thought roosevelt was a personal friend but its time he met more people across the aisle we dont care where they sit as long as they get the decree squashed and he gets bunny raised his eyebrows well have to see wont we ben looked around the room again all this extravagance to arrange a meeting rosemary was near the piano now chatting with alexis smith ann sheridan had gone over to greet the warners it occurred to ben suddenly that the stars had been brought in to dress the room like eyecatching centerpieces they were all under contract to continental or warnersmaybe lasner and jack had simply ordered them up he wondered if there were a studio pecking order bette davis having earned the right to pass cagney beyond this kind of thing only paulette was with another studio but she was a friend happy to sparkle for old times sake well hes here bunny said looking toward the door the honorable ken to his friends minot was sandyhaired younger than ben had expected with an athletes build already filling in about to turn soft there was a pleasantlooking woman on his arm a little dismayed at the dazzle of the party about to swallow her up his first term ben said war hero took out a jap machine gun emplacement then caught shrapnel in the leg enough to get him out just in time to start passing out flyers in van nuys welloh god the wife marie i think marie time to go to work you think youre kidding sorry about the cousin but i did give you paulette i just wish youd told me by the way i talked to the boys in publicity and security nobody made any calls about your brother nobody knew him in fact so id check your sources they might have got mixed up another studio that happens sometimes on purpose a little game they play taking the time to close the door on it ben started to say something then let it go bunny was already moving away on to more important things he made another circuit of the room another glassful then noticed liesl listening to some man her expression polite but a little pained trapped there had been a shift in the crowd the people near her moving away leaving her standing in a circle of space like a fawn in a clearing and he felt a sudden urge to wrap a coat around her shoulders when he went over she smiled a flicker of relief in her eyes marion had been replaced by a director whod known danny at metro and was now offering his condolences he took ben as a convenient excuse to escape having fun i would be if i didnt have to talk be like her she said nodding toward a middleaged woman staring out the picture window smoking just watch everybody shes looking the other way they all want to know what picture im working on when im not they walk away bens eye wandered back to the woman at the window now moving to a coffee table to put out a cigarette and light another she looked up taking in the room but blankly as if she couldnt really see anything a skeletal thinness gray hair in short bangs a velvet dress that seemed too big for her borrowed she turned back to the window staring down at los angeles i have a feeling thats my dinner partner ben said no it isnt paulette goddard said suddenly at his side i am hello again he introduced her to liesl bunny told me she said to ben i dont suppose you brought any cards her smile and eyes bright still carrying their own key light ben thought of her crosslegged on the pullman bed letting sol win a good sport hope you dont mind he said mind i usually get rex he likes me or something i dont know why he starts on his horses and i just nod off do you ride she said to liesl drawing her in no i cant imagine the only ranch ive ever been to was the divorce ranch in the women at metro she glanced around fay certainly knows how to go all out she said halflaughing i remember when it was soup and crackers she reached for a canape on a tray showing a green flash of emerald bracelet youre friends liesl said polite mm from the good old days and thank god theyre over are you in pictures or i translate books from german she said with a sly glance to ben waiting for paulette to bolt but paulette was impressed do you really i wish i could anything like that they say youre not supposed to regret anything but when you dont have school i started work so early i dont know anything you never catch up really well translation its not so brainy liesl said easily just work and theyre my fathers books so i can always ask him what he meant then find the words your father hans ostermann hes not so well known here central station paulette said immediately i read it warners made it god what a mess mary astor he must have hated it but i read it in english so that was you id love to meet him sometime just coffee or something if he sees people oh theres rosemary have you met rosemary she said drawing her to them come meet some people liesl kohler she said remembering it something they didnt teach in school my old friend benwe were on the chief together rosemary hesitated staring at liesl that first appraisal women make at parties seeing everything then shook hands with them both are your ears burning paulette said everybodys talking about you the picture isnt even finished yet rosemary said glancing again at liesl then facing paulette a subtle ranking thats the best time when everybody still thinks its wonderful but i hear you are well you know everybody likes dailies and then it comes out and just hit your marks and cross your fingersthats all any of us can do rosemary flushed clearly pleased to be included in us in person without the glow of backlighting her features seemed sharper everything less soft she looked around slightly nervous perhaps still selfconscious about being the center of attention ive never seen such a beautiful house she said apparently meaning it well its not my taste paulette said i cant even pronounce it louis quinze she said to liesl saying it perfectly liesls a translator so she can be mine tonight quinze she said again at liesls nod i always think about dusting it but fay loves it she always had a good eye i cant tell one vase from another but bunny says the sevres is museum quality again pronouncing it correctly so you see she knows she turned seeing bunny coming over to them isnt that right darling i have to borrow you bunny said ignoring the question come meet the congressman he loved standing room only god and he got elected nicey nicey come on you can talk to ben at dinner rosemary you know irving rappers here im sure

hasnt talked to anyone fays cousin has to be i dont think she has any english then go rescue her im going to the ladies find out what people are really saying fays cousin didnt turn when he came up her gaze still fixed out the window entschuldigung pani markowitz pani so you speak polish she said in german finally turning ben smiled no a courtesy only i was told you were polish im ben collier i was born there yes she said her voice flat it was then that he took in her eyes the same faraway emptiness hed seen in some of the others a blind persons eyes no longer needed nothing more to see her collarbones stuck out barely covered by the thin layer of skin i thought i would die there too but no she half turned to the window and now look so many lights you lived in berlin ben said to say something i was there as a boy a few years yes berlin and youre fays cousin her father and my motherbut he came here a long time ago before the first war your mother stayed my fatherhe did very well there was no reason for us to leave it was a different time then my mother always said max left for the adventure they thought he was a nogood to leave your family your country so who was right she turned fully to the room the rich end of maxs gamble a daughter living like this to think all this still exists you were in a camp she raised her eyes still not really looking we all were my husband my sister everyone are they she shook her head now only me im sorry she wrinkled her forehead as if the words were not just inadequate but puzzling irrelevant i dont know why i was not so strong leon was stronger for the work but they took him to the gas i dont know why no reason you survive no reason or you dont i knew youd find each other lasner said in english genial putting his hand on bens shoulder you speak english ben asked her a few words only but now that youre here you have to try i tell her if she gets every other word shes at least halfway there right you tell her about the picture not yet ben switched to german were making a documentary for the army about the camps you want to put this in a film so people will know a record eisenhower ordered them to film it when we got there he said no one would believe it otherwise a kind of proof a proof that it happened he looked at her we dont have to talk about this if youd rather not put her in the picture you can tell your story lasner said what would i say i dont know the reason for any of it she reached down to the coffee table for another cigarette you ought to go easy on those things im sorry for me its a luxury a whole cigarette i didnt mean i just meant for your health your life is a gift now she stared at him saying nothing until slightly flustered he changed the subject you know who this is he nodded at ben otto kohlers kid now her eyes did move suddenly alert as if shed heard another voice ottos but you knew my father otto she said the flat tone now a little agitated there was a boy yes but i dont understand youre not my brother i was in england your brother taller she said measuring what happened to him hes dead she drew on the cigarette and looked down yes of course he would be dead her voice flat again when she looked back up at him her eyes had retreated behind their blank wall so now this she said aloud but to herself ottos son i knew you two would have lots to talk about lasner said in english she turned to him hesitating translating in her head then looked back at ben an almost wry expression on her lips yes much to talk about she said and then suddenly skittish excuse me she left before either of them could say anything lasner raised his eyebrows so i was wrong shes grateful to you you know ben said an instinctive peacemaker its just maybe too much for her he opened his hand to the party so soon you know what i think honest to god i think hitler won that one i dont think shes here anymore how did she know my father she was in pictures over there they all knew each other by that time theres only one studio he paused taking a puff on his cigar she was a looker when she was young what the hell fays cousin he looked down at the cigar not now to do that to someone he broke off looking up at ben well see if you can get her to talk a little so she doesnt just sit there at dinner picking ask her about otto you think they were christ i dont know i never thought otto i wouldnt be surprised you think thats what spooked her with you like seeing the kid walk in on you when youre oh there goes jack watch hes going to take on congress ben followed him intending to split off and not intrude but the loose group around minot seemed open to anyone passing by both minot and warner were used to audienceseven talking to each other they were playing to the cluster around them a public conversation ben noticed that they were already ken and jack ill tell you what i see jack said i see the goddam unions at my throat and now this thing hanging over my head ready to chop consent decree whatever the hell that actually means except trouble i look around i see trouble here we are knocking our brains out trying to make pictures and everybody wants a piece jack minot said smiling youre on top of the world top of the world a soap box voice resonant his chest swelling the industry and this city grew up together he gestured toward the lights outside the picture window thirty years ago that was bean fields now look at it with lots more to come this year the industrys revenues are going to hit one billion dollars one billion revenues not profits profits estimate sixtythree million he nodded again to the window its not lima beans anymore you just happen to have those numbers in your pocket you like to come prepared minot said almost winking industry estimates jack not some office in washington doesnt know what its talking about industry estimates youre on top of the world with a sword over my head jacks a worrier lasner said of course i cant predict what the justice department is going to do minot said with them you need a crystal ball but i can tell you therere a lot of people in washington grateful for all the fine work this industry did during the war while they were earning those profits someone said a left jab i dont begrudge profits im not a socialist he laughed a stage chuckle not even close people buy your product you ought to make a profit and keep it not have the government reaching into your pocket every five minutes but im not here to talk politics all im saying he said looking directly at jack is you treat your friends right and theyll treat you right thats the way it works in washington thats the way it works here too trick is knowing who your friends are my job is to protect your interests you do well the district does well minot smiled and you know what i think i think youre just getting started the industry look whats ahead no more war restrictions no more price controls everybody wants what you make youre just going to grow and grow with this district with california you know why because its our time right now americas time all through the war i kept thinking win this thing and theres no stopping us and we did win it its our time lifted directly from a campaign speech ben thought the rhetoric building even jack warner listening now with full attention of course youve got somebody over there doesnt like that at all and we all know who that is no profits there he said nodding to warner no god either a country with no god i think that says it all you think the other guys were bad the japs the nazis waitll you see this one but at least this time were ready the commies want to fight let them come and all their helpers over here trying to bring this great country down they dont like to fight in the open like to hide but well find them too you know what a great job jack tenneys been doing up in sacramento i knew him when he wrote mexicali rose well hes doing something a lot more important now that state committeethey could use it as a model when they go national with this and they will a house has termites youve got to get rid of them before the rot sets in thats just common sense unless you want to see it fall down jacks been working this for years now you know what he told me how many files hes got reds and their pals and people too dumb to know any better over fourteen thousand just waiting for when we need them fourteen thousand subversives or fourteen thousand people he doesnt like the same man whod made the crack about profits well lets just say people hes not sure of minot said deflecting this easily youd want to be sure something like this when youre under attack not with gunsnot yet anyway but ideas too the wrong ideas slip them in every chance you get until people are confused thats where you come in he nodded to warner make sure it doesnt happen in pictures theres nothing more powerful if you want to reach people not even radio hitler understood that the power of film these people too thats why we have the breen office jack said try getting an idea past them he laughed a signal to the others who joined in after a second of hesitation minot did too playing a man who appreciates a good wisecrack now jack i said wrong ideas he said still laughing congressman you dont have to worry about that jack said seriously ive been in this business all my life and i dont think you could find a more patriotic group of people we love this country it gave us everything lasner said jack waited a twinkle in his eye and were going to love it even more if you get this decree taken care of more smiles all around jack they told me you were a kidder minot said pleasantly they didnt tell me you were a politician next thing you know youll be running for my seat you dont have to worry about that im already running everything i want in burbank sol you going to give us something to eat tonight cutting the scene before it ran too long his point now made minots instincts werent as surehe missed warners cue and kept talking about the future now of the valley but since none of his listeners actually lived there they became less attentive darting glances around the room he was saved by a waiter at his elbow quietly announcing dinner not a gong after all servants discreetly guiding people into the dining room a piece of social choreography some attempt had been made to place the few german speakers at genias table but as her dinner partner most of the caretaking still fell to ben paul henreid no doubt another warners draftee was on her right but after a few pleasantries turned his attention in english to rosemary liesl an unexpected german speaker was across the round table from them too far for conversation paulettes other partner was mike curtiz who might have helped but head close monopolized paulette instead with studio gossip genia didnt seem to mind she sat quietly her own island while the table talked around her since no one on either side was listening when ben spoke german to her it became oddly private as if they were in another room in no danger of being overheard as lasner predicted she scarcely touched her food moving pieces of the tournedos with her fork but not eating them i cant you know she said noticing his glance to her plate its too rich for me ben remembered the rescued inmates vomiting their first meal their bodies no longer used to digesting anything but watery soup he looked down at the deep burgundy glaze with its sliver of truffle such vegetables this time of year california ben said they grow all year round have you been able to get out see anything the ocean fay took me for a drive the rest its all houses no buildings not like berlin liesls father says its still the first layer here before the schinkels he smiled but she seemed not to understand this at a loss she looked over at liesl shes your wife no he said looking across with her so that liesl smiled back maybe one day see how she looks at you no ben said flustered shes my brothers wife was i dont understand the same brother he wasnt killed years ago no just this month why did you think why it was so dangerous back and forth the courier i never thought it was rightfor your father to use a boy like that well not a boy still young to risk his life when you said he was dead i thought yes it must be of course they killed him who ben said suddenly feeling lightheaded the nazis she said simply it was always a risk for an american a communist she said her voice steady matteroffact what you didnt know this involuntarily ben glanced toward minots table apprehensive the word itself now like a pointing finger but no one in the room was paying attention hearing anything more than a murmuring of german only ben felt the words shouting in his ears he shook his head slowly barely moving and he never told you well thats right we had to be secret to survive the first enemy even before they started killing jews no one was safe from them i said to otto how can you use your own but of course it was important to him and he was like youan american passport would protect him they wouldnt suspect his mothers in england of course he travels so a courier for the communists ben said numbly as if repeating the words would give a sense to them steady the room yes for your father anything for your father for him it was like a religion so maybe for the boy too i dont know like a religion ben said still catching echoes yes and he died for it for being a communist thats why he stayed in germany not another woman a career he couldnt leave behind a misguided sense of safety they didnt suspect him he could do things the others couldnt goebbels liked him all of themthey liked to watch those comedies they thought he was like that so he was useful to the party so close and they didnt suspect they didnt protect him either he was still a jew thats what you think all these years that he was foolish that he trusted them she shook her head they didnt kill him as a jew they killed him as a communist she paused he was betrayed she said her voice suddenly low looking away across the table ben said nothing he heard forks people laughing sound track noises from another movie in this one everything was still he looked at genias hands the bony fingers resting now on the table pale webbed with veins the hands of an old woman how do you know that he said finally for a minute she kept looking across the table then turned to him because it was me i betrayed him she said her voice still detached a confession without emotion or selfpity something willed he felt it like a hand on his arm a restraint making him look directly at her why why else to save myself staring back the rest unsaid then she looked away breaking the connection but i didnt not in the end she picked up the small bag at her side excuse me i must have a cigarette apologies she stood up catching liesls attention who looked at ben first with casual curiosity then taking him in with real alarm paulette was already putting her hand on his im not ignoring you really mike was just telling me about selznick you know hes still in therapy he believes in it since spellbound i said he could save a bundle and just give up the pills are you all right you look as if youd seen a ghost he tried to smile shaking this off seriously youre all white finally the smile just old war stories im fine from the corner of his eye he could see the emerald bracelet covering his hand at the next table fay and ann sheridan were charming minot who wanted to get rid of termites bunny apparently still worried about the seating kept looking over at liesl watching her jack warner was telling jokes the waiters had begun to clear the tournedos replacing it with floating island puffy clouds of meringue and otto had risked dannys life the one ben knew nothing about id better check on her make sure shes okay he said to paulette getting up liesl still concerned shot him a what look but he made a nothing movement with his head as he crossed the room still half in a daze he noticed bunny chatting with marie minot keeping things going she was sitting behind the coffee table tapping her cigarette on the rim of the ashtray i thought i would never say that she said not even looking up as if shed expected him not to anybody and now his son for years i thought what if someone finds out what if someone knows and it doesnt matter none of it matters everything matters she looked at him then made a half smile to the living she drew on the cigarette so what do you want me to say to you an apology its late for that tell me about danny what did he actually do my father made him carry things in his mind only she said tapping the side of her head messages he had to remember no papers if they had found papers they would have arrested him killed him so it was safer up here of course if they tortured him he would have told themeverybody didbut without papers there was no reason to suspect him and an american passport they couldnt arrest americans so easily so he was perfect for us my fathers idea she nodded there was a problem before we had a network with merchant seamen for outside communications you couldnt use the radio by hand by mouth and then there was a roundupone of the cells in hamburgand we knew they had been given away an informer we traced it to one of the sailors so we couldnt use the network anymore thats when your father had the idea the one person he could really trust she stopped except me he said but he couldnt send me so he was wrong about that too but what did he actually carry what kind of messages she shrugged to help get people out at that point all we were trying to do was survive save ourselves there werent so many left he would travel through paris there were people there who could make arrangements to get people across this was before the war if we could get people to france and later to spain ben thought helped across by someone with experience by then you didnt have to be a communist to be in danger so we used him for that not a spy not like in the films just messages to help get people out but he would have been hung just the same if theyd caught him yes naturally thats why i thought it was too dangerous but he wanted to do it you know at that ageno fear its exciting to them everything a secret they dont know yet what its like to live that way to live in secret she rubbed out the cigarette but he survived you said so im glad for that they never got him well he stopped when otto he did it for otto he never came back to germany after that so maybe that saved him tell me what happened with my father its not so much to know she said shrugging a familiar story they caught me my faulti was careless so prinzalbrechtstrasse we used to talk about it if the gestapo i knew what it would mean not just for me my family they didnt have to torture me i already knew what they wanted the names who was head of the cell well otto goebbelss friend she looked up so i gave them your father and they let you go i thought yes usually they killed you too after you told them we all knew that they had no more use for you he looked at her waiting i agreed to give them names i didnt know yet to be an informer they thought i would do itso weak they hadnt even had to beat me a coward with blood on her hands what they wanted and did you only to get out to have a chance to escape i knew they would watch but we did it my family we went into hiding the party helped us the ones who were left they thought whoever had betrayed otto had betrayed me too so they helped us safe houses we lived like that place to place no one ever knew id given them otto of course by that time it didnt matter if you were a communistit was enough to be a jew so we hid do you want to hear the rest how he died i dont know that shot i suppose i hope it was that no what happened after not everything dont worry not all the horrors just enough to know why its like this now why isnt she weeping on her knees begging forgiveness you dont owe me any doesnt she feel anything facing me ottos son what kind of person is this that it doesnt matter to her cant even say shes sorry isnt that what youre doing now he said gently she shook her head its too late for that so one story only something you cant put in a film never mind the hiding the rest of it how you feel in the line select one here for work select him for the gas impossible to understand that even when its happening to you so impossible for you she took a breath we were back in berlin then the first big roundup february cold all of us in a basement like rats but still leon my sister her husband all down there but safe then not safe she looked up we were betrayed maybe a justice anyway jews in the cellar so they came for us you dont fight but they pull you out anyway poke the guns in your stomach yelling i can hear them now it never goes away the yelling and it frightens rosa my sisters baby an infant shut it up he screams at her the soldier as if she could do somethingall that noise so terrifying terrifying to us and she tries to quiet it against her shoulder you know rocking while theyre pushing us out and its not enough for him shut up he yells and then he grabs it right out of her arms a second my heart stops now too i can see it he takes rosa by the feet and before my sister can move he smacks her against the wall swinging her like a doll once thats all because then its quiet he drops her like a rag a piece of i dont know a thump and then blood on the wall a blotch little streaks theres nothing in his face it doesnt matter to him this takeshow long how long can the heart stop a second less and its my whole life in that time then i hear my sister scream and im somewhere else another life she stopped almost out of breath shutting her eyes then reached for another cigarette something tangible right now and lit it she brought it with us she picked it up and brought it they didnt care on the train until leon managed to get it away from her get rid of it by that time she didnt know she wasnot herself so of course they selected her right away for the gas a madwoman right on the platform she looked up at him tell me anything matters ottos son she reached out and grazed his hand with her fingertips if it did matter i would be sorry do you know that she turned her head distracted by the sound of doors opening here they come theyre going to watch a film she stood drawing him up with her make some excuse for me yes headache whatever you like it doesnt matter she smiled to herself a weak grimace that either she slipped out behind the stream of people heading for the bathrooms before the movie started it seemed a disorganized moment an aimless milling like the scattering pieces in his head whats wrong what was all that liesl said he stared for a second adjusting to the switch back to english his mind elsewhere nothing shes ill tell you later he said looking at her closely now had she known how could she not unless danny had kept this secret too can we cut out before the movie whats the form we cant it would be considered an insult she said listen i have to talk to you i think i know later he said touching her arm heres bunny everything fine bunny said looking at liesl did you enjoy dick her dinner partner had been dick marshall out of his pilot uniform a smile replacing the oxygen mask more window dressing for the party yes he was very funny ill bet bunny said but relieved as if hed expected a different report he turned to ben and you i thought itd be pulling teeth but there you were nattering away ben felt fuzzy a diver decompressing too fast why were they talking about any of this floating on froth like the meringues mr l cant get two words out of her well wed better start the picture before the natives get restless glad you enjoyed yourself he said to liesl youve got a treat in storejack sent over something special ben she said when bunny left at dinner she knew otto he said she knew danny daniel in berlin when he was with my father she thought the nazis had killed him he was getting people out the way he helped you later it started then why didnt you tell me he was a communist what are you talking about she said nervous unprepared for this she told me she was there you must have known known what she said a quick dismissal she looked toward the room measuring their distance from the others then back at him he never said everyone was a bit then they were against the nazis organized there wouldnt have been a resistance if they hadnt you never asked i didnt care about that politics when someone throws you a lifesaver you take it and marry him her eyes flashed it wasnt important she looked down biting her lip i thought he wassympathetic thats all so maybe he worked with them everyone did it was never officialyou know a party member meetings i would have known about that it was a way of looking at things then because of the nazis years ago anyway that was there it was different after we came here its not something you stop just like that things change people change do they you think that thats what youre looking for in his desk a card a letter from stalin i would have known she looked away hearing herself yesterdays certainty he made movies here thats all silly movies so did my father and he ran a cell according to her if you want to know ask them the party i dont think theyre handing out membership lists these days ask howard stein its always in the papers about him that he must be one polly says he is ask him why is it so important anyway because we have to know everything about him what he was doing why anyone would no you have to know i dont know why look theyre going in no more about this the way people talk who knows whats true my fathers applying for citizenship how would it look a communist son a dead one well my fathers alive talk like this we have to know it might be important he took her elbow dont run away from this help me we owe it to him owe it to him she smiled to herself then looked up i was trying to help before you started with all this politics they dont kill you for that yet maybe not love either you want to know the girlfriend rosemary she nodded maybe not the only one i dont know so does that help does she look like how do you know i know i knew at the table the way she was with me she wouldnt look at me not once i could see her do it not looking and then she heard who you were and she was upset she wasnt ready for that the wife thats one thing but you thats it the proof you can prove it any way you like i already know its her she said turning away so that before he could say anything else she had already joined the people moving toward the screening room he followed his mind darting again his feet moving on their own in another place around him people were talking about the movie overheard but echoing like voices in a train station warners treat turned out to be saratoga trunk a bergman not yet released ive been sitting on this since over a year jack said youre worried sol said not worried sam wood youre always going to get an a product getting the time right they put her in dark hair in period and im thinking they want casablanca again not this a totally different type so i wait we hold the picture then what the bells of st marys for christmas talk about timing i figure after that theyll like her in anything put it out right after you cant miss same season you cant get into the crosby see the other well the crosby sol said theyre already counting the money hundred bucks it grosses more than anything this year the catholics alone you know how they come out for nuns jack a hundred bucks there were no assigned seats in the theater so ben and liesl sat together toward the back minot and his wife still being charmed were in the front row with the lasners and the warners bunny walked up the aisle like someone counting the house making sure everything was in place the lights dimmed followed by a blast of music when the warner logo came on people applauded a jokey tribute to jack within minutes ben saw why warner had waited ingrid bergman was in a bustle pretending to be creole there was a dwarf and flora robeson in blackface as a maid who knew voodoo gary cooper was gary cooper a texan his name seemed to be clint maroon none of it made sense and ben drifted not really paying attention somewhere upstairs fays cousin was lying on a bed smoking seeing a splotch of blood on a wall he thought of her bony hand on his how can you use your own but otto had like a religion to him abraham ready to sacrifice isaacby whose orders the priests of the international wherever orders came from your own son who wanted to do it fearless he went through the dinner again trying to piece the parts of dannys life together looking for some clear thread that ran from berlin to the cherokee but what it seemed as patchy and unlikely as the movie even without the dwarf liesl wasnt watching either he could feel her beside him restless in her seat maybe looking for rosemary knowing it was her a feeling the girl most likely someone bunny would make a call for dating ty power while they built her up not a b director on a b lot but when liesl leaned toward him to whisper her mind was somewhere else why would he keep it secret from me why that i wouldnt have cared about that he felt her breath against him before he heard her warm reaching into him when he turned her face was even closer her eyes shiny anxious he sorted out the words not about rosemary but then he saw in her eyes that it was really the same question another betrayal i dont know he said less than a whisper but feeling her breath again the warmth coming off her skin with the last of the perfume and suddenly a trace memory he was a teenager with a girl in a dark theater so close trying not to be overwhelmed by it wanting to lean forward afraid to in a second she would move back the contact broken but she didnt the whispers became tactile like a hand against the side of his face do you believe her the cousin yes but why would he i dont know he said again everything secret now she did look away dismayed reminded of other secrets she sat back pretending to watch the movie seemingly unaware that he didnt move his head turned as if her face were still next to his then someone coughed and he went back to the screen wondering whether anyone had noticed whether it showed on your face the way he used to think it did when the lights came up kids necking in the balcony think about something else why had danny kept it secret even from his wife politics were public argued about unless thered been a turning away a new life that made the past embarrassing something to put behind you howard stein had said hed even faded away from the union no longer interested you get to want other things which still didnt explain how hed ended up in the alley at the cherokee saratoga trunk was a hit with the party ending to applause and pats on the back then everyone began to leave at once pouring out of lasners chateau as if it were a downtown theater without red trolley cars and taxis just harried teenage parkers the warners and the minots were the first to go bunny hovering nearby followed by a halting line of impatient guests did you meet the honorable ken bunny said waiting with them i heard him that was good enough who voted for him anyway the same people who go to the movies he looked up we dont make the world right now hes what they like jack liked him anyway that was the point wasnt it jack likes jack but its a start glad you enjoyed the evening he said to liesl another question mark still working when she thanked him a bland response ben noticed the quick flicker of relief in his eyes relieved about what that shed got on with dick marshall or that nothing more awkward had happened placed at rosemarys table something bunny hadnt expected another car left the line moving forward bunny was looking at her again do you mind my asking are you a dancer a dancer liesl said no why you move very well he said still looking at her oh she said not sure how to respond a professional appraisal not a pass maybe its the theater ben said same training youre an actress bunny said before in vienna not here bunny tilted his head taking her in at a slightly different angle but not in pictures would you make a test a test to see how you look bunny said simply people are different on film oh and with my voice never mind about that its justit gave me an idea the way you moved if youre interested liesl nodded still too surprised to answer ill send you some pages then here we are he said opening the door as the car pulled up liesl stood there for a second hesitant then got in taking direction bunny bent forward eye level with the window maybe nothing he said lets just see well call you in the car she was quiet looking out the open window at the dark hedges and driveways beverly hills asleep this place she said partly to herself years and then one night you walk into a party so i should thank you for that hes not doing it for me you really interested she shrugged it doesnt mean anything they test everybody favors not bunny ha place your bets so maybe it comes up she looked out again and maybe it doesnt so lets see what else am i going to do now she pushed in the dashboard lighter then rummaged in her purse for a cigarette do you think shes pretty who who she said waiting i think she looks like you she stopped the lighter in midair then put the red coiled tip to the cigarette you do maybe they were all you she went quiet again smoking thats nice she said softly to say that she turned from the window then why have them i dont know he said keeping his eyes on the road did you what have others she turned up her lips slightly you mean since he did she shook her head only before you want to know how many i didnt mean i dont even remember that life it made you that way you never knew when youd have to leave go somewhere else so you took what you could i was no different but not after why not i wasnt brought up that way when youre married you know i can cook sew all those things a good wife for somebody but not him they entered the house through the garage turning off the driveway lights behind them do you want a swim she said unclasping her pearls as they walked its good after a partyfor hangovers you go ahead he smiled dont worry i wont watch well then good night thank you for the party my evening with the stars she reached up and kissed his cheek then stopped her face as close as it had been in the theater but this time looking at him her eyes moving as if she were reading him deciphering he stood still feeling her breath again then the graze of her hand behind his neck drawing him closer to kiss him on the mouth he opened his almost dizzy with surprise and the taste of her they broke a gasp for air then kissed again her mouth open to his both of them eager what are you doing he said moving down to her neck smelling perfume and warm skin she pulled back i wanted to know what it would be like he looked at her their faces still close im not him she smiled moving her hand to his forehead gently brushing the hair away no someone else he felt her hand fingertips barely touching his skin but drawing him back a kind of permission then lowered his head to hers again no longer thinking all instinct her mouth was moist all of her warm rubbing against him so that his blood rushed excited she started unbuttoning his shirt her mouth still on his then pulled away both of them panting holding each other are we going to do this a look not words and she answered by taking his hand leading him into the bedroom the furniture just shadows outlined by the pool lights outside she turned her back to him so he could undo her zipper move the dress off her shoulders letting it slide down then hold her there kissing the back of her neck no longer groping smooth wanting to kiss every part of her this shoulder that one she arched her back an involuntary intake of breath then a small sound dropping her head so that he could kiss more of her neck giving it to him when he reached around to her breasts holding them underneath moving his thumbs against her nipples her body came up again pushing back against him and he felt her bare behind the soft round cheeks press against the erection in his pants they stood that way for a minute her nipples growing hard his groin tight against her until he thought he would burst from it and he turned her around kissing her mouth then her breasts faster tearing off his clothes then laying her on the bed and falling over her his mouth covering hers his hand moving down between her legs feeling her wet beginning to move against his hand there was no waiting no drawnout stroking everything that might come later only an urgency mindless she pulled him into her one thrust a second to feel her wrapped around him the wonderful fullness and then they were moving again not a steady rhythm but a heedless plunging impossible to wait both of them grunting he saw her in the pool opening her legs to the patch of hair where he was now then he didnt see anything could only hear her next to his ear breathing then noises little cries as exciting as the slick feel of her pushing against him when she came a louder cry broken like a shuddering he could feel her grip him inside and he wanted to shout let something out before he exploded and then the come shot out of him and he stopped feeling the last jerks his whole body emptying then flooded with relief inexplicable pleasure he moved his elbow falling on her and it was only then that he felt the sweat both of them shiny with it when he rolled away she turned with him and they lay on their sides heads touching not saying anything drained then her body began to shake not crying a trembling what he said quietly touching her she shook her head nothing its justto feel something again she put her hand on him he took her shoulder drawing her closer and kissing her im sorry it was so fast no dont be sorry next time we wont have to hurry she propped herself up looking down at him already a next time youre so sure she said lazily now i know you you think thats true you sleep with someone and you know her all those girls beforeyou knew them every one i didnt want to know them just go to bed very nice and now that youve seduced me me she smiled moving her hand down his chest youre sweaty he moved his hand up to her breast running the back along it come on she said getting off the bed how can you move where just come she pulled his hand and he followed his eyes trailing her white skin feeling illicit walking naked through the dark house he put his hand on the smooth flesh of her behind cupping it and she laughed then sprang away opening the patio door and running across the tiles to the pool looking over her shoulder once at him before she plunged in he ran after her the front of him flapping in the warm night air then jumped in too and swam after her underwater his testicles floating beneath him everything free when he caught up to her they both rose to the surface isnt it wonderful she said shaking her hair i never want to wear clothes again all right he said kissing her she laughed and youd like that she swam a little toward the shallow end so they could hold each other without having to keep afloat in deep water you know my father says you can only seduce someone who wants to be seduced otherwise it cant work when did he say that ben said kissing her again in a story die verfuhrung the seduction he wrote a love story she giggled well it was about germany how the country wanted to be seduced by hitler but i think its the same with people like you she said touching his face what about you he drew her against him as they kissed not playing anymore aroused again drawing one leg up around her everyone thinks it should be easy in the water she said but its hard maybe esther williams can who you dont know her bathing beauty with cugat daniel did some second unit work on it she stopped looking away we didnt get everything overseas he said trying to glide over it maybe it was like this for him she said distracted with the others all like me so now im one of them he let his leg drop freeing her below then turned her head with his fingers im not him she glanced up and moved her shoulder and you dont love me either so thats the same anyway but i know it so nobody gets hurt nobody gets hurt not wanting to go further coaxing her back someone you meet at a party why not her is that what it feels like to you she looked at him for a second her eyes opening wider then pulled him closer leaning her head into his make love to me she said her voice quick and raspy he glanced over the side of the pool the chaise he said kissing her yes on the chaise she said amused like an odalisque she took his hand urgent again leading him up the shallow steps shivering a little as the breeze touched them he held her to him his body a blanket then lay down next to her now you seduce me she said you have to want me to he said stroking her thats how it works she pulled herself up her wet hair falling on him then took his penis into her straddling him she closed her eyes just feeling him there for a second then slowly sat up moving just a little looking down on him this time we dont have to hurry this time it was slow enough to feel everything every part until they came again gasping and then fell back together not talking just breathing ben could see the city lights in the distance hear the palm fronds overhead clicking in the soft air the sound of paradise after a while it turned cooler and he went over to the changing cabana and brought back two robes she wrapped herself in one and reached for a cigarette pack on the table then crunched it up there are more in the house she said can i get you anything a drink he shook his head then raised the back of the chaise to sit upright he watched her go in a blur of white through halfclosed eyes and leaned back smelling the night flowers a light went on in the house in a minute he knew his body would start to go limp and hed drift the animal languor that came after sex everything else could wait until tomorrowwhat had happened what it would mean now there was just this ben she was back at the door her body tense voice nervous she waved him toward her as if she were afraid of being overheard he crossed the patio tilting his head in a question somebodys been in the house she said keeping her voice low what in the office things were different moved i could tell she put her hand on his arm maybe theyre still here her eyes darting upset youre sure you didnt lock the doors of course i locked the doors this one too she said nodding to the patio door sometimes iris forgets he looked down at the door handle no scratches or chipped paint but an easy lock he guessed for someone who knew how what if theyre still here she said gripping his arm tighter calm down theres no one here he thought of them on the bed grunting someone watchingbut they would have felt that sensed anyones presence wouldnt they ill walk through he flicked on a light is anything missing i dont know i just went to the study for cigarettes what was moved little things on the desk maybe iris no it didnt seem right i could feel it another feeling dont laugh at me she said almost snapping someone was here in the house she clutched the top of her robe tighter her voice rising a pitch all right ill look where do you keep your valuables she looked at him blankly jewels he said cash jewels just the pearlsin the bedroom but the bedroom was untouched except for the bed the spread twisted and still damp from sex nobody had taken anything from the bureau drawer the velvet box with earrings and a clip there was still money under the handkerchiefs he went through the rest of the house turning on lights liesl close to him still anxious fear bobbing just beneath the surface not just an intruder a more general violation ever have any trouble before ben said no it was safe i was safe here youre still safe he said taking her by the shoulders stop you dont know what its like she said not really hearing him every knock always looking back i thought it was different here liesl nothings missing so just in here he said turning in to the study she nodded the desk somebody went through the desk how do you know its different look at the blottersee the one end out to look under see for yourself you know his drawers she picked up the cigarettes lighting one now her hand shaking then stood watching him go through the drawer everything seemed the same until the second drawer the folders of personal papers the police accident report jammed at the end not where hed put it what she said seeing him hesitate somethings out of place he went through the envelope flipping through the photos everythings here probably where i put it just looked different no you noticed liesl why would someone break into the house and not take moneyanythingjust go through a desk his desk all right his desk she inhaled smoke then folded her arms across her chest holding herself in its what you said i didnt believe you why would anybody do that i thought it was just your way of she broke off hearing herself racing but its true isnt it maybe i always knew it that he wouldnt i didnt want to be afraid and now theyre in my house somebody killed him and theyre still not finished what do they want i dont know he said coming over to her maybe they think i have itwhatever they want they didnt go through your things just his i cant stay here listening any noise ill go to my fathers he took her by the shoulders as if he were holding her down before she could fly away im here youre just nervous thats all ill be right next to you all night oh next to me and what will iris think an automatic response he smiled at her the worst probably how can you joke ill check the doors nothing is going to happen to you i promise he kissed her forehead if youre worried about the house ill talk to somebody make it safe who guy i met hed know she dropped her head to his chest when is it going to be over the phone ringsyour husbands inwhen was that and its still not over what did he do go with rosemary and hes dead for that its crazy and now you what am i doing his brother she raised her head maybe thats crazy too my lover say that again he said brushing her hair she looked away oh that doesnt make it any better it doesnt have to make sense it happens we wanted it to he paused we seduced each other so nothing makes sense what happened to him we have to make sense of that he touched her hair again just that liesls fathers birthday went exactly as predicted dieter read a long prepared toast then ostermann stood up for his own prepared thankyou the others were more spontaneous but none of them brief the conscience of germany a glib phrase from time had now become a kind of honorary title his own von the toasts ran to form the books the humanitarian concerns the early courage in speaking out all noted before and repeated now familiar as myth the dinner itself followed a prescribed pattern it had been called for late afternoon a throwback to the curfew days when aliens had to be home by eight and the food according to liesl was unvarying steaming bowls of chicken soup with liver dumplings boiled beef with horseradish potatoes and red cabbage followed finally by salkas chocolate cake a menu that seemed designed to weigh people down in their chairs for the toasts later after the brandies there would be coffee and mohn cookies more winter food as the california sun poured through the window salkas house on a steep wooded road dropping down into santa monica canyon was modest a dolls house compared to lasners the guests were many of the same people whod come to dannys funeral and they greeted ben like an old friend with the fast hospitality of exiles brecht was there again and spent most of the time arguing with someone in a corner lion feuchtwanger interrupting playing peacemaker fritz lang with a monocle thomas mann had not come this time a social deference not wanting to eclipse the birthday honoree kaltenbach wore a suit that needed cleaning ben noticed scarcely any of it preoccupied the german toasts droning in the background liesl down the table her face halfhidden by one of salkas flower arrangements did she look different did he could anyone tell if he looked down at the lace tablecloth blotting out the rest he could see her last night riding him her breasts bobbing and he smiled to himself because no one else knew their secret maybe this was the excitement spies felt sitting down with the enemy knowing something holding it to themselves while no one else had the faintest idea what was more secretive than sex kaltenbach stood up to make his toast ben glanced down again at liesl this time meeting her eyes amused talking to him in code just the two of them when he went out to the kitchen to open more wine she followed standing behind as he pulled the corkscrew putting her hand on his waist he turned their faces close somebodyll see he said quietly glancing toward the dining room the angle of the table she pulled at his shirt moving them away from the sink the open door no they wont she said urgent her eyes darting with excitement not here kissing him then her lips warm unexpected alive with risk from the dining room there was the tinkle of glass and they kissed harder racing ahead of it he pulled away breathless theyll see he said already hard his face red with it unmistakable i dont care she said eyes shiny still moving then leaned forward again i dont care not really meaning it playing but the words flooding into him like sex itself rushing wonderful then there was the scrape of a chair and he turned back to the counter grasping the wine bottle and she slipped over to the refrigerator opening it with a faint suppressed giggle kids stealing cookies waiting to be found out he took a breath to calm himself and started in with the wine but when he saw that the chair belonged to ostermann standing to respond to a toast he glanced back at liesl a complicit smile something theyd got away with after all after dinner salka led the party down mabery road to the beach to watch the sunset ben had volunteered to drive feuchtwanger home a cliffside house on a twisting palisades road that would be treacherous in the dark so he was late joining the others on the broad beach people whod come earlier for the day were still in bathing suits or sweatshirts and stared openly at salkas group in suits and ties liesl took her shoes off but the men didnt bother formal even in the sand the light on the water had already begun to turn the deep gold just before orange you know i was twelve before i saw the ocean ostermann said to ben they were walking with dieter the others straggling behind fifty years ago more now the nordsee absolutely gray freezing rocks for beaches but my father had paid for the week so we had to stay he made a mock shudder at the memory so something else good here dieter said indicating the white sand yes but shallow you have to walk far before you can swim thats why they build the piers he nodded to the amusement pier farther down the beach me i prefer lakes of course its what i knew the wannsee anyway liesls the swimmer not me from a child always in the water yes she loves the pool ben said seeing her gliding underwater parting her legs everyone thinks it would be easy in the water but its not preferring a chaise he looked over at ostermann suddenly embarrassed change the subject she told me about die verfuhrung he said ive never read it is it in a collection no alone quieros did it in holland a small edition it was not so popular you know not even the emigres liked it antigerman me antigerman its a german failing dieter said thin skin kanon joseph stardust and thick boots ostermann said a wonderful combination anyway no one read it i thought they might buy it for the title he said teasing they would think its something else but no one did you always write about germany dieter said everybody knows that and this timebe faira fatal flaw in the blood an insult no not in the blood thats what the nazis believed things in the blood destiny it wasnt like that a whole country seduced led into a dream you have to make that happen he raised his finger a classroom gesture but they have to want the dream the master race imagineto believe that if its german its better well the french too maybe everyone look at them here the greatest country in the world what does that mean great how but they believe it its not the same dieter said what happened there was unique you think so well lets hope its not so hard you know give them something to be afraid of someone else the process is the same did danny ever talk to you about this ben said liesl said he liked to talk to you about this ostermann said confused the story he said it was different here he nodded to dieter a point he said they were already seduced by the movies ha dieter said he was serious ostermann shrugged well an idea to make talk that was his world not politics he never talked to you about politics ben said maybe i talked enough for both of us ostermann said wryly of course you know he worked against the nazis to get people out of france but i think that was for the adventure he had that spirit but here but someone told me last night he was a communist youd think people are always saying such things now dieter said every day in the papers how many could there be just for signing a petition a glance to ostermann no the woman knew him in berlin she said he worked for them in berlin ostermann said but he must have been a boy old enough he helped my father what woman fay lasners cousin genia she was in the camps to survive that dieter said impressed genia a polish name originally but she knew him in berlin but saying such things at dinner to accuse she wasnt accusing him of anything she was one too and he never said anything to you dieter said his brother its her imagination i think what did you think when you were eighteen ostermann said gently putting a hand on bens shoulder do you remember i was for the kaiser a young mans ideas things change maybe he changed too a flirtation and then you want to put it behind you especially now dieter said the way things are even at the school checking on everybody so strict what do they think we write on the blackboards he nodded toward ostermann maybe you can help me persuade the conscience of germany to keep his conscience to himself a little its not a good time to show these opinions when was the good time thirtythree dieter gave ben a seewhatimean look then turned to the water look its setting at the end so fast do you know why liesl said coming up to them slipping her arm through dieters of course he said affectionate when the horizon line she reached up and kissed him on the cheek im teasing of course you know everything when are you going to show us the stars i thought you were going to take us up the mountain youre serious youre interested to go he said including ben whenever you like you have to stay overnight you know yes i know she said turning to ben her eyes meeting his in code again ill pack something warm smiling now handing him a room key he smiled back then toward the sunset before anyone could notice feeling the color in his face you know i dont think it can be true ostermann said quietly to ben reassuring again the ones i knewthey talked about it they liked to tell you for them it wasthe truth it explained everything children daniel wasnt like that moreelastic anyway does it matter so much now what he thought youve got a hell of a nerve how would i know howard stein pushed back from his desk as if hed been touched by a cattle prod i thought you were in the party thats what i heard what are you working for that fuck tenney or did the studio send you lasner doesnt like the pickets he wants to nail us this way its a simple question get a subpoena you might get an answer thats how it works now he looked across the desk you have any idea what youre getting into with this i just want to know about danny somebody told me he was so was he its not a crime last time i heard yeah and its a free country he was a friend of yours that doesnt make him anything he looked up it doesnt make me anything either he kept looking at ben hesitating then stood up taking his hat off the stand his manner deliberately lighter but ill buy you a cup of coffee you want some stories for your scrapbook he jerked his head toward the door more than a suggestion he could be a funny guy before ben could say anything more they were heading down the stairs and into the glare of the street steins office was over a car showroom on wilshire not far from the tar pits and the closest diner was empty at this hour still waiting for school groups you think im crazy maybe youre right but i think they got the office wired you talk about stuff like this the board starts lighting up dont bother he said catching bens look i know paranoid i even know how to spell it but im still walking around it never hurt anybody be a little careful you either he nodded to the waitress to bring the coffee pot first of all im not in the party i left the party thats for you all right not the water cooler just something you heard around so was he you want him to be everybody else is running away from this and you want to hand him a card i just want to know stein waited until the waitress had poured their cups the gods truth no not that i ever heard of or saw not one meeting id swear to it at least him i wont have to hes dead its the others theyll want to get fuck em its a funny thing about agethe memory goes not a goddam thing you can do about it even under oath what with tenney up in sacramento whats he going to do put me away ive been there im not afraid of it you were in prison you didnt know im a tough guy fucking george raft he stirred some sugar in his coffee aggravated assault that was hitting back when they broke up a picket line teach me a lesson which it did but not the one they thought he looked up no he wasnt like i said he was a friend to the union thats all and then not even that five years ago there were lots of shades of red here like a fucking lipstick counter now theres one and its too bright for most people then why would she say he wasthe woman who knew him make trouble maybe this is someone in the hollywood group no from before in germany germany thats years ago he was a member or just he was a courier for them would they have trusted an outsider then stein thought for a minute all right but thats still years ago it doesnt expire does it its not like a library card maybe he quit i thought you couldnt no thats what they think the tenneys the minots youre never clean unless you confess help them throw a few other people on the fire you can quit i did why did you ben asked suddenly curious he sipped his coffee no one thing maybe i got tired of taking orders party discipline all the goddam meetings it wears you out and this place you got a bunch of people sitting around beating themselves up part of the dialectic and theyre bringing home five hundred a week more i didnt sign on for that and you know what i got more done outside than in my little time away kept me out of the service so i went to work for the union the last thing they expected when they put on the cuffs when was this stein glanced up late if thats what you mean its a funny thing after the hitler pact thirtynine everyone heres bailing and i stick maybe stubborn but i figure maybe theres something i dont know then it all turns around and i see there wasnt just whats good for russia it takes a while you know to see where its going then we get in the war and now everybodys friends againsome people here came back in you believe it but it has the opposite effect on me i dont care anymore the party line keep the movement alive help russia what about this country what are we doing for us he shrugged maybe it was all the patriotic movies what the hell me waving flags i know what its like here he touched the top of his head i got the bruises but i figure if we can get rid of the fucking golfers we still have a shot at something here ben smiled but the golfers have the money yeah they do stein said smiling a little right on top where they like to be now anyway you ever go across the street see the pits its interesting you see these bones the dinosaurs and you think there they were walking around fucking owned the place top of the world and then the next thingtheyre gone just bones in a pit its something to think about you drive out to the valley past warners you see those big sound stages sitting there like the whole things theirs and for all they know a tar pits going to open up on them then your pickets go too stein grinned jack would like that hed throw them in firstbuy a little time he looked down you want pie or something with that he said a signal to wrap things up ben shook his head this is so important to you whether he was a red did he ever talk about my father some bigtime director over there right the nazis killed him he didnt get out in time or something or something stein waited thats who danny was working for he used his own kid what does that tell you thats a trick question he said flustered listen i knew your brother the family thats something else he didnt talk about that just your father once in a while not the mother he never mentioned you for instance no ben said feeling it anyway a sharp point going in so i dont know what does it tell me he must have thought it was important to do that it was to them they helped smuggle people out then after they got my father danny kept doing it getting people out of france probably using the same network wouldnt you say its not the kind of thing you can do freelance you need somecomrades in place so he still must have been a red and then he gets on a boat to come home and throws his card over the side does that seem like danny to you not on a boat stein said quietly what he came on the clipper the boats werent running then something else he didnt know a meaningless detail with the same sharp end so does it ben said stein thought for a minute playing with his spoon you ask his wife she says no he didnt tell her either ben said including stein but you believe the other woman the one who said he was she survived the camps people like that dont have to make anything up they could make a mistake ben shook his head not her it cost her to tell me stein looked at him uncomfortable then went back to his spoon sometimes its better keeping things quiet lets say he gets here first thing he sees is you dont want to advertise lie low we were never popular here you know even before this craziness began so he goes unofficial unofficial part of a closed chapter you mean secret dont get excited not like that just off the books to protect their jobs some places this can get you fired flash a card at hearst see how long you last you go unofficial to protect yourself theres a chapter like that here stein shrugged youre in pictures you cant afford to offend the public my group it was mostly writersthey dont have to care but they must answer to somebody in the party they wouldnt just be left on their own would they no so who would it be here i wouldnt know ben looked at him even if you did i left the party not everybody did and i dont know you from adam he paused look i liked your brother so im telling you maybe he was unofficial but i never heard that and it doesnt matter a damn now anyway leave it you dont want to get somebody else in trouble they put me under oath there are no unofficials never heard of them the rest of us the dues payers its open season on us but we dont have to give them anyone else all right take a look at this hal said head leaning over the moviola viewer his jaw even in the morning had traces of beard birkenauwe havent seen this before ben looked with him silent film with card titles in cyrillic stacks of corpses he felt his stomach slide the way it always did open oven doors with mounds of ashes lasner wont like using russian footage cut away from the soldiers it doesnt matter whos holding the camera we just want to see the place look the guards are still there this must be just after they went in on the small screen men in uniforms were being led away hands up their collars open disheveled what do they look like to you ben said watching them anybody ben nodded anybody you wonder what went through their heads the ovens going night and day the smell there were people in bunks too weak to move holloweyed and ben realized going down the line with the film that he was looking for genia an outside shot now prisoners standing around disoriented waiting for another roll call the wire fence the ovens again bodies everywhere what she must have seen every day unable to turn away like the guards he thought of her in the big louis xv room her dead eyes still seeing what was in the film after a while it would be the only thing you knew and then you were here in the sunshine with people drinking milkshakes and you saw that it must have been going on at the same time while the doctors made selections on the platform and there was no reason at all why you were in one place or the other reality itself become something random inexplicable this is pretty rough hal was saying worse than the other stuff were going to have to be careful you dont want to chase the audience away we want them to see it thats the point look at the russians soldiers carrying inmates to carts theyve all got their heads turned you dont want the audience doing that he glanced up at ben let me work on it you want anything back well put it back but keep the guards the way they look they watched the rest of the film then another absorbed not even making notes letting it run a pan shot across bodies the genitals just smudges as if they had retreated inside the women oddly neutered without sex open mouths bastards hal said almost a whisper and then neither of them said anything when it was over they went outside for a cigarette wanting distance even a few feet hal leaned back against the wall looking toward the admin building on gower howd you get him to do it he said lasner he saw itone of the camps i didnt have to do anything well whatever you did i never thought id get to do something like this at continental piece of history fort roach enemies to friends how to bow to a jap what not to say to the women put in your time go home at night thats all ive done nothing like this he cocked his head taking in ben from a new angle what are you going to do after what the army ben shrugged maybe go back overseas theres a newsreel job if i want it most people they get on the lot they never want to leave i just want to get this one done you saw it for real thats why ben dropped his cigarette and rubbed it out with his foot im still trying to figure it out the guards how do you get to that point when you can do that what makes it all right do you know i dont youre never going to know that a wife shoots her husband that you can know this there has to be something what makes them think its the right thing to do theres no money in it nothingpersonal like the wife some other reason for ending up in a mound of ashes or in an alley with your blood running out at least he could know the reason for that as blameless as the ash heaps the question that was always there what had he done riordans telephone voice was all business as if he were sitting behind a desk what kind of technical advice for a picture no someone broke into the house last night so call the cops nothings missing i cant prove anyone was there then why do you think some things were rearranged rearranged look the point is it made liesl nervous i dont want it to happen again i figured youd have some ideas the bureau must what train us in breaking and entering ill tell you this much somebody wants to get in hell get in get better locks alarms will run you money and anybody who knows what hes doing can get in anyway get dead bolts thats for free i was thinking about surveillance there was a pause as riordan took this in youre asking me to babysit i figured youd know somebody what makes you think theyre coming back they didnt take anything even stuff just lying around so they must have been after something in particular if they didnt find it maybe theyll try again look im just asking you to recommend somebody another pause all right ill have a look around anybody home today iris the housekeeper liesl probably tell whoevers there i sent you to check the locks got a pencil i know where it is thats right the funeral what was rearranged so you knew somebody had been there a file in the desk that was careless whats in the desk nothing papers desk stuff no idea what they were looking for thats why i called the bureau yeah all right ill take care of it where are you the studio thats gower you know luceys on melrose by paramount six but im telling you now its locks the red light was on so ben waited leaning against the sound stage wall his head still full of the artkino footage in the street two japanese pilots were sharing a smoke probably on their way to divebomb dick marshall the casually surreal world hal thought everyone wanted what have you got a girl back over there or something hed said not able to let it go no here ben smiled to himself a mermaid waiting at home dannys home the red light flicked off and he heard the buzzer inside unlocking the doors what would rosemary say why would she say anything a girl on her way up dancing with ty power at the mocambo shed want to shed danny any blist affair like molted skin ben stepped in facing the backs of some painted flats then walked around to the interior of the set still drenched in hot light a nightclub with an orchestra stage and a bar at the side now being set up for a tracking shot gaffers were making adjustments in the overheads angling away from the mirror behind the bar the extras in suits and evening dresses were still sitting at the club tables waiting to be told to start talking again rosemary in a tight dress was leaning back against a slant board to keep the skirt from creasing while a makeup girl ran a comb over her hair patting it gently into place rosemary didnt move when the girl stepped aside leaving her alone against the board she seemed for a minute like an oil painting propped on an easel i hope you dont mind he said coming up to her we didnt get a chance to talk at dinner no she said wary but not surprised to see him ready in two darling the assistant director said passing them were in the middle of a scene she said to ben you all right with the gun the ad said she nodded glancing at the gun on the table beside her make a leap before she can react danny told me a lot about you eyes cornered now but meeting his not backing away yes noncommittal waiting we were close he could tell me things he said wondering if a lie showed in your face she looked at him still waiting just me he said a reassurance she stared for another second then raised her eyebrow well that puts you one up he never told me anything it turns out she said her voice sarcastic but warm as if bad behavior were a bond between them something they should have expected how do you mean i always believe it i always think okay this time im not going to listen and then i do i guess you like to thinkyoure the only one so thats what you hear he never told me about anyone else ben said trying it another fly cast just me huh well so theres that look i dont know what to say to you is there a script for this i meanhis brother its a relief in a way i guess that somebody knows one day you think youre she stopped looking down and the next day youre not supposed to exist you cant go to the funeral upset anyone so what do i say im sorry for your loss well im sorry for mine too but nobodys going to say it to me ill say it to you thanks she said stopped by this well so now what i want to talk to you about him why warn me off before it gets out of hand before the wife finds out a little late now anyway she knows i could tell was that you he shook his head not danny either a hunch i guess maybe you told her the way you acted with her yeah and maybe it was that big a on my back she looked up at him amused your face i played the part in stock youre right though i never read the book so what do you want to talk about were you there the night he fell what she said a place holder caught off guard with him with him you think hed do that with me there its the kind of thing you do alone somebody was there or expected maybe you were on your way she looked at him carefully whats this all about nothing im just trying to find out how it happened who to blame you mean you think i wanted this she shook her head why would i i thought we were i was silly about him huh thats the first time ive said that even to myself she looked away whatever it means he said it and it turns out it didnt mean much no i wasnt there must have been somebody else on the call sheet she turned back to him you think it was because of me is that what you want to know maybe i should be flattered but i wasnt anything special to him i know that now what did he tell you when you were so buddybuddy what did he say about me besides being an easy lay places the ad yelled he said you were nice oh she said softly surprised her eyes suddenly moist if you ruin this scene for me ill kill you she got off the slant board checking her dress and picked up the gun then turned to him nice thats not a word hed use maybe i said it he nodded to the gun who are you going to shoot the makeup girl came back for a last brush of powder my lover im jealous she met his eyes people are we going to wrap today or not places monica stick that puff somewhere all right here we go the buzzer sounded the director looking through the viewfinder on the tracking camera signaled for the clapper rosemarys lover an actor ben didnt know turned from his drink and started walking down the length of the bar into the moving camera you think you can but you cant he said looking from her to the gun rosemarys hand shook her eyes beginning to tear up you love me the actor said with a sneer i hate you rosemary said the words pulled out of her then shoot he said easily still coming toward her he froze as the shot exploded then grabbed his stomach in astonishment and dropped to the floor rosemary kept holding the gun out then lowered her arm her shoulders shaking cut the director said nice lets get one for safety they did it twice more then broke to change the setups for rosemarys reaction shots were almost there the director said to rosemary the payoff shot remember you still love him even while im plugging him she said wryly and i want to see it right here he said pointing to her eyes watch the dress she stepped back against the slant board that was good ben said its always good until you see it we can talk later if you theyll be ten minutes she said you want to know why he did it so do i dont you think ive asked myself a million times i never thought there was anything wrong maybe one of his other friends didnt show and he got all upset i dont know me all hed have had to do was pick up the phone he was seeing someone else he must have been why else would he have the place we never went there well oncei had somebody staying with me we used mine sometimes little trips santa barbara the biltmore he was romantic like that her voice thickened la valencia down in la jolla places but not the cherokee just the once he said it was a friends place he borrowed it because we couldnt use any of the hotelsthe columns watch and then i read in the paper that it was his so there must have been somebody else without a place maybe more than one who knows that hurt a little you like to think but why should i be surprised what did i think i was someone he saw like that on the side call it romanticoh la valencia but you know what it is it didnt seem that way though at the time it wasnice how long were you a few months last spring ve day i was on loanout at republic and they stopped work allday party so i guess i could blame the booze but it wasnt and he wasnt breaking it off not that he told me she said a little sharp maybe he told you ben shook his head then why do you ask because he gave notice at the cherokee end of the month i just assumedhe didnt need it anymore she took this in you think someone gave him the brush i dont know any idea who it might have been i never even suspected why would i we were good together you look at it now and i guess i was a fool but i never thought when i first heard i thought maybe hed been sick some condition he had a lot of doctor appointments then i read the place was his and i thought oh thats where the doctor was those kind of appointments how did you hear in the papers i was on the set and its in the papers and i had to pretend it didnt mean anything it didnt say how bad he was not that i could go to the hospital anyway you had no idea he was in a coma you call and they say stable they didnt know who you were when you called what do you think im not supposed to exist remember and you werent at the cherokee that night i told you why do you keep asking that because if you werentif there was nothing to connect you to himwhy would bunny get the police to file it as an accident she started then pushed herself away from the slant board no longer caring about the dress what are you talking about you think bunny would fix something for me im not important enough did he know about you and danny i dont know he knows everything hes like that but what if he did you think the studios going to fall apart because somebody sees us necking in la jolla with danny not ty power he wouldnt like that then hed tell me about it not go flying around town playing mr fixit you think hed do that for me you dont know what its like here he can trade me in for a new model any time he likes not if youre a star thats something to look forward to then isnt it bunny cleaning up after you but hes not doing it now im just a big maybe to him you know how many chances you get in this town one not even half maybe and nobody gives it to you you just keep working and one day you get lucky she opened her hand to the set this is mine if the picture works maybe i get the other half a real chance thats after ten years a greyhound from newark nobody fixes anything for me anyway fix what you close a file nobody asks any questions nobodys embarrassed thats all and im the embarrassment maybe danny was a married man they have plans for you the buzzer sounded ro one sec she turned to ben look what happenedthis business about giving somebody the brush he wasnt planning to do that was he i mean to me he didnt tell you that no she nodded holding on to it thanks this is a funny kind of conversation to be having i never thought of him as dead i knew it wouldnt lastbut not like this why wouldnt it last well they dont do they these things she shrugged theyre all still in love with their wives i think she brushed the front of her skirt smoothing it for the shot anyway they dont leave them he had lunch with hal taking in the pecking order of the commissary lasner had nodded to them when they came in a sign of favor from the head table but nobody got up to ask them to join the group sober gray and pinstripe suits except for bunny in his camel hair jacket the writers were more casual hounds tooth checks and plaids noisy with laughter as if theyd just moved the table over from the derby on vine the actors stayed with their production units eating salads in period dress and seating themselves by salary levels otherwise technicians talked shop with each other the room itself seemed the one place on the lot where lasner or bunny had been willing to spend moneychair backs of curved chromium tubes lacquered tables and sleek sconces a cedric gibbons set whos that with sam pilcer hal said nodding to a table near the window where julie sherman was huddled with a short man in a doublebreasted suit that was fast the ink cant even be dry on the contract yet you want me to introduce you later not in front of sam ben smiled but looked over again uneasily julie was leaning forward her full attention on pilcer is this how danny had done it a drink and a promise then a quick trip to the cherokeeexcept theyd never gone there only the once a place paid for by the month theyre wrapping today hal was saying maybe ill run into her at the party without sam rosemarys picture what about her what about chances with her hal shook his head protective shes not shes got talent ben looked at him surprised hed made the distinction talent watch her on the set a pro on time knows her lines no highhatting ever knows your name she does the job he looked at ben then she goes home but not always sometimes she went to la jolla the papers have her out with ty power yeah well hal said you know these pictures they put her in shes got the figure for it but shes not like that he looked again toward julies table you want to get something going ask her if she has a friend what just thinking ben said then gathered up his tray i have to make a call on his way out he couldnt resist another sidelong glancepilcer even closer now smiling telling her all the things he could do for her what men must have said to rosemary too while she waited for half a chance but shed believed danny kelly was in a rush claiming to be on deadline quick question ben said one sec long time no hear nothing to tell yeah i know this ones heading for the fridge so what do you want to know when did danny take up the lease at the cherokee did anybody ever say last spring no first of the year they didnt say i asked im a reporter a cheeky dick powell why do you want to know why would he im checking the loanouts helps to have a time when she might have been here first of the year youre still on this huh arent you ill tell you something the way it works at a certain point you think im just spinning wheels its getting late i can feel the chill on this one already how many weeks now and all i got is one girlfriend who wasnt there what who the miller kid on your contract list he said a tiny delay making a point how do you figure that i showed glossies to the night clerk the real one not joel he idd her but not joel never saw her so i checked her out and hes right she wasnt there that night so nothing you never told me keep your pants on tell what we dont have anything if she wasnt there a hit and run if i ran an item on everyone who got laid there wouldnt be enough paper so they screwed around and hes dead but wheres the connection no story but you ran it down anyway its always nice to know something to put on the layaway plan might come in handy you never know if she makes it ben said then you can give it to polly tch tch is that nice anyway whats in it for polly hes dead sorry i didnt meanbut he is and not a star so the only way it plays now is if she is and he was the secret love of her life which doesnt sound like it was the clerk saw her once you cant do much with a onenighter not even polly ben said nothing one night la jolla the biltmore all the others still hers not tucked away in anyones file hey speaking of which you know the fed at the market you asked me to check out riordan yeah the technical consultant turns out he was republic paid him worked for your brother on the series just like he said so why speaking of which ben said trying to follow oh pollys secretary you said he came to the funeral with polly so i figured shed know him and well i told you they never retire they just find other garbage to go through hes been freelancing for tenneyyou know the one with the committee a bunch of old hands from the bureau dig around for him he sends stuff over to polly and sometimes riordan takes it thats how polly knows him tenney stays clear so nobody figures where the stuff is coming from so hes a messenger more like a supplier anyway hes who he says he is and a little more christ theres the me i have to go wait one more thing the clerk who idd rosemary he saw her they didnt go through the back no he saw her they must have come in the front i gotta run you want ill keep poking around but this is already going away what i cant figure is the studio but maybe they got trigger happygrabbed the phone before there was anything to cover up it happens you get nervous about people maybe they dont like rosemary screwing around but that doesnt get us anywhere we need someone there that night or every nightthe romance that broke his heart but all weve got is a jump yesterday check the loanouts danny had rented the cherokee months before rosemary maybe for someone he didnt bring through the front door he started out for personnel to get the monthly lists but got sidetracked by hal instead excited about something i was thinking about the guards he said leading ben to the cutting room you know the faces are hard to see medium pan shots nothing closer its newsreel film army they dont do closeups heads tilted up to the light long lashes making shadows right but take a look at this at the moviola a frozen frame of the guards being led away just for the idea its a work print but they should have the camera originals in culver city now look he took a lens and held it over a section of the viewer so that a single face leapt out of the frame blow up the negative here show his face ben looked at the spot enlargement the guards eyes caught forever on a piece of film in the full running shot hed be turning away from the camera a closeup of shame itself itll cost though the lab work youre not just splicing what if the qualitys not good enough the stocks grainy wetgate print it what before you transfer it takes out the scratches we always do it with a sixteenmillimeter transfer come back here ill show you ben followed him not really wanting to take the time but feeling obligated he had felt in hals eyes the line workers mild contempt for the foreman still learning the fundamentals the whole technical side of filmmakingthe developing tanks the chemical emulsions the synchronized sprocketswere things handled by someone else they went through heavy double doors to a big factory space of drying rooms and machines that made the transfer from light to image merlins workshop see the transfers clear hal said leading him to a machine but you couldnt close in on this depends on the exposure what light was retained he pointed to the sample an indoor shot of people lying in bunks you blow up these faces you dont have enough resolution like a night shot see what i mean ben looked at the faces visible now as individuals but slightly blurred not good enough for fullscale projection i tried printing with more light but you cant get the background up too dark in the first place he reversed the process the faces slipping back into a formless crowd but the other stock we can work with shadowy faces in a crowd ben stood still eyes fixed on the enlarging mechanism hal he said not looking at him thinking you can do this with any picture right bring up the background depends how it was printed if you can work from the negative you can pretty much get whatevers there the negative ben said elsewhere thats right then you control the printing kind of coax it out ben looked at his wristwatch how long would it take blow up some negatives stills no time what stills ben touched his upper arm ill be back keep the machine free okay what stills in the car he tried to remember the lighting in the pictures windows shining down on the cherokee alley the glare of a police flashbulb a few people standing near the body the rest outside the circle of light like dots in an afterimage he tried to remember the womena distraught neighbor anyone from the studio maybe even rosemary herself who hadnt been therebut all hed really looked at before was the body iriss car was in the driveway so he parked on the street and walked around to the back of the house the french doors wide open another invitation to rifle through dannys desk liesl was in the kitchen grating potatoes her face pink from the work wisps of hair spilling down out of the pile on top oh what are you doing here just picking something up wanting to go over to her touch her arm but aware of iris at her ironing board i thought you were going to keep the doors locked well at night oh now you wont be surprised she waved the knife i wanted to surprise you my roast chicken he nodded to the mixing bowl whats that kartoffelpuffer a hesitant smile i told you i could cook what did riordan say about the locks who the man i sent over to check the house no ones been here ben looked at his watch cutting it close or not coming or maybe hed been there without announcing himself playing burglar thats a lot of food are people coming no just us she said looking at him her eyes soft its going to rain i think so its cozy eating in he held her stare for a second trying not to smile in front of iris then headed to the study the photographs were just as hed remembered danny lying with a dark smear around his head people huddled at the edge of the flash two angles with two backgrounds one of the parking area the other leading to the street he looked carefully at the faces in front but still didnt recognize anybody theyd be neighbors rushing out at the sudden sound then the police lights something more exciting than the radio but who were the people right behind them he slipped out the written reports leaving the prints and negatives in the envelope when will you be home liesl said then flushed the simplest domestic question now somehow suggestive i only ask because of the chicken im supposed to see riordan after work if he shows eight eightthirty yes all right but youll call if youll be late so i know this time he did smile not caring whether iris saw something any couple might say hal looked at the pictures waiting for ben to explain what exactly are we looking for people you cant see clearly in the prints theyre dark he held up one of the negatives to the light then turned it on its side looking at the numbers in the margin these are police whered you he stopped still waiting whos the victim my brother i thought ben nodded i want to see who was there somebody from the building maybe anybody i could talk to hal looked at him skeptical then took up the negatives okay lets go to work ben watched fascinated as hal manipulated the negatives enlarging then disappearing into the darkroom with its trays of solutions but even the studio couldnt produce a miracle in the shot looking toward the parking lot faces were barely visible even blown up the alley angle was better street lamps at the end providing a kind of backlight they looked at the enlargements together ben hoping that hal familiar with everyone on the lot might suddenly recognize somebody but they were all anonymous caught unexpectedly in suspenders and house dresses one woman in curlers hand over her mouth you can tell the cops by the hats hal said examining a new print everyone else just rushed out i guess look back there in the alley you can always tell cant you so why is he in the alley not with the others hes just someone off the street whos the woman next to him can we get in closer on her closer not much a few more degrees youll get a blotch but lets try one when the print was done it was just clear enough ben looked then went rigid stunned she looked better in the dark hal said but the hatpure cop you still think hes in off the street no hes a cop ben said slowly exfbi his parking space was behind admin b but when he got there he put the keys back in his pocket he could use the walk to clear his head he passed the choked line of cars at the gate all heading home at once then the small knot of picketers and turned down gower where they used to shoot westerns under roofs of cheesecloth today they wouldnt need to filter the lightthe day cloudy before was overcast and thick already growing faint how long had riordan been in the alley in the picture hed been craning his neck to see just another curious bystander but how could he have been someone danny knew who had never made himself known not on any of the reports a hat in the crowd wanting to see maybe wanting to make sure luceys was more than a few blocks a longer walk than he expected so he was late when he pushed open the door and took a second to adjust to the dim light inside the afterwork drinkers had already piled in from paramount but riordan had managed to get a table and he signaled ben through the crowd with a twofinger wave i went ahead and ordered he said pointing to two glasses try getting a waitress in this beer okay ben sat down putting the envelope next to riordans hat so he said letting riordan take the lead so you need to do something about the pool doors oh ben said looking over at him the same military short hair steady eyes but everything different now someone whod been in the alley is that how you got in theyd be easy to jimmy he said not picking up on this i noticed at the funeral and thats why you didnt bother going over today riordan said nothing or because you already knew how he got in saturday did you do it yourself or did you send someone else in case riordan picked up his glass staring at ben over the rim as he drank buying a minute if id done it you wouldnt have known anybody was there he said finally so someone else but youd tell him what to look for now you want to tell me you think i knocked over your place what for for something you didnt get maybe i can help youre going in circles and i keep coming back here you were tailing him youre still tailing him a dead man what do you want didnt you have enough on him already a nice big file down in tenneys office you dont know what youre talking about i know you work for tenney take love notes to polly god knows what else keep tabs on liesls father dangerous characters like him so we can sleep safe at night while youre breaking into the house i dont work for tenney were you getting stuff on danny while he was paying you maybe little notes on his love life tenney likes that i hear where is this coming from riordan said evenly your informations old i dont work for tenney i did a while ago but thats a while ago and by the way im not tailing ostermann you just like having lunch at the farmers market riordan sat back his eyes steady on ben you going to tell me what this is all about ben slid the envelope to riordan have a look ben watched him open the envelope and take out the picture his face registering no emotion at all a practiced blank but when he did raise his eyes they had a new directness where did you get this the police had it they just didnt know what they had what did they have someone he knew right at the scene who didnt identify himself just stood there watching him bleed out they might be interested in that i was and and they might want to know more show your picture around do those things the police do to see what connection there might be they have any reason to do that ben shrugged a courtesy to the family after they start making noise plus interfering with police procedures getting a report changed they really dont like that unless theyre the ones doing it but that cant be all of them can it and im supposed to be the one asking continental asked but the studio had to get a call from somebody who was there otherwise its too late the time doesnt fit ive been looking for the girlfriend whoever he must have been meeting but the girlfriend wasnt there you were the meeting was with you riordan said nothing so were back in the circle againwhat were you doing there maybe i happened to be passing by passing by who can say different well theres the call why call bunny if youre just passing by he told you this not a word loose lips sink ships your secrets safe with him i just figured but put him under oath and hes not going to keep ducking and weavinghell have other things to think about so will you the police might want to change the accident report again make it a criminal case this time what are you saying you think i killed him somebody did riordan looked at him sharply nobody else thinks so just the two of us huh riordan paused for a minute staring at him then nodded but i dont know it neither do you then you wont mind if the police give us a hand so well all know ben slid the picture back i can get more made if youd like one riordan sat forward his shoulders hunched we need to talk start you think you know something but you have things a little confused so lets put them straight first i didnt kill your brother and you dont think so either or you wouldnt be sitting here kind of a dangerous thing to say to somebody if it were true why because youd plug me here in luceys you wont always be in luceys riordan said calmly and you can save the tough guy talk i know people who really are tough what are they like you they dont talk much at all second youre not going to the cops you dont have anything to give them except a picture that doesnt mean much and you start anything theyll mess it up you dont want any mess with this they closed it out as an accident keep it that way thanks to you riordan opened his hand conceding the point you dont want anybody nosing around trust me on that i know what danny was you must too or you wouldnt have been hounding him more red meat is that why you didnt want it as a suicide theyd blame you for hounding him i wasnt hounding him then what were you doing at the cherokee were back there again he said tapping his finger on the photo i was keeping an eye jesus ben said turning his head in disgust and what did you think when you saw him there what was in your head one less red keeping an eye you want to listen to this or just get up on a soapbox i was keeping an eye because something was wrong i knew your brother we did business together and then all of a sudden he was acting funny upset and i thought which is he upsetting himself or is somebody upsetting him so i started keeping an eye friendly to see what was going on that night im sitting in the car on cherokee no idea what he was doing there a woman maybe i see him go in but i dont see anyone else so somebody who lives there then the crash people come running out i go take a look and there he is he pointed to the picture the police come right away everybodys talking in the alley hes a jumper that fairy night clerk carrying on and i get that he rents there its his place and i think this is going to be a mess so you decide to be the janitor you know what happens a suicide anything suspicious theyre going to seal the place make an investigation thats not going to do anybody good not you anyway how does it look you go after somebody and he finally runs so hard he jumps thats not the kind of press tenney needs what his files are really doing to people riordan sat back whoa he said putting up his hand in a stop gesture look youre not playing with a full deck here thats not how it was no nobody was chasing him he was working with me he was a source for a second even the sounds of luceys seemed to fall away his head stopped up with a cotton numbness what kind of source he said quietly a source he gave me names things to follow up youve got this backwards he helped make the files i dont believe that ben said suddenly chilled his blood stopped for a minute riordan shrugged that doesnt change anything he wouldnt do that i can show you reports in the files ben said nothing still digesting this then he looked down to the photo you bastard he said thats why you thought he jumped that he couldnt live with himself anymore riordan looked away embarrassed people are unpredictable especially informers they turn on everybody then themselves is that it what are you talking about informer he was a patriot jesus fucking christ a patriot what did you do to make him do it what club did you use youve got this wrong nobody made him do anything we were all on the same side in this he was a communist in germany was he saw what it meant right here he held his hand close to his face you see it that clear you want to do something like shop people to you riordan took a breath sometimes you stop believing in something you go the other way you hate it and hate yourself no not like that then why did you think hed jumped riordan looked away again people get ideas you never know how theyre going to he stopped leaning forward but thats why it didnt make sense to me the way i knew him so i thought what if it wasnt just the way you did i thought what if he had help someone who knew wanted him stopped communists you mean at it again is that the way you think party discipline works throw people out of windows you should go to work for minot riordan looked at him i do you work for minot its not a secret ben studied him again as if he were moving pieces of his face seeing him new rearranged and thats why bunny made the call he said half to himself not for you ken doesnt forget a favor and nobody would know danny was feeding you minots own bureau just one of the field agents riordan said smoothly tenney recommended me after all your good work there you want to be a wiseass go ahead i dont care your brother knew what was what maybe you will too someday everybody will minots going to take this national take what national the threat in the industry he held out his hand stopping a passing waitress you want another ben looked at his beer scarcely touched then sat back staring at the picture riordan waited letting him catch his breath youre surprised why would he do it why wouldnt he its the right thing to do ben looked up at him to fight the threat which one betty grable taking over the government you think its a joke its not this is a war of ideas whats the last idea you saw in the movies riordan said nothing not wanting to quarrel how long was all this ben said how long did you know him couple of years since the bureau he was a friend to the bureau what kind of friend we asked for some help he gave it you asked for help what go through herb yatess mail we dont need people for that we know what people say what they write to each other what we need to know is what they think your brother had special access to whom ben said chilled again apprehensive he did us a service but i think he did them a service too wartime the bureau has to keep an eye on enemy aliens its our job but you dont want to make people uncomfortable not if theyre what they say they are he spied on his friends ben said suddenly seeing the exile faces at the funeral heinrich and alma and feuchtwanger hans and liesl family i wouldnt use that term he reassured us thats closer that they were all right well brecht i still wouldnt trust as far as i could throw but we got nothing yet so we cant touch him eisler we already knew and the mann kids a fruit thats always a risk the others harmless more or less but we had to know that so like i say he did everybody a service the bureau spied on them these people risked their lives fighting nazis so they say that doesnt necessarily mean theyre good for america they have a different idea of politics over there you ask me to tell you the difference between a nazi and a communist and what would i say this much he held up two fingers a tiny space apart at the bureau we call them communazistheyre both on the same side so why not put them together we needed to keep tabs your brother saw it how the reds tried to use themsmall stuff innocent put your name on a letter then maybe not so innocent he was worried about them being used we knew how he felt how you tap his phone riordan ignored this so we asked him to help you know the bureau its hard to say no wartime its a patriotic duty and then you kept asking he saw how it was going in the industry so he gave me a hand real pals ben looked again at the alley picture but you couldnt even go over to the body see if you could help just stood there thinking how to cover your ass he was dead i thought he was dead hows that feel having someones blood on your hands riordan glanced up at the returning waitress but she seemed not to have overheard smiling as she put down his glass and moved on he took a sip of his beer how do you figure that first you think he jumped because he got disgusted with himself for what the work he was doing for you thats what you thought isnt it riordan said nothing but what if somebody killed him who would that be whod hate him that much how about somebody he sold out to you he picked up the photo both of them glancing at it again back in the alley then slid it into the envelope either way it comes back to you he said his voice lower drained behind him he heard the tinkle of glasses then a roll of thunder he turned to the window even darker now and suddenly thought of the window on the chief looking out at the endless bright fields everything getting bigger and more open golden the way he imagined dannys life had become not shadowy and squalid i dont see it that way riordan said he did what he thought was right i didnt kill him but somebody did youre his brother if youd stop spitting at me for two minutes maybe we could help each other out ben stared for a second hearing the voice steady and reasonable then separating it from the words what he might have said to danny help each other out while he wrapped the coil around him ben stood up its still on them he said nodding to riordans hands he reached into his pocket to pull out some money then stopped ill let you get this one he didnt turn until he was at the door seeing riordan drop some change on the table outside it had finally begun to rain heavy sheets of it so that he was trapped under the small awning the mediterranean hills had disappeared even the paramount water tower leaving a few flat streets with running gutters and a tangle of overhead wires christ riordan said coming out wheres your car i walked riordan looked at him puzzled a joke he didnt quite get im there he said pointing to a car come on ill drop you ill wait it out riordan gave him a suityourself shrug then turned up the back of his collar ready to dart to the car by the way he said youre going in circles again you think its somebody he gave me if hed already done that itd be too late wouldnt it no point then right he dashed out into the rain fumbling with his keys and got into his car the rain was blowing in under the awning in a real city thered be taxis or a bus rumbling along ben watched riordans car move into the street circles no point then right riordan pulled up in front and rolled down his window dont be a jerk get in ben looked at the rain again feeling the bottom of his pants already wet and sprinted to the passenger door youve got a short fuse riordan said pulling out into traffic ben brushed the front of his jacket damp in patches i liked him you know whatever you think yeah ben said he took out a cigarette and lit it they were passing rko only a few blocks the windshield wipers keeping rhythm everybody did even as a kid friends clung to him following him home jokes about the teachers plans for later but what had he felt about them nothing can lie like a smile kaltenbach spoke of him as a hero but danny must have filed reports on him too long talks with liesls fathertaken down later bedtime reading for riordan who must have supplied the lever maybe not blackmail a plot out of partners just a soft pressure point and then he was in it but at least part of him must have wanted to be sometimes you stop believing you go the other way but when had it happened had he enjoyed it even justified it to himselfkeeping the wolf away from innocent people but not from everybody how did it feel giving riordan a name ill tell you one thing riordan was saying its a funny thing to say but im glad its this way that he didnt do it to himself id hate to think that just as long as everybody else does riordan was quiet for a minute youve got some mouth on you thats not even fair i got it changed ben rolled down the window and tossed the cigarette the quick storm had slowed to a light drizzle just up here he said at the continental gate they idled behind a white convertible with a canvas top its tail lights bathing the trunk in neon red even the cars were different here bright pieces of color not gray jeeps and flatbed convoys like waking up in oz maybe it had been that simple not some blinding light on the road to damascus maybe danny had just seen a red convertible an aqua swimming pool and decided to leave the old world behind why bunny ben said suddenly why ask bunny doesnt minot know anybody downtown picture people call comes from the studio they figure the usual a dame maybe high on weed something a congressman calls they wonder people talk and word gets out he looked at ben howd you hear by the way ben said nothing turning back to the gate right riordan said slowly doing a sum in his head your pal at the market little jimmy olsen did bunny know why riordan shook his head just a favor so dannys a drunk another studio mess but not a snitch snitch he was your brother what do you want to beat him up like that for i beat him up ben said looking over at riordan youre doing it now what he did youre right ben said tired of it maybe you didnt either maybe he beat himself up he didnt do anything to himself thats the point somebody else did so who check your files you didnt listen before if i know its too late somebody wanted to stop him its somebody he hadnt told me about yet ben watched the tail lights pass through we could help each other out riordan said ben turned to him meeting his eyes thats what you were looking for in his desk he said finally another name its the same one you want isnt it he walked through the gate and heard music people singing around a piano the door of sound stage was open light pouring out onto the wet pavement to one side holding an umbrella bunny stood watching his figure oddly poignant like one of the waifs he used to play nose pressed against the glass he was in a belted raincoat dressed to gowhere ben had never imagined him off the lot but he must have a life somewhere maybe a house on the beach a bungalow in one of the canyons where he took phone calls at night doing favors something he must have done a dozen times just putting things right a call the police understood coming from himstudio business another embarrassment to keep out of the papers not asking riordan why just holding the favor in his hand like an iou not talking about it either certainly not to the unexpected brother who kept poking at it ben stopped according to riordan it was still a call to the police not something bunny would do without knowing why what had riordan said to him or didnt he have to say anything its stopped raining ben said coming up to him he looked at ben distracted then up at the dark sky and closed the umbrella so it has youre not going in on the nightclub set everything was still in place but the gowns had been traded in for ordinary skirts the men back in casual trousers and vneck sweaters even the cocktail glasses replaced by bottles of beer platters of food had been set up along the bar no you dont want to barge in on a wrap party breaks the mood the piano player shifted to a new song the small knot of singers laughing as they picked it up no fun with the boss around bunny shook his head ever work on a picture he said smiling a little his voice distant for six weeks eight weeks whatever the shoot isthe minute this door closes everything else goes away everything theres just the crew what youre doing that day getting the take right thats all like family closer then its over he nodded to the set where rosemary was being lifted onto the bar next to the piano and you pretend youre relieved butnow what you dont want outsiders not at the end well he said catching himself listen to me you must miss it well of course you miss it its the whole point all the rest of it he waved his hand remember castaway my first picture a hundred years ago we opened at the pantages my first time id never seen anything like it beforethe flashbulbs people yelling your name i was on the radio and i thought well this is all right this is it but it wasnt this was it he said looking at the set you can get things right perfect sometimes a perfect take you can never get things right out here he looked down at his watch still here we are and im late im late he said doing the white rabbit no rushes tonight not tonight he said closing down moving back into the life ben knew nothing about as secret as dannys ben looked over at him the one riordan had called youre all wet by the way bunny said starting to move better get dried off i got caught i was having a drink at luceys with a friend of yours bunny stopped dennis riordan bunny turned trying to read his face what a busy little bee it is buzz buzz he said slowly and what did he have to say not much he knew my brother oh yes his nickel or yours his a condolence call bunny took a second fiddling with the umbrella you want to have a care there you know who he is ben nodded one of minots field hands dont worry i told him you said the pledge of allegiance every morning thats not funny what did he ask you about you you didnt come up then why did you say he was a friend of mine ben shrugged i figured youd know everybody on minots staff not everybody we just talked about danny was this after your chat with rosemary not making a point just letting him know quite a day for old times ben hesitated why didnt you tell me why the big mystery you knew what i was looking for tell you what bunny said then looked away switching gears it wasnt mine to tell yours either you said you didnt know him i said id never met him i knew who he was hard not to considering so it must have been a relief bunny peered at him are you trying to get me to say something unpleasant why im sorry for your loss all right lets leave it at that all i wanted was to talk to her i knew thered been someone and do you feel better now any more skeletons in the closet or are we ready to move on i dont know are there but bunny didnt rise to this usually people are disappointing once you get to know them i find youd do better remembering the good times i assume there were a few well hold on to those he said archly patting bens upper arm he glanced through the door now lets let her have her party in peace anyway im late he began to move away again whyd you make the call bunny was quiet for a second les freres kohler he said finally rhyming one was trouble now two you didnt answer all right what call the one you made to the police again youre like a record with a skip back and back the one riordan asked you to make why you did he tell you what now that youre chums why dont you ask him he said an end move he let out a breath with an audible weariness look were stuck with each other for a while mr l insists lets make the best of it he nodded toward the sound stage for a start well keep rosemary to ourselves shall we whats done is done no need to upset anyone theres the grieving widow to consider is that why the screen test something for the wronged party dont be ridiculous bunny said genuinely put out screen tests arent favors not mine you think were all sam pilcer he looked up feeling the drizzle begin again cooling his mood i think she has something besides an accent so did bergman when she started you can work with an accent if theres something there he looked again at the sound stage whatever it is some quality and you think she has that havent the faintest she moves well thats what i noticed but you cant know anything until you see film its not what you see its what the camera sees what quality it brings out you have to have that what was yours ben said bunny looked at him then smiled amused innocence i think after bunny left ben stood for a while watching the party invisible in the dark outside there was a cake somebodys birthday with candles to blow then whoops and applause he wondered if bunny had had a cake on his set eleven candles surrounded by beaming grips and the family closer than family years like that closing the world out with a door until he was outside too he darted back to admin b then sat at his desk looking at the photos in the manila envelope riordan peering over someones shoulder maybe already planning how to clean up not a stranger to it youd see things at the bureau maybe another informer tired of it except danny had stayed with riordan not yet tired wanting towhat protect the country from whom what names had he actually given it was possible wasnt it that hed just told them things they already knew some nimble card shuffle to protect his own flanks and bank a favor or two but there he was lying facedown in the alley evidently not harmless the same boy whod been in the bed across the room talking late into the night ben looked at the pictures again feeling a heaviness in his chest an informer and what about the boy in the other bed no longer all ears the eager audience now hed seen things himself stacks of bodies a shocked face watching blood gush out not a boy anymore either someone who knew the camp guards might be anybody might be us and where did we go from there now that we were capable of anything theyd both done things theyd never imagined theyd do who was he to blame danny making love now to his wife maybe he would have helped riordan too done the same thing under the circumstanceswhich were what exactly he shoved the pictures back in the envelope and put them in the drawer who knows what dannys reasons had been some twisted apostasy the point was hed ended up in the alley nothing he could have told riordan deserved that a career jeopardized a reputation not a real war with real casualties you didnt kill people yet for namecalling hal had asked him to stop by the cutting room on his way out a quick checkin he assumed but some of the enlarged clips had come back from the lab so a few minutes became an hour then two by the time he headed out to his car he was already late for the roast chicken the sort of absentmindedness they wrote into the blondie series cut to a scolding or an exasperated sigh at the door he opened the car door what were they doing its too soon shed said but done it anyway gasping if he thought about it things flooded in all the awkward questions but if you didnt think about it it was simple againthe feel of skin he wanted her because he wanted her and she clutched him when she came him not someone else no need to go deeper than skin you could feel alive in it thank god an outofbreath lasner upset his eyes slightly frantic where the hells bunny he went off the lot where theres nobody home i tried what does he have a date for chrissake henry took fay to her cards so now what call a cab whats wrong your car lasner said eyeing it you mind i appreciate it you need a lift hurry lasner said opening the passenger door come to think of it you can talk to her if she can talk they didnt say who ben said getting in the cops called theres a crash the buick lorna said genia took it out i didnt even know she could drive ben started the car and backed it out where go out sunset the palisades so who does she know out there she doesnt know anybody whats she doing there at the gate lasner leaned over ben to talk to the guard carl henry comes tell him i got a lift home will you sure thing mr lasner he said saluting a dick marshallarmy gesture he takes fay to the cards lasner said to ben and then she likes him to stay im here late anyway so what the hell then something like this happens they went up gower and made a left on sunset they got the name off the registration lucky fays not home you imagine she gets the call so lorna says call here now the cars a wreck i guess not that you mind the car i mean family i dont know you try to do something nice for somebody and she just sits there then it rains she takes the car out a night like this maybe she was going to see somebody who does she know they had passed through hollywood then the long featureless stretch before fairfax slowing now as they came to the heavier traffic on the strip bright from the neon signs over the clubs who knew she could drive who has cars over there look at this he said indicating the slick street she goes tonight roads like this what about the other car they didnt say maybe she went into a tree i dont know just come its serious lasner was quiet for a minute its a hell of a thing isnt it you get through all that business survive hitler and then you come here andbam they didnt say she was dead did they no just there was an accident but they dont on the phone do they christ imagine how fays going to feel lets wait till we get there lasner fidgeted as they snaked around miles of houses when they climbed into the palisades he pulled a note out of his pocket paseo miramar on the north side they said after palisades drive into topanga i know it what do you mean you know it you just got here feuchtwanger lives there a friend of liesls father i had to drop him off there a mediterranean villa spilling three stories down the cliff and thats where she goes for a drive christ look at it they had started up the narrow twisting road slowing on the sharp curves and they put houses here for the views thats the ocean he nodded to the string of highway lights in the distance the dark sea beyond they passed feuchtwangers house dark except for a single light in the study not expecting visitors but why even suppose they knew each other a convenient turnoff up into the hills maybe even picked at random he imagined her at the wheel deliberate her eyes still blank the light left somewhere in poland she comes up here you know what im thinking lasner said a kind of echo its a hell of a thing to do that he looked over at ben suddenly embarrassed well i dont have to tell you no at the top there was another turn then a swarm of lights at the end of a stretch just before the road looped back ben saw an ambulance and a cluster of police cars lights trained on a splintered section of a wooden barrier fence at the edge of the cliff one of the policemen was holding back a group of curious neighbors the same extras ben thought whod appeared in the cherokee alley a flashbulb went off maybe even the same police photographer now a few more shots catching the group of ambulance workers carrying a litter up the side of the hill and onto the road i made the call the policeman in charge said sorry to bring you out but we need an id on her its your car another cop drew back the sheet lasner looked down at the body his face growing slack then turned away squeamish a friend cousin lasner said almost inaudible youre next of kin my wife close enough youll need to see the me over there make the id im sorry but we need to do it what happened ben said staring at her face torn by shards of glass where she must have hit the windshield her hair matted with blood her eyes were closed but her mouth was open as if it were still saying oh she went through there the cop said pointing to the broken fence into the canyon the car didnt catch fire so thats one thing but a drop like that be a miracle you survive it you just get knocked to hell he looked up at lasner sorry ben looked at the length of road almost straight after the hairpins coming up what do you think he said she swerved to avoid another car the cop shook his head no sign of that no skid marks either side course the rain didnt help there but you get a slippery patch here you take it a little fast he raised his hand letting them fill in the rest we had a hell of a time getting her out the door stuck but the curve wasnt sharp a gradual arc that anyone should have handled easilyunless you hadnt driven a car in years or never intended to turn he looked down at the body again trying to imagine the last minute through the fence and then suspended in nothing waiting for it to be over something no one else ever knows the desperation for release but what prompts it ben wondered an awkward second whether he had been part of it the unexpected reminder ghosts coming back reuben its you he turned to find feuchtwanger a raincoat over his jacket and tie the slickedback hair and wireless glasses formally in place herr feuchtwanger such a commotion we saw the lights he looked over at genias body clearly not recognizing her poor woman oh these roads marta says its no worse than the corniche but me i think a death trap he paused but what are you doing here shes a cousin ben said indicating lasner huddled now with the me im sorry he said would you like to come back to the house some coffee a ritual courtesy no no thank you we have to he spread his hand to the accident scene policemen still moving idly around stay with the body sign things he looked down at her she survived the camps he said perhaps a memory trigger but feuchtwanger still didnt know her the sorrow on his face was impersonal another victim the camps but not this road he said shaking his head well what am i doing here they say in english a rubberneckits amusing a rubberneck so he looked toward the group of neighbors still gawking marta wanted to knowall the lights if you need to telephone please come to the house ben nodded a thankyou and coffee one day tell liesl to bring you well talk she looked well so strong i thought it would kill her toothe way she felt about him but no strong the fathers daughter he looked down at the stretcher but so much death ben stood in the road watching him walk away the way she felt about him but lion was a romantic his books filled with duchesses and men in wigs and undying love he didnt know she could lean her head into your shoulder soft not strong at all everybody saw what he wanted to see lasner was almost finished with the police once the id had been made there was little either of them could do except arrange for the car to be towed he looked again at the road no skid marks the policeman had said but you didnt need to slam on the brakes to have an accident here another car with its lights in your eyes the inky darkness of the canyon beyond making the guard rail hard to see the slide effect of wet pavement there were lots of ways it could have happened all of them easy to believe unless you had sat with her at dinner and seen her eyes still why this road the next turnoff would have taken her up over the coast highway itself a more dramatic plunge off the cliff into the traffic a spectacular end but the etiquette of suicide could be peculiar oddly discreet maybe she hadnt wanted to make a point just go quietly no trouble to anyone who found her ben said suddenly to the cop they had pulled the sheet back over her face i mean anybody see it happen stop no some kids see the shoulder over there its a view point daytime anyway sometimes they park thereits away from the houses nights you dont get many cars so itsanyway theyre there going at it and when they leave they spot the fence they take a look and theres the car her in it so they call it in this was when hour ago maybe couldnt have been too long after she went over no rigor tire marks still fresh must have been a quickie he caught bens look the kids i mean nobody heard the crash nobody said pretty quiet up here shed have the place to herself till morning anyway then you get the dog walkers hours later not an instant attraction on the highway its just lucky it didnt burn a few weeks ago all youd need is one spark and woof but she would burn now finally the ashes the germans had wanted unless sol decided to have her buried he looked over to where lasner was standing a little lost he was avoiding the stretcher still shaken but sol had scarcely known her it occurred to ben that their talk at dinner may have been the only real connection shed made in california that he had known her better than anyone not buried shed want to go up in smoke erasing herself another car had pulled up with a noisy greeting to the police photographer kelly ben not yet seen went quickly over to lasner get in the car he said what now dont let him see you the guy over therehes press if he thinks theres a studio connection hell do a story you dont need that youre looking after me now he said i know him ill take care of it just dont let him see you hell recognize you not her another bunny lasner said but moved to the car his face turned away kelly was already at the stretcher with the cop hey kelly ben said chasing ambulances hey kelly said surprised to see him its a living he nodded to the stretcher more trouble in the family just visiting down the street we heard the sirens visiting kelly said taking in the neighborhood an open question if you need to call you could use their phone kelly turned back to the cop who is it anybody the cop passed over a clipboard here he said i cant even pronounce it copy it if you want polish or something slid in the rain and went through the fence ben looked nervously at the form on the clipboard theyd have the summit drive address a crestview phone exchange easy for kelly to spot but kelly didnt bother to look polish he said a code for no story anybody else hurt if so they took off just her he lifted the sheet off her face christ she did a job on herself didnt she whats with the head in the back you get banged up there youre the driver the cop nodded to the cars take one and find out ill give you a push im just saying a wound like that its consistent with a crash kelly for chrissake anythings consistent with a crash you know that yeah its always got to be something he said taking the clipboard away its not enough shes dead shes got to be somebody dead ben waited for him to mention lasner but evidently the name hadnt meant anything to him if it was lana turner id be on the phone to you if it was lana youd be fucking the corpse i wouldnt put it past you nice and all those years in school you going to write this up or what a polack goes in the ditch my pulitzer he turned back to ben funny seeing you here friend lives down there ben said cocking his head toward the houses another refugee some refugee you know what these go for i guess he got his money out ben moved slightly to the left blocking kellys view of his car i was going to call you yes ben said alarmed now what a new scent maybe not just some gossip this time now there were worse secrets the kind that could spread like a stain touching other people things he wouldnt want kelly to overhear at luceys get anywhere with the loanouts ben shook his head i thought you were giving up on it yeah said kelly too bad though you hate to leave it theres a studio angle sometimes its like this with a story it goes and then it comes back never close a door he held up a finger and smiled you know where i got that partners in crime remember how frank always said that ottos pet phrase after he started working for goebbels which one were you kelly said the younger one neither its a movie kelly nodded unconvinced well you hear anything you know where to reach me youre the first call he put the car in a uturn away from the accident and started back down the hill what was that all about hes going to write this up lasner said the only story was she was related to you so theres no story you forgot to mention it huh mrs lasner doesnt need to see this in the papers i know what its like lasner looked over at him youre a piece of work youre here what five minutes and already you know guys on the paper not to mention the goddam palisades they were passing feuchtwangers house dark now thanks for this lasner said serious he was quiet for a minute as they turned onto sunset heading back its a hell of a life when you think about it hiding like an animal the camp now this to do something like this there was nothing you could have done ben said quietly i dont know what she went through it breaks something you cant fix it not just like that what did she say to you at dinner she talk about it no ben said avoiding it she was sad sol nothing was going to change that you give her all this lasner said glancing out the window brooding you know the best thing that ever happened to me getting the hell out everybody should have got out even now you want to kiss the ground here what kind of life could you have there this country he broke off as if the thought had overwhelmed him ben followed his gaze out the side window trying to see what he was seeing the big sleepy houses and palms and hedges of paradise she asks tell fay it was an accident but he didnt have to say anything when they pulled into the driveway fay came running out of the house and ben could tell from her face that calls had been made and nothing needed to be explained behind her like a shadow bunny stood in the doorway evidently summoned to wait with her she hugged lasner then put her hands on his chest smoothing his jacket a hovering gesture are you all right she said did you eat anything she said her hands still on his jacket come on ill get you something im not hungry and then youre weak it puts a strain she patted his chest come on it was bad lasner said nothing moving one of his shoulders her face too no she shook her head a little relieved you know she was beautiful before everything started you cant see it now but she was she took his arm to lead him into the house bunny stepped aside and where the hell were you lasner said not really angry out out even the maid gets a night off ill make the arrangements tomorrow fay said cremation lasner nodded what shapes the car in scrap probably he pulled a receipt out of his pocket heres where they tow it anybody there from the papers you want me to ben took care of it lasner said giving him a thankyou wave bunny hesitated for a moment ah see you tomorrow then you want an obit who would read it who did she know its a question of respect fay said then to bunny ill get you the dates she was in a few pictures over there you think theyd be interested in those they always cut something bunny said evasive but well see he watched them go in then came over to ben german silents from the twenties just what the papers want he looked at ben whod you talk to kelly from the examiner dont worry they already had this one as an accident you dont have to make any calls bunny held his stare not answering then said hows mr l doing hes all right its more the idea of it he scarcely knew her neither of them i dont think she said ten words except to you ben glanced up at the big picture window where shed looked out over what had been bean fields she knew my father it took her back he drove to the hollywood hills his head filled with the grainy clips in hals cutting room why did some survive and some break but maybe it was only a matter of degree nobody was the same after only the mindless or the callous could pretend nothing had happened the others would feel the weight of it pressing on them until they accepted it part of the air or it got worse and they drove away from it still why the car maybe because it was the one way it wouldnt have happened therenot gas or starvation what they used your own choice liesl was on the couch smoking her legs drawn up under her a script in her lap when he walked in she drew on the cigarette deliberately not saying anything im sorry i couldnt call i play a daughter she said picking up the script so its good for me something i know not asking where hed been he went over to the tray on the side table and poured a drink she takes care of him but now she has to go away so i can just think of my father what that would be like you didnt wait i hope no daniel would do it sometimesnot come so i know dont wait she put out the cigarette of course i thought he was working thats all i thought then there was an accident i had to take lasner remember the cousin at dinner what happened car crash near lions in fact i saw him when they pulled her out you mean shes dead ben nodded she went into the canyon probably killed when she hit that kind of drop oh she said a sound standing in for everything else theyre listing it as an accident she raised her eyebrows no other car she drove herself off oh she said again taking this in she did that it happens with the survivors its hard to come back and here i am thinking about youre not surprised at this no neither was lasner its terrible for them to be the ones left it doesnt end she said her voice private interior he looked over at her he didnt do that to you thats not what happened it feels the same you cant put it away somewhere its in your head tonight i sat here i thought its just like before so foolisha roast chicken something as foolish as that waiting just like before and i thought its happening again im waiting again he went over to the couch reaching out to put a hand on her shoulder but she shrank from it moving away no dont she stood up and moved toward the french windows clutching the sides of her arms guarded we cant do this what happenedall right it happened but to keep she turned you know what i was thinking about tonight maybe im still angry thats why like a child hitting back you can i can too something like that i dont know its not like that not for you i dont know what it is for you maybe something of his something crazy like that why does it have to be anything because hes still in my head how can you want me like that i dont care oh and that makes it all right she shook her head then moved toward the kitchen a distraction are you hungry no i want to talk about this theres nothing to say we have to stop before something happens like what we went to bed i dont know why maybe just to do it you enjoyed it yes all right do you want to hear that i enjoyed it but now its not so easy ben was quiet for a second taking another sip of his drink waiting for her a look to get them over it do you want me to leave leave where would you go the cherokee i still have the key ha to take women there then you can really be him its what you wanted not anymore no why not hes not who i thought he was she looked at him disconcerted then turned back to the window not wanting to pursue it you cant go to that place itswhats schaurig ghoulish creepy ghoulish she fingered the handle on the window testing it anyway im afraid here now the man never came about the locks i know you dont have to worry turns out it was him or someone he sent what he wanted to look through dannys desk like a thief why they used to work together he wanted some information danny didnt get to pass on he said his voice taut i dont understand worked how you dont want to know know what you can stop waiting for him he said cocking his head toward the couch he wasnt who you thought he was either whats wrong she said her hands fluttery nervous whats happened i had a drink a real eyeopener with dennis riordan mean anything to you she shook her head exfbi they worked together danny was keeping an eye on all of you for the bureau he gulped down the rest of the drink angry at the sound of his own voice all of who the germans all of you your father i suppose i dont have the exact list id like to get it see how far he went what do you think he told them about alma talk about suspicious characters he looked up at her you really had no idea what that people watched us of course all during the war my father always said we had to be careful on the phone they listened you had to expect that but not from your husband but who better he was practically a refugee himself hed know everyone in the german communityhe married into it be the most natural thing in the world for him to know what everyone was up to just not so natural telling the fbi about it i dont believe you its a lie riordan told me himself why would he lie what for why would i a man who breaks into the houseyou believe him they got together again later after the bureau riordan catches reds for minot and danny helped him with that too a name here and therei dont know how many but enough to keep riordan interested partners in crime its not true but he thinks there must be one more name somebody danny didnt get to tell him about whoever killed him so he had the desk searched a little clumsy but he wanted to know he sends apologies if it frightened you no you she said suddenly white her face drained you frighten me me youll say anything now to make me hate him any lie daniel wouldnt do that yes he would he just wouldnt tell you about it like a lot of things she glared at him that makes it easier for you if he was like that then it doesnt matter what we do she went over to him putting her fists on his chest stop it you think id make all this up to go to bed with you i didnt have to remember i didnt have to force you either he took her hands holding them close enough to feel her breathing until she pulled them away she looked at him then slumped onto the couch halfsitting on the back no you didnt she said quietly so its another thing ive done in my life he touched the side of her face tentative waiting for her to turn away but she leaned into it letting him work down to her neck ill never force you to do anything he said no she said staring at the carpet no no she said wearily that wouldnt beseemly she looked up at him the good brother but not always he took his hand away she said nothing then got up and went over to the window again pacing and the bad one who was supposed to do all these thingswho was that i didnt know anybody like that riordan saw the reports your friend for the moment he wants to know who killed danny too his own reasons but so what he can help hes expedient she said a test answer a chance a lead it was better when it was rosemary she said picking nervously now at her fingers one push you could believe it she paused what did he say about my father i dont know yet yet i dont know what he said about anybody but we need to now he said including her still together we need to know what he gave them see who might have been next oh and theyll tell you how are you going to do that i thought the way he did she looked over at him work with them be like danny the one we didnt know posse minot had suggested chasens for lunch and dave chasen himself took them to the table one of the front booths reserved for regulars and recognizable faces greer garson near the door seemed not to know who minot was but most of the others parading past the table did and the lunch was interrupted by a series of hellos and handshakes a surprisingly public place for such a meeting but what had he expected raincoats in an alley a murky room drapes drawn in real life you talked at chasens hoping for a mention in the columns the chili here is great minot said ordering it some people never have anything else best in la riordan said a chorus you notice how good dave is smooth youre in hes gone he lets you get on with it romanoff hes all over you you cant get rid of him the russian prince harry gerguson brooklyn he had leaned his football shoulders forward confiding thats the real name he shook his head theres a lot of that element here what element is that ben said on guard as if someone had just stamped a j in his passport phonies i like to know who people are you picked the wrong town then ben said easier half the people in hollywood have changed names well in the industry sure thats just part of the territory isnt it but a waiter pretending to be a waiter riordan said amused anyway i didnt pick this town you know i was born here native californian one of the few ive seen it change a small town in those dayswell small comparedthen the phonies and smart guys start coming in spoilers a couple of years ago it was still just oranges here like a garden of eden now you have to be careful you dont step on the snakes he smiled pleased at the turn of phrase something he could use again a big citys bound to have crime not crime police can handle that but what do we do with the others they want to spoil what weve got here where were going and i still dont know why some idea have you been down to long beach you see whats happened there since the war we can have the biggest port in america big as new york and ill be goddamned if were going to let somebody like harry bridges close it down san francisco all hes got to do is snap his fingers and nothing moves we dont want that here mans not even a citizen and he can push a whole city around hes not a citizen australian a break for us you cant bust a union but you can sure as hell deport troublemakers cheryl dear he rose to greet a grayhaired woman in a feathery hat and fur stole hows george the flowers meant so much to him ken thank you never mind about that you just get him home you get the best at cedars but its still not home he patted her hand at least they keep him in bed you know what hes like hell be a bear youll have a nurse he says he wants laraine day so i guess hes getting better she said almost winking well enjoy your lunch ill tell him you asked a massive heart attack minot said after shed gone richfield petroleum not everyone heres in the movies just the ones everybody knows about he took a drink from his water glass that makes them special people are interested in the movies you can get their attention ben said nothing waiting for him dennis here tells me we might have some mutual interests ben nodded i like the sound of that thats how i like to work what governments all about mutual interests i dont believe in isms any of them just getting things done but youve got people out there they have a different idea not to your face a fair fight they know theyd lose they get underneath hide thats the way they work we need to know who they are get them out into the open congressman ben said stopping him a communist killed my brother theyre not my favorite people either ken minot said automatically and now they want this country unable to let it go your brother did us a great service dennis says we can count on you too i want to find out who did it he nodded to riordan we think its somebody he was going to give you so i figure we both want to know like i said minot smiled a mutual interest i have to say when dennis told me about this i waswell relieved isnt the right word its a tragedy what happened however it happened a mans dead but you hate to think people you work with might beunreliable a lot of what we get is hearsay youd be surprised how much time we have to spend just making sure informations worth something now with your brother we never had that if he told us to take a look at somebody wed find it all right he didnt shoot from the hip he got it right so you learn to trust that then this happens and you have to wonder youre going to have people saying your sources are unstable and that makes it all suspect theyd like people to think that its one of their tactics so it was better as an accident ben said interrupting the flow thats right minot said hesitating not sure what ben knew but this this is a whole new game if its true we could make some real noise most of the time its hard to get people excited they think its just about union business organizing the coloreds politics but a trial thats something else a red kills somebody working for the bureau everybodys going to jump on that if its true well i mean you have to prove it otherwise its still just a man fell dennis here says its not going to be easy police never took it up so were not long on evidence we can get some help from the bureau on the quiet but even they cant make a miracle far as i can see the best chance we have is you me youre in his house you know everybody he knows and it has to be somebody he knows you dont name strangers ive already looked through his things if he was keeping notes something like that he wasnt keeping them there but sometimes one name leads to another so it would be useful to see the files what files would those be minot said wary what he gave you look let me explain how this works your brother never gave us any paper he liked to play things close to the vest he didnt want anything traced back to him limits you once thats out people dont confide in you no hed just give dennis a name a little information if he had it and then it was up to us like i said they were the right names once we knew where to look you said there were reports ben said to riordan with the bureau you talk and somebody types it up thats how it worked with us hed talk to me and id memo the file you dont have to see themjust ask me who did he talk about can you give me a list how this started the bureau wanted to know what ostermann was up to you thought he was a communist we didnt know what he was all we knew was when he spoke wrote an article or somethingpeople listened theres a war on its important to know what somebody like that is going to say and your brotherwell who was in a better position to know so he agreed to report on him ben said hoping to be contradicted tell you the truth it kind of surprised me too i mean what if the wife found out how would she feel but i think maybe he thought he could do him some good he liked ostermann he said we never had to worry about him and you know we didnt no funny business there at all wants to be a citizen now maybe you should write him a character reference ben said more sourly than hed intended dont get touchy you got an important german figure and were at war with germany of course the bureau has to be interested nobody ever interfered with him he went right on making those speeches all that i doubt he ever knew so thats how it started ben said leading him who else we asked about brecht no surprises therewe already knew but that was a kind of test see if your brother was pulling his punches and he wasnt the important thing see was whether somebody was actually in the party or just had lefty sympathies like feuchtwanger your brotherd been inside so he knew the difference people approached him tried to recruit him back in how at lunch ben said opening his hand to chasens minot peered at him we dont recruit people come to us like you not to inform on my family informing riordan said waving this off nobodys informing he didnt see it that way minot said calmly it waspart of the war effort and now its a different war i just want to be clear not ostermann notfamily i wont do that nobody gives a rats ass what ostermann says now riordan said a little exasperated as long as its proamerican but he is proamerican minot said patiently and feuchtwanger writeswhat do you call them like anthony adverse kaltenbach cant get work at the studios so hes flirting with the east germans but hes not going anywhere hes not i think hed find it hard to leave the country were not going to give him a passport so he can be some propaganda stunt the point is nobodys asking about the germans thats how it started with your brother but thats not what he did for me im not interested in that what are you interested in minot leaned back against the booth playing with his fork im interested in getting peoples attention this country is under attack and it doesnt even know it how do you get them to see it and here we are sitting in a district with the most popular thing on earth you want something to make people sit up and notice nothing even comes close to the industry theyve already got peoples attention if we show whats happening here in the industry you mean in the unions minot smiled well the unions nobody would be very surprised at that would they howard stein hes practically got a party number on his back he looked up your brother was helpful about that information we can use when the time comes i thought everybody already knew ben said his stomach turning over at least they assume and he can deny it but not under oath then youre looking at perjury hes going on trial minot made another half smile no the industry is ben looked at the broad handsome face remembering his hand on jack warners shoulder bunny eager to please everyone taking up positions in the chess game of the consent decree minot leaned forward i assume all this is in confidence ben nodded fascinated a different game board hollywood has done a lot for this city minot said nobody knows better than i do i even know the figures which is more than you can say for most of them and the figures are big since the war he trailed off letting the obvious finish itself so now its like a rich widoweveryone wants something out of her the unions want their piece the east coast bankers lets not even think about the payoffs lets just pretend they dont happen but the commies want something else they want to use her to get ideas across he caught bens skeptical expression they dont have to be blatant nobodys making battleship potemkin here good thing he said flashing a smile who the hell would go see it nothing that obvious you dont attack america you just chip away at it some doubt here suspicion but how do you stop them first you have to find them he nodded somehow including ben with danny then you get them to lie actually show them lying not even their fans are going to trust them after that you know you cant put someone away just for being a commie conspiracy to overthrow you spend years making a case like that but perjurys quick and its right there theyre lying or theyre not he paused as long as you have evidence so you get some you ask about files tenneys got files and jack can be a little hasty so god knows what hes got in them but we have to be more careful were not just some committee in sacramento were a congressional committee subpoena power you lie at the hearing you just bought a ticket inside and if they do come across riordan said you still have a shot at contempt ben raised his eyebrow waiting nobodys a red alone riordan said but theyre usually reluctant to say who their friends are even under oath so either way ben said assuming weve got the goods on them in the first place and thats what danny was doing for you giving you movie stars for show trials no were a little shy in the star department minot said with a stage modesty not catching the moscow reference something that had happened far away but any kind of friendly witness here can be somethingyou still get the press theres lots of ways you can use information your brother wasnt going to testify anything like that i told you he liked to play things close to the vest of course if id really had to i could have subpoenaed him but why would i do that he played fair with me he gave me background and you can use background in different ways sometimes like i say to set up a perjury charge but sometimes to get people to cooperate lead you somewhere else give you other names that or help in other ways be a friend to the committee you know we dont want to hurt the industry we want to help it protect itself his voice earnest without a trace of irony was it possible he really believed this saw himself as a savior not just another of the rich widows cynical suitors borrowing her limelight so are you going to be a friend to the committee he said casually bringing his hands together fingers touching putting a question but when he looked at ben not smiling his whole body seemed to tense expectant as if he were waiting for the snap of the ball and ben saw that the rest of the lunch didnt matter just this moment he sat fixed by minots gaze in a kind of quiet panic feeling exposed like the second before you leaned forward to a woman crossing a line he thought wildly of the first night with liesl being drawn in no going back he was my brother he said finally hoping his voice sounded steady plausible i want to know who did it i think we both owe him that minot said nothing assessing then nodded the bargain struck that easy everything goes through dennis understand not through my office when were ready for subpoenas we want them to come as a surprise like an ambush minot hesitated for a second then smiled thats right by the good guys this time ben how nice youre every where paulette goddard on her way in he stood up taking her offered hand paulette you remember congressman minot of course at the lasners nice to see you again an efficient smile not overlong dennis riordan mr riordan she said goodness you all look so serious thats what happens with just dennis to look at minot joked a compliment to her she was wearing lunch jewels a solitary drop and a diamond bracelet everything about her shiny im here to eat humble pie with polly she said apparently i owed her a train interview and shes been seething nice if they had told me but im the one in the doghouse not for long ill bet minot said smiling my god is that chili at this hour men she rolled her eyes i dont suppose you have anything i can give her she said to ben otherwise shell just go on about charlie again and what am i supposed to say just kiss and make up ben said she giggled in chasens wouldnt they be surprised well ill let you get back to business three men its always business dont sign anything she said putting a finger on bens chest thats my motto ken she nodded to minot remembering his name when she left there was a trace of perfume thats some goodlooking woman riordan said hard to believe she was married to him minot said chaplin ben said that was a while ago when he wanted to open a second front just a little earlier than ike did id like to get him in front of a microphone now tell us all about his russian friends i cant help you there ben said moving him away from it never met him anyway i doubt they ever talked politics would you with her not me riordan said grinning i dont want you to expect too much ben said to minot i dont know the people danny knew theyll know you minot said theyll want to know if youre sympathetic his brother theyll come to you but ill have no way of knowing whether theyre really how far it goes leave that to dennis were just looking for background sympathies it would help if i knew who hed already minot nodded dennis can help you with that too keep in mind some of those people agreed to be friends protected friends even from you we promised them that ben looked at his smooth untroubled face the careful eyes what had those conversations been like no one will know ifnot blackmail just a sensible arrangement to keep information coming a friend to the committee what hed promised now too he shifted in the booth feeling suddenly hemmed in you can do business with anyone otto had said until he couldnt across the room paulette was ordering a drink dont sign anything he could still say no go over to her table stay in the bright world you understand minot said what you want to do riordan said now that we think its like this is go through everything again calendars things like that who he was seeing hes not going to pick a name out of the blue what you want are the contacts whod he take to that room anyway any idea ben shook his head surprised at how easy it was to lie just another move on the board protecting your pawn you take a room its somebody to you youd talk you know minot said slowing them down to kill someone youd have to have an awful lot at stake something important to protect the people we know abouttheyre writers studio people who wrote a few checks to send an ambulance to spain people like that so who else his voice more excited now who had a reputation so big youd kill to protect it a reputation ben thought you could showcase in a hearing room newsreel cameras turning while you pounded a gavel you mean a star ben said its possible but everyone thinks his reputations important if somebodys threatening you everything you have something like this exposing peopleyou set up conditions he looked at minot you have to be careful do you mean me i meant danny but lets face it congressman you keep going a few people might think they had a reason to kill you what kind of talk is this riordan said just making a point minot reached over to sign the check a house account some point are we done here gentlemen they made their way out the door through another round of nods and waves and almost collided with polly rushing in she was tottering in her heels the way she had been that morning at union station but came to a dead stop when she saw minot congressman she said flustered a hesitation ben took as a sign of respect polly ive been meaning to call you me she said almost girlish that piece sunday i just hope everybody reads it stars still in the service you know my office gets calls every daythe wars over when is he coming home now we can say look at this did you read polly marks is bob montgomery home yet movie stars but theyre not bellyaching theyre doing what we all need to do hang in there till the jobs done ben watched fascinated as this rolled out in what seemed to be one breath effortless congressman i take my hat off to you whats winchell say orchids an orchid for that one you know dennis i think my friend ben collier here hes still in the service come to think of it still working for uncle sam making one of those great pictures the wacs been putting out this year its not over for them yes at continental of course good to see you again she said her eyes almost doing a double take someone she hadnt quite got the measure of before a friend of minots i hear sol lasner thinks the world of you ben shrugged not knowing how to respond awful about fays cousin isnt it i heard you were there terrible he agreed noncommittal avoiding her eyes youd think they couldve met at sols not have her drive way out there road like that probably feels terrible about it now who whoever she was meeting the one who called what he said everything stopping for a second his whole body rooted somebody called her that afternoon they think thats why she went out i hadnt heard that how had she fay lorna the hollywood switchboard and in the rain youd thinkbut you never know about people do you well you do minot said thats for sure theres not much polly misses or so they tell me a wrappingup voice ready to leave riordan hearing it handed a stub to the parking attendant i get paid not to miss anything polly said smiling again flattered well you keep writing pieces like sundays theyd better give you a raise you can tell them i said so too he said a verbal wink that was fine work nice to run into you moving her through the door before she could say anything else ben stood still only vaguely aware of them who would she have been meeting not feuchtwanger had she been peering through the rain looking for house numbers but the houses stopped and she had gone on but not necessarily lost or alone thats a powerful lady minot was saying do you know how many peoplefirst thing they do in the morning turn to polly millions one hundred twentythree newspapers ben said dully still preoccupied minot looked at him surprised then let it pass and the radio he said a good friend to have his car was being brought up im glad we could do this he said to ben i think we can do some good work you know the mpc ben shook his head motion picture council for the first amendment pinks riordan said but not a front group legitimate you might think about joining it show them where your heart is what you might be ready for let them approach you he paused an interior debate how well do you know kaltenbach ive met him hes close to ostermann i thought you werent interested in the germans only if theyre in the industry he had a lifesaver contract at warners in fortyone one year he hasnt worked since at a hundred dollars a week that still sounds like a lot of money to some people hollywood money hes nobody the germans dont seem to think so the east germans hes a famous writer there nobodys heard of him here maybe hell be better known ben watched him hand some money to the attendant how he said apprehensive be a help to us if you could let us know what his plans are i thought you said the state departments unreliable people write theminfluential peopleand they do things they shouldnt if it were me there wouldnt be a hope in hell he could go anywhere but its not up to me so we need to keep an eye on him i dont want him taking any trips not before the hearings youre going to call him hes a communist minot shook his head no just two meetings a little window shopping but we can put him at the meetings that means he can tell us who else was there i dont think hell do that hell have a lot of incentive under oath who put him at the meetings ben said queasy already knowing minot looked at him not saying anything danny saved his life in france im trying to save this country minot said he put his hand on bens shoulder about to move to his car nice to have you with us fay assumed it was a condolence call and insisted they have coffee on the back patio the day was mild but overcast fall on summit drive and she put a light cardigan over her shoulders as they went out after lorna brought the tray fay poured from the silver pot fluttering like billie burke then sat back and lit a cigarette crossing her stillgood goldwyn girl legs it was nice of you to come theres no one to talk towho knew her i mean it was only the once but i liked her the language was a problem people dont make the effort the friend who calledhe was german well lorna didnt think so at first she thought it was bunny somebody from the studio you know but then genia spoke german to him so it must have been a man then mm hmm why i just wondered he never called again no isnt it the strangest thing maybe he doesnt know thinks he was stood up or something the notice in the papersif you blinked you missed it i cant imagine who it was she never talked to anybody maybe someone she knew before over there but she never went out where would she at the party maybe she met people then you mostly of course bunny can talk to a stone so she knew him maybe somebody through the red cross i dont know none of it makes sense to me i mean you call to meet somebody its usually a hotel a bar someplace like that maybe she was going to his house and never got there or maybe she did i never thought of that maybe it was after she frowned turning this over well he has the number let me know if he calls will you she looked at him surprised her cigarette in midair just curious its like a mystery everything about her was a mystery she inhaled some smoke look we dont have to pretend she didnt slide off the road did she ben said nothing i thought it would help all this she said stretching her hand toward the sloping lawn well you do what you can she liked the garden so thats one thing youve put a lot of work into it he said taking in the lush rose beds the perennial borders me i wouldnt know a weed fromwell whatever the opposite is miguel does everything filipino but with a mex name dont ask me why it was a spanish colony so lots of spanish names is that right ha wait till i tell sol she looked over at him thats something everybody knows right about it being a colony no it was a while ago but people know she laughed who am i kidding sitting here with a teapot ladida like i ever made it past ninth grade bunny likes me with all this hightone stuff and fine i like it too because sol likes it but i know i like the roses though to look at sometimes i look at this place and i think who would have imagined all those years on the road washing out things in the sink and now youve got your own roses not just what some guy brings backstage a gardener with a fancy name she stopped and looked away but i guess she didnt see it that way you ever miss it he said steering them away the business that life not for two seconds whats to miss one town after another with nothing to dosomeplace in the sticks you couldnt wait to get back to new york its the same here you ask me but dont because sol loves it at least its not the road schlepping around worrying are you losing your looks what kind of life is that oh at first youre young you think there isnt anything else i never saw myself like this married mrs lasner and all right hes a handful but you know what hes crazy about me the rest she said waving her hand its nothing she put out the cigarette looking straight at him would you tell me something he almost died on the train didnt he dont worry i didnt get it from you he had an attack i dont know how serious im not a doctor he almost died she said flatly he thinks i dont know how can you live with somebody and not know these things what did the doctor say rosen what does he ever say retire and do what watch birds anyway he wasnt there only later when sols better you were you know how i know how he is with you what do you mean close you almost die theres a closeness i think youre imagin but she was shaking her head he watches you at the studio how youre doing he watches everybody ben said but he tells me about you how you are with hal other things he thinks you have a feel for the business a family thing only my father my mother hated it why oh the girls he got distracted ben smiled at the word over and over people say i should worry about sol and you know i never do i figure if it happens whod want to know she did fay smiled so maybe im not telling the truth either id kill him bare hands but ill tell you something he doesnt even look i know i was on the lot for years i know what to look for the thing about sol nobody gets this hes a gentleman they see the rough spots not here she tapped her heart here hes not so tough she looked down flustered i dont mean the real one a figure of speech i know but thats right too isnt it the real ones not so tough either then what you know what he thinks about all the time what happens to the studio me i guess he figures i can take care of myself but what happens to the studio who could do it you know we never had children he said it didnt matter to him but now i think it does you build something you want to pass it on not just hand it over to the banks i said to him once maybe its better look at the laemmles junior almost took it down with him and i could tell hes not even listening so thats part of it i think why he watches people what about bunny bunnys not a son im not either but he likes you so maybe it was the train i dont know all the sudden you feel youre running out of time maybe this is it did you ever wonder how much time you have left ive been thinking about that because of sol but i guess thats one thing nobody can know she paused unless its like with her you decide she said her face softer you were nice to come its good somebody came she lifted her head a visual pulling up its funny shes the one contacted the red cross she wanted to come over you wonder but you know what i think it came to me this morning does this make sense to you i think she was already gone she just didnt want to die over theregive those bastards the satisfaction there was still a police marker by the broken fence so ben stopped short pulling the car over to the lookout shoulder where couples parked the drive up feuchtwangers corniche had been no easier in daylight an ordeal even for anybody familiar with the road ben imagined it dark headlights shining on the wet surface he got out not even sure what he was looking for something left carelessly behind but the place seemed undisturbed even the smashed car removed now any tire marks or shoe prints washed away he walked to the fence looking over into the canyon a steep drop all youd have to do was put the car in gear and let it go gravity and a soft skull would do the rest ben went down the slope there were ruts gouged out of the ground probably made by the tow truck or whatever kind of winch theyd used to haul the wreck up the tree that had stopped it had some bark scraped away but was still standing given the angle of descent the impact must have been violent a thudding crash enough to throw a body into the windshield so why hadnt there been more blood he tried to remember the body his brief look when the sheet was pulled back lacerations the matted wound on the head but not drenched in blood but it wouldnt have been if shed died instantly a dead body doesnt pump blood still the blow on the head had caused a bloody welling ben looked up to the broken fence unless shed been hit before the crash maybe already dead when the car began plunging he hiked back to the road and walked along the shoulder to the turnoff big enough for two cars even more somewhere to meet marked by the curve ben turned back again to the fence searching the ground hed wanted to come back to the site show himself how it was possible but hed known outside chasens that she hadnt been alone a phone call a hasty meeting dead or almost dead before she went over the ground falling into topanga told him nothing he thought of her at the lasner party unafraid to tell him things he shouldnt know no more whispers and shadows not after everything a german voice on the phone who else was at the party what other ghost who recognized her he drove back to feuchtwangers house parking near the other cars along the steep patch of road one of them he noticed ostermanns come in come in feuchtwanger said bubbling his rimless glasses catching the afternoon light i didnt mean to interrupt no brecht is starting to make speeches please interrupt what were you just passing by nobody passes by up here he led ben into a large living room with a spectacular view of the pacific through the picture window couches were arranged to face it but the group sat instead at the end of the room away from the light clustered around a coffee table littered with halffinished cups and hazy with smoke as intimate as a kudamm cafe everyone was speaking german so you can decide feuchtwanger said im thinking about a play and of course brecht doesnt want me to write a play so he doesnt like anything about it write the play brecht said deadpan drawing on his cigar do you like the devil in boston for a title the title tells you whats wrong brecht said all right so witch trials yes everyone sees a metaphor for what is happening here what is going to happen but its not exact it was then about belief the devil in boston a religious phenomenon not political persecution it felt the same to the witches feuchtwanger said brecht waved this aside it confuses the issue but the process is exactly the same the psychology oh psychology brecht said dismissive why do you think its going to happen ben said back at chasens minots hand on his shoulder because ive seen it happen before precisely feuchtwanger said the process is the same always make the fear then the fear feeds on itself thats the devil hitler made the jew the devil but it was the fear the motivations are different brecht said hitler wanted to go to war thats what he always wanted from the first not religious hysteria and the rallies feuchtwanger said what do you call that brecht drew on his cigar with a little smile show business he said in english ach feuchtwanger said a mock exasperation but enjoying the joke and here politics brecht said not even serious politics foolishness its a country of children he turned to ben you know what his inspiration is for a play about witches they refused his application to be a citizen of this place why he wants such a thing why not gratitude ostermann said they took us in they took you in too yes and theyll spit me out watch he took a drink from a small glass we have no place now only here he said touching his temple hah im not such a poet feuchtwanger said i live here he pointed his finger to the floor but not as an american why what did they say ben asked feuchtwanger i can appeal the time isnt right maybe with whats going on the reason premature antifascism brecht said rolling out the phrase slowly savoring it what can it mean there must have been a time when it was good to be a fascist then not its a trick finding the right moment you can be against the fascists but not too soon then yourewell what exactly feuchtwanger shrugged nodding with him a socialist a pacifist before when you wrote against the nazis where could you do it the places they suspect now too left too this too that so its not the best time here thomas mann had no problem brecht said puckish oh saint thomas they laughed softly a cafe murmur ben looked at them slumped against cushions holding cigars easy with each other was this the sort of meeting danny had described riordan scribbling notes the author of josephus is preparing a play about the salem witch trials drawing analogies to contemporary events the author of galileo made remarks critical of the us hans ostermann my fatherinlaw saidall typed up for the files smoky idle talk a harmless report but no betrayal was harmless what brings you here ostermann said suddenly what did just a quick hello lasner wanted me to check on the car whether theyd towed it yes the accident feuchtwanger said i told you about it he said to ostermann terrible but on this road not a surprise ostermann said someone you knew a relative of lasners ben turned to feuchtwanger are there any germans living here up on the hill besides you oh no were famous marta and methe foreigners of course mann is also in the palisades vicki baum but not here nearer the village why do you ask ostermann said ben looked up at a loss maybe this hearing german it would be so nice for you if there were someone else nearby only lion has the courage brecht said these roads in santa monica its safe all flat even salka in the canyon its not so bad but the views feuchtwanger said extending his hand toward the window and the fading afternoon copper glints on the water and lights beginning to come on but we always have to drive you ostermann said the courageous lion another easy laugh the road familiar to all of them you didnt have to live here to know it even lions guests german speakers so how was it at almas brecht asked feuchtwanger you know she had schoenberg and stravinsky both the same dinner another play for you brecht said mischievous no it was dull they wouldnt talk about music out of respect anything but musicso nothing really and alma talked about herself ben drank his coffee halflistening talk that could go on for hours no other germans on the road just a place to meet then out of the way he stood up but youve just come feuchtwanger said i know but i have to get back to the studio ah the studio brecht said airily back to the assembly line he moved his arms in a pincer like chaplin working the wrenches in modern times more dreams more dreams and me ostermann said standing too no no dont get up a nice afternoon lion like before nothings like before brecht said even before outside ostermann walked ben to his car i thought when you came it was for me that you had news news about the screen test almost forgotten liesl playing a daughter no not yet i dont want her to be disappointed after everything although to wish such a life for your child still i can hear it in her voice how she wants it i was worried after the funeral i remembered how it feels how lonely but now look screen tests it was good not being alone in the house i think so thank you for that ben looked away they really refused lion he said hes a socialist its very well known even here all you had to do was check a file information from a wellplaced source but thats not not before now its different his lawyer said be patient now he gets his publisher to write for him how distinguished he is he does very well here you know the translations not like poor heinrich is this how it was done you didnt have to ask just let the conversation run listening for riordan a sponge and now there are difficulties its ironic yes they didnt want heinrich to leave europe now they dont want him to leave here this time no daniel to arrange the escape so he goes to offices and waits for a piece of paper just like his script why not leave without it cross the pyrenees again you forget he had papers then thats what daniel arranged its not so easy without that a passport brecht doesnt understand living in his head he said with a sarcastic smile why lion wants his piece of paper if he leaves he cant come back hes not a refugee anymore but not a citizen either of anywhere so all he can do is stay here as he is yes its very comfortable for him he gestured toward the house but now a cage also but kaltenbach doesnt want to come back so he thinks i wonder what he will say after when those doors close he sighed but first he has to get there with minot watching with ben watching for him what about you are you having any trouble me oh im not such a dangerous person as lion i wasnt premature he looked down maybe too late how we waited hoping it would go away thinking a catastrophe would go away there was traffic on sunset so that by the time ben got back to gower the lot had taken on the afterwork quiet of skeleton crews and empty sound stages only a few cars left in their reserved spaces screening room with mr l said one of bunnys secretaries anticipating his question she was putting folders in drawers evidently working late to catch up on the filing howd the test go do you know liesl kohler or had they changed her name when was this today maybe theyre looking at it now the only way i know is he writes a memo on a screen test everything she said with a nod to the wall of filing cabinets what tenneys office must look like fourteen thousand files rumors on paper how about the guest list for lasners party saturday her head went up immediately protective i was there he explained and i talked to somebody and i cant remember her name i thought if i could go through the list you know it might come back to me does he keep them the lists uh huh dont worry im sure itll be okay with him she said nothing i could go down to the screening room have him phone up she hesitated trying to guess what bunnys reaction would be to either course no its here she said finally turning to a drawer i just filed it in fact she got it out and handed it to him you mind ill bring it back you want to take it she said suspicious again he began to read down the list everyone there with marks next to the warners people seating plans names on spokes around a circle everything thought out liesl listed as ben collier guest rex morgan who owned percent but who had talked to genia spotted her across the room a german speaker so not ann sheridan or one of the starlets maybe not at the party at all just someone who knew she was in town but it would be easy enough to come up with a short list of possibilities then use dennis to check them routine for a bureau man start somewhere she hadnt taken a random turn off sunset someone had told her where to go he looked up to find the secretary watching him he doesnt like things to leave the office she said expecting trouble its a party list he said folding it ill tell him downstairs they had already started running the dailies so ben slipped into the screening room quietly and took a seat at the back bunny was in his usual watching posture chin resting on a pyramid of fingers while lasner made running comments to the directors it was dick marshall again out of the fighter plane making a sentimental visit to another pilot in the hospital why a profile lasner said theyre paying to see the face watch the eyes when he turns the director said now you see the tears hes been holding them back why he saw the picture sol the buddy dies wonderful something upbeat what can i tell you sol its a war picture all right all right he looks good jamie bunny said to the director placating think you can wrap this week there was another clip lasner quiet his silence acting like a sigh then the directors left jesus christ bunny lasner said the room was still dim ben invisible in the back shadows i know itll be okay if we can get it out fast we can book it with rosemarys picture recover the costs were supposed to be making money not recovering costs sol youre the one who taught me pay the overhead with these your wins are twice as big and what about dick we got an investment there too another war picture i had an idea about that i want you to see this test bunny picked up the phone could you run the test now the first one this would have been the moment ben knew to cough declare himself but he sat still too interested to move it was the same scene theyd used with julie the young girl getting up from the piano and saying goodbye to the older manher father her teacher who was sending her away better for everyone for some reason liesl was wearing a simple white blouse and skirt her hair brushed straight the whole effect young on the brink when she lifted her face at the piano it seemed to draw the key light to it a sudden radiance ben knew that it was framing and makeup and wellplaced arcs that it was liesl playing the piano but knowing all of it made no difference film transformed everything even the piano gleamed she smiled now at the keyboard slightly wistful a girl he had never seen before watch this bunny said what am i watching lasner said the way she moves its the first thing i noticed like a dancer watch how she gets up you know who does that cary grant he was an acrobat lasner said not a dancer same thing bunny said still fixed on the screen now the hands watch her with his arm she just grazes it the way she might have touched ostermann a gesture ben had seen her make protective listen bunny said im hearing someone who went to school the clip ended with an accent lasner said never mind thats part of it stay with me watch it again he asked the projectionist to rerun it this time neither of them spoke paying attention lasner was quiet afterward a nice girl he said finally bunny nodded exactly she looks like she could actually play the piano so what was with the piano by the way you dont miss much do you vegetable oil you spray it on and the lights pick it up lasner shook his head delighted another magic trick they dont line up for nice this is something else sol maybe another bergman youre serious about this bunny picked up the phone run the other one you made two tests nice with something behind it watch liesl was on a terrace now outside a pair of french windows about to kiss dick marshall it was a night scene their faces lit by moonlight her white skin glowing in a lowcut dress you used dick in a test watch marshall kissed her and she responded then began kissing his face all over devouring it an eruption of kisses that seemed to well up out of her control when dick pulled back breathless the camera went to her leaning forward still eager her eyes darting all over his face as if she were kissing him now with her eyes somebodyll see marshall whispered i dont care she said her breath a gasp moving up to kiss him again bens own breathing stopped for a minute hair bristling on the back of his neck not just the same words the same face turner does that with her eyes lasner was saying no ben thought liesl does that a look printed in the back of his head just for him when her lips reached dick marshall he knew how they would open the same soft yielding he felt his hand tighten on the armrest an actress borrowed from life the look in her eyes now was real as real as it had been with him but what if it hadnt been maybe it was just the way she played the scene with him with dick acting both times how had she played it with danny something he hadnt allowed himself to think about before the same expression the same eyes all over his face or had it been different with him a different acting or not acting at all the way they felt about each other how do you like her with dick bunny said as the clip ended ben scarcely heard him his mind flooding with scenesin the pool on the chaise her hand reaching up to his neck had any of them been real none of them didnt everybody react this way when they saw someone they knew on film they seemed the same because the gestures came from the same placea protective pat on a fathers arm but not the eyes intimacy wasnt something you could carry away with you turn into a character touch thats why you used him it works the two of them so she can kiss theres still the accent you know what it would take smooth that out bunny nodded but not yet the accents part of it remember dearly beloved the klausner script he brings the wife home and the mother makes trouble i thought you didnt like it for dick i didnt too light for hima meringue and with her a strudel give it to rosemary bunny shook his head the problems always been why does she put up with it why doesnt she get wise to the mother rosemaryd be onto her in a minute but if she were foreign a kraut dutch whatever the accentll pass for anything a war bride dick brings her home now its okay for dick its time to get him out of uniform he marries her over there shes crazy about him why not he saves her hes taking her out of there to heaven she thinks then she gets here and theres mom before its a b about newlyweds now youve got gis coming home its about something dick can handle that and shed be perfect a nice girl youre on her side when the mother starts in and she gets him back in the end because hes nuts about herwhich you can believe he said flipping his hand to the screen the remembered kiss he paused we need to get him into something right away with an unknown the biggest name weve got she wont be unknown when the picture opens shell be his new friend first time they meet on the set sparks then the brush fire you can see it on the screen before your eyes polly will eat it up lasner looked down thinking how soon to get it fixed get ben hecht to do a polish a polish hes five thousand a week thats all hed need we could put it into production right away a dick marshall for the holidays he paused we own it and its sitting there lasner looked over at bunny you really have a feeling about her ben sat still fascinated the moment suddenly important a feeling about her not brechts factory a casino as imprecise as a white ball spinning round a wheel lasner sighed a moment of theater then lowered his voice standard options and you have to do something about the name what are you going to call her linda its close you like linda eastman her name means eastman in german now you speak german enough to know that ben sat up enough to make a telephone call but why would he whered you find her at your house she was at the dinner for minot with ben collier collier oh ottos kid what hes screwing her his brothers wife the one who ben cleared his throat announcing himself both men turned bunny touched a switch on his armrest console to raise the lights youre there all this time lasner said like a spook i didnt want to interrupt i just wanted to see how she did dailies are by invitation bunny said frosty anything you hear stays in this room understood its all right lasner said patting bunnys arm hes with the studio hes also a relative so whens that a crime this whole business is relatives he got up facing ben whats the matter you look funny nothing ben said also getting up just seeing someone you know up there what did you think lasner said walking up the aisle dont ask meim family bunnys the expert he said a peace offering the scene with marshall did they improvise the lines or improvise bunny said rolling his eyes on a test the words a coincidence then but not the face bunnys looking for a nice girl lasner said a tease a bergman shes the biggest thing in pictures sol nice but something underneath what underneath shes playing a nun one picture you want to borrow her for dick its a fortune and you wont even notice him somebody new it looks like hes pulling her and we go into production right away making a case lasner hesitated for effect then nodded one week for hecht and no color no color bunny agreed its not a musical lasner glanced up sam come to you yet about the musical now hes telling me she can sing the new skirt as if he would knowanother pasternak he hears her humming on his dick he thinks its a musical a bar mitzvah coming up and hes playing around with that well sam bunny had been watching lasners face scanning a page you want me to put her in something right away he said flatly shes busy maybe sam doesnt think were metro bunny looked at him then put a folder of notes under his arm ill find something how long does it last with sam anyway lasner said but bunny had begun to usher them out moving on the first contracts always boiler plate he said to ben dont worry shell sign she wants this everybody wants this bunny said simply turning to him explaining something to a child everybody in the world by the time ben had finished copying the guest list bunnys secretary had finally gone he put the list back on her desk then an impulse went through to bunnys office and glanced around the room a more careful look than on that first rushed morning wood paneling barrel chairs with metal trim but none of the personal effects that usually filled shelves no photographs of bunny as a child star no leatherbound favorite scriptsnothing in fact but the business of continental filing cabinets and inboxes filled with waiting papers it was as if his former life had receded with his hairline leaving the front office to mr jenkins he walked over to the desk and ran his eye down the open calendar tomorrows page crowded with appointments and reminders as detailed and inflexible as a shooting schedule he glanced up quickly to make sure he was still alone then flipped back to monday another full page ending with rosemarys wrap party and rushes with l the usual last entry except he hadnt stayed to watch them ben remembered him standing outside the sound stage on his way somewhere lasner annoyed later when he couldnt be found where just out of curiosity ben estimated the time between bunnys leaving and lasner getting the police call how long to the palisades forty minutes even with the wet roads maybe less he could easily have been there but why would he be he wasnt someone in her past like danny hed probably helped arrange to bring her over why ask now for a secret meeting still hadnt lorna thought at first the call was from the studio when he got home he found liesl in the screening room watching one of the partners movies the light pouring through the open door had startled her someone caught in a guilty pleasure you know this one she said car trouble its from life when our car broke down in laguna theyre all from life i never realized before i never paid attention the premiere all you can think about is the audience do they like it but he took everything from life their life the one they had together ill let you finish he said backing away no turn it off its enough i just wanted to see you what you were like well what he thought you were like she said her voice offhand plausible and how was i he said moving to the projection room serious a great believer in justice she said playing with it he switched off the projector and raised the lights what made you run it he said coming back you werent trying to see me eddies not me you dont think so she said an evasive shrug i dont know maybe for daniel maybe i wanted to see what was on his mind you tell me thingsyou make me think i never knew him so who was he any answers no maybe in the one he didnt make she nodded to the box republic had sent over he picked a script out of the box youre late again she said ive been watching you he said with a sly smile they liked the test yes she said lifting her head alert lasner bunny they liked it tell me she said excited what did they say get an agent yes they want to make a contract well kohner i can call him she said suddenly practical he knows my father they really liked it bunny wants to give you a buildup a buildup she said translating it publicity oh to make me a movie star she said skeptical with my accent daniel said it was impossible with my accent times change he sees you as a war bride dick marshalls her eyes widened his wife its a real part ben nodded also his girlfriend off screen at least at ciros places they take pictures they can do that its a personal services contract thats part of the service oh will you be jealous she said coming over to him putting her hands on his arms that depends what happens after he said playing along thats not in the contract too is it no good she said reaching her hand up to his neck then theres nothing to worry about she smiled her whole body warm against him eyes darting across his face just the way they had when she said i dont care and suddenly he didnt care either maybe it was always acting he thought of the girls in germanythered been no pretense there a warm mouth for a few cigarettes no one thought of sex in the back of a jeep as making love just something you did while you waited to go home to real intimacy a cry that wasnt fake her eyes moved over him now the way they had in the test but did that make it any less real he was already hard wanting to be seduced wanting the touch that reached inside you when the eyes were only for you the way it was in the movies liesl became linda eastman suddenly swept up in a storm of wardrobe fittings and blocking rehearsals and ben moved out of the house it wasnt a question of propriety he was family easily explainable to the photographers but why raise questions at all she was supposed to be lonely waiting for someone like dick to come along he wasnt superstitious about the cherokee danny may have died there but he had never actually stayed there and there was still part of a month already paid for with the next now paid in advance to joel it was convenient just a few blocks walk to drugstore counters on hollywood boulevard if he didnt want to eat in still there was a haunted feeling to the place especially at night when the thin sound of a radio playing downstairs came in through the window like smoke he never saw his neighbors and after a while he began to feel that no one really lived therethey were all just passing through drinking or washing out nylons or memorizing lines all waiting the way they did in hollywood for the phone to ring even with his things hung in the closet and books and papers in a small heap on the desk the room seemed empty he paced through it door to kitchen counter to balcony an animal staking out territory to make it his own the balcony especially needed to be claimed swept free of ghosts he looked down seeing the body in the photograph again the huddled neighbors riordan hanging back surprised if he had been if he hadnt been upstairs racing down with the others to gape the photograph was real but everything else was a story you chose to believe you couldnt be certain not of anybody even someone you thought you knew hed seen that going through dannys reports in minots office a paper trail of little betrayals no one ever suspecting just listening and passing on but violating too as ben flipped through folder after folder he felt he was no longer looking for leads but for something else a reason at first riordan hadnt wanted ben in the files at all its not somebody we know its somebody we dont know remember but ben had insistedit was his bargaining chip a matter of trustand riordan finally agreed but only at night after everyone had gone he steered ben to files that used dannys reportsostermann brecht the emigre circle there were even notes on werfel and salka and thomas mann everyone danny appeared simply as the initial k in the margins identifying him as a source on the memos riordan had written up bureau style subject ostermann requested sign position paper latin american committee for free germany sponsored by exile group mexico city see seghers et al brechts sexual relations with secretary ruth berlau were known to wife helene weigel guest viertel home santa monica arranged brecht numerous visits brecht kaltenbach had met with kranzler aufbau kranzler under bureau surveillance after visit eisler known cp purpose discuss english translation of subjects works no decision reached k according to the files kranzler visited other german writers then the highland lounge popular with deviants entertained us serviceman overnight at roosevelt hotel there were more brechts arguments with fritz lang on hangmen also die kaltenbachs finances ostermanns intention to apply for citizenship after the fiveyear waiting period could anyone have taken these seriously written down recorded sources put into code so that the files themselves became secrets about secrets were they all like this ben thought of the fbi the gpu any of them with their archives and hundreds of legmen filling folders with items no more damaging than onions in winchell but there were other items too from other sources requests for surveillance possible new informants now vulnerable to approach everyone caught in a fun house hall of mirrors in germany files like these had killed none of these are recent ben said thats what he used to give the bureauits just there as backup you know in case we ever need it the congressmans more interested in the industry riordan pulled another file subject schaeffer suspected cp hollywood branch k suggests verify with source g excp whos schaeffer a writer fox but you get one you have a lead to someone else did g verify riordan nodded what happens to schaeffer that depends what he says under oath doesnt it when he testifies how cooperative he is who else riordan looked to the filing cabinets i told you hes not going to be here bring me a suggestion a name in his desk we can check that out but here its a needle in a whats that a guest list people danny knew i thought he stopped what could he tell riordan another crime with no connection except a shared past something genia must have known look were flying blind here i know but i think he was going to put one of these names in here he pointed to the files lets see whos already there riordan looked at him then at his watch then back again can i say something to you i know this is personal with you but make it too personal youre not going to get anywhere you want to know everything he told us whats the point i want to know where he was looking if there was a pattern you think he just pulled names out of a hat tell you the truth i didnt give it a thought as long as the names checked out and they did so where was he getting them his memory box i always thought riordan said tapping his head these are people he knew some of them but not all so theres another source not just him someone else riordan stared at him then got up a weary shuffling all right you got an itch about this scratch it buti dont have to say anything in here stays here you know that right you think i care whether schaeffers red or not theres only one communist im interested in you and minot can have all the rest i never even saw these all right riordan said nothing for a moment then picked up his hat the door locks behind you im just saying theres a lot of privileged stuff here and im trying to get you more one more friendly witness just dont do it solo dont worry ill give him to you i didnt mean that what you get too close all by yourself you could get hurt hed have to wouldnt he like before wouldnt think twice he put on his hat safety in numbers when hed gone the room turned eerily silent and ben found himself moving quietly too as if he had broken in and had to make sure no noise reached the night watchman he slid the file drawer out carefully guest list in his other hand the easiest way would be to eliminate the obvious names first then move on to the ones he didnt know but it was hard to be methodical even when a name had no file he would bump up against another one not on the list that seemed vaguely familiar paulette goddard was there but only as an exwife crossreference to the thick chaplin file ben flipped through thisevery speech hed ever made every interview anonymous evaluations of his opinions a full dossier of meaningless paper flecked with little drops of professional envy but someone had taken the time to compile it out of curiosity he looked for his own name but neither he nor liesl had attracted anyones attentionnor danny for that matter unless the sources had a special file drawer of their own a warners director had solicited contributions for the abraham lincoln brigade and his films had been reviewed for leftwing sentiments feldman a front office crony ben knew only by sight had attended an antifascist league fundraiser ambassador hotel with gail simco excp his girlfriend a party seven years ago it was when he found a file on warner himselfproduction decisions made on mission to moscow that the full craziness of it all struck him he looked around minots silent office drawer after drawer of trivia and innuendo put together during the war consuming time and expense to prepare for the war in their imaginations and danny a willing part of it had his sense by then been blunted too crazy wasnt necessarily harmless the files were an arsenal they were getting ready his fingers stopped surprised at the tab with rosemarys name on it subject real name risa meyer raised cp household father jacob arrested nyc strike action later official ilgwu mother irene seamstress also ilgwu both cp membership on record resignation no evidence subsequent membership but source g believes remained socialist subject attended pine hill monticello ny childrens summer camp known for cp indoctrination no known official cp affiliation but background suggests further investigation attached were supporting documents even a camp roster a list of her magazine subscriptionsobtained how sag membership date a copy of the police report of her fathers arrest none of it important or secret yet sitting in a file available he looked at it again feeling squeamish as if hed opened a lingerie drawer a private place where he wasnt supposed to be no k source at least hed reported on ostermann on friends why not jottings after a weekend at the biltmore but he wouldnt have one fine line he wouldnt have crossed as if ben knew any longer what he wouldnt have done he came back to her again after hed checked more names off the list had rosemary known he thought of her at the party enjoying her moment not meeting liesls eyes suggests further investigation what if that had been danny listening closely the click of the key in the door startled him he looked up frozen at minot coming in his hand still on the door even more surprised for a second neither of them moved what are you doing minot said finally his voice flat waiting to hear he was in black tie evidently on his way home from a formal evening checking files ben said trying to sound calm riordan had to leave an eager beaver minot said squeezing out a small smile dennis shouldnt have done that he went over to his desk and took an envelope out of his inbox the files are private i was just checking my brothers reports no offense he stopped taking in the stack in front of ben you understand we promise people when they help us well like yourself you wouldnt want everyone the sources are coded minot nodded his eyes darting involuntarily toward the bottom drawer a quick check to see if it had been opened but not impossible to guess i mean we need to protect them youd want that wouldnt you your brother was very particular on that point and even so well its late need a lift ive got a car waiting downstairs ill just put these back no leave them minot said firmly sally can get them in the morning he was moving to the door now opening it expecting ben to follow anything for us yet he said pleasantly no i was hoping he opened his hand to the files i think youd find it easier with someone around help you navigate he switched off the light closing the door behind them testing the knob to make sure it had locked what did you mean even so ben said about danny you said and even so oh well you know things happen even when youre careful your brother was very careful i dont think anybody ever knewthat he gave us information about them but somebody did find out i cant even remember howdennis i suppose your brother chewed him out for it said it cost him a job who found out minot slowed looking at him oh i see no its not what youre thinking no grudges but if the guy it wouldnt be he said evenly he became a friend of ours after danny a friend minot said cutting him off like you we trust our friends he glanced over be a hell of a world if we didnt wouldnt it he waved to the night watchman his tone suddenly genial frank whereve you been keeping yourself right here not out on the town like some people the guard said smiling at the tuxedo well somebodys got to do it hows the wifebetter a politicians memory better than a room of files like new ill tell her you asked he said pleased taking in ben now minot handed him the envelope from his inbox somebodyll be by for this sorry about the hour im here anyway frank said propping it on the fire extinguisher while he opened the door for them outside a car was waiting the driver idling the motor ben caught a glimpse of a womans crossed leg in the backseat patient mrs minot sure i cant give you a lift no my cars over there ben said nodding to the dark parking lot minot reached out for the door handle then hesitated turning have you seen kaltenbach he said lowering his voice i keep hearing things we dont want to have to move too early tip our hand one subpoena too soon its like scaring birds they start flying all over the place you want to get the timing right he hesitated again id appreciate it if you spent a little time with him i know youve got something else on your mind and thats fine but right now we could use someone inside id think of it as a favor ben watched his car go then started over to his own thinking a friend of ours but how willing danny said it had cost him a job he looked toward the dark building then suddenly with a wheel click he was back on the chief something that hadnt worked out sol couldnt remember why frank looked up from a magazine when ben tapped on the glass like a dummy i forgot something and ken took the key do you have a pass take me a second the first name did it a man whod asked about his wife frank led him down the hall and found the key on his ring thanks appreciate it ben said but frank stayed with him just inside the door he went over to the bottom drawer and flipped through the tabs there might have been other jobs not necessarily but there it was jenkins so thin he almost missed it he slipped the file under his arm i owe you one he said to frank putting on a relieved expression his homework safe in hand in the car he flicked on the overhead light a studio bio sheet innocuous presumably there for reference and a single report sheet subject jenkins attended discussion group cp westwood guest of j macdonald source initial k in the margin one meeting not enough to suggest any serious political window shopping much less something to use against him later maybe it had been nothing more than a courtesy dropin for macdonalds sake why even bother to keep the report now that he was a friend but why look for logic in any of it why report that kranzler had asked a gi up to his room that brecht had arranged trysts at salkas that rosemary read colliers the peeping like any compulsion was an end in itself no information was useless if the point was the gathering a brief word from danny now permanently on file to hold over bunnys head keep him friendly but bunny had reasons of his own to get close to minot why would he care about this still he hadenough to be angry with danny maybe it was nothing more than the startled uneasy feeling of someone who realizes hes being watched through the window anger a natural reflex maybe it had to do with macdonald a name to check the next time he got into the files but not angry enough to kill a job denied no more i knew who he was hed said to ben no explanation necessary when riordan asked him to make the call maybe even a touch of satisfaction bringing source k to an end ben switched off the light and lit a cigarette rosemarys file was more damagingnot a summer camp the studio would want to see written up in photoplay ben wondered if bunny knew about the reportmore interesting if rosemary knew about it her moment with everything at stake there was nothing to indicate that danny had ever betrayed her what if shed thought he had but bunny hadnt made the call for her hed made it for riordan he looked up his eyes caught by the headlights sweeping into the parking lot not minot again a smaller car it pulled up to the door and the driver ran up the steps tapping on the glass it was only when frank turned on another light that the driver became more than a shadow for a minute ben still didnt recognize hima natural lag seeing something unexpected out of place frank opened the door and handed over minots envelope then kelly started back down the stairs ben watched moving pieces around in his head kelly playing messenger for minot but at the farmers market he hadnt known riordan the connection must be at the other end there wasnt time to sort it out kellys lights came on again the car starting for the street almost without thinking ben turned the key kelly getting something for the paper but at wilshire he was turning away from downtown heading toward beverly hills just keep a few lengths behind no one ever noticed a tail if he wasnt looking for it kelly was leaning forward to turn the radio knob just going about his business whatever it was after el camino kelly turned right passing blocks of stores and then crossing santa monica to the horseshoecurve streets of the flats below sunset ben slowed dropping farther behind the streets were empty dark between the corner lights halfasleep just stop signs now not enough traffic for lights another right turn the house was halfway up the block ben parked a little way down and across killing his lights the car swallowed up in the shade of a big pepper tree kelly was walking up the curved pavement he rang the bell waited looking up at the fanlight a brighter light then the door opened and polly marks stepped out a drink in one hand running an errand for polly not for the first time a few familiar words the envelope delivered and she was turning back to her drink all in one gliding movement something theyd done before in time to get it into the typewriter a leak from the files more kindling he watched kelly drive away then sat for a minute looking at the quiet streetshrubs and lawns and even a trellis of flowers no sound but crickets peaceful and unaware not a flame in sight he was surprised when riordan answered the phone youre there early ken likes it navy hours or some shit riordan said his voice husky only halfawake studio hours too ben said looking at the pile of paper already on his desk outside technicians with coffee cups were heading for the sound stages anyway im glad i caught you what i hear ken caught you you dont want to surprise him like that he gets riled up i was just checking names not anymore he said a thud in his voice files are closed great open one for me then will you see if you have anything on a j macdonald mac even a crossreference who is he thats what im asking you his name came up thats all came up how dennis are you going to do this or not just see what you have a hesitation then an exaggerated sigh give me a sec ben heard the receiver being laid on the desk the sharp metallic scrape of a file drawer opening a meeting five years ago music department universal riordan said reading cp not in here fellow traveler though lots of organizations the usual pink went into the army fortytwo thats the last thing we have want me to check some more check what army records friend of mine has access see if he was discharged died maybe who was the source on the file no source just a general stuff you can pull from the papers this goes back some nothing recent you think your brother knew him maybe just a loose end i mean if theres been nothing for years but he must have known his name at least well enough to mention it in bunnys file you have an old address uh uh nobody ever wrote him up hes just a guy on some lists so they made a file strictly what he joined antifascist league things like that howd you say he came up ben glanced at bunnys thin file how long before anyone missed it on a list probably nothing let me know about the army though okay so i can scratch him off do i need to do anything about ken i dont want him to think hell calm down youre the only one hes got now with the krauts i thought he wasnt interested in them they meet people it all connects like a web one strand to another and who else was present mr kaltenbach to the best of your recollection heinrich must have met people if he was sympathetic enough to be approached now invited to return why not then a gathering over coffee one name then another until they found one for the newsreels and who else was at the meeting mr macdonald but bunny would be protected a friend to the committee until it began to eat its own too hungry to stop ben walked over to the window looking out at the sunny lot cowboys and showgirls coming out of makeup grips moving scenery everyone busy unconcerned did any of them know what minot was planning what it would mean for a second he saw the street in a freeze frame a stopped moment before it all began theyd turn on each other running for cover right into minots hands at the gate there was a commotion as some grips crossed the picket line more pickets had come out today not just the usual handful and the guards had seemed jittery when ben drove through earlier shouts now instead of breezy catcalls one of the grips shouted back then had to be pulled away two of the picketers lunged toward him then stopped posturing more shouts namecalling but no sticks or stones a jurisdictional dispute he turned back to the paperwork then saw her coming out of makeup she was in the same kind of white blouse and simple skirt theyd used in the test but now wore heels so that her legs stretched up his eyes followed her toward the actors trailers hair catching the morning light watching the way she moved the easy glide bunny had noticed but ben had noticed other things a leg in a mirror eyes that darted across your face he missed the swimming pool sitting on the chaise still wet in terry robes then the smell of chlorine on her skin her thigh half open to its soft side she looked up into the mirror of her dressing table when the door opened i saw you pass going over lines she nodded to the script in front of her today i meet the sister shes jealous he closed the door behind him dont people will notice im family in my dressing room what if connie comes its hers too you share youre the star she smiled not yet she held up both hands to the mirror wriggling them i havent put my hands in cement why do they do that he shrugged why do they do anything you think its all foolish only newsreels he walked over to the chair standing behind her next week we do the scenes in germany she said to the mirror did you see what theyre building i live in a house that was bombed in a cellar its strange you know where id be if id never come here or dead yes you know my name the character maria no saras here either like goebbels i thought they were making you dutch he said back to the mirror no they want the ruins so when i see his mothers house he put his hands on her shoulders leaning down to kiss her neck dont she said moving forward ill have to do the makeup all over again it took hours to look like this not even lipstick its the hardest connie says to look natural he brushed his hand down the back of her hair its good to see you she looked down maybe its good it gives us time to think about what she looked at him in the mirror for a moment then let it go i dont know she said getting up and turning so that now they were facing each other hows dick marshall the perfect gentleman she put her hand on his chest holding him in place not like you how about i come for a swim she shook her head still holding him back their faces close hes taking me to the grove after after i sleep the camera picks it up if your skin theres nothing wrong with your skin he said moving closer not here she said pushing her hand against him i can come late leave early he said his face almost on hers dont she said again no one would know when she didnt answer he waited for another second then stepped back if thats it he said his voice ironic he moved away leaving it but she reached for his arm pulling him back maybe its best for now he stopped still just looking trying to read her expression could eyes be trained like voices i wish i knew what you wanted he said quietly she returned his look then let her hand drop moving away from him i wish i knew that too she went back over to the mirror a final check i have to go theyll be ready you too before anyone sees she patted her hair i have to meet the sister he glanced at his watch shifting moods with her and i have a meeting lasner keeps asking me to meetings he likes you i think he does it to needle bunny all right he said moving to the door do i go first or do you want me to sneak out after youve gone you think its a joke people look for that by the way what i came for did danny know a man called macdonald she thought for a second i dont think so why i came across his name in some papers what papers it doesnt matter papers he never mentioned a macdonald no thats what you came for more daniel youre sure he said ignoring this i dont know one name all those years how would i remember macdonald like the man on the farm ben nodded waiting i dont think so she looked up i wish you would stop with this business when i know how whos going to tell you daniel maybe from the grave you keep him alive with all this here she said touching her head then turned and closed the script her back to him it feels like cheating he said nothing looking into the mirror maybe thats what i want she said two in the room not three i only see two ben said he was early for the scheduling meeting with only one project to manage there was no real need for him to be there at all but lasner had insisted another mark of favor the other line producers took in with nervous waitandsee glances only sam pilcer an old hand at musical chairs seemed not to care they were waiting in the conference room next to lasners office where bunny had set up a television the first ben had actually seen outside magazines on the small glass screen a clown was performing again with this lasner said to bunny just look at it look at what found money lasner waved this off youre like freeman at paramount remember he set up that kraut right before the war klaus landsberg bunny said and what two years minimal investment and he takes it on the air wxyz what youre watching now he said catching lasners puzzled expression its not an experiment anymore sol the only question is how fast they can make them last four years theyve all been working for the government every electronics company in the country army contracts now watch they can start turning these out to watch this clowns no rex morgan the silver bullet series thats ten fifteen years old and just sitting there in the warehouse pictures nobodys going to run again and heres a new exhibitor with all day to fill why not with rex im telling you found money no prints no advertising no overhead aunt tillie just died and left you a little something say thank you and cash the check what kind of money can something like that pay not much now bunny said but its bottom line to us all of it right now were making nothing on rex just paying storage but lasner was only half listening staring at the wooden box eyes narrowing in thought and ben wondered for a moment if he was back in the dry goods store on fourteenth street the fuzzy lines behind the glass just like the jerky figures of light on the tackedup sheet of course the real money bunny was saying is going to be in production but thats down the road this is going to be the new pictures nobodys saying that people say iti hear it and were going to hand over continental product for a few bucks cut our own throats let them stick with the clowns see how far they get b product old b product and you said production its getting harder with the bs sol you know that if they take away the block booking were going to have a problem on our hands were not metro and you dont see mayer making clown shows either he looked again at the set where are the kids going to neck in the balcony at the movies thats not going to change not with a product anyway i know i know more as you keep saying bunny made a little nod backing away familiar ground itll never be pictures he said but maybe the new radio were not in the radio business no the hotel business its about turning over rooms bunny said spreading his arm to take in the lot outside every time one of those stages is empty were losing money sams going to wrap next week stage seven he said including pilcer then were dark two weeks until greg does the interiors on abilene move river house from five lasner said they havent built the porch set yet then youve got five for a longer shoot harry you wanted six weeks right ben listened interested the whole scheduling meeting already worked out in their heads we can yes bunny said to sol but the point is youre going to have some off weeks so why not use the room not waste it bunny were not just talking square feet here he looked again at the television the moneys not there yet he said flatly as if hed just run through the expense sheet no not yet and i should set up a new second unit lasner said to pilcer i think he enjoys it giving me grief he turned to bunny you got something though with the silver bullet s what the hell get one of these for rex he can watch himself all day fees right not sales just another exhibitor fees bunny said a handshake he keeps an eye out for you sol pilcer said bunny dipped his head to pilcer selfdeprecating like a courtier in one of his boy prince films sol smiled touching bunnys shoulder who else could squeeze another nickel out of rex christ all right shall we start bunny said pulling out some papers with time graphs were looking at a twoweek overrun on river house and thats before the retakes so were going to have to move things around abilene were still okay nobody ever lost money on a western lasner said about to take a seat what the hells that they all looked toward the window lasner went over following the shouting coming from below on gower street the pickets had swarmed around a car trying to go through the gate yelling a few of them banging on the fender what the hell why so many today pilcer said joining him everyone else following change of tactics one of the producers said what i heard he said when they all looked at him pick one or two studios to make a point instead of spreading themselves thin so they pick us lasner said and warners theyve got a whole army out on olive i heard he said when they looked again were the pick in town one gate paramount youd need three times the people below the studio police had rushed out and were now pushing people away from the car with clubs just night watchmen bunny had said i thought this wasnt supposed to happen lasner said to bunny with our people no you cant pay off two sides sol the car had begun to move but now the strikers were squaring off against the studio cops shouting in their faces still a ritual not an actual fight theres that fuck stein a producer said ben followed the pointing finger howard was near the edge of the crowd apparently trying to quiet things down as he made his way through a technician heading for the gate was stopped by picketers then surrounded by studio police pushing the strikers away one shoved back grabbing the cop who raised his stick two other pickets rushed over and the cop alarmed stuck the club into the strikers chest to hold him off the striker taking it as an attack swung at the cop and then in an instant like a fire catching everyone seemed to be shoving pushing chests the line breaking up people spilling into each other bunny picked up the phone and dialed an extension carl get the police ask for healy tell him weve got a street fight here and tell charlie to keep his men out of there away from the gate the shouting was now a roar and ben felt his neck stiffen a startled animals reaction violence was always sudden a fistfight in a cellar bar drunk gis smashing bottles jeeps pulling up white helmets and billy clubs combat the same adrenaline fear your whole body flushed with it everything happening fast it was nothing like the movies no soundeffect punches choreographed swings clumsy pulling at shirts gouging falling down like the studio cop below covering his face to ward off a kick ben saw howard stein still trying to pull people away putting out a brush fire jesus christ lasner said but quietly his face pale eyes fixed on gower street then ben saw hal trying to skirt around the crowd to reach the gate strikers swerved around to block his way the crowd now moving by instinct more shouts grabbing him as he tried to rush in the studio police shrinking back someone landed a punch maybe unintentional and hal swung back drawing the others on him a lucky hit to the face suddenly a spurt of blood so startling that everything stopped for a second a freeze before crossing the line then a blur of rushing hands ben looked down the street a siren wailing squad cars not one a stream of them like mps with clubs now there wouldnt be any sides just bodies in the way he ran out of the conference room clumping down the stairs and tearing through the gate a small group of studio workers had clustered behind it watching help me get hal he shouted at one of them but didnt wait pushing his way into the crowd what the fuck do you want the cops are coming get out of here everybody yeah friends of yours he kept going hal and the striker were now in a kind of wrestling lock too close to get any punches in pounding each others back get the fuck out the striker said as ben tried to separate them let go the cops are coming want to get your head cracked hal stepped away the opening the picket had been waiting for a quick jab to the face hals nose running blood then another punch as hal held his hand to his nose stunned and reeling now you stupid fuck ben yelled jumping on the picket hitting him hard enough to knock him down then dropping to his chest another hard punch so that the striker turned on his side cowering trying to cover his head ben pushed himself up and grabbed hal by the shoulders herding him toward the gate his hand throbbing a studio cop stopped hal with his stick anyone bleeding now suspect and hal swung back at him the cop weaved clutching hals shirt until hal managed to pry him loose flinging his arms away a flashbulb went off somewhere to the side the cop fell taking one of the strikers down with him but people had begun pulling away looking toward the sirens the street jumping with sound ben got hal through the gate call the infirmary he said to carl hes not going to be the only one he pulled hal over to a low wall sitting him down and handed him a handkerchief to wipe the blood hows the nose broken i dont know whats that feel like squishy my head hal said touching it son of a bitch actually kicked me a studio cop staggered in blood streaming down the side of his head one of the infirmary nurses rushing to the gate intercepted him making him sit you know the good part hal said im on their side he looked at the clotted handkerchief we never get blood right it processes too red you dizzy anything like that no the posse got there in time he looked over at ben thanks whered that come from the police were wading in with clubs swinging indiscriminately at everyone bodies in the way even the studio cops were shrinking back out of range some press had arrived trailing after the squad cars and more flashbulbs went off around the edges of the fight tomorrow the picture would be a mob out of control a breakdown not a confused spontaneous fight overwhelmed by police clubs people were falling down crawling away before they could be trampled one of the cops bent over to hit a striker again not finished drawing some blood before they began the arrests jesus christ hal lasner said his voice shaking most of the other producers had followed drawn like gawkers at a highway wreck im okay what the hell is happening lasner said not really a question looking out through the gate his face bewildered some press photographers raced past out to the left two cops had zeroed in on howard stein who had begun with his hands outstretched in a stop signal but now had thrown them on top of his head trying to wrench himself away as the cops grabbed his shirt dragging him a flashbulb a club whacked his arm another striker came to help but the police ignored him interested only in stein pummeling him now do you need help to the infirmary bunny was saying to hal our own people lasner said to himself still looking out they hit stein again this time in the head and he staggered falling as a second blow got him on the neck and ben saw that they werent going to stop a storm trooper kind of frenzy another club raised high then swung hard he glanced quickly at hal now being swabbed by a nurse and rushed through the gate again grabbing some of the others get stein theyll kill him at first no one seemed to have heard then one of them looked toward stein the swinging clubs fuck he said dragging another picket and racing over with ben they came up behind the police jabbing at them with picket sticks a quick thrust to the knee that brought one down the other swung around his club whacking ben on the arm ben lunged for his throat a surprise the cops face drawn back in a snarl then one of the pickets threw a kidney punch and the cop teetered backward falling against the strikers more men came over blocking the cops from stein ben looked down winded for a second stein was lying on the pavement a pool of blood spreading under his head danny in the police photo his body flung in the same angle or did all bodies fall that way arms awkward twisted he knelt down and felt his neck not dead but now the police would have him resisting arrest the least of it legal clubs this time help me he said to one of the pickets we have to get him out of here you shouldnt move him just fucking give me a hand he said a command lifting stein from underneath and waiting for the picket to take the other side fuck the man said grunting as he lifted howard can you walk at all we cant do deadweight not dead almost indistinct a growl just try to walk weve got you put your arm there hold on they went a few steps stein dragging then pulling himself up putting weight on his feet blood was still running from his head staining bens shoulders who called the cops stein said another mumble just keep walking theres a doctor not far stein opened his eyes squinting at the continental gate a doctor he said trying to make sense of this just inside keep moving he swiveled his head to check on the two cops still down the others not near enough to help the crowd was a blur of hand fighting some people had begun to run away yelling curses but retreating a flashbulb went off in front of them the photographer probably recognizing stein another siren reinforcements ben was straining under the weight sweaty now his shirt bloody almost there not far he said again trying to move faster before the police noticed and could cut them off at the gate the crowd of employees were still watching looking dazed a battle scene on gower street casualties real blood ben realized then that they were looking at him wet with it but hed made it to carls booth you cant bring him in here bunny said do you know who that is so what hes hurt stein opened his eyes again looking at bunny then lasner and began to smile as if they were acting out a surreal joke you have a stretcher ben said to the nurse hes heavy she hesitated uncertain waiting to be told what to do you cant be serious bunny said you want the cops to finish him off ben said hes hurt hes picketing us bunny said get the stretcher ben said to the nurse then turned to bunny look at his head you cant just leave him in the street he looked at lasner still sitting next to hal a vacant expression on his face like someone after a house fire fucking stein one of the producers said he could be dying ben said to bunny you want the papers to see continental throw him back in the street he jerked his head motioning to the photographers outside the gate how would you fix that for a moment no one said anything then lasner got up his eyes on ben get a stretcher he said to the nurse and the doc he turned to one of the studio cops tell charlie to get the men back in thats it they waited together for a few seconds an awkward silence louder than the yells and sirens behind them then lasner patted hal on the shoulder and turned to go see if anybody else needs an ambulance he said to carl before they start throwing them in the wagon he looked at bunny expressionless the cops stay off the lot the nurse was running toward them bringing two aides with a stretcher get him to cedars lasner said to her when the doc says its okay then his face drained almost vacant he started back to the admin building i suppose you know whats going to happen when our people see him bunny said to ben maybe you should switch unions or would it cost you you dont know the first thing about it i dont care ben said helping the aides lift stein onto the stretcher stein groaned eyes halfopen right leave it to me to explain make a mess and hand somebody else a mop and when the police come looking for him not exactly mr x is he they know him ben stood and went at him i saw it and i have a good memory for faces tell them anybody comes after him with cuffs ill id them the ones who clobbered him when he was down and me he touched his arm beating up soldiers im still in the army remember out of uniform not when i testify we can play it that way if you want you think this is a mess you wouldnt have a mop big enough he turned to the aides got him on two bunny watched them lift the stretcher why are you doing this he said i owe him a favor stein opened his eyes watching them both as the group moved past the admin building toward the infirmary a favor bunny said plus hes bleeding he turned id do the same for you in the infirmary the aides transferred stein to an examination table high enough to do stitches as the nurse swiped his head stanching blood stein reached out his hand grabbing bens wrist dont leave me he said ben started back in the other hospital another hand on his wrist a stopped moment youll be all right the nurse said reassuring a hand with the same urgency but it was stein not danny a different meaning not with them he said looking at bunny and one of the aides bunny rolled his eyes wonderful now im chester morris where did i put my gun youd all better scoot the doctor said while we patch him up this is going to sting we cant use anesthetics until we know whats going on in there he gestured to steins head here hold on to these he put one of steins hands on the gurney frame ben moved the other hand off his wrist ill be just outside he looked toward bunny already at the door theyre going what favor stein said his voice raspy why do you owe me a favor i figure danny owes you something a little payback payback stein said vague he should have been a better friend well stein said shrugging this off then winced at the antiseptic one more the doctor said just a sting ill be right outside ben said in the hallway a nurse was wrapping an ace bandage around a studio cops wrist while another lay on a gurney holding a pad to a cut on his forehead the aide had gone but bunny was still there smoking just outside the screen door he stepped aside as another stretcher was brought in christ scarlett down at the rail yard he said offering ben a cigarette looking for dr meade thanks ben said lighting it bunny nodded at the splotch of blood on bens shirt yours no carrying him hows the hand ben made a fist and opened it nothing broken all very boys own i must say wading in like that whod have thought he looked toward the gate the problem is it wont solve anything theyll be out there again tomorrow and now weve got this little situation here he looked back to steins room hell be out of here in an hour what situation the unions are a little prickly at the moment or hadnt you noticed nobodyll accuse you of switching sides act of mercy the papers got some pictures by the way you might want to see what theyre planning to run right he said making a mental note it wouldnt do to have charlies boys lookingwell looking unfriendly just the big boy scouts they are he drew on the cigarette god i hate this iatse all of them were supposed to be making pictures notwhatever they think theyre doing i suppose you know your new best friend in there is a red just to make things that little bit more complicated does it bunny circled around not rising to this then looked over at ben i hear youve been talking to minot where did you hear that just listening to the drums lunch at chasens hardly a secret it was just lunch what did you talk about my brother mostly your brother he worked for minot one of his legmen you know that you made the call for him can we stop this all the cat and mouse bunny said nothing for a second drawing on his cigarette all right i dont like tom and jerry much either dennis asked i called nothing earthshaking it was an easy favor to put in the piggy bank thats all for someone youd never met i didnt do it for him i wouldnt have lifted a finger for him but minot is important we need him on the consent decree so why not help himwhat tidy up bunny shrugged very scrupulous they are afraid a little of the soot would rub off i suppose but who cares so lets just say he tripped nicer for them and the family for you come to that much nicer and you keep hounding me about it he paused now ken youre not hounding him i hope he could have you for breakfast before you noticed and thats why you jump when i dont jump the studio needs him for the studio not because he has something on you thats his specialty isnt it dont be ridiculous if he does he didnt get it from danny if thats what you think i checked all he ever did was put you at a meeting as a tourist thats it well theres a comfort he doesnt have anything theres nothing to have only a meeting you scare easy how did danny know by the way who told him about it nobody told him bunny said dismissive he was there ben looked up caught off guard i thought you said you never met him i didnt we were never introduced people werent not exactly a garden party but i knew who he was and he knew you he must have and think to remember all those years just store it up here and wait till you need a little mud to throw so it wasnt macdonald bunny hesitated for a second either rattled or genuinely confused who he was at the meeting too bunny shook his head i told you nobody was introduced danny said you were with him with him bunny said wrinkling his brow acting out thinking he dropped the cigarette and started rubbing it out oh jack its been years he was in the pasternak unit over at universal an arranger he worked on some of the durbin pictures a friend just someone around who took you to meetings once i didnt knowwell we all say that now dont we anyway i didnt not really my idea of a good time where is he now no idea were talking about years he went into the army did he i didnt know he looked up how did you oh brother tell all what else did he say nothing just the one meeting then whats this all about a loose end i just wanted to know a loose end of what you want to hound him too sorry to disappoint i dont have the faintest i expect if the army got him hes probably dead not much of a fighter he paused checking himself you dont want to get mixed up with minot they dont fight like this he said waving at bens shirt you wont even see it coming i dont want continental involved in any of his he stopped again not one person on this lot i dont work for him im not danny he looked at ben then backed off better get a shirt from wardrobe before you start scaring people ill see whats happening outside i suppose theyre arresting people he sighed but they wont stay arrested he started to move off then stopped how much does she know about all this i mean married to him ben shook his head youd want to keep this to yourself then not clutter things up he tapped a finger against his temple you dont want anything here now but the part before ben could answer the doctor came through the screen door is he going to be all right ben said the doctor nodded just a little agitated about being on the lot while were so tickled pink bunny said so to speak ill go in ben said stein his head now bandaged opened his eyes when ben approached the bed well get you to a hospital just take it easy this wasnt supposed to happen now theyll say we started it probably stein grimaced so thanks for ben nodded cutting him off well get you an ambulance you know with your brother that was all right a lot of people lose interest ben said nothing confused for a minute until he realized stein meant the union i dont want you to thinkhe wasnt a friend people lose touch thats all after stein was taken away ben stopped by the cutting room to check on hal already back splicing film as if nothing very much had happened but something had the lot had a hospital quiet and even though the police had now cleared the street people kept looking toward the gate an accident after the tow truck had pulled away on gower hal said lasnerits like somebody knocked the wind out of him nobodys had a raise since wage controls he had to expect its not the money its his studio he knows everybodys name r osemary was in postproduction recording the red light on why did he have to know to salvage one piece of decent behavior find one line danny hadnt crossed after crossing all the others when she came out on break she was in street clothes her skin pale not made up for the camera i heard you got beat up she said noticing the cut on his forehead you should see the other guy he smiled cheap line hows it going i thought you wrapped dubbing they want to sneak it and the sounds still not finished i need to ask you something i hope you dont mind about daniel yes well about you me did you ever tell him about pine hill when you were with him i mean did you ever mention it she stared at him clearly thrown you have a great way of coming up from behind she said finally sorry i didnt mean sure you did did you talk about it no she took out a cigarette and let him light it for her why did he no he said a relief audible only to him how do you know about it then i read something it said youd been there as a kid i wondered if he knew why am i supposed to be ashamed of it eight years old read something where ben shrugged or are we going to is that what this is a shakedown rosemary miller red diaper baby she moved her hand through the air a headline no she looked at him sharply i always knew somebody would someday you never see it coming though do you its not coming now this is just between us you think im afraid of this there are pictures me and aaron silber who later went on towho knows his father was a button supplier hes probably running that now anyway were on a raft in the lake cute they ran it in the daily worker my parents still have a copy if thats what youre after im not after anything no just curious want to know what it was like nice we had a lake campfires no running water in the bunks but that was all right everything looks good when youre eight eight she looked directly at him a child who didnt know it was any different from the other places in the mountains i felt lucky to go the classes with the lessons only one a day and who listened in class anyway not with aaron silber around shows too i was on the stage my parents came up for it they thought it was wonderful they thought the whole thing was wonderful what the future would be like one big pine hill she looked down her voice lower maybe i would have thought so too if id had that life you see these fingers she held up her index and middle fingers my mother has no feeling in them ever operate a sewing machine she held her hands in front of her mimicking pushing material toward a bobbing needle sometimes it slips you get your fingers caught under the needle it hurts not like a saw or anything you dont lose them but after a while it happens enough it kills the nerves so you lose feeling my father with him its the cough from the fabrics the dust it gets in your lungs you never get it out just keep coughing so maybe they were right what they thought if you have that life she looked up at him but i dont i have this life but theres always somebody looking to dump you right back isnt there im not what did they do anyway that was so wrong send me to camp im supposed to apologize for that no stop he said raising his hand a little theyre my parents he raised it higher a halt my father was a communist rosemary he looked at her so was danny what her head tilted as if it had been literally jarred hit by something he never said no she said still off balance i thought he might have talked about it thats all thats the only reason i asked he trailed off letting them both take a breath im not trying to never he never said anything like that she said her voice vague groping its true he was in germany then he changed thats what im trying to understand what made him change but all this time she said moving her body restless unsettled she dropped the cigarette with a willed half smile what my parents always wanted a boy fromwell but not married she shook her head a physical clearing out but how could it be true he wasnt like them he wasnt even interested it was a while ago he was younger my parents never changed every time my father read the paperbut not daniel not even that what was in the paper or maybe he just never talked about it with me anything he cared about not with the girlfriend it wasnt like that oh you know that too what he was thinking tell me i dont understand any of it why would he ill tell you this if he never asked you it means he cared about you i dont understand that either he was protecting you she looked at him quizzically then smiled to herself protecting me it sounds better anyway or maybe you like making him look good whats next maybe he was in love with me too maybe he was she glanced up her eyes suddenly moist but her voice still edged well thats something to hold on to riordan called late in the afternoon while ben was drafting the last of the voiceovers youre going to love this what john macdonald you found him army records once youre in hes alive wounded discharged fortyfour he said reading from notes va hospital over by sepulveda until may then you follow the disability checks they thought he was dead because they started coming back for a while then the change of address came through so where is he riordan paused a delivery line care of continental pictures what but thats not the part youre going to love ben waited previous address riordan said teasing him with it cherokee arms ben sat for a minute afterward his mind racing then reached for the studio directory no macdonald but had he really expected to find him there the mailroom was in the basement of the admin building filled with sorting boxes and the deep canvas bins for fan mail hundreds of envelopes waiting to hear back from dick marshall with his own signature on the photograph one of the mail boys pushed an empty cart through the door help you im trying to find somebody hes not in the directory but he gets mail here so where does it go you have a list or something like that macdonald sure give me a sec he went over to a clipboard hanging beneath the rows of pigeonholes and started flipping pages an eternity of minutes everything in slow motion or maybe it was just that ben already knew what he would say that goes to mr jenkinss office joel had only been working at the cherokee since winter and had never heard of macdonald but the name was there on the rent rolls a few months and then gone no forwarding address danny hadnt taken c until later so there was nothing to connect them but coincidence and dannys source entry in minots file familiar and now bunny collecting his checks but what did he do with them bunny got to the studio a little after the first makeup call and usually stayed late to watch the dailies he took scripts home to an apartment on ivar handy to the studio and seemed to have no personal life at all according to his calendar he spent sundays making the rounds of tennis parties and open houses and since he organized most of the lasner dinners there were frequent entries for summit drive but otherwise the schedule was a long list of business appointments and business in disguise a premiere a night at perinos with an agent a producers birthday he was invited to cukors for dinner about once a month and appeared to have standing dates with marion davies and billy haines presumably old friends he never saw jack macdonald ben had actually followed him home a few nights stopping short of his building but bunny had stayed in the reading lamp burning in the corner window a working hollywood life none of the samba bands and white furs that twinkled in pollys column every morning at the studio ben began staying closer to him spending more time at admin stein had pulled his pickets which bunny assumed was a favor to ben and a quiet gower street was worth an uneasy truce he even included ben in the sneakpreview car usually restricted to the line producer always glendale lasner said its anywhere this hour its going to be kids we want kids bunny said with all the wiseass response cards go on the boulevard later you get the swing shift its a better crowd that was during the war sol theyre not staying open late anymore they liked everything lasner said stubbornly the glendale audience as young as predicted seemed to like it well enough there was the usual surprise when the unannounced movie came on but no groans or jokey demands for the regular feature and they clapped at rosemarys name in the credits a good sign the continental group sitting in the back had already seen the picture so they watched the audience instead a kind of seismic reading alert to rustlings and murmurs and pockets of quiet on the screen sequined women were dancing in a nightclub the set of the wrap party but ben drifted more interested in the men around him seriously at work one of whom had lied to him a name he hadnt heard in years whose mail came to his office it would be useless to ask him why hed already ducked once another question would be a warning drive him further away ben looked down the row bunny sat slumped in his viewing posture hands tipped the bald patch on top of his head gleaming slightly how many pictures had he seen half a lifetime sitting in the dark it was hard to imagine him anywhere else not on a balcony at the cherokee ben tried to run the scene in his head bunny in one of his soft sport jackets the fawn eyes narrowing as he pushedbut it kept slipping away impossible besides hed been home when dennis called hadnt he a fixer fixing something else now only half the audience bothered to fill out the comment cards but lasner ignored these anyway scanning faces as they came out during the break before the regular feature he stood near the balcony stairs in his suit watching the lobby not looking directly at anybody just taking in the air the publicity assistants whod been collecting the cards were sorting them in stacks and handing a few to bunny al shulman the producer had already gone outside to smoke unable to stand still theyre okay bunny said in the car riffling through the cards just okay lasner said itll do business with okay a million seven hundred eight lasner said and thats with south america eight we can recut shulman said theres nothing wrong with the picture lasner said harry did a good job whats to recut rosemary bunny said they like her he held up one of the cards women too they just could like her more she needs this picture sol its time he turned to shulman can you soften the bar scene maybe cut to her when he leaves how it hits her sure from the two shot take a day ben looked at bunny hunched forward calculating ready to do what had to be done another scene this one easier to imagine releasing a hand brake letting gravity do the work a quick fix but why lasner said nothing looking out the car window and after a while his silence became a noise of its own something audible underneath the talk around him ben thought of him looking down at the fighting on gower street distant thinking something through its too late to change the dress bunny was saying anyway it looks great you wanted soft her face not the dress well keep the heat on the trades they dont like to back awaythe early word was good even paulette had said so flocking around rosemary with the others her moment lasner turned to bunny what did they say he nodded to the cards the ones that werent okay bunny met his eyes then picked up one of the cards didnt i see this last year but i liked dana andrews yes id recommend then another usual hard to believe junk he looked up one of the kids this one says the pictures okay but why not in color he looked at lasner ive seen worse sol itll do business lasner said nothing then went back to the window the car was through the pass now heading west on fountain you feel it in the lobby we didnt have the audience he said still looking out we used to have the audience the rest of the trip back was dispiriting shulman worried everyone staring at the halflit billboards a funeral quiet bunny had tried putting a pragmatic good face on things seven or eight even with south america was respectable and nobody had been expecting going my way but theyd been hoping for something more when he got back to the cherokee ben walked down to hollywood boulevard to get a sandwich at the rexall still brooding he looked at his reflection in the glare of one of the storefronts a disembodied image as if he were not actually there invisible to the people passing behind him why couldnt danny another shade now appear in the glass beside him tell him what had happened or just talk tell one of his jokes at the lunch counter while dishes and coffee cups slammed around him he took the family picture out of his wallet all of them together in the tiergarten his mother in the cloche hat danny grinning him smiling held next to each other by otto one hand on each shoulder how could they have changed so much he looked at his father holding his boys tight against his coat not putting them at risk his mother leaning against him eyes laughing before the bitterness and danny mischievous and daring who got him into trouble but protected him too who never told on him gave him away partners in crime none of them the same but they had been like that once maybe you always carried it with you what you used to be danny hadnt told on rosemary then why the others put yourself in his place but he couldnt he was still the boy in the picture too wanting to be his brother before they changed the night clerk barely looked up when ben got back fixed instead on the crossword he was filling in his voice lazy almost a drawl any luck finding that mail key management was asking no theyll charge you get another one made dont bother then im not expecting any mail officially that would still go through the apo sent on by fort roach but who would write now that danny was gone youve got some in there now ben looked at his box the seethrough holes backed white with an open piece of paper another current resident flyer itll keep you have to turn one in when you leave so youll still have the charge maybe i wont leave the clerk didnt rise to this his hand still moving across the puzzle ill order it he said indifferently heres a message he reached over to a box and handed ben a slip liesl out tonight talk tomorrow another evening with dick the perfect gentleman and then sleep because the camera sees everything but shed called hoping to catch him in he felt a warm stirring on his skin just from a message slip upstairs he poured a drink of the brandy and sat up on the bed with one of dannys scripts the partners were foiling a blackmail scheme the victim someone rosemary might have played was a woman with a past who was about to marry into society danny was coming to her rescue flirting and ben was doggedly following leads he smiled to himself there was some business with post office boxes maybe the lost key downstairs put to use hereand a confrontation in a gambling club danny and the blackmailer play cards you give yourself away what danny used to say when they played cards bens eyes apparently acting like mirrors into his hand but unlike ben the blackmailer wasnt intimidated he tosses a chip youre wasting your money thats all right with me i own the place but dont waste your time too you work for her what have you got be a friend to the house youll come out ahead ben sat up straighter hearing minots voice he flipped back even the physical description fit an athletes swagger would he have recognized himself was this how danny saw him a blackmailer but why risk offending him an actor might read it differently but the likeness underneath would be unmistakable if you saw yourself that way and of course minot didnt what else ben kept reading looking for anything real the stray detail that might lead somehow to the balcony outside but partners ran to formula after a few kisses danny sends the girl back to her rich suitorbetter for her and better for the series the blackmailer goes to jail danny remains uncompromised the brothers drive off together everything that didnt happen ben closed the script but the way hed wanted it to happen that was something at least wasnt it he got up restless shed be home now before the second set started at the grove talk tomorrow but there was still tonight a drink by the pool his hand idling on her leg no files with coded sources scripts with minot just the soft air afterward when she slept hed lie next to her the scent of her still on him the driveway was empty should he wait but maybe the car had already been put in the garage tucked away for the night there was a faint light coming from around back and he got out and followed it the way riordans man had come slipping through the french windows to look for a name he heard her before he reached the corner of the house still awake an easy murmur leaving part of it behind in her throat now a laugh louder maybe reading something by the pool he should call out not startle her coming out of the dark he turned the corner and stopped she was kneeling on the chaise someone beneath her lowering her face to his another murmur playful the light catching her bare back now naked moving gently like pool water ben felt his stomach clench punched in her hair came up again white shoulders he stared unable to move step away now he took in the rest the robes lying on the ground the wine on the table the blue light coming from the pool she dipped her head again then raised it her face visible over the back of the chaise his breath was coming back a little blood rushing to his head in a second his face would be flush with it surprise replaced by something else she arched her neck back and her face came up eyes closed then opening then locked on his for a second there seemed to be no sound at all no gasp not even crickets they looked at each other too shaken to react then her eyes moved one thought chasing another and she reached for her robe her breasts showing she said something to the man in the chaise as she put it on presumably an excuse improvised keeping him there as she got up to go into the house any excuse moving steadily not alarmed not seeing anybody standing by the house an arm dropped over the side of the chaise and picked up cigarettes then a head leaned down lighting one dick marshall liesl stood between him and ben but dick wasnt looking he lay back on the chaise a bare arm flung out the rest of him would be naked too waiting for her liesl started across the patio belting the robe her eyes on ben again a flicker of panic he turned away heading back to the driveway wait she said a whisper no louder than a hiss then she was past the patio following him down the flagstone steps out of earshot wait she said again ben turned his body still tingling everything mixed up i guess i should have called he said his voice neutral its not what you think she said no longer whispering but soft conspiratorial what is it then it doesnt mean anything he looked at her for a second does he know that i didnt she stared back biting her lip dont silence again the air churning any words likely to wound talk to me she said finally he kept looking at her not speaking things still shifting inside falling youd better get back he said turning to the car she reached out and they both looked down at her hand on his arm something out of place she pulled it back the movement opening the top of her robe so that she had to clutch the lapel covering herself did you swim first he said nodding to the robe her eyes flashed then looked away youve no right i guess not what was it just one of those things no she said quietly you know that getting back at him something like that dont be not that i didnt enjoy it just next time let me in on it we cant talk now youre so he waited so what i dont know angry ah he said exhaling it she looked down how could we go on like that him always there instead of like this he said motioning toward the pool it doesnt mean anything she said again it does to me we have to talk later now its he shook his head you dont owe me an explanation lets justnot he turned to go its nothing she said her head down you must have had a good laugh me being so she leaned forward her head close to his chest no i wasnt laughing he could feel the robe near him aware of her he stepped back you better go finish him off before he starts playing with himself you should have him about halfway there by now if i remember it right she looked up her eyes suddenly filling stung go to hell he took out his car keys flipping them about to say something more but instead just nodded and held one up a kind of wave and got into the car he turned his head backing out not wanting to see her standing there in her robe a goodbye glimpse in a few minutes twisting down he was out of the hills he stopped for a red light and sat staring out jumpy afraid for a second he might be sick the light changed then went red again unnoticed no one behind him to make him move staring no longer queasy his mind blank when he finally turned onto hollywood boulevard the rexall the theaters all of it was still lit up as if nothing had happened but he felt that if he got out and walked by the plate glass windows again his reflection wouldnt be there that his heart was still beating but the rest of him had disappeared sam pilcer invited most of the studio to his sons bar mitzvah the list had begun modestly just the commissary head table but then he felt he had to include people in his unit and after that it became impossible to draw the line people would feel slighted and why leave yourself open to resentment besides it was the kind of occasion that wanted a crowd he canceled the small ballroom hed booked at the ambassador and took over the grove instead by midmorning there was already a line of cars in front of wilshire boulevard temple the lot behind was full but ben circled around and finally found a spot two blocks in on hobart the temple was byzantine inspired a scaleddown hagia sophia and the crowd gathering outside made it feel a little like one of the big movie theaters downtown ben stopped for a minute watching people being helped out of black packards and hugging each other on the sidewalk another premiere there were photographers and even the usual cluster of fringe people whod come to see stars held away from the entrance doors by ushers sam and his younger wife stood at the top of the stairs hemmed in by wellwishers women were in dressy day clothes navy set off with a diamond brooch peach silk with pearls everyone in hats and a few in fur stoles in spite of the bright autumn sun ben thought looking at the guests that all weddings and family parties were the same everyone falling into predictable place rosemary stepped out of her car all ready for the camera but the beefy middleaged man off to the side looking slightly lost was probably uncle al who ran a linen supply business in inglewood sams motherinlaw on a cane was being escorted by an older grandchildjonathan the bar mitzvah boy would already be inside looking over the hebrew passage als daughter the pretty one had brought a new man aunt rose whom nobody ever knew what to do with was beaming at a photographer happy families all alike the front office people were now arriving the lasners first then everyone else in a quick jumble so that they all reached the steps at once swarming around sol the way they had at grand central fay teetered on high heels holding on to his arm what are you walking sol said seeing ben i parked behind yourself what if people see what people ben said laughing people theres always people you should know that just saving the studio money ben said brushing it off you and who else but he dropped it tugged by fay to start up the stairs rabbi magnins doing it himself she said to him leaning in say something to esther shes thrilled lasner turned slightly to ben come sit with us he said but ben held back already imagining bunnys scowl fays appraising glances liesl was getting out of a car with dick marshall a little excitement running through the spectators dick over here almost a squeal as he waved flashing the marshall grin ben kissed liesl on both cheeks a european family greeting you look nice she smiled relieved but still tentative wardrobe i think from the wehrmacht she said touching one of the padded shoulders you know dick but dick was flashing the grin again for one of the photographers save me a dance later what she said slightly thrown not sure if it was a doubleentendre at the grove sam hired the band too oh yes that would be nice letting her eyes stay on him talking more car doors were slamming voices getting louder rising like heat waves better get inside theres polly he said spying her farther down the row of cars no were supposed to talk to her dick seeing her put his arm around liesl hey he said to ben drawing a blank liesl put on a public smile and started to turn have fun ben said sliding away heading for the stairs so glad you could come pilcer said as they shook hands you know esther congratulations you must be proud ask me after she said pleasantly its still touch and go with the hebrew itll be fine he said a meaningless reassurance but wasnt it always how many had he seenstruggling through their readings rabbis at their sides but always ending with elated grins he remembered a whole season of them the year danny was thirteen dreading the boredom of the service all of it alien to them who werent being instructed who werent in their friends eyes even jews otto had been indifferent and their mother gentile so theyd escaped the hebrew lessons the tedious weeks of preparation the services themselves were exotic a series of risings and sitting downs and words repeated phonetically just to go along most of the boys used the synagogue in fasanenstrasse and afterward there would be a formal lunch across the street at the kempinski all good manners and politely smiling grownups years later after they had left it had been torched on kristallnacht now there was nothing a few shelllike walls hes reading from esther sam was saying for his mother its a nice touch dont you think what did you read ill bet you dont even remember ben shook his head i didnt my father wasnt observant like sam esther said nodding to him a lot of work and who remembers but i think its important now i mean she faltered a little embarrassed you know after yes ben said helping her of course you would sam said you know what hes making at the studio but someone had taken his elbow abe wonderful to see you esther you remember abe lastfogel the morris office congratulations again ben said to esther letting her go hell be fine its just you know its important to have a sense now she said still making a case to herself yes ben said moving inside but was it had it mattered before even mischling s had been taken one parent people whod had no teaching at all he picked up a yarmulke from a pile on a sideboard inside through the marble arches people were settling in waving to friends the hum before a show all religion was a kind of theater he smiled to himself as he walked in at least here they knew their audience the whole vaulted ceiling a night sky was covered with stars he sat with hal jasper behind the lasners close enough to be in the party without taking anyones place bunny whod also put on a yarmulke was next to fay and took his cues from her rising when she did mumbling during the unison response rabbi magnin in wirerimmed glasses led the shabbat service in one of those pleasedwithitself oratorical voices ben remembered from his childhood jonathan sat waiting on the bema dwarfed in a chair that made him look no older than eight all of it just as expected in a few minutes theyd open the ark and walk the torah through the congregation letting people reach out to touch it then finally open it for jonathan to read and then theyd all go to the ambassador fasanenstrasse otto hadnt believed in any of it only allowed them to go because it would have been impolite to refuse the invitations drehkopf s he called the rabbis head spinners a hostility that ben had never really understood until now no room for two religions but he would have been killed for either as a communist genia had said not as a jew but that had only been a matter of time ben looked around all these welldressed lucky people faintly bored waiting to congratulate sam and go to lunch it could have been any of them except theyd been here out of the way and otto had stayed he shifted in his seat uncomfortable it always came back to that why make danny run the same risk they knew what would happen if they were caught what did happen at least to otto denounced and now his denouncer gone connected somehow to danny the link he couldnt understand but must be there could otto really have believed in it that much when he didnt believe in anything else or did he know somehow sense that hed left it too late that he could only help save the others now before he became one of the millions no matter what he believed somebody ben had seen standing on the platform and then never saw again on the bema magnin had finished and the cantor got up and walked to the lectern another endless wail ben thought another thing hed hated about the services he looked at bunny wondering how he was reacting one of the few there for whom this wouldnt even be a memory the yarmulke just a prop of respect thinking about the studio maybe or how pollys talk had gone with liesl a hundred things how to protect jack macdonald the first note high and clear wavered in the air dropped then rose again a call reaching out ben felt his head go up as if the note were lifting it a second phrase without a breath lonely the voice its own music but so beautiful that it filled the great room hushing it it hung there for a minute a pure abstraction and then the imagination rushed in around it adding color and suggestion as the music began to float a haunting stream of notes a few heads nodded familiar with it but ben couldnt move a sadness so knowing that it felt like an actual fingertip on his heart not a wail not even a lamentation but an endless sorrow he imagined it vibrating through thin air over bleached rocks stretches of dry waste desert music meant to carry long distances across emptiness had it really been written there a tribal heirloom or much later in some polish village the desert by then more a story than a memory there were notes in gershwin like this bent midway in a kind of ache he didnt know the wordsit might have been a simple hymn of praisebut what he saw were figures wrapping a body in linen laying it into a shallow ditch rocks and sand and the body he knew was otto the day the temple had triggered the memories all the old questions there hadnt been a service for him no details of the death itself so that it seemed not to have really happened the official letter a kind of missing persons report but now here he was in the music everything hed denied being the string that connected ben to this room of survivors not lessons but blood the music might have meant anything but in the stillness of the room he saw that it now meant everyone who had gone it was important to have a sense esther had thought he noticed that lasner had lowered his head a tear running down his cheek overwhelmed by some loss of his own or perhaps a sign of age easily moved ben remembered him at the camp actually sobbing the first thing ben had liked about him who was it now the same vast number a lost father how long before a blood tie finally dissolved never he was still ottos son after everything danny even more so ben sat up even more so otto wasnt someone he would ever deny no matter how much his politics had changed otto had died for his you didnt honor the memory of that by feeding gossip to a minot he wouldnt have done it but there were the files hal leaned toward his ear this is it he said softly the music for the pan shot for a moment ben was confused still lost in his own thoughts he needed to think it through about otto and danny but the music was moving on and he began to move with it like a wind out of the desert across the steppes to a stretch of cold flat land he knew the shot hal meant taken high from on top of the cab of an army truck panning slowly left to right over the endless reach of the camp and as he listened he saw the finished film the plain mournful sound passing over the miles of barracks a perfect match as if the writer of the song from its first clear note had known all along it would end this way when the cantor finished there was a stillness fay put her hand over sols bringing him back the tear discreetly brushed away then another piece of music began the ark was opened and everything went on you know what its called hal whispered ben shook his head and hal made a note to himself jotting something on the program you think we could get him he nodded to the cantor ben didnt bother to answer did anyone ever say no but the mood was broken the haunting music of the dead now just sound to be scored used but isnt that why they were making the film for them make it the last shot he said use it at the end jonathan read well his young boys voice surprisingly clear and precise pitched to his family in the first row esther looked side to side pleased but sam kept his eyes on the bema his face soft with unguarded affection around them people were nodding one of them patting sam on the arm a few rows behind liesl was following with polite attention her blond hair hanging back grazing her shoulders another mischling was the hair from hans the mother another dark sara she turned meeting his gaze then looked down a smile forming at the corners of her mouth and ben realized she had misinterpreted when she looked back again just a moment between them she was answering something else not what had been in his mind at all and he felt his face answer her another layer it could go on this way he thought one response building on the next all begun with a mistake maybe thats how we all talked not knowing each other a verbal house of cards they were seated at lunch with studio people away from the family table down front the cocoanut grove was usually lit softly to suggest evening and the bright daylights now made the prop palms look slightly tawdry like an island beach that unexpectedly turns out to be littered the band had already been playing when they arrived and the floor beyond the moorish arches had been kept clear for dancing just a few extra tables laid along the side waiters had held out trays of drinks as they arrived a little early in the day dont you think dick marshall said taking one not for champagne liesl said they were playing a couple moving through the room together only a few people were actually sitting down after they found their place cards they circled the room seeing everybody how long is this going to last rosemary said to ben you have to stay for the speeches after that all day then they had reached the buffet table of canapes elaborately laid out with ice sculpture centerpieces they sneaked the picture she said suddenly you were there the cards were good so why is al so nervous level with me they liked it they didnt love it she flinched a little a jab to the stomach they liked you it wasnt you and thatll make a difference nobodys saying nobodys saying anything thats the trouble you think i dont know how to read the tea leaves youre overreacting you think so she touched her forehead you know what that is what they call it in the theater flop sweat in a refrigerator like this do they always keep it so cold its like a banana boat coconuts he said smiling looking up at the trees then back at her dont worry its one sneak kids in glendale you havent been here very long have you dont worry how you stop worrying youre dead i just meant i know what you meant my option gets picked up in january so we have to talk now and all theyre thinking about is the kids in glendale youre the biggest star on the lot after dick and nobodys hiring ben hecht to do rewrites for me she looked across the room to where liesl was standing with marshall one week so one week they just shot ours every lousy line for her hecht she stopped lowering her head theyre rushing her picture shes all theyre thinking about now funny isnt it that its her after everything the early cocktail hour went on but the waiters had begun to put out the fruit cups so people slowly gravitated to the tables it was then that the bandleader announced a special treat and introduced julie sherman she was dressed modestly a blue jersey with a big pin but the dress was formfitting clinging and folding showing her off ben thought of her on the train drawing eyes but shed done the voiceover in a day professional and the surprise now was that she was good one of those performers who comes alive with music warm and easy comfortable with herself they were doing let me off uptown and while she wasnt as throaty as anita oday she had the same swinging assurance fronting the band too distinctive to be background a few people turned to look as they made their way to the tables bunny not expecting this was watching her carefully evaluating the up tempo seemed designed to move people to their seats and the band kept it up with riding high the bright porter lyrics an even better showcase for her voice do you believe this lasner said annoyed hed been coming back from the mens room and stopped midway next to ben he has her at his kids bar mitzvah a piece hes banging what the hell is he thinking whats esther supposed to think but esther oblivious seemed happy the entertainment just another benefit of being a studio wife she knows its the idea of it wheres the sense anyway who has a bar mitzvah in a nightclub he flung his arm to take in the room downstairs in the temple some cakes coffee maybe lunch somewhere after no thats not enough he has to have a floor show with her yet its a question of respect a nightclub he looked around the oasis room you know where they got the palms the sheik off the set it was valentinos idea well that was a while ago maybe theyre not the same ones anymore who knows here he brings his kid you know we go back sam he was an extra in the gulch waiting around i pick him one day and he tells me the pictures a piece of shit oh yeah so what would you do and he tells me and you know what hes right so i give him a shot fix it and well do some business thats twentyfive thirty years now he never lost me a nickel not once still all this you want to chase something all right but you dont bring it home there was applause as julie finished followed by a dinner gong one of those handheld xylophones they used on ships lets see where she goes lasner said his eyes following her off the stage shes going to sit with the family no so at least hes not that crazy look at esther shes thanking her like shes the help he shook his head and turned to ben hal tells me youre almost finished with the picture almost so we should talk sometime what youre going to do next thats up to the army dont be a schmuck i talked to arnold theyre doing the papers maybe a week two ben nodded a thankyou my only question is are you tough enough for this business how tough do you have to be lasner smiled pleased with this then put a finger on bens chest well talk theres fay go keep an eye on your sister dicks all over her hes supposed to be thats the idea it builds her for the picture yeah i know all about that i still say somebody tell dick hes gods gifthe likes to be reminded any chance he gets i know im the one had to pay off the paternity suit so keep an eye he tapped bens chest again i tell bunny these things get out of hand youve got a mess to deal with but he doesnt listen like he knows dames always think its real besides shes supposed to be fresh right off the boat not another chippie look at that he nodded to the table where dick had put his arm around liesl theyre talking to polly its for her five bucks its for him too ben joined them after polly had gone sitting between liesl and julie dick still drawing a blank as they were introduced again wine was served with lunch but instead of feeling logy he was more alert than before lasners bet planted in his head now watching dick touch her all the usual little moves claiming territory she smiled back at him a public smile but ben suddenly saw them on pillows talking lazily about nothing smoking he turned his head cutting away from it julie whod been talking to hal turned at the same time that was terrific before he said youre nice no you were good you should do a musical from your lips she said laughing rolling her eyes upward mr pilcers trying to fix something at continental i know no musicals but maybe a first time if he can get mr lasner to go for it ben looked at her lips glistening her pretty face still young going places did she really believe this but thats probably not going to happen she said sensible after all i mean the studios not really set up for musicals at foxi was there for about five minutesthey had a whole building all these rooms with pianos arrangers voice coaches you know the whole thing maybe i should have done a party like this sang for zanuck anyway now im here where they dont do musicals but heres the thinga loanout mr pilcer knows people at metro he can get a test over to the freed unit you never know it could happen that way her voice had got faster a little breathy that would be my dream said plainly too important for irony ben smiled at her trying not to look dismayed the hunger that moved everything here did liesl feel it now too pretending not to care a european reserve but there every day at dawn maybe like julie doing whatever it took i hope it works out he said blandly what else did one say something will mr pilcers helped lots of people she said looking at him directly without embarrassment sam and esther had got up to dance a signal to everyone else and now liesl and dick followed as much an attraction as julie had been on the bandstand wardrobe had done a good job beneath the military padded shoulders her dress was soft and flowing swaying against her long legs dick held her in the small of her back just close enough to brush against her but far enough away to talk about what evening after evening when sam made a welcoming toast during the first course esther at his side ben glanced at julie curious to see her reaction but her face gave nothing away a polite guest he looked around the rest of the table imagining for a minute all the invisible ties between them and it occurred to him that julie might be the only one who knew exactly where she stood not measuring love somebody elses real feelings not even wondering mr pilcer helped people a simple transaction but was it ever what did she feel when she saw him beaming with jonathan and esther people came with strings attached when you touched someones skin you always touched something else he looked at liesl who was skittish aware of him aware of dick and he thought of that first night how easy it had been unplanned not calculated not for a chance at a song just because it happened dick was standing now and leading the woman on his right to the dance floor careful with that al shulman said joking apparently his wife back in one piece dick said pleasantly stop staring at him liesl said in a low voice even though they were alone hell think youre angry with him something why would i be when everybodys so happy do you think im enjoying this i didnt make up the tables come and dance no kanon joseph stardust for old times sake he looked at her otherwise al shulmanll think he has to come on before he gets up on the dance floor only halfcrowded he put his hand on her waist then moved it slowly to her back drawing her to him with the music easy to love she put her hand in his making contact their heads still far apart ive never danced with you before she said no he said feeling her we never did normal things like what go dancing meet in a cafe well that was all before the war she looked up at him i wonder if it had been you in france if id met you how different everything would have been they moved together easier his hand resting higher now on her back she came nearer lowering her head he touched the back of her neck just one finger stroking it gently can anyone see she said shivering a little no dont she said pulling away a little like dancing class she looked at him schicklich another minute just moving what do i say to you i dont know what to say you dont have to say anything we already did that and now what my father was asking about you why he never sees you anymore what did you tell him she shrugged youre busy both of us anyway hell see you tonight tonight at the observatory with dieter you forgot its tonight but youre coming yes he planned it for you all of us yes all you want me to stay home what would i say that its awkward now just to be in the same room we have to learn how to do this she looked away what a mess weve made for ourselves if wed never started this but we did he said why did we not really a question then looking at her wanting to know why did you the words hung there for a second waiting and he saw something change in her eyes a flicker of hesitation then a softening familiar the way theyd known each other before because i wanted to she said her voice low like a hook drawing him closer and you we wanted to he drew a breath remembering the dress slipping off her shoulders his mouth on her back excited both of them wanting it he felt his lower body now against hers the same not the same but still drawn in he leaned forward whispering come with me now just come she pulled her head back are you crazy she said barely audible we cant a little breathless panicky everything happening on the dance floor people around them just for a minute come outside how can go to the ladies room take the door out to the courts just for a minute her eyes were shining excited now too catching his eagerness stealing just a minute now ill tell him a minute my purse i cant go to the ladies without my purse complicit she drew him by the hand hurrying to the table before the others picking up her bag the door out to the courts down the hall he said but she had already gone both of them caught up in a rush not caring as if they were throwing off clothes dick returned with mrs shulman liesls gone to the ladies ben said casually can i bring you something from the bar when dick said no ben started across you always ran into somebody at the bar it was bound to take a while to pick up a drink minutes longer he disappeared behind the crowd and out of the grove the ambassador had courts and a pool behind the main wing country club grounds as he went through the side door he saw in a blink the studio cars grouped near the driveway their drivers smoking in the shade prepared to wait all day like coachmen in a period picture but then he saw her waiting for him there first and he took her arm without thinking pressing her against the wall and kissed her his mouth already open we cant not here she said without leaving her mouth he moved her away against the adjoining wall behind a tree jonathan has to light candles he said into her neck moving back to another kiss name all the relatives his mouth on hers again itll take hours how do you know it always does ssh an open kiss now no time for talking excited by the wet by knowing she was here wanting to he leaned closer pressing against her breasts oh she said finally breaking the kiss gulping air i hate this no you dont he said sure now nuzzling her feeling her respond not this she said moving her neck with him what she pulled her head back breathing hard i dont know what im doing i used to know what i was doing now i she looked down one minutenow look at us im not like this everybodys like this i dont mean that i dont know myself anymore i used to know she broke off but i was wrong wasnt i all those years i thought i knew and it wasnt true he leaned forward again but she put her hand up no we have to go back she took a breath calming herself then smiled tonight come tonight too many people he said his face close she moved her hand up to his cheek not after when they go to bed she said not then its what you want isnt it if you do she nodded yes she said then looked down another mess i dont know what im doing and i want to do it anyway she brought up her purse and took out a handkerchief reaching over and wiping lipstick from the corner of his mouth then stopped looking at him for a minute the door slammed open they both turned ben shielding her bunny her eyes widened her fingers clutching him but bunny was preoccupied never glancing to the side heading straight for the studio cars he didnt see ben whispered just stay still what do you think happened hes running i dont care if he looks hell just see the tree why come out this way bunny summoned one of the drivers with his fingers then jumped into the backseat its early to leave ben said as the car began to start down the driveway he turned to liesl make some excuse for me ill be back later what excuse dont say anything then theyll think i got lucky at the bar he touched her shoulder later but where he ran out from behind the trees and darted into the lot looking down the driveway to see which way bunny turned on wilshire then raced back to his car taking his keys out as he ran it took two blocks before he got bunnys car in sight hemmed in by saturday traffic headed for the department stores maybe he was going back to the studio a minor crisis to settle but they passed all the logical turnoffs for continental and after a turn on sunset ben knew they must be heading for bunnys apartment on ivar maybe hed just had enough and decided to go home ben parked at the bottom of the block as bunny got out thanked the driver and headed down into the basement garage why change cars a continental driver would take bunny anywhere he wanted to go ben waited for a few minutes watching the street empty and sunny then bunnys car appeared up out of the driveway and turned back toward sunset ben ducked when he sat up again bunnys car was already at the next corner the first blocks on ivar were tricky because there were no other cars but on sunset ben managed to put a few between them staying far enough back to avoid being seen still heading west past highland and hollywood high commercial blocks of driveins and offices with blinds ben anticipated a turning somewhere but bunny stayed on sunset past fairfax and then through the strip where dick marshall took liesl dancing i dont know what im doing but she wanted him to come and how would he explain this tracking bunny but he wouldnt have just left in the middle of lunch sam would notice there was a close moment in beverly hills at the light before the hotel when the car ahead turned and ben found himself just behind he pulled down the sun visor so that bunny would only see the bottom of his face then waited until someone had cut in before following again the streets were quieter here and they picked up some time bunny actually running one of the lights still heading west past ucla then down the hill past the belair gates this endless city where was he going in a while theyd be in the palisades one of the emigres houses on the steep slopes of the canyon why not paseo miramar they were through the village now if he didnt turn soon theyd be at the ocean ben imagined him making the hard right and climbing the cliff past feuchtwangers past the lonely turn where genias car had gone straight did macdonald live up there one of the neighbors lion hadnt met he slowed a little ready to make the turn but bunny didnt stop sailing past paseo miramar all the way to the pacific and turning north on the coast highway the sun flashing off the flat blue water ben kept following confused now they had reached the end joining the steady stream of traffic going out of town ventura who lived this far away where bunny didnt want to take a studio car ben checked his gas gaugethey could be going anywhere then suddenly bunnys turning signal started flashing just before a narrow opening in the cliffs not a major road not even signposted ben slowed watching bunny turn but then drove past impossible to miss a car behind you on that road he continued until a break in the traffic let him pull left in a uturn and double back to bunnys road what if it were a private driveway bunnys car already invisible in a garage at first there seemed to be no houses at all just tall wild grass the road switched back as it climbed the guard rail just like the one genia had crashed through a first house with two cars in front neither of them bunnys then a modern glassfronted house looking empty ben climbed again another switchback and the land leveled out a straight stretch and then a clump of trees and a huge building stucco with balconies one of the big mediterranean beach houses theyd built in the twenties this one stuck on top of the hill for the views in the white gravel forecourt there was a half circle of parked cars bunnys at the end ben hesitated for a second not sure what to do next then pulled in beside it the checks came to the studio he had to be somewhere ben got out and looked around why so many cars but he remembered iriss car at the house a city where even maids drove the morning fog had burned off and there was a breeze he walked around to the side the back of the house faced the water with balconies large enough for outdoor furniture a chaise to lie on in the salt air walking trails had been cut into the bluff he went back to the forecourt someone was coming out a girl with a sweater over a white blouseno over a white uniform with white shoes the desk is just inside if youre looking for somebody she said helping he nodded a thankyou and watched her get into her car not a private house but not really a hospital either not up this secondary road he was still standing there thinking when bunny came out and lit a cigarette he saw ben and froze neither of them moving then hurried over throwing the cigarette away what are you doing here he said his voice almost a growl are you following me you said you hadnt seen him in years but you get his checks he lived at the cherokee so did danny i have a right to know a right is he here what do you want was he there that night is that what you were really trying to fix he looked at ben his eyes flashing moving from fury to contempt his whole body tense unsettled and then he quieted a giving way and ben noticed what hed missed before the pale skin the eyes close to brimming face haunted like someone after an accident you want to see jack is that it what is this place its where he lives now come and see he said turning his voice sharp ben grabbed his arm stopping him just tell me one thing was he there that night take your hand off me bunny said a stage line haughty then he switched unexpectedly breezy almost malicious come and see inside there were more people in white coats attendants in loose pajamalike uniforms is this a hospital its a private facility for people who cant manage on their own whats wrong with him hes been coming along nicely bunny said laraine day for a second but today weve had a little setback im afraid still since youve come all this way a man holding a clipboard looked up concerned but bunny made a little hand motion that seemed to vouch for ben they walked down a hall of polished mexican tile hell be sleeping so just a look today i suppose you wanted to talk have a hearttoheart about the brother but thatll have to wait is something wrong im not trying to bunny turned what are you trying to do just in here he opened the door to a large bright room facing the sea what must have been the master bedroom in the old house it was not a hospital room there were reading chairs and tables with books and magazines a small dining area an ordinary bed but ben noticed a pull cord next to a nightstand covered with pill boxes and medicines macdonald was lying half propped up his face away from the light pouring in from the terrace his bare shoulders and the top of his chest were visible over the sheet but one of the shoulders ended in a stump the arm gone the other arm was lying out on the sheet the wrist wrapped in a white bandage this is jack bunny said what happened ben said almost a whisper he cant hear bunny said a normal voice they gave him something earlier he looked down at the bandage he gets sad sometimes oh you mean the arm a grenade they took it off over therenew guinea god knows what the place must have been like probably some tent butchers next anyway not cedars but maybe it wouldnt have made any difference it was shattered you knew he was a pianist at universal ben said quietly an arranger helpful arent they those files not just an arranger a pianist he was looking down at him now the lightest touch chopin especially like night sounds he was very gifted he touched the sleeping mans hair of course theres nothing we can do about the hand now he can use that to get around he said nodding to a corner where a prosthetic arm rested on an end table but not for the piano the face thoughtheres a surgeon at ucla whos been doing wonders with grafts so we might get that back ben now saw that the side of his face away from the window was a blotch what must be a burn scar from the same explosion he was so goodlooking he brushed the hair back again a sleeping child im sorry bunny took his hand away yes but theres no bottom to sorry is there down and down so one of us has to keep things going its justi wish he didnt get so sad sometimes there was a knock on the door then a white coat halfway through mr jenkins oh im sorry he said noticing ben no its all right please dr owen you wanted to see me its just that he glanced again at ben uneasy its just we cant take the responsibility ill take the responsibility we cant be with him all the time i know and accidents will happen he looked at the doctor but not again ill talk to him he has to be more careful thats all but mr jenkins we cant he looked to the terrace we cant be building fences on the balconies were not a ill talk to him bunny said firmly all these medicines you have to be extra careful so disorienting but thank you for everything he said coming over as if he were seeing someone out after a party the stitches it seemed like a nasty cut yes nasty mr jenkins he may need a little extra help at meals for a while you know with both arms not really there wont be any problem with that will there the doctor faced him down a moment then looked away no there shouldnt be a problem mr jenkins ill talk to him i know this will be a warning to him to be more careful yes a warning the doctor said a last shot then nodded to ben and left im sorry ben said so you said so everybody says well they would if they knew but no one does except you the grand inquisitor so let me ask you something what would you do leave him to rot in that veterans hospital everyone walking around on crutches missing this missing that bedpans and people leakingimagine living there all the time looking at who you are all those people like you sad you might as well he stopped and reached into his pocket for a cigarette is that allowed darling i dont give a shit its my nickel nickel thousands and not even a fucking ashtray all right lets go out there better for him anyway and no doubt youll want to chat now that youre here about that wonderful brother of yours he looked at the bed sometimes i think they can hear when theyre under they come to looking like they know everything they were moving out onto the balcony or maybe hell look surprised that hes here until the next time theyre right you know they shouldnt have to worry about this give the place a bad name hes right about these too he said touching the balcony wall why not just slip right over quite a drop no he had to do it that way all messy and so maybe he didnt really mean it not finally anyway if you really mean it why not jump easier yours did danny didnt jump no he tripped he said sarcastic then looked up oh jack gave him a push is that it with his good arm no doubt really even you he lived there at the cherokee for a while i thought it would be better for him but he kept running into people danny you mean mm old comrades i wasnt having that tell me please bunny looked over at him then put out the cigarette on the rail you put him there ben said i had to get him out of the hospital i couldnt face it all those boys trying to come back clomping around theyd fall sometimes and theyd have to wait for someone to pick them up you could see it in their faces what it did to them it was making him worse being there so i hired somebody to be with him found a place why didnt you bring him home home where have you been living he caught himself and looked away toward the pacific you dont know how it is do you that really wouldnt have been on sharing theres a certain standard you have to keep up here not startle the horses unless youre a set dresser something like that he turned to ben and im not so i found him a place one of the contract players used to live there who ben said thinking of the lists hed gone through does it matter the boy who played the gunner on dick marshalls bombing raid dick marshall he said partly to himself thats the war we gave them not the one in there well why not dick killing japsyoud pay to see that whod pay to see this he took a breath any way he was at the cherokee for a while and i knew about the phone there that was essential having the phone but still private not the roosevelt or something so i moved him in with robert to look after him and i think he liked it so much better than the hospital like being on your own in a way that was before the leg got better so he was still in a wheelchair but even so not assad and danny was there no that was all an accidenta meet cute robert was wheeling him doing errands i suppose just getting out and your brother waswell i dont know what he was doing actually make something uplunch at mussos who knows who cares anyway on the street and wouldnt you know longlost jack its been years what happened to youlike that robert probably thought they were old army buddies not comrades anyway it cheered jack up seeing somebody from the old days so come back and have a drink and they did a lot to catch up on so thats how danny knew about the cherokee bunny shrugged i must say it never would have occurred to me to use it for but i didnt have his imagination you saw him there no i never knew he took a place there until dennis called i guess he liked the look of it all the possibilities but he saw jack there the second time i thought thats it im getting him out of here the reunions over anyway robert really wasnt enough he couldnt be with him all the time jack needed somewhere like this where they can watch him he glanced again into the bedroom why didnt you want him to see danny i mean if they knew each other well its how isnt it i knew what your brother was doing ive done minot a favor or two myself but not like that jack left that life a long time agowell the war left it for him it was only his good nature you know always for the underdog but try to tell anybody that now hes been through a lot he doesnt need to go through anything more not one more thing you think danny was going to give him to minot a crippled war hero what for to see who else he remembers from those fuller brush parties they used to have very sinister characters they were how can we help paul robeson christ he looked up his arms gone but his memorys there no thank you he has a silver star bunny raised his eyebrows a question army records ben said bunny said nothing for a second taking this in i always underestimate you theyre not going to go after somebody with a silver star how would that make them look they dont have to play to the gallery nobody sees friendly witnesses in closed sessions im not putting him through that either im not but danny didnt do thative seen the files he wouldnt have touching your faith in him he was an informer you dont want to face that dont i had to i had someone else to think about one time howve you been fine two hes after something so i moved him what would danny have said we went to a meeting five years agobring him in theyre after more than that headlines and theyll get them but not here not from me and not from you either he said leveling his gaze not here you dont have to worry about that then what are you doing running errands for dennis im trying to find out what danny was doing thats all so im friendly just like you to get something and what was your brother trying to get ben said nothing his own question come back at him he leaned against the rail youre wrong about him though he said quietly he never gave macdonald away where he was even if hes alive theres nothing there i checked you forgethe stopped reporting he wouldnt have bunny looked at him then let it go taking out another cigarette instead and sitting on the chaise do you know how it works he said not angry a resigned patience ever been to the zoo watch them feed the big cats animals like that give them a piece of meat then another it only stops when you stop feeding them the cats just keep eating you think they cant be hungry anymore but theyll still take the meat its what they do no matter how much you give them its never enough you think you know these people i knew tenney that same hungeri dont know where it comes fromhe could never get enough but a crackpot you didnt have to take all that carryingon seriously look good in sacramento and hes satisfied but minots not a crackpot you stick your hand through the bars hed take it with the meat get out of this before it turns on you once youre part of it youre expected to supply just to prove youre with them so you throw them anything maybe even jack to stay in your brother would have done it but now jacks safe except from you i told you you dont have to worry about that i just want to be clear how unwise that would be oh i know little brian not very scary but you know who is somebody with nothing to lose and im going to lose everything i want i know it he looked back to the bedroom one of these times its going to work so all i can do is hold on till it does he looked back at ben you were never here ben held his stare thats right bunny nodded then drew on the cigarette but you were werent you so now youre part of it my confidante so what do i do tell me i dont know anymore hes going to do it again i dont know what to do give him time even here he said holding his hand to the view it takes time darling time does it get any hoarier i suppose i deserve that wallowing like this he sat up mustnt grumble as they used to say in the blitz my mother was like that mustnt grumble mustnt grumble he covered his eyes with his hand why the fuck not thats what id like to know he paused what if it works next time youd think id be enough even with all the rest youd think it would be enoughnot to want to for me but it isnt ben was quiet for a minute then moved away from the railing id better go am i embarrassing you or just me bunny said moving his hands over his cheeks a quickchange what do i say when he wakes up the last time last monday ben said trying it bunnys head jerked up how do you know that why would you you left the studio in a hurry you never leave early i figuredjust now i mean bunny stood up a willed change of mood my every move i didnt realize i was so fascinating i still dont know why what do you want exactly coming here just following a name i didnt know he looked toward the bed what all this because he knew your brother i think somebody tried to stop danny before he could rat on them i dont blame him id do it myself he raised an eyebrow or did you think that i did ben he said drawing the word out well sorry to disappoint dennis called me at home i may have picked up a phone from time to time but my activities dont extend tooh never mind think what you like you might scratch jacks name off the list though dont you think he really wouldnt have been up to it anyway he was here ask anybody he waved his hand to the house i had to be sure thats all well now you are so fuck off he looked down sorry not very nice was it what a hard case i have become he said giving it a hint of a southern accent you get that way when you stop telling yourself stories you cant change things no matter how many stories i remember standing in front of the mirror looking at my hair go just crying and crying because i knew everything was coming to an end and my face just stared right back at me there it was like it or not he turned away like it or not from the bed there was a soft rustling jacks head moving slowly still asleep bunny went over and watched for a second the side of jacks face with the purple splotch was more visible now he made a sound without opening his eyes some fragment line in a dream bunny touched his forehead ssh he said calming him ben stood in the room not moving afraid any sound would wake him watching bunnys hand stroking jacks hair when he finally turned satisfied jack was still asleep his eyes were squinting in pain oh go ahead and look he said then glanced back at the bed he was a hero did you know a real war hero he saved someones life from that grenade justnot his well he said raising his head mustnt grumble then he looked at ben his eyes brimming do you know what its like when you feel everything slipping away he held out his hand as if it were actually happening like water right through your fingers there was no point going back to the ambassador so he drove to the cherokee to change and throw a sweater in an overnight bag weather was vertical here mt wilson would be chilly at night first tea an excuse to see the campus in pasadena and then by convoy up the mountain an evening with the emigres the last thing he wanted his head filled now with bunny and danny and the unknowability of people he parked in back and was about to take the stairs when he remembered the key and went to the front desk instead you have a mail key for me yet you c a new clerk the staff as transient as the guests he reached under the desk and handed ben an envelope theres a charge put it on the bill cant ben exasperated put a few dollars on the counter and went over to the mailboxes opening his for a second he just stared empty but thered been something there a flyer for current resident something the mailman wouldnt have arbitrarily cleaned out the box mails late today the clerk said helpful should be here soon but i thought he closed the box no white paper visible through the holes but there had been upstairs he packed his small bag then looked at the key again if the box had been opened then someone else must have one from danny he noticed the script on the night stand bits of business about post office boxes something that had been on his mind ben glanced at his watch again think about it in the car when he got to the lobby he saw the mailman filling the tilted wall of boxes anything for c he asked the mailman flipped through the stack in his hand john collins that you ben held up his key an id tag and took the envelope staring at it john collins what danny had called himself here he went out the back threw his bag into the car and stood there holding the letter john collins a name for hotel registers hiding out who knew him as john collins a san francisco postmark he opened it carefully as if he were prying but wasnt he john collins now not a letter a sheet with a list of names grouped not boxed like an organizational chart but arranged in clusters some kind of order he looked down the list no one he recognized from the continental list men not starlets but a list danny evidently had wanted ben studied the names again wondering whether any of them were already in minots files or whether they were new more names to feed him at the bottom of the list there was a group of numbers also arranged by some unknown scheme army serial numbers he counted one off against his ownno wrong number of digits some other number then maybe file references sent by some friend in san francisco he looked at the building halfexpecting to see people watching him why would danny get mail here where hed brought his women except he hadnt stained sheets in the afternoonbut the maid hadnt seen any rented months before rosemary then used once but why drive up to santa barbara when you had a secret place in town ben looked at the list again then folded it and put the envelope in his pocket unless it hadnt been used for that no personal items in the bath no toiletries or leftover boxes of powder maybe the point all along had been the mail not girls ben saw him walking jack macdonald home taking in the barely supervised lobby the anonymous rooms upstairs ideal for sex what everyone would think not noticing the boxes but letters from whom not whoever had killed himhed have stopped sending them someone still unaware that danny was gone ben looked at the time minots office would be closed saturdayshed need riordan to let him in and he was already running late anyway why suppose the names were already in the files dannys new list maybe with the one whod thought hed acted in time before his name was in the mail he headed east on hollywood boulevard storefronts slipping by in a blur there had been a flyer in the box so someone had opened it recently maybe looking for the envelope now in his pocket how long would he wait and why set it up this way why not pass a list in a bar call from a pay phone unless the source couldnt be too careful he cut down through silver lake then crossed the river and followed the winding road through the arroyo seco the old commuter route from downtown businessmen in starched collars driving home to their midwestern houses and flowering gardens what the city had been like before the movies came turnofthecentury lampposts and rows of trees the streets empty in the yellow afternoon light hed expected cal tech to be utilitarian but the look was residential cloistered quadrangles the buildings larger versions of the houses down the street the faculty lounge was even more traditional dark wood paneling and oil portraits dieter was already pouring tea for liesl and her father to bens surprise kaltenbach rounded out the table i didnt realize you were coming he said yes maybe a last chance kaltenbach said in german to see heaven english here heinrich dieter said and ben saw that the purpose of the party had been to show off the lounge dieters assimilated life im sorry im late what happened liesl said not looking at him directly you left so suddenly sprinting across a parking lot i had to see someone in the hospital the hospital its all right just a long drive everywhere is far here kaltenbach said a mission of mercy dieter said so now youre here some tea liesl looked over at ben curious but caught his signal to wait they talked idly for a few minutes dieter at one point introducing them to a passing colleague ostermann a folded newspaper near his place seemed preoccupied around the room men sat talking quietly or reading papers formal in jackets and ties all moving slowly like people under water did you see any of the campus as you came in dieter said to ben just a glimpse the grounds are handsome of course everything grows so well here in europeyou remember the university tram lines outside the door another reason to prefer it here ostermann said deadpan teasing him you admit its more pleasant he turned to ben youre still anxious about him your friend no ben said did he look nervous the rest of the room seemed to be moving at a different rhythm almost placid but is there a phone if i could call downstairs dieter said near the toilets you have nickels ben hesitated for a second as if he hadnt heard then nodded of course theyd be pay phones not chasens phones plugged in at the tables he was back in the real world where no one cared about the crosby grosses or who was being fed to minot or who hadnt been one name he stood up the envelope almost pounding in his pocket right back he said hurrying to the stairs riordan might recognize someone just hearing the name the top group ben guessed was the most important but riordan wasnt home ben hung up the receiver how did you find people phone books he took out the list reading the top names to himself then started leafing through the flimsy pages not in los angeles but why give them to danny to minot if they werent local san francisco he picked up the receiver again and asked for long distance information the top two names just to check it took a few minutes but they werent in san francisco either hes all right i hope dieter on his way to the mens room yes ben said startled sticking the letter back in his pocket fine we should leave soon after the light goes the road meet you upstairs ben said already moving why not just rent a post office box if all you wanted was mail wouldnt it have been safe there but in the script the partners get the police to search the boxes a court order ostermann said his mail was read not at his front door intercepted at the post office one branch helping another maybe something the fbi did all the time a consulting tip from dennis but who had sent the letter danny hadnt just filed reports from scraps of memory thered been a source someone who might be traced he thought of the paper in his pocket any fingerprints now smudged by his own but the police had ways of finding things paper and postmarks and typewriter strokes clues invisible to anyone else riordans friends could tell him a rush job a small favor for congressman minot upstairs they had gathered near the door you can imagine my relief when it came kaltenbach was saying in german yes but will you use it ostermann said heinrich i told you english here dieter said joining them yes no german ostermann said he held out the paper what would people think ben looked at the news picturethe first group of defendants at nuremberg sitting erect in uniforms and proper suits dont be foolish dieter said its nothing to do with us do they know that ostermann said nodding to the room its the language of criminals now our german criminals who everybody are we supposed to be guilty too i dont feel that do you no not guilt he glanced down at the newspaper shame ach a literary position dieter arched his eyebrows at liesl a whatdoyouexpect gesture all right ben you take the criminals speak all the german you like nobody will hear liesl darling come with me he held up a finger english only she smiled and put her arm through his my car you still drive in german before ben could say anything they had paired off dieter leading everyone to the lot allamerican ostermann said wryly watching him so he doesnt feel german anymore just like that when does that happen take an oath and any news on your citizenship papers not yet but my lawyer says its a question of time only i have good moral character he said amused how dull i must be you heinrich said the most provocative writer today they used to say that all the critics well now just dull ostermann said smiling you heard the good news he said to ben heinrichs passport came an american passport ben said confused with my moral character kaltenbach laughed no czech you know before the war they would help us a passport of convenience so we could leave and then no czechoslovakia so after the war it was a question would the new government honor the old passports give us new ones and yes so it came from the consulate but do you want to be czech i thought i must be something to travel you cant without a passport so now i can go anywhere not like a prisoner its a wonderful thing they had reached the parking lot liesl fiddling with her keys dieter looked at bens car daniels he said then looked up yes of course i forgot youre at the house not anymore now its on lendlease youve moved i didnt know hm to the cherokee youre living there its convenient to the studio yes but he stopped slightly flustered you dont mind that he never really lived there ben said its just a room dieter looked at him not sure how to respond then at liesl to see her reaction well thats right he said finally uncomfortable just a room ready liesl said would you show me on the map ben said just in case yes all right its very direct she brought a map over to him and opened it this isnt going to be so easy he said to her out of earshot of the others tonight no maybe not was that true about the hospital ben nodded he was visiting someone it was nothing he said suddenly protective but i need to ask you something the mail key for the cherokee you never found it in dannys things again you asked me that before no look for yourself why is it so important get them to give you another one i want to know where his is maybe he never had one why would he he never really lived there she said quoting then looked down just sometimes i dont think he used the place for that what then to write scripts she folded the map why are we talking about this always daniel right here she said motioning with her hand to the space between them she stopped and exhaled collecting herself theyre waiting now dieter will want to know why you didnt stay family should stay what do i tell him that i couldnt keep my hands off you a nice conversation for an uncle she paused the key what does it mean if you dont have it someone else does yes so how did he get it they drove through the suburbs in the foothills and then started the steep climb on the angeles crest highway a twolane road that twisted high into the san gabriels the low grassy hills giving way to dry chaparral clumps of sage and prickly pear cactus and dwarf oaks like a western ostermann said gazing out the window ja a stagecoach kaltenbach said from the backseat its an agony back here i feel sick look straight ahead not out the side all these twists and turns heinrich said as they cut sharply into another hairpin curve look at liesl she cant slow down ahead of them liesls car kept darting out of sight and look how close to the edge it cant be safe just like lions street i have to close my eyes when she takes me there so fast i dont know how he can live there for the views views we had views in berlin and it was flat views everywhere not so many now ostermann said gently they kept climbing skirting a sheer drop beyond the chiseled boulders lining the shoulder you know someone went over the edge heinrich said back at feuchtwangers near lions house so you see its not safe i always said and yet you go and so had genia ben thought but not to see feuchtwanger someone else familiar with the road a friendship kaltenbach said up ahead liesl turned sharply my god dieter says the old road was worse from the south in the beginning not even paved they had to bring everything up in wagons with mules all the pieces of the telescopes imagine what that was like the turnoff road for mt wilson seemed narrower not intended for highway traffic they had had the sun behind them and now the slopes were becoming shadowy gathering dark at the bottom ben hunched over the wheel to concentrate on the road saw what it must be like at night even headlights swallowed up in the pitch black kaltenbach had actually closed his eyes not wanting to look anymore there were more trees forests of conifers like germany ostermann said so many pines the harz mountains well a long time ago heinrich thinks its the same what are you saying kaltenbach said from the back hearing his name that you should stay here another flagwaver like dieter even the oranges are better its easy for him numbers you can do that in any language he was quiet for a minute id have a post at the university a professor like him but youre still here you know dolner at rko is giving exit visa to koernerhes the head you think they would make it now ostermann said politely a war story no an escape story that has an appeal anytime dolner thinks its possible even now kaltenbach said stubbornly a man clutching a lottery ticket dieters fond of liesl ben said to change the subject he sees her mother were they alike a physical resemblance anna was not so strong it was hard for her to live like that new places liesl maybe she was always an actress german now austrian frenchyou learn to adapt but anna never did it killed her i think of course dieter says it was me waiting too long he never saw the nerves the worry not like liesl that way to escape with daniel the danger anna could never have done it ben saw the solar towers first poking up through the trees like radio antennas beyond them was the dome for the telescope and even farther on the other side of the complex another much larger dome scattered between on side paths were wooden frame buildings where the staff lived like a permanent summer camp under the pines liesls car was turning left to one of these a long white building with green trim a man came out to greet dieter signaling ben to park on the side theres been a little mixup about the rooms dieter said when they joined him annoyed but trying to be pleasant professor davis brought some graduate students so well have to doubleup they wont be in the waytheyre working with the sixtyinchbut it does mean sharing ben how about you and hans then heinrich with me john will show you where you are professor davis full of dates and statistics showed them the grounds a visitor talk hed obviously given before the first tower in then the sixtyinch telescope finally the onehundredinch in still the largest in the world the dome was on its own promontory reached by footbridge over a shallow chasm and a reservoir pond it was getting dark now flashlights needed on the path the site is remarkable davis was saying it has the best seeing in the country seeing kaltenbach said the best conditions very little atmospheric turbulence but so close to the city ostermann said the lights yes but even so its the turbulence that matters you know if you stand in a swimming pool and look down the water moves your feet seem to move turbulence is like that we see the stars twinkle but they dontits just air moving across their light but up here with the good seeing theyre steady well youll see later shall we have some dinner now they dont twinkle ostermann said its a little disappointing davis looked at him puzzled all the poems ostermann added lamely songs well songs davis said at a loss ben hung back as they got near the dining room now what he said to liesl am i supposed to sneak out while hes sleeping she smiled like a teenager she touched his arm maybe its enough for now to know we want to dont look like that what are you thinking ever hear of arnold wallace he said his head still in the letter no she said an abrupt change of mood he went down the sheet in his mind one typed name after another raymond gilbert who are these people i dont know yet more friends of daniel people he might have mentioned she looked away not to me the graduate students left as soon as theyd finished eating but the emigre group lingered talking with eric professor daviss assistant who had now taken charge of them eric was tall and gawky but eager to please consumed by astronomy it seemed to ben a conversation from another world beamed in from one of the stars not nine miles up the slope from pasadena the hundredinch is really the point now mt wilson began as a solar observatory but after professor hubbles work there was a shift to nighttime research without the hundredinch modern cosmology ben drifted and he could see the others were having trouble keeping up dieter to whom all this was familiar seemed to be monitoring their response glancing at each of them ready to interrupt if things became hopelessly tangled ben felt the envelope in his pocket maybe the names were arranged by studios how many groups had there been five majors maybe a few poverty row companies but none of the names were familiar technicians screenwriters he hadnt heard of schaeffer at fox until minots files but not in the phone book they couldnt all be unlisted not technicians the key was proving that spiral nebulae are distant galaxies outside the milky way in other words the universe is expanding expanding ostermann said thoughtfully what does it mean oh i know he said waving off eric theres an explanation of course but how do we imagine such a thing the universe expanding how do we even imagine the universe you dont have to imagine it you can see it eric said getting up outside they trailed behind him to the big dome the sky all lit up if you look that way he said pointing youll see the section were studying at the moment there keep it in mind when we go inside youll see how much more the telescope picks up it seemed impossible there could be more the stars already too numerous to count much less name as davis had predicted they were steady lights not twinkling the telescope was more than just the giant shaft that shot out through the domes opening there was the heavy platform with its gears the series of reflectors and magnifying properties to explain and eric grew more excited as he talked a boy with his wonderful toy ben smiled to himself thinking of the hal jaspers at the moviola both mechanics at heart but why would minot want technicians recognizable faces nobody cared about the hal jaspers maybe these werent the intended names just ways to get to them sources like danny they had made an adjustment to one of the mirrors that brought the sky into sharp focus a swath of stars leaping out of the black ben stared at it for a minute as silent as the others dazzled he felt himself getting smaller a speck reduced to nothing by a vast indifference the universe expanded without us none of it matterednot the preview audiences reaction or whether julie sherman could sing or whether danny had filed reports they were just frames flying by in a movie wed made to keep us awake in the dark you see the dust to the right of the star were measuring eric said pointing again were not sure yet its early but the gap there might be another star forming when will you know liesl said eric smiled not for years the dust has to fuse a long process but we can track the movement its real dust not just light real dust and gas particles of elements but we see it as light sometimes its whats in the way but with this you see beyond whats really there i wonder ostermann said do we want to see everything so clearly well you want to see this clearly or you wont get the measurements right eric said no poet ostermann smiled yes thats right a distraction if we want to know but beautiful i think all the same well yes eric said not sure what he meant you have to be careful you see the star there on the right two oclock that was mine my project i knew it all its properties and then there was movement some dust and it confused everything i began to doubt it what i already knew but that was with the sixtyinch with this it was clear again the same properties which was lucky for me my whole dissertation was based on it years of work but nothing was clear yet the names had to mean something people minot would be interested in focus who interested him ben turned to dieter is there a phone up here in the directors office youre still worried about your friend come ill show you they walked back across the bridge stars everywhere a whole sky of them there were other phone books follow the logic dieter turned on the light in the office thanks dont wait i can find my way back dieter hesitated but then made a polite nod and backed out pointing to the light a reminder it was late but kelly was still at his desk see something always turns up you got a body or just a tip i need a favor last time i looked you owed me now ill owe you two youve got all the studio phone listings right maybe youd have to theyd be your favorite bedtime reading i want you to look up a few namesjust tell me which studio i should do this why kelly said playing with him a wiseguy line does your paper know youre moonlighting for polly there was a silence i dont know what youre talking about then youd have a tough time explaining it to them wouldnt you if they ever asked come on kelly theres nothing to this just pull the lists out of the drawer and were done in two minutes there goes one kelly said wallace first name arnold youll find it near the bottom of the list ha ha ben could hear a shuffling of papers nope not at fox not anywhere try gilbert raymond another shuffle gilbert allen at republic no raymond who are these guys supposed to be friends of my brother i found them in his book and im trying to get in touch the lie said easily a little wave of turbulence over the wire try friedman alfred but friedman wasnt there either nor three others ben looked at the list stymied minot was going after the industry but danny was feeding him someone else so who could they be he said aloud but really to himself bookies ious muscle all guys right kellys world okay thanks sorry to bother you how about a little payback something on dick marshall and the sister how would i know you live there give me an item i could sell anything on them im not there anymore im at the cherokee what his room talk about sick i havent run into any ghosts yet maybe hell talk to you in the night tell you who he was banging ill let you know about that other thing polly howd you happen to come up with that a shot in the dark thanks for the favor a shot in the dark now i owe you two he stared at the list again then put it back in his pocket out of ideas maybe hell talk to you in the night he walked back to the dome smelling the night moisture on the pines fresh something to wipe away kelly i could sell anything on them inside eric was demonstrating a spectroscopic binary the guests following attentively as if it made sense hes all right dieter said yes thanks what have i missed dieter smiled advanced astronomy his course do you think theyll pass the exam he said nodding to the others they adjusted the mirror again a new perspective larger than the last but dieter noticed that people had begun to tire eric i promised the guests a nightcap so im going to steal them from you yes ill just finish with this magnification now see those very small points there outside theyd be invisible the eye simply cant take them in but theyre out there we have no idea what were going to see when we build the new scope down at palomar twohundredinch things in there we cant see now he said pointing to the image his voice excited what wasnt he seeing a san francisco postmark someone who didnt know danny had died and no way of telling him no return address but they must have communicated somehow the letter hadnt dropped out of the sky was some response expected what if he hadnt taken it just let it sit there he held the thought for a minute like a breath but it wouldnt just sit there somebody else would have picked it up eric finally finished to a chorus of thankyous outside the sky seemed less full limited by the unaided eye to only a sampling of stars like the ceiling of the wilshire temple could it only have been this morning gazing up while the music tugged at him back to otto an invisible chord suddenly he felt tired lightheaded as if he had climbed up to this thin air on foot good seeing but how could you do it below you had to wait for a flash something that broke through all the obscuring dust sam pilcer looking at his son his heart suddenly visible bunny gazing at a bandage finally without irony this wasnt all they werethe other parts were still therebut without the glimpse you couldnt really see them take some kind of measure maybe the letter if he could explain it was a flash a way to see danny he stopped looking up again but he already knew him the way eric had known his star before all the dust got in the way the same properties the same constant light and if you knew that you could explain the rest he hadnt mentioned jack macdonald after hed seen him an easy bone to toss he hadnt mentioned rosemary either he never stopped writing to ben stayed with otto to the end got liesl out a dangerous trip who he really was back at the lodge they spoke german for heinrichs sake and ben already tired found himself sitting back not really listening they were huddled around the table drinking and for an instant he saw them as danny might have refugees in a mountain hut waiting to be smuggled across but now they were here at the end of another continent and heinrich was talking about going back but you dont consider the rest of us dieter said the effect it might have he waved his hand in a circle a decision like thisit will draw attention to all of us but only i would be going and then they think who else whos next remember during the war how they watched us the wars over that one yes now a new one and look where youd go the other side you think its so pleasant there now at least wait a little im an old man dieter how long should i wait you make yourself old dieter poured more brandy in the glasses you talk to him he said to ostermann maybe were a little selfish ostermann said we dont want to see you go you want to speak german go to switzerland dieter said lion is thinking about that zurich lion has money no one is asking me to come to zurich theres no rush liesl said to heinrich you can stay with me for a while if you like the room just sits there but what about heinrich looked at ben im not there anymore no in that apartment dieter said you know where daniel he shook his head it seems so strange to me you dont feel he didnt die there liesl said into her glass he died at the hospital ben looked up jarred as if he had just heard a skip on a record a needle scratch the hospital those awful last minutes people racing liesls face as she stood in the doorway dont leave me the last thing hed ever say but ben had a technicality dieter said i still wonder to myself what was on his mind kaltenbach said then looked at liesl forgive me an intrusion its justsomeone with so much courage liesl drew on her cigarette as if she hadnt heard then tamped it on the ashtray preoccupied you think its an act of weakness ostermann said i dont know maybe its the hardest the restyou can do anything if you have to you with your good moral character is there such a thing i used to think so very clear the nazis are here he said putting his hand at one end of the table and were here bookending the other he moved both to the middle no here somewhere mixed together we know that now we can cross any line but that last one such talk liesl said rubbing out the cigarette any line ben said not killing someone look how often we do it its only ourselves we cant kaltenbach nodded settling in for a longer discussion ben stood up i want to get an early start back he said an apology but the studios are closed sunday dieter said even continental well a last one for me liesl another brandy no no she said picking up her glass and finishing it another skip on the record watching her drink he felt the back of his neck go still the way it had watching the screen test except this time he saw ruth harris on the penthouse terrace easy enough for a woman to do he shook his head more interference dust and you come too she said to her father youll be up all night the two of you outside they all looked up again ben tilted his head to where erics star would bebright and clear if you knew how to find it the letter he thought was a kind of telescope the names were out there somewhere in a bigger file no entries turned up at minots office you got me down here on a sunday morning riordan said eyes still a little puffy with sleep ben had gone straight to his apartment waking him with drugstore coffee i wanted to make sure theyre new so now youre sure riordan said waiting we need to get this to the bureau ben said holding out the letter we you could get it to the right desk faster one of their own retired its not exactly a twoway street with the bureau they have to be careful doing favors for the congressman people get touchy about that dennis he sighed why the bureau theyre interested in the same people minots interested in look somebody sent this to danny which means they sent it to you too youve got an interest here nobody has files like the bureau ill bet theres one on me security check dennis said automatically then half smiled at bens reaction you asked all right ben said so my point and whod know better than danny he was a source you the only one he dealt with maybe there was someone else he got to know with access how much do they give minot a spoonful once in a while theyre careful i said so maybe danny found a backdoor you dont know that lets see where the letter comes from what the lab says thats the stuff theyre good at right every typewriter has its own signature paper comes from somewhere has to what theyre famous for you know what theyre good at sitting in a car all day watching who goes in and out i know i used to do it now you want them to run a full investigation just to see whos mailing things in san francisco if these names are in their files theyll want to dont you think why because one of them killed a source former source they still owe him riordan said nothing for a moment then handed him the letter make a copy sometimes things go into the bureau they dont come back ben sat down and started to write and if they come up dry with these theres always a file somewhere ben said in frankfurt there had been rooms of them millions of index cards the whole crime at your fingertips this doesnt come from minot riordan said hes careful too no official ties just warm feelings can you get it to them today sunday i know but the bureau never sleeps right why the rush whoever mailed this didnt know danny was dead but somebody else has the key now how long does he wait for it to show up assuming he knows its coming then why take the key want to be sure put a dummy letter in see if it stays there and if it doesnt move out he had just finished the names when he heard the lock turn without even thinking he covered the paper with another and folded the original in its envelope his eyes fixed on the shadow behind the translucent glass minot opened the door and stopped staring at them for a second then took off his hat on your way to church he said ben saw riordan freeze a burglar caught too slowwitted to make a move congressman ben said youre up early what are you doing here he said bluntly making a report dennis was good enough to come down my only day off a report i spent the weekend with the groupostermann kaltenbach you asked so i wanted to get it down while it was still fresh in my mind tomorrow im at the studio all day while whats still fresh kaltenbach the russian consul come too he said dryly it was just the krauts riordan said as if theyd already been over this we went to the observatory see the stars something easily confirmed and what happened that couldnt wait ben glanced up aware of minots eyes expectant waiting to be fed nothing much ben said flailing inside looking for something but i thought what would interest you is that hes got a new czech passport what minot put his hat on a table and walked over galvanized he had one before ben said easily you probably know passport of convenience but the new governments agreed to reissue so i thought youd do you know what this means minot said he can travel not yet hes still trying to peddle an old script at rko dont be an ass you cant leave without papers and believe me he wasnt getting any from us we had him now he can go whenever he likes with what congressman hes living on handouts he has friends to help now ben held out his hands in a whoa gesture nobody was talking about going anywhere then why does he need a passport minot said almost snapping then catching himself look youre new at this i appreciatebut we cant afford to take chances dennis we need to get a subpoena i dont care what passport hes got hes not going anywhere if hes under subpoena how long will it take ken its sunday i didnt want to move yet minot said to himself you want to orchestrate this but we can do a closed session first no noise but we keep him here for later how long tomorrow probably tuesday congressman ben said alarmed now i think were overreacting i was with him its the last thing on his mind not on theirs you dont know how these people think the east germans want him why do you think the czechs got so generous all of the sudden you think theyre sitting there worrying about kaltenbach nobody cares about kaltenbach then why do you minot looked up at him sharply i mean ben said placating hes my witness minot said calmly thats why hes useful but hes not a communist hes not anything read the file minot said nodding to the cabinet socialist party there documented speeches the whole thing probably what the books are about thats years ago anyway socialist thats not the same thing minot looked at him you know that thousands dont theyll just see what hes not whats that american you establish a pattern he said a willed patience quote the speecheshow far left do you want to go gets a visit from the russian consulatewe have this witnesses if we need them actual contact with the russians same man works for warner brothers a lifesaver contract they gave them to jews to get them out i wonder if jack will mention that he said evenly so that ben looked up at him chilled now someone who realizes his hand still in the cage whats inside of course hell also have mission to moscow to explain a lot of activity over at warners over the years and here are your old employees drinking tea with the russians thousands wont understand that either but they see the pattern but what evidence this isnt a murder case minot said its not about evidence its about what people are you think hes harmless just an old man im sorry i disagree ive read the speeches you put lenins name on them and then tell me the difference and once the pattern is there youve got a very useful witness ask him if he sawwell who lets say you did you ever attend meetings with mr collier and he says no but now your names out there isnt it whether he says no or not all we have to do is put it there now why would we ask if there wasnt something we knew ask a few others people from the studio you want to use him to squeeze warner ben said quietly but his voice so neutral that minot took his dismay for appreciation we need the studio heads he said simply we dont want a fight with the industry we want to help them clean house their own good ive met jackyou were there i remember i think hes the kind of man whos going to be friendly to the committee a good businessman looks after his interests and he thinks hes a patriot made yankee doodle dandy thats the story he wants to tell how he made that not how the studio took in leftwing jews not that its about jews i know how some people feel but you dont want to go down that road im looking at the real threat if you see the pattern i think jackll see it too so kaltenbach hes useful wed like to keep him close to home come to think of it if hes got the passport does that make him a czech citizen technically i dont know a passport of convenience ben said lamely good question to ask though foreign national and a hollywood address all through the war some people theres no way to help this are going to think swimming pools youd think someone like that would be grateful not have little parties with the russians well he went over to his desk and opened a locked drawer some of us do have to get to church dennis you get on that first thing tomorrow right you boys almost done here you want to put that in the file he nodded to the papers in front of ben ben took the copy and handed it to dennis who moved to the cabinet before minot could ask for it you have the date he received it the passport minot asked ben exact no but just last few days see if you can find out it helps having things exact makes people think everything youve got is ready they all went out together ben scooping up the original letter for his pocket when minot turned to the door good work minot said to him in the hall you keep your ears open its just like the commies isnt it pick on the weak one kaltenbachanythingd look good to him jackals he signaled to his car keep an eye on him until we get the subpoena served take him to dinner ill bet he could use a meal when the car pulled away ben gave the envelope to riordan whered you file the copy kaltenbach ben watched minots car leaving the driveway how much of it do you think he believes all of it how much do you riordan looked at him then started down the stairs you know you retire early you only get half pension then why did you i took a bullet my leg you probably didnt notice but i favor my right leg now my own fault i should have been paying attention grazing idly another straggler pick on the weak one let me know what the bureau says it was only after theyd both gone and he was alone in the parking lot that it hit him a lurch in his stomach that felt like nausea is this how danny had felt after one of his deliveries he saw kaltenbach sweating at the hearing table in his shabby suit asking someone at his side to translate his eyes frightened his nightmare finally coming true what he had managed to escape no germany would have been worsehe would have been killed or left to rot in a camp here they would just hollow him out use him to snatch someone else but what was the alternative ben had been in berlin he had no illusions about russians the first wave of rapists and thugs now replaced by a grim occupation the next thousandyear reich nobody could want that not by choice and yet there would be pockets of privilege a prized pawn trapped on the board but not thrown away he thought of kaltenbach at the cemetery spontaneous tears on his cheeks mourning the man who had saved him got him out but the war the heroic stories were over what would danny do now kaltenbach lived a few blocks off fairfax walking distance from canters where his landlady used to work before shed brought her sick mother over from boyle heights to nurse full time kaltenbach had the room now with a ground floor window that looked out on a magnolia tree and a patch of lawn that needed cutting ben drove by struck again by the sunday stillness of los angeles as quiet as one of those ancient cities where everyone had vanished leaving their pottery he had come to see heinrich driving fast but now that he was here what could he say call your lawyer the blinds were drawn perhaps for a nap after the early drive down the mountain or maybe hed been restless gone over to fairfax for a whitefish salad and coffee with other heinrichs then there would be the rest of the day to get through ben stopped the car then suddenly didnt have the heart to go in how could he explain i know this because ive been informing on you and then minot would know who else could have warned him is this what it had been like for danny a balancing act hiding from both sides anyway in a day or so it wouldnt matter hed be stuck ben looked again at the quiet house they couldnt serve the subpoena if he wasnt there the only thing to do now was buy time liesl could take him homean insistent invitation no need to explain anything until they figured out what to do he drove back to the cherokee stopping for lights without noticing and parked behind nothing in the mailbox behind the little holes but why would there be sunday and maybe hed already taken the last piece that would ever come the new joel looked at him indifferent and nodded when he got in the elevator he opened the door with his key eyes already fixed on the phone table he heard it first a soft whoosh then the back of his head exploded with a lightning pain jagged so fast there was no time to know what was happening a pulsing afterimage like staring into a flashbulb darkening then another pain a crack as his knees hit the floor and he realized he was falling he put his hands out to break the fall but couldnt find them off somewhere to his side as his face met the floor a louder thump then nothing at all everything was still dark when he felt the animal pawing at him brushing his clothes aside to get at his chest not paws hands pulling at his jacket digging into the pockets still too dark to see now at his collar dragging him back to some den he felt his head scrape on the ground then a welling slick and he knew the blood would excite the animal but couldnt stop it everything beyond his control a change in the air like a window being opened a banging as a door hit the wall and even in the dark he knew it was the french window the black now just a dimness being pulled again out toward the air the balcony and he tried to open his eyes panicking because he knew not a dream that he had become danny dragged out to the balcony heaved over like a laundry sack his head was throbbing a toothache pain they were in the open air now the animal wearing a hat not an animal still dragging him another yank at his jacket panting almost at the rail and then they were there the man grunting as he heaved turning ben over grabbing under his arms about to lift and ben already knew what the next second would be pitched over the juliet balcony no scream jumpers dont scream and then the crash of garbage cans danny him a loop his eyes still wouldnt open just slits taking in gray outlines the man bending forward to secure his grip in the movies ben would leap up now in a violent struggle but instead hed become an animal prey being dragged to the feeding place he still couldnt find his hands no time left then the mans grip slipped bens head falling again and as the man reached to grab him a better angle ben turned his head a move of pure instinct the effort dizzying and opened his mouth teeth connecting with flesh biting hard on the mans ankle the howl must have been more surprise than pain something dead come back to life but it startled bens eyes open the world fuzzy but there and as the man jerked his foot away bens hands came up back now too and he held the leg and bit again the man staggering as he tried to pull it away no longer pitched forward toward bens shoulders his hands springing back grabbing onto the french window then using the other foot to kick crunching bens chest lunging for him again there was a shout from somewhere enough to make the man hesitate for a second before he hammered his fist into bens back a squashing slam that forced bens face tighter against his leg making the man twist free away from the window now the fulcrum of his weight flung backward so that ben felt the pull of the leg moving and let it go feeling it hit his face then flying free following the body turning as the man reached for the rail then kept going into the loud scream that filled the alley the noise danny hadnt made and then was swallowed up by the crash lids clanging cans rolling away from the impact of the body ben grabbed the balcony edge and pulled himself up just enough to look over to see the police photos again the pool of blood spreading from the mans head but in color this time dark red the body splayed out at odd angles the chalk mark outline where ben was supposed to have been he stared at it for a second nobody he recognized then heard a window open a gasp more windows the faint sound of a radio the desk clerk rushing out and looking up at ben holding on to his balcony the loop ben already knew soon the ambulance the crime scene photographers maybe even riordan losing himself in the crowd he lowered his head from the railing putting his hands in front of him to get up but couldnt move falling instead down an elevator shaft until it was dark again the bandage woke him an unfamiliar weight on his head the room was all white which made him smile a white telephone set then he remembered the alley liesl was standing looking out the window her back to him and the loop started running again dannys hospital room this time ben in the bed but not dying everything in focus the fuzziness gone is this presbyterian he said surprised at the croak in his voice she whirled around and stared at him then shook her head her eyes filling with relief caught in the same loop where community on vine how long have i been out most of the day its almost four youve been here he touched the bandage at the back of his head then the adhesive tape across the bridge of his nose a dull throb in his chest what else its enough head trauma she looked away its not the same not five stories you still might have died she said still not facing him then turned and came over brushing her hand against his forehead how aboutwhoever it was is he dead she nodded any idea who some schlager kelly knows kelly hes here outside he wont go until he sees you first okay you dont have to youve been out you should see the doctor first no i want to know he grabbed her wrist im fine its the kind of thing you know about yourself if somethings wrong kelly came in tentatively the usual jauntiness left outside can you talk you doing a story i didnt know what hit me pretty lame except i didnt make something up i dont care the police out there with you kelly shook his head they want a statement when youre ready dot the is they already took the witnesss who guy next door saw him punch you try to throw you off day clerk thought he was in the building guy comes in goes to the mailboxes so the clerk figures he lives there of course if hed known it was ray whos ray the guy hired hand if you need something done people do so he and the cops go way back thats why when they saw it was him you didnt have to draw a map he used to run with the pachucos his mothers a mex then i guess he decided to put it to work go freelance hes already been in once for armed robbery thats what they think this is i have to tell you dont take this wrong when i got the call the first thing i thoughti mean same place monkey see maybe a better story dont be like that its what anybody would if id been the one who went over i know thats what he wanted you to think who what are you saying whoever paidwhat was it ray he looked at kelly want something better than robbery first of all theres nothing to steal he said feeling rays hands in his pocket again not something for kelly the door wasnt forced i had to open it with a key but he was already in doors not a problem for guys like that especially if they have a key kelly looked at him waiting you know i never saw his face he hit me from behind all he had to do was walk away if he wanted to kill me a few more head taps would have done it so why go through all the trouble lugging me out there maybe so youd say the first thing i thought anybody would theyd think id been planning to do it but how would he know well kelly how would he you think he did your brother maybe maybe not find out who paid him but thats how danny was killed i know it for a few minutes there i was him dont worry he said touching the head bandage im not going spooky on you i just saw how it had to be find out who paid him work it from that side is he the kind who brags maybe theres a girl he get the money yet youre so sure about this fine do it as a robbery maybe you get a column the double jump would have been better but i screwed that up for you but a murder two that the police never saw exclusive thats a ticket up he looked directly at him no more moonlighting kelly said nothing for a minute why dont the police see it he said biting because theyre traffic cops and they like robbery come on kelly nobody was supposed to see it ask around who paid him kelly picked up his hat to go and the pachucos will tell me swell its a bigger story kelly looked at him a small ironic smile any studio connection after hed gone liesl moved to the chair next to the bed did you really think that that you were daniel i just saw how it made sense imagine if you could do that know what somebody was thinking he could tell youwell but i know what hed do maybe it took a knock on the head but its clear now he began throwing back the covers what are you doing i have to get out of here dont be listen to me heinrichs in trouble there isnt much time trouble ill explain later where did they put my clothes help me liesl im all right see he said getting out of bed and standing not even dizzy but then he was weaving slightly putting his hand on the bed to steady himself get back into bed she said taking his elbow its my fault understand my fault i have to help he took a breath exhaled there i just got winded for a second he looked down at the adhesive tape on his lower chest the rib makes it hard to breathe thats all here help me with this shirt you cant just walk out the doctor has to release you what would danny have done would he have waited she looked at him that was different he walked over to the closet liesl trailing him we cant go back to the cherokee the copsll still be there so well have to use your car my wallets here i can use my military id theyre not going to say no to that hell need his passport though passport what are you talking about he took her arm i have to get him out i can do it but i need you to help me get him out she said looking at his head im all right im not crazy no excited she said quietly looking at him drop me at the house then you go to heinrichs alone in case anybodys watching he said pulling on his pants why would anyone be watching she said nervously dont pack his landlady sees a suitcase shell startbut anything he really wants take a grocery bag so it looks like stuff for dinner and the passport dont forget ill explain everything to him when you get back if he doesnt want to fine we give him dinner and drive him home but he will with a grocery bag she said like a knapsack and then what we cross the mountain no he said buttoning his shirt too busy to hear her tone i get him to mexico mexico its just a drive why the movie people came in the first place dodging edisons patents sun and a convenient border according to sol anyway wheres my hat im going to need a hat to cover this he said fingering the bandage your fathers in touch with the germans there some of them will know heinrich hell need help how much cash do you keep at home some its something you learn in case okay shoes he stood up stop a minute listen to me youre in no condition to drive youll both be killed and then what i have to oh have to so pigheaded just like she stopped looking away its serious his trouble he nodded all right ill drive dont she said holding up a hand anyway its my car youre sure he said pleased as if he were extending a hand she shrugged a pretend indifference you cant go alone its breaking the law not yet in a few days it would but hell be gone over the border she said i thought it was finished all that business kaltenbach grasped the situation right away ben had expected indecision an arguing back and forth but the urgency had jolted him into an oddly calm selfassurance all his usual dithering put away like bits of stage business a political trial he said now here no its a hearing closed at first its not the nazis ben said it would be a mistake to think that to decide that way its not camps or but a political trial all the same kaltenbach said evenly i know what it means theres no danger to you youre not being charged with anything not even being a communist just politically unreliable so no work at the studios youre not working there now ostermann said they were drinking coffee near the end of the pool terrace the city below lights coming on in the dusk no not for a long time kaltenbach said now longer i want you to understand ben said if you leave you wont be able to come back theyd make sure of that its not like before ostermann said what choice did we have now theres a choice you cant take this lightly thats why you came over to talk me out of it no i talked to anna in mexico city seghers you remember its not easy to make a call there an hour to get through but i thought she would know somebody or somebody whoso heres an address in tijuana who can help with arrangements i said youd be there tomorrow if you go no tonight kaltenbach said firmly then i came to say goodbye ostermann said if youre sure kaltenbach turned away too emotional to face him look at it he said nodding to the city a mirage maybe its the palm trees that suggest it but sometimes i think theres nothing really there blinkjust sand again was i here you and dieter all milk and honey blue skies but i wonder even for you almost ready liesl said coming out of the house she had changed into creamcolored slacks and a blouse resort wear was it big enough she pointed to one of dannys old suitcases now filled with heinrichs few changes of clothes kaltenbach turned back to ostermann i know its different there now he held his gaze for a second a silent conversation then stuck out his hand so goodbye my friend but ostermann tearing up took him in his arms a fierce hug and ben saw in his posture that he had done it before one more leavetaking when he finally pulled away he took some money out of his pocket here no kaltenbach said covering his hand youll need it kaltenbach shook his head but frau schneider my landlady theres rent owing are you sure keep my good name he said smiling sadly ill pay you back a ritual phrase ostermann took one of the bills from his hand here for cake at the romanische kaltenbach took the money mohnkuchen like nowhere else he touched ostermann on the shoulder starting to turn away then stopped and looked at him again if you read that ive said somethingsomething you know that doesnt soundyoull know its not me yes youll remember that of course even if my name is attached i may have to but you know the books they cant change those the rest dont listen just the books we should go liesl said they look all right she said to ben now in dannys borrowed clothes how do you feel ready this all he lifted her bag i have to be back im in the scene they can shoot around you for one day he turned to ostermann have iris call in sick for her doctors orders they wont like that we cant just drop him at the border one day they started across the terrace then froze as the phone rang dont answer ben said thatll be the hospital wondering if i ended up here in my nightgown what did you say at the nurses station he said to liesl that you were sleeping id be back tomorrow good so im the only one missing walking around somewhere near vine youll be in trouble for this kaltenbach said not unless they catch us they followed ostermanns car down the hill and stayed behind until he veered off with a small wave kaltenbach waved back his eyes fixed on the featureless boulevard a last look before it shimmered away by the time they turned on sepulveda heading down the coast he seemed to have lost interest letting his head rest on the backseat eyes closed like someone on a long railroad trip dont go too fast ben said we dont want to get stopped why are you so nervous nobody has any idea why are we supposed to be going if anyone asks the races everybody goes down for the races fishing in ensenada i dont know why does anyone go your brother used to say dont think about anything kaltenbach said pretend its the most natural thing in the world if you worry at all they sense it like dogs and did you worry i was terrified you know what i think got us through alma the way shes in her own world at the border she seemed surprised to see the guards you know anything in her way they didnt even question us of course your brother made a gift to them but even so they usually asked questions to make a show but not alma si senora up goes the crossing bar and all i could think was dont sweat dont let them smell it on you and you know if it had gone the other waywell it was another time i owe my life to him now you no this isnt the same it feels the same all that climbing i was afraid for my heart now look a chauffeur but the same he was quiet for a minute watching the night landscape pass dark houses and miles of streetlights stretching down to long beach i never said goodbye to alma i wonder if shell notice that im gone everybody will ben said youll be in the papers so you have to leave to make an impression he said playing with it they drove past huntington beach the lights getting fewer liesl sneaking glances at him whats wrong he said nothing she said a little startled unaware that hed seen im all right really its not that the jacket i bought it i was remembering when i bought it he fell asleep without realizing it his head against the window dreaming of the stars spilling across the sky on mt wilson then he was at the cherokee watching blood spread in the alley someone elses blood not his had danny fought back he woke when she stopped for gas the station overly bright in the black landscape where are we nowhere another twenty miles to la jolla maybe we should stop there its a long drive no kaltenbach said from the back its important not to stop another lesson from the pyrenees even to rest people notice you you see that car its been behind us now it stops too its the first station for miles liesl said go to the toilet ben said see if they follow ive got your back the attendant came over to start the pump you encourage him liesl said hes careful want a coke he went over to the ice cooler and pulled out a bottle and opened it glancing at the second car as he drank two men on a sunday night going where kaltenbach came out of the station head low his face shadowed by his hat theyre still there getting gas i think its all right they paid and left ben driving now one eye on the rearview mirror how would anybody know liesl said to him using english heinrich just a child in the backseat swiveling his head from time to time you think they were watching his house hes not the only one in the car you heard kelly the guy was a hired hand and im still here she took this in thinking for a minute and yet you do this out here where its easy for them he said nothing they were going to use heinrich anyway you didnt make them i helped so its all on your shoulders all the problems of the world she looked out the window quiet you and daniel what do i do just sit there he looked at her its not much considering theyre turning off kaltenbach said looking out the back after la jolla there were more lights the hilly outskirts of san diego liesl was fiddling with the radio kaltenbach keeping watch for cars in the movies they always hear about themselves on the radio liesl said but listen just music so were safe she turned the dial picking up a spanishlanguage station we must be close what will they think of us different passports they dont care much going out its getting back in itll be easier just the two of us with a bandage on your head she was quiet for a minute why did he want to kill you you never told me that part why he was paid the one who paid him maybe im getting close close she said not following who killed danny why do you think that theres something youre not telling me he shook his head dodging but i must be then hell try again she said flatly you have to go to the police with what tell them danny was a snitch for minot i have to stay close to minot thats the connection she looked down he wasnt that i still dont believe it maybe he thought he had a reason ben said letting it go were coming to the border kaltenbach said his voice nervous and melodramatic as if he had seen guard dogs and soldiers with guns in fact it was only a string of lighted booths under an arched sign go to sleep ben said to him i dont want to use a czech passport if we dont have to hed remember hes probably never seen one i dont have to show it we can try close your eyes he pulled up to the booth holding his id out the open window a uniform like a state trooper with a broadbrimmed hat driving late the guard said checking the id want to be early for the races not tomorrow you wont no races you didnt know ben could feel liesl tense beside him i guess well have to find something else to do he said the suggestion of a leer in his voice the officer glanced at liesl i guess she began to hand over her passport but he ignored it whos that my old man he likes the ponies and the tequila he nodded to the back got a head start hell feel it that stuff careful tonight you know where youre going weve been before then i dont have to tell you watch the car theyll steal the tires while youre still in it he stepped back waving them on and they drove through the nomans stretch to the mexican booth another bored officer who just looked at them and said bienvenidos and then they were over suddenly in tijuana its done kaltenbach said almost deflated cheated out of an expected drama youre free ben said stumbling on the word an unintended irony no subpoenas the city was noisy even at this hour bright with strings of bare incandescent bulbs san diego had been asleep but here there were still crowds peddlers and shoeshine kids and americans in hawaiian shirts the smell of frying food makeshift buildings as dingy as carnival flats men with mustaches idled on corners waiting for something to happen like extras their eyes following the car kaltenbach kept staring out the window expecting it to get better but the blocks streamed into each other the same glare and sinister languor and for a second ben wanted to turn around take him back make some deal with minot but now he was here even more displaced they went to the biggest hotel they saw with a guarded parking lot and ben paid for the rooms in dollars the desk clerk a mexican joel barely lifted his eyes as he handed out the keys there was a restaurant two doors down and they sat in a booth exhausted and drank beer picking at the chiles rellenos the waiter had brought all that was left before closing how long do you think i will have to stay here kaltenbach said well see broch tomorrow i think theres an airport maybe we can get you on a plane for mexico city a plane kaltenbach said timidly you dont like to fly oh such a baby liesl said fondly its like a bus in the air a man who crosses borders an escape artist kaltenbach smiled weakly not so difficult find a kohler he looked at ben my old man ben tipped his glass in a toast the other time it was sherry your brother found a place after we got through and we all drank sherry its what they have there spain he glanced around the room its the same language but this there was a shout from the street a bar argument that had moved outside border towns are like this itll be different in mexico city ben said wondering if it were true better food kaltenbach said looking at it imagine living in such a place stealing tires ben stared at the scarred table top remembering a wrecked horch abandoned in jagerstrasse tires gone gold on the black market children selling krations as slippery as the kids outside where he was sending kaltenbach but where kaltenbach wanted to go its an odd feeling he was saying no one knows im here none of us liesl said you could disappear here she met bens eyes if someone were looking for you you couldjust go anywhere be safe unless you wanted him to find you ben said looking back at her you could stop not now he wont stop id always be looking over my shoulder you cant live that way he touched her hand and theres danny do you want me to walk away from that she raised her head her eyes wider as if she were startled to find him there what are you saying kaltenbach said not following their english nothing she said quickly sitting up just how its like before when we got out this place yes everything how worried i was what if they turn us back and then at the border how easy and you thought its a trick yes thats right kaltenbach said then a drink to celebrate like this everything she said facing ben again and how calm he was your brother well and you my old man he grinned but not this he said gesturing to the beer do you think they have schnapps they may call it that but it wont you cant celebrate with beer not something like this they were another hour sipping a harsh burning brandy with a mexican label kaltenbach getting sentimental but not yet maudlin liesl smiling to herself as he talked and youll come to see me how far is berlin imagine the neighbors a movie star in old kaltenbachs flat everyone looking just behind the curtains you remember the courtyards how everyone knew your business nothing said and they know everything so youll come look at you since a child you dont forget these things your mother so protective everything for you for hans everybody but herself and then she couldnt protect you anymore liesl reached across the table heinrich yes i know i know dont speak like hans but then you know we begin to forget they go away from us he turned to ben can i say something to you your brother was very brave i know this thing maybe its hard for us but we cant pretend it didnt happen we dont talk about it it goes away but then they go away too look at hans he never talks about daniel now it reminds him once its there in your head what does he mean ben asked liesl my mother was anxious she had pills for that so one night too many maybe an accident we dont know heinrich she said to him not for sure ach he waved his hand so its not for sure and thats why hans wont talk about it but its in his head the kind of idea that can lodge there ben thought so you come back to it over and over use it something people dont want to be sure about a car off the road a fall something theyd rather not see not even laid out in a pattern a convenient way to make people look away he talks about it to me liesl said quietly forgive me its the schnapps i dont mean anything by saying this i know but your brother kaltenbach said switching tack that was someone right past the guards not a drop of sweat always an answer whos this the signature you know hard to read petain on a laissezpasser imagine petain but they believe him he cocked his head looking at ben i used to think so different but now i see it not the looks something else dont you see it liesl doesnt he remind you she looked at ben for a second then finished her glass its late she said standing up at the hotel there was a message in bens box someones here liesl said apprehensive but it was only a flyer from a bar down the street offering the first drink free stop worrying ben said handing it to her think how easy it would be to do here who would know somebody in the alley another one they were in the hall now kaltenbach opening his door so goodnight thank you again he hugged ben clamping him on the back then kissed liesl youll knock get some sleep liesl said softly lock the door you too she said to ben as they moved down the corridor its not safe it is tonight were off the map for one night anyway and then what she stopped at the door hes so old she said nodding to kaltenbachs room all of a sudden you just havent been looking no no one has she touched the bandage on his nose how is your rib he shrugged the brandy will make you sleep you must be tired its not easy all this he kissed her forehead easier than getting over the mountain she looked at him eyes darting across his face suddenly tearing up whats wrong i cant do it twice what the border you him now you what if it happens again she ran her hand over her eyes its the brandy go to sleep its going to be all right how do you know she said her head still down was it all right for him she started shaking fighting back more tears ben put his hand to her cheek stop its too many parts i cant do so many which one do you want she sniffed a stifled laugh war bride thats what i want turn here feel this be that not these heinrichs memory youryour what she raised her head i cant do it twice im not him no she said her head sinking again her voice breaking no one is she began to shake harder pitching forward with sobs trying to stop by gulping air so that for a second he thought she might be sick and then she was letting go her shoulders suddenly slack and drooped as if her body were sliding away from her he put his hands on her arms holding her now i do this she said after all this time all this time my god what a place he followed her glance down the hall the dim sconces and fraying carpet ssh he said letting her forehead fall on his chest a child whod just tripped cut her knee do you know what he said when i asked him to stop the work do you want me to walk away the same words you say it and hes saying it blurted out in a rush unscripted all day hes there still there she started shaking again and he put his arms around her holding her but then the words came back and this time he listened went still the smell of her suddenly different someone he had never held before he tried to think of her somewhere else their own time but his mind went blank because he saw that she had never been there already taken somebody elses he drew in a breath stunned by how fast it had happened maybe this is how you died without warning without the chance to hold on one minute it was there and then it wasnt she moved her head back as if she had felt the shift too some fluttering away and looked at him biting her lower lip for a minute neither of them moved letting the air settle its not your fault she started but that seemed wrong and she stepped back her hand over her mouth its late im not making sense rewinding pretending it hadnt happened but too late no one is spoken out loud there everything different wheres your key he said a disembodied voice i can do it im sorry she was wiping her face its justi dont know some foolishness but still looking at him seeing something go out of his face irretrievable too much brandy she put her hand up to his neck just a touch uncertain then turned with her key lock your door he said in his own room still dizzy with it he stood smoking and looking out the window the room dark except for the weak pool of light by the reading lamp there were a few people below moving in and out of shadows a car radio playing why didnt it all look different everything had changed in a beat and no one in the street had the faintest idea broch had already organized the plane anna will meet you in mexico city so someone you know theres a group there they can help you with the arrangements did you have any trouble at the border no they didnt even look yes its like that if you want to stay of course you need a permit you might consider mexico for a while its not a bad place broch was short with thinning hair and a soft german accent bavarian or even austrian you mean here kaltenbach said well mexico city but of course there are business opportunities here he wore a rumpled tropical suit and mexican sandals and ben imagined him in cafes arranging shipments bordertown business one eye to the door no i want to go home kaltenbach said broch looked surprised at the word but didnt say anything then took ben aside are they looking for him the authorities no no its all right nothing illegal no risk to you i only ask he looked back at kaltenbach now huddled with liesl everyone here is waiting for a quota number to get in but he leaves can you get him to the airport we should go there were more hugs kaltenbach looking wistful liesl had stayed near him all morning solicitous but also shy of ben watching him with side glances unsure of things so ill see you in the kino he said to her ten feet high make a sign eh like this he touched his eyebrow then i know you dont forget i wont forget she said brushing his lapel and you my friend he said to ben i can never repay you just dont tell anyone how you got here our secret who would ask theyre going to interview you you know that the prodigal son kaltenbach looked away it means wasteful you know maybe its true wasted years its not serious here its too much sun i think he looked up at the hot mexican sky already a bright reflecting tin we need clouds sometimes but what choice was there in the car liesl was restless checking the passport in her bag then turning back to the dusty streets lined with open stalls when they stopped at a corner a woman in a peasant skirt rushed over to sell them a ceramic madonna i hate it here she said were almost out i saw you give him money she said hell need it you think this is bad he nodded to the street i wish i thought we were doing him a favor here we go the crossing booths were now just down the street got your passport just once not to be nervous i think theyre going to send me back every time dont worry about the mexicans no them she looked toward the american gates my own she said ironic and with this head so much to drink last night putting it behind them one glass too many the evening hazy and vague how do i look he turned you look fine but different as if he had changed glasses the exact same features subtly altered a shift in definition she seemed unaware of it her skin just as it always was her hair falling loosely on her shoulders the way she had looked yesterday but something had been said and now he saw it through a different lens everything the same but different the mexican guard barely glanced at their papers but the american flipped through her passport buy any smokes liquor no you been away how long just overnight purpose of your trip tourism ben said deliberately not looking at liesl letting the guard do it an unmarried couple he took bens id card just a minute he said turning in to the booth whats wrong liesl said under her breath nothing the guard was on the phone then he was back okay pull up over there he pointed to a building on the right whats the trouble just pull up over there he said beginning to walk beside the car still holding their papers two men in suits hurried out ben put the car in gear and headed slowly to the building oh my god liesl said her voice panicky its probably just a spot check ben said a willed calm check for what get out of the car one of the men said hands on the car he said when ben stepped out the other began to frisk him whats going on ben said is there some trouble that depends on what what you have to tell us you want the cuffs the other man said but the first shook his head tell you about what the man flipped open a wallet to show an fbi badge lets start with espionage ambush they separated them taking liesl down the hall her eyes startled and jumpy like a deers and leading ben into what seemed to be a lounge for the border guards a big coffee urn in the corner he sat at a table across from yet another agent answering questions not complaining or hesitating because he saw that was expected the air hostile and hoping the questions would tell him what had happened all he knew was that the letter hed given riordan had set off an alarm in the bureau still ringing after a while the questions began to repeat themselves as if asking them again would produce different answers but the agent was no longer bristling settling in for the long haul he offered ben a coffee is this where you tell me i have the right to call a lawyer you dont have any rights how about a cigarette then that allowed the agent put an ashtray on the table now can i ask you a question no you seem to forget i called you you wouldnt be here at all if i hadnt given you the letter last time i heard we were on the same side so whats the question who are they the names the agent said nothing not even a day and youre here jumping on me i didnt know the bureau could act that fast so they must mean something to you they pop up in the files or did you just know he shook his head i cant you dont have clearance dennis didnt dennis doesnt have clearance either not even before not now just you even though ive already seen them so why ask who do you think they are the agent said turning it around communists hardly the agent said unexpectedly amused lets hope not anyway then how is this espionage the agent looked at him over the rim of his coffee cup youre in the army know what an order of battle is organization commanders in the field this is a kind of order of battle okay its important thats all im going to say we need to know where it came from so do i the agent raised his eyebrows i think somebody on it killed my brother who by the way in case nobody told you used to work for you i know that he said tersely which makes it all the worse is that it you think he was a spy your own guy the agent put down the cup not responding neither do i so you want to know two things where it came from and where it was going it didnt end with danny what was he going to do with it anyway hes dead and it still came so who was it for the only person you know it wasnt for is me or i wouldnt have given it to you in the first place you following where it comes from i dont knowthats for you to figure out but whoever it was on this end maybe i can help you with the agent stared at him help us how he said finally well lets talk about that but first can i assume that im not under arrest and we can start this over or do you want to keep grilling me for two cents id except youre flying blind here ive been listening you came all this way lets talk talk the agent said his voice low dragged out of him first liesl youre not going to charge her eithershe knows less than i doand youre probably scaring her to death she was his wife was ben said is and mexico we were giving a friend a lift nothing illegal dennis says dennis isnt even allowed to know who were talking about and if hes already told you about kaltenbach you know about mexico so were wasting time you dont make friends easy well we started off on the wrong footyou throwing me against a car and accusing me of things it put me off can we get liesl now he said then seeing the agent hesitate im the only shot youve got how do you figure that whoever wants the letter thinks i have it he tried to kill me for it i think hell try again the agent looked at him for a minute then pushed back his chair with a scrape and walked over to the door im agent henderson he said turning halfway liesl was brought in a few minutes later her face still pale drained you all right she nodded mute i thought youd better be here for this its going to concern you because of heinrich she said still puzzled no danny they think he was passing secrets what well receiving anyway he turned to henderson is that right close enough secrets liesl said confused almost sputtering like a spy daniel no its a mistake what secrets classified information was sent to him by name his address we dont know for how long once would be enough to the house the cherokee ben said his other name the place was used as a mail drop i dont believe it how would he knowsecrets he didnt have to know them he just had to pass them on ben looked at henderson assuming he did what do you mean by that they were sent to him but we dont know that he picked them up do we we can assume but we cant prove it the guy who went over the balconymy burglar ray police find a mail key on him henderson said nothing you must have asked given your interest or didnt anybody think of it we asked and great partnership he said when henderson didnt answer look i can find out anyway but i thought there was some urgency here he stared at henderson its important henderson nodded then said now tell me why because he didnt take mine so he already had one dannys which he either took from him or which danny never had its possible somebody else picked up the mail he looked at liesl its also possible danny did either way and either way hes part of it henderson said he had to know about the mail yes not necessarily what was in it small difference not to us ben said including liesl anyway ray had a key which means whoever hired him gave it to him which also means he doesnt have it anymore and thats where we come in he said to henderson back up henderson said guy goes to the cherokee checks the mail but nothings there because id already picked it up so he checks the apartment still nothing and after he knocks me out he goes through my pockets and still nothing then he goes over and now the police have the key but not the letter or all kinds of bells would be going off so whoever hired him is stuck no key no letter but he knows it was sent so where is it you have it henderson said quietly right and the important thing is that he doesnt know were having this little talk he doesnt know i gave it to you unless somebody leaks we dont know where he has friends nobodys going to leak make sure okay or he wont move he wont take the bait the bait being you henderson said ben nodded what are you talking about liesl said bait if the letters already here i must have it if its still on its way then id get it no other keys not to mention he wont want to risk checking the boxes at the cherokee after what happened police might be taking an interest so if he wants it he has to get it from me with any luck before i start asking anybody about it so he doesnt want to see me with anybody he looked at henderson no watchdogs but liesls a different story thats why i wanted you here so youll know i want you to put someone on the house he said to henderson not sitting out front in a hat either a gardener maybe something like that but whos there all the time and somebody right behind when she goes out so shes always covered youre taking the case over now you were going to put some guys on me werent you just switch them to her hell watch me he has to think its all right to make his move try to kill you you mean liesl said which he might do henderson said and then were nowhere and youre dead thats the chance youll have to take youre the one taking the chances liesl said you dont have to do this hell come anyway hes already tried once besides we have some names to protect ben said leading him protect you moved in hours if you had files on these guys criminal files youd be rounding them up so theyre in the other files which other files security clearance is my guess of course im not cleared to know does it make any difference im putting myself in a gun sight for you henderson looked at him ill see what i can do id need approval protect yourself liesl said dont act like this you should have someone you wouldnt even know he was there henderson said we can do that hed know and then hed know you were after him hed duck we have to do it this way ive got a guy looking into who hired ray its a back way in but maybe well get lucky otherwise what guy a reporter knows a lot of rats sorry i cant say whoyoure not cleared very funny how about the bureau issuing me a gun a gun liesl said alarmed one of the other agents knocked and opened the door phone he said to henderson in a minute its long distance berkeley henderson frowned annoyed i have to take this he hurried out of the room closing the door behind him leaving them alone the air suddenly thick with quiet this is what you think he was a traitor its fantastische i dont know how can you say that i know because youre still in love with him she jerked up her head meeting his eyes for a minute then looked away you take everything too seriously i didnt mean i didnt see it maybe i wasnt looking what difference does it make his widow thats one thing his wife she smiled grimly to herself still staring at her lap not seemly she was still for a minute then got up pacing to the other side of the table so now you want to get yourself killed to prove this first an informer now what from bad to worse thats what you want to get killed no i want to talk to him talk to him i want to know what happened what danny did not guess know why he looked at her so i can let him go she stopped folding her arms across her chest swaying slightly holding herself in and me she said before he could answer henderson was back the same brisk hurrying any luck ben said with what the san francisco postmark wasnt that the call berkeley henderson shook his head something else we have other cases believe it or not now we were you were going to get me a gun were not a store youd have to be deputized fine its a family tradition working for the bureau maybe this time itll be for something worthwhile not just chasing communists henderson turned to him youre a little mixed up on this he said how i told you those names are like an order of battle the only people interested in that now are the communists thats who your brother was working for riordan shortstopped him in the hall you dont want to go in there not even near not the way he is today hed do it with his bare hands riordan was carrying an envelope in a rush his eyes darting toward the parking lot whats the problem are you kidding warning kaltenbach cmon before he sees you then how about you going in there quiet and getting my copy of the list and ill be gone forget it get it from the bureau ever see him crossed he paused whyd you do it anyway i mean who was he to you nobody just a friend of the family they both turned as the door opened minot coming out so fast he almost bumped into them youve got a hell of a nerve he said to ben what are you doing here dennis i thought you had something to do he slammed the door behind him lets go or do you want me to have frank throw you out he began hustling everybody down the hall congressman i dont want to hear it just get out you come here again therell be orders to call the cops you hear that frank he said to the guard at the door take a good look at this one you want to remember if he shows up yes sir they were outside now minot watching his car pull up he was an old man ben said to him there wasnt much to squeeze thats not for you to decide is it he said his voice fast a whiplash or maybe you think it is he looked at ben it isnt he was my witness and hes gone dennis he nodded toward another car pulling into the lot lets get the subpoenas served before paul revere here has any more ideas what subpoenas you think im going to let this happen again once is a lesson twice is stupid i learned my lesson thanks to you he stopped his face breaking into a jagged smile thats right isnt it theyll all owe it to you maybe we should let them know make you a popular guy he switched tone i didnt want it like this i wanted more time do it right now i dont have a choice i have to use a net but theres something to be said for surprise he smiled to himself again catch the lawyers off guard mine too you going to put a lamp in my face i dont want to see it again ever i trusted you he shrugged another lesson in life youre a lot upset over very little that depends maybe youre right maybe i dont need him at all but i sure as hell dont need you so im throwing you back another smile well let the others take care of you he opened the car door and got in dennis make sure he gets out of here what others ben said after minot had left what taking care of me he meant something by it he gets mad thats all he likes to get even in other ways such as targeting continental they get to go first kind of a payback to me thats crazy you shouldnt have crossed him when is this as soon as the subpoenas he stopped get out of here okay you dont have to warn anybody theyll know soon enough maybe nobodyll connect the dots to me the dots in his head the other car had pulled up hey kelly ben said still picking up pollys laundry kelly took the envelope from riordan a little embarrassed anything yet on ray i just put out a feeler yesterday and then you got busy ben said looking at the envelope is polly getting a lead this time or still playing shill whats it to you i like to see you get ahead kelly looked at riordan a thanks for the envelope im doing all right ill walk you to your car riordan said i can find it ben said youre busy they watched kelly drive away so who were they in the letter riordan said i dont know they wouldnt say they wanted to find you in a hurry you know what i think they dont know they were looking to me to tell them riordan made a face skeptical communists havent you got enough ben said cocking his head toward the office riordan didnt bother to answer maybe well run into each other some time lunch at the market ben headed for his car then turned watching riordan go in so who were they friedman someone the san francisco operator didnt have a few names lodged somewhere in the back of his mind the rest in a drawer unavailable he looked at the building the guarded back door minots office would face the side street he followed it toward the front entrance on wilshire trying to guess which windows were minots there both open now but locked tonight high enough to require a jump to catch the sill and then what he saw himself dangling in the street pulling himself up breaking the window the sound of smashing glassimpossible something even the partners would find absurd the way into any office was through the door he skirted the building going in through the wilshire entrance also locked at night presumably part of franks rounds he walked down the long hall to minots office then stood near the door behind the translucent glass he could hear voices dennis and the secretaries did they all go out to lunch together but then theyd lock it he looked at the doorknob the keyhole in the middle something frank could open with a master key but not ben a man came out of the next office and crossed the hall to the restroom looking at him ben took the knob pretending to enter until he heard the mens room door close then noticed frank turning the corner down the hall he jerked his hand away and went into the next office statewide insurance an outer room with three secretaries yes are you here to see mr herbert no ii think ive made a mistake congressman minot next door on your right thanks he said hesitating listening for frank then saw that she was waiting and that he had to move he opened the door and looked down hiding his face but frank had passed he hurried back to wilshire the files still behind him at the studio people already knew minot was going to make a move the power of hollywood gossip ben thought impressed again no warning flares needed bunnys been with lawyers all day hal said but nothings happened its going to pollys got a column tomorrow she says its about time for what housecleaning makes you think of a duster joan leslie doing a little tidying up ben glanced at him surprised at his tone but youre all right i mean hal nodded smiling a little but you had to ask didnt you take a walk around the lot you can feel it people just waiting to see bunny came in without knocking oh good both of you hows your head he said to ben and then at his expression you made the papers well the burglar did some building still a little sore can you work we need to get this wrapped up sure why you think youve got a headache wait till the messengers get here with their little papers tomorrow the next day the suspense is killing us except its not going to we stay on schedule he turned to hal two things the overrun was not authorized its an army film let fort roach do the processing he stopped taking in ben too we bring it in on budget or we bail i mean it second i need to see you in the office this to hal his voice lower me i want you to talk to the lawyers hal took a step back his whole body a question mark whats going on ben asked for him you know schaeffer over at fox we made a picture together hal said suddenly hoarse well theyre going to want to know everything he ever said to you the lawyers need to prep you slow down a minute ben said whats going on a runthrough bunny said rehearsal for taking on the majors minot wants to show them how disruptive this can be what it can do to your business encourage them to be friendly just like were going to be he said looking now at hal all friendly witnesses we understand the gravity of the situation and he goes away and we close the door and were still here then its jacks turn and zanucks andand they wont even have to be told they watched him do it to us now okay my office theyre waiting hal left without saying a word who else is going to be called ben said were not sure were trying to anticipate talk to him i thought you were pals and what would i offer him you i gather you annoyed him even wounded he pointed to bens head i dont want to make trouble for the studio do you need me to take a walk youre not making trouble hes making trouble were easy the first bite small enough to chew and spit out he thinks you notice hes not taking on warners or metro yet just somebody he can push around he looked up at ben he wants to tear this industry apart to make himself a star so we help him and then we help him move on youre going to cooperate bunny glanced at his watch now look at the time he raised his head bens eyes still on him im going to keep things going call liesl by the way and get her in here sick day we send somebody over there and shes off on some joyride with you dont bother he held up his hand it wouldnt even be good the point is that we have to move up the picture tick tock we may have a hole in the schedule we cant go into christmas without an a why would you have a hole in case a pictures in trouble bunny said turning away in case we had to shelve it if someone were testifying bunny looked at him then put both hands to his temples didnt i tell you its already starting why dont you help and just save the questions want an aspirin youll feel better wouldnt that be nice bunny said heading for the door bunny before you go i cant hear you studio have a locksmith bunny stopped surprised im having trouble with my door thats all lucky you rogers carpenter shop two hundred and fortyone no detail too small rogers like everyone else wanted to be in the movies what kind of lock like this ben said touching the doorknob similar to minots the scene calls for the guy to pick the lock trouble is nobody knows how its actually done so i figured you you dont need a pro for that anybody could pick that get a yale maybe a dead bolt you can stretch the scene but this is what we have you only find these in buildings like this standard spring the guards are the security hotels sometimes theyre cheaper the door chains your real lock this is a heist theyd have to pick something a lot stronger no just an office so maybe hes not a pro how easy is it rogers took a slender rod from his tool belt and holding the door ajar inserted the rod flicking it up in one quick motion that released the lock thats it show me this groove here put her in there all the way to the right then up youre going to do this in closeup youre better off with a yale ben tried it twice before it worked can i borrow this sure smooth slice up you could jiggle have it slip or something but thats not going to fool anybody you should change the lock b en waited on the wilshire side until just before closing the problem isnt getting in he said to liesl its getting out after six everybody goes out the back that hour theyre heading for the lot so id have to get past frank unless hes not there youve explained it i just need a few minutes keep him with you your boss mr herbert whos going to kill me if i dont do those papers tonight why are you doing this because the bureaus never going to help what names the only thing theyre willing to do is let me get killed okay lets go park on the side street and wait for the window shade then do my scene with frank funny now ill be you he looked at her puzzled in the series the one who helps the good one he went in through the wilshire door moving quickly down the hall late for an appointment there were only a few people around stragglers or assistants doing lastminute jobs cleaning ladies collecting waste baskets lights still on in minots office probably a secretary with a letter to finish riordan he knew had already left he went into the mens room took the last stall and sat down to wait the building was alive with sounds when you stopped to listen a typewriter click footsteps somebody laughing then nothing for a while just the creak of the building settling the scrape of a chair when someone came in everything sounded loud the splash of pee the running water a throat clearing ben imagined himthe insurance agent adjusting his tie then the thud of the door closing it got darker earlier now even in california and ben watched the window over the sinks get dimmer he got up and switched off the overhead light then peeked out no lights at statewide but somebody was still in minots office what if she stayed late theyd come to clean the restroom soon mopping everywhere but then minots door swung open one of the secretaries with fresh lipstick locking it behind her then checking it by twisting the knob ben ducked back behind his door listening to her high heels going down the hall give it a few minutes in case she forgot anything the hall needed to be clear there was nothing suspicious about being in the mens room not yet once it got dark though no story would work he waited for what seemed like hours but was probably ten minutes then opened the door again no one the only sound the clang of a pail near the wilshire end the cleaning ladies starting he palmed the rod and crossed over to minots door act as if youre using a key he inserted the rod jagged right and up but nothing happened again why did he assume they were all alike it must be a different mechanism he tried left a variation his hand tense then stopped taking a breath feeling a bead of sweat on his upper lip but it had been so easy at the studio dont overwork it think of rogerss hand the deft flick right then upward he tried it again almost making a sound of relief when he heard the click inside there was barely enough light to see the shades halfdrawn liesl would be outside watching minots personal office was in the next room but all the files were out here where the staff worked for a second he was tempted now that he was in to go through minots desk but that would be actual theft not just collecting something of his own he crossed over to the file cases what if riordan had already taken it out something he didnt want minot to find but it was still there in heinrichs now useless file ben folded it quickly and put it in his jacket pocket now get out before the cleaning staff started working its way down the hall he returned the file and went over to the window pulling the shade then raising it back into position and waited by the door it would take at least a few minutes for liesl to talk to frank helpless and panicky ben jumped his skin tingling when the phone rang was someone supposed to be here for one terrible second he expected it to be picked up in the inner office but it kept ringing so shrill that everyone must hear and then finally stopped he breathed out his ears still filled with sound listening now to the hall why so worried everything was fine what hed expected there were even footsteps now a womans voice liesl on time he put his ear near the edge of the door to hear better liesl was thanking frank slightly scatterbrained someone likely to have forgotten her work they were now at statewide liesl thanking him again as he used his passkey take him inside two three minutes and ben would be out he opened the door a crack they were going in liesl still talking keeping him busy now he opened the door he saw them before he heard them two shadows followed by the sound of footsteps clunky not furtive he pulled back in banging his shoulder and listened closer then frank was back in the hallway alert congressman he said thought you were catching forty winks somewhere minot said genial no just helping next door little lady forgot something could liesl hear or would she blunder out into the hall ben slid his hand toward the knob turning the lock quietly hoping the sound would disappear under franks voice if it were open minot would wonder he looked toward the window frantic too late to fiddle with the sash lock under a desk did liesl think he was already gone but what choice would she have once shed got her papers a new voice now minots guest the shadows were larger against the glass another look around the office nobody hid under desks something out of mack sennett minot was taking out his key ben tiptoed away from the door next to the filing cabinets there was a supply closet not a real closet with a door you could close just shelves covered by an accordion screen he wedged himself behind his back flush against the shelves trying not to move anything this wont take a minute minot said opening the door he flicked on the overhead light ben glanced to his leftdid he make a shadow but i did promise and you know peoplethink nobodys busy but them i can imagine bunny said ben went still his mind racing almost jumping again when the phone rang thatll be him minot said picking up and talking the words bunching together slipping past ben just business a meeting with bunny arranged by whom minot just another union another negotiation bunny was walking around the room politely distancing himself from minots call maybe looking out toward the hall where liesl would be any minute but shed see the lights realize people were here ben imagined her in the hall being swept down toward the back door by her own storyshe had the papers why stay her voice now to frank dont say any more if he could hear it bunny could youre a peach she said you saved my life distinct to him or was he the only one listening bunny preoccupied then the sound of her heels everything okay congressman frank said his head in the door minot nodded and waved him off now hed follow let her out and shed go to her car expecting to find ben alarmed when she didnt dont come back sorry about that minot was saying now where ginny was supposed to leave here it is ben heard the ruffle of paper we can talk more in the car i think i know what you need you understand our records arent anything like this ben imagined him waving to the cabinets no these are the best anybody has thanks to jack tenney its understood that mr l wont be called bunny said i see no reason for that at this juncture minot said oddly formal hes not mayer no real press value for you and the studio heads might see it as an attack close ranks we wouldnt want that besides im not sure he really understands what this is about he dropped his voice hes out of it thats understood he hired schaeffer minot said so did zanuck anyway he said switching tack who talks to writers people on the set not the front office we can help you there what kind of charges are you going to bring charges this isnt a criminal trial im not looking to send anybody to jail takes time and then you make martyrs out of them of course if he perjures himselfbut i doubt that dont you especially with all the corroborating testimony schaeffers a commie and he knows we know i dont want to put him away i just want everybody to know hes there anyway the public isnt going to care about schaeffer theyll want he stopped evidently aware that he was saying more than he needed actors bunny finished stars well lets just say people they know not necessarily reds maybe just people who are as concerned as we are friends i understand bunny said interrupting him faces for the newsreels well just so we do understand each other minot said annoyed how mutual interests work the studios the committee we want to be on the same side here as i say im not looking to put people in jail im expecting the studios to do their own police work you wouldnt want one working for you would you there was a pause not even a suspected one bunny said quietly taking this in thats right and once people know the studios feel this way that its about their jobs i think well have a whole different situation you fire one everybody sits up theyll know its not going to be tolerated not in american movies you dont want to employ people who are against everything you stand for you get together on this hell you could put the committee out of business their jobs bunny said then why not give us names we can take care of it before you have to call them saves expense maybe in time but right nowi dont have to tell you about the value of publicity to get things rolling thats mothers milk to you people preview of coming attractions thats right we understand each other for a minute ben heard only the clock ticking mr l is out of it bunny said and the union contract thats not in my gift but i can promise that mr stein will be otherwise occupied that should help things along funny how theyre always jews isnt it well i have to get going do me a favor will you and reach behind get me an envelope for this there should be a box of manilas in there ben fixed his eyes on the edge of the screen what an animal must feel he thought finally outrun trapped a rush of blood to the head then an eerie stillness everything stopped waiting a hand then a body blocking the light bunny turning ben reared back flattening himself against the shelves as if he could disappear out of bunnys startled gaze he expected bunny to jump but instead he put his hand to the shelf maybe to steady himself still staring a second passed then another neither of them making a sound so that of all the things racing through bens mind what stuck was bunnys control a will stronger than shock and then it was too late for him to say anything the moment over both thinking not breathing trapped by each other the door slides minot said theyre back there somewhere maybe coming to help ben made his eyes go to the shelf beside him a direction then repeated it like a flashing light i see it bunny said reaching to the box on the shelf his hand grazing bens shoulder complicit now by his silence suddenly bens protector they looked at each other a whole exchange without words beyond the obvious question ill have andy drop you home minot was saying his voice sounding closer no the studio bunny said still looking at ben i have a meeting somebody i need to see his voice now pitched directly at ben unmistakable he took the envelope then pulled the accordion screen closed hiding ben here you go he said handing it to minot and it was only then ben heard the first waver bunnys nerves finally engaged not wanting minot to know this late well i know how that is come on ill get you back i feel good about this i think we got something done tonight ben heard them cross the room and then the light went out and the door slammed he breathed out the blood coming back and realized he was sweating he nudged the screen back trying to do it silently give them a few minutes he looked around the dark office hed have to use the window after all he leaned against the wall waiting thinking about the conversation their jobs he was going to get the studios to do it for him and they would buying time feeding him one piece at a time staying percent american even bunny who understood would have to give him somebody a face to start with he thought suddenly of bunnys face as it had been guileless a freddie bartholomew tear running down his cheek an orphan if you were fired at one studio youd never work at another it would be understood the way minot wanted it some headlights went by outside the window minots or just another car not yet he looked at the files any one of them and then he knew who it would be the pragmatic choice the file was right here easy for him to take would it make any difference you could reconstruct a file if you remembered the sources knew the cross references had the time and minot now was in a rush danny had tried to help her once never reported a thing she must have meant something to him ben glanced at the file drawer again right here be danny one more time he went over to the files and flicked through the tabs miliken millard miller he took it out bulky and put it in his jacket feeling his blood rush again he glanced around a thiefs involuntary gesture then closed the drawer and went over to the window trying to estimate the drop not far the first floor but youd have to dangle a second before you dropped or risk your ankles just the second a car might be passing but everything seemed quiet wilshire was always busy but the side street mostly took the outflow of the parking lot he waited another minute listening then opened the window and swung out when he was over still hanging from the lintel he tried to reach up with one hand to bring the window back down but it jammed and putting his weight on one hand made it begin to slip so he brought the other back and let himself down dropping slowly until he was a few feet from the ground now he hit the ground just as a pair of headlights swung around from wilshire he was wincing from the dull shock of the jump but forced himself up before the light could reach him a crouch would be suspicious your body told the story somebody walking heading for the lot the car passed liesl was still down the street i didnt know what to do it was bunny wasnt it what was he doing fixing things he thinks drop me at the studio i told him id be there he saw you what did he say nothing he was more upset that i saw him kind of thing you like to do by yourself what make deals she was quiet for a minute moving them into traffic whats going to happen i dont know she fixed on the windshield shivering a little its like before today at the studio i felt it the way it was before the war the quiet nobody talks everybody knows and nobody talks so its like that again there were a few lights on in the admin building but bunnys office was dark so ben headed over to the screening room he touched the letter in his jacket aware suddenly of the shadows and the deserted alleys between the sound stages a perfect place to wait no shots another crack on the head fatal this time carl oblivious at the gate while someone went through bens pockets bunny was alone in the screening room running a picture just a minute he said motioning ben to sit watch this not rushes an old feature claudette colbert in a gold lame evening dress clearly gold even in black and white watch her wiggle in the seat a society party people listening to a classical singer she got in with a pawn ticket and now theyre onto her barrymore knows look at the way they size each other up but ben was watching bunny his face soft with pleasure living in the picture even as he talked now hedda makes the announcement see the one with her back to us thats polly polly mm her greatest performance hedda gave her her start with the column watch barrymores eyebrows nobody could ham like that the way they play off each other her eyes its perfect isnt it claudette was getting up summoned by a butler and bunny picked up the phone stop it there jerry thanks his eyes were still on the screen as the lights came up one week at the paramount and its gone but it was perfect that look like a grace note thats what were supposed to be doing here putting in grace notes making things better whats the picture midnight before the war he got up theres a sequence i wanted to see a bit with taxis but i dont think we can use it he turned to ben what were you doing there if you dont know youll never have to answer that ben said feeling the weight in his pocket bunny looked at him then moved away running his hand over the back of his seat i suppose you heard everything behind your little arras faint mumblings i should have had a sword run you through but i find i never do have one when i need it he stopped dont interfere in this ben nodded noncommittal i mean it just put it out of your mind well both do that what were you doing though catching up on my filing they make interesting reading not anymore stay out of it dont give him anybody you think im enjoying this he walked down the aisle away from ben its business thats all no its going to get worse not for us bunny said quickly look im walking a tightrope here he lifted his arms from his sides a little a balancing mime dont shake it dont huff dont puff he looked at ben dont anything or youre off the lot mr l or no the back door to the cherokee was kept locked now so he went through the front past the new night clerk attentive maybe a bureau man planted too late upstairs he flicked on the light before going in and flung the door open in case another ray was waiting he opened the french windows to let in some air then went back to the door and wedged a desk chair under the knob would he really try here again dropping somehow onto the balcony ben sat on the bed and pulled out the sheet of names wallace gilbert no more recognizable than before not here not in san francisco friedman he stopped a name he had heard literally heard a voice saying it but whose he tried putting it in peoples mouths to see how it would soundliesl bunny anyone he knew but nothing came still hed heard it somewhere on the lot lasners party let it go if you tried to force it nothing came you had to let it pop into your head he looked at the door again barricaded what his life was going to be like now what if he never came but hed want the list unless hed decided to write it off as a bad risk move on still hed tried once a man dead a day two or hed have to use more bait minot presented the hearings as a preliminary factfinding inquiry something local but he was staging them like a full washington investigation the press had its own section in the hearing room behind the newsreel cameras but half were still outside covering the witnesses arriving a premiere without the broad smiles the public seats filled almost immediately with a few front rows reserved for the witnesses studio vips and anyone with a friend on minots staff ostermann surprisingly was in the press section near polly who kept leaping up and down to talk to people then scribble notes a blur of eager restlessness the committee sat at a long table not a raised judges bench but the arrangement looking across at the witnesses and their lawyers still had a courtroom effect what ben noticed most was the noise the galleries buzzed with talk in the side rooms telephones rang almost constantly and aides ran back and forth with messages when minot came out to take his place at the table the hum rose even higher the room busy anticipating ben thought of a coliseum scene in the old silents everyone in jerky motion waiting for the lions the first bang of the gavel was startling followed by a murmur a second bang quiet minot his face flushed with confidence gave the opening speecha great industry undermined from within the values and moral fabric of the culture itself at risk the unwitting comfort extended to traitors in our midstand then just a few seconds before the audience could get restive called dick marshall i thought he was going to start with stein bunny whispered half to himself a logical choice the strike still daily news and steins sympathies so well known he would have been an easy first shot but for once bunnys instincts were off not the point minot wanted to score as marshall approached the table there was an audible rustling of interest a movie star someone ben suddenly remembered whod once actually played a gladiator it was clear from the first moment minots head nodding with respect that marshall had come as a friendly witness there to add a glow and demonstrate that he was as american as everyone assumed him to be there were soft questions and patriotic answers more nods from the committee dicks very presence his concern somehow affirming their own bunny watched carefully head on his pyramid fingers marshall was continentals most valuable name a marquee favor to minot but why call him ben looked at his tanned smooth face an arm dangling from a chaise minot he saw was ignoring the continental row there were complicit glances at the rest of the audience direct appeals to the cameras but he never met bunnys eyes acknowledged the gift marshall was his now you yourself didnt serve in the military minot said no i was f perforated eardrum bunny sat up but didnt say anything maybe a question not in the script but of course you served your country in other ways i did what i could yes during the bond drive we raised well i meant more just by doing what you do your pictures i can tell you when i was in the pacific there were times the boys thought you were winning the war singlehanded everyone laughed and marshall tilted his head modestly i had a little help about four million guys in fact theyre the ones who won it christ ben said under his breath dont snipe bunny said but i think we can all agree minot said morales important too as someone who did see active service i can tell you those pictures meant a lot to us now i wonder if i can ask you about one of them in you were in convoy to murmansk you remember that sure i was in the navy in that one escorting a convoy of freighters wasnt it dick nodded dodging uboats dodging uboats now of course they were all over the atlantic and the book the movie was based onwere you aware of this was english about convoys heading for england convoy it was called that was the original title of the picture too the first script i mean oh the original and were you going to england in the script yes then all the sudden murmansk now why is that do you think i dont know that would have been up to the writer the director i just say the lines the director the writersame fella on this picture is that right on convoy to murmansk minot said emphasizing the last word right milton schaeffer you ever ask him why he changed it just in a kidding way made things harder to pronounce the places in a kidding way and what did he say well at the time we were trying to show how all the allies were in it together he said this was a way of bringing russia in including a new russian character he looked down at his notes andrei malinkov soviet naval attache dick marshall couldnt get through the baltic himself is that it dick smiled the idea was we were working together he knew the mine fields americans and russians side by side just like they were any folks let me read you something he picked up a paper were not just carrying food equipment were carrying hope theyre taking a terrible beating we have to help how can we eat if theyre going hungry recognize that i said it in the picture its in the book too of course then youre saying it about london now itswhat leningrad you think its the same thing london leningrad is that what mr schaeffer said dick gave a side glance to his lawyer who nodded a cue he said the suffering there was even worse in russia but nobody was doing pictures about it this would help draw attention that we needed to help the russians help the russians minot repeated well that we certainly did the ships in convoy excuse me convoy to murmansk were carrying lendlease millions and millions to help those people mr schaeffer said were suffering so much know how much of it theyve paid back not one cent not one kopek he looked up did you ever suspect at the time that mr schaeffer might be a communist no sir marshall said appalled no you dont find that word in the script not once just those friendly russians but they must have been mustnt they why not call them communists i dont know maybe youd have found that harder to say maybe everybody would have found it harder to watch better not to tell people what the picture is really about thats how they work how would you feel now about convoy knowing what you know today another glance to his lawyer bunny still staring ahead i guess id ask to be taken off the picture if like you say it wasnt good for america all my pictures ive always thought they were a hundred percent american mr marshall no one here is questioning your loyalty were just concerned that some people might use it for their own ends maybe you need to be a little more careful in the future not just say the words think a little bit about whats behind them a school principal to a truant yes sir dick lowered his head slightly ben thought of him climbing into the fighter cockpit eager to take on japan and saw that the nod had been the real point of the testimony a kind of salute to the new commander at the long table anyone else on the committee have a question if not i think we can take a short break youll be available to us later if we need you he said to dick congressman im here to help i believe in fighting for americaand not just in the pictures ben glanced across at the press section everyone was scribbling but ostermann his eyes fixed on minot that was fine bunny said to marshall his lawyers were gathering up papers from the witness table nice to say that about my pictures seeing them over there what he said was that he was in the pacific and you werent thats all anybody heard still never mind you were fine the fight line was good theyre all going to use it i meant it thats what makes it so convincing bunny said not missing a beat i didnt know where he was going with the f but it was fine where he was going well we dont want anybody poking lights in your ears do we anyway its done he put a hand on dicks shoulder polly he said spotting her dick that was wonderful wonderful read the column tomorrow she said patting him youre going to be very pleased she turned to bunny i have a bone to pick with you oh polly a very small bone i hope you promised me an interview with liesl and youll get it when after the picture opens i thought shed be here today why isnt she she said her voice pointed now youd think shed want to be here with dick polly shes shooting some of us have to work of course she wanted to be here she also wants to get the picture out you mean you do because ive seen it you wont believe how good she is bergman he held his hand up being sworn in have i ever lied polly laughed you no you dont have it in you a heart to heart i promise the kind you like just let her finish polly waved this off see where im sitting right next to the other mann maybe ill get him to ask somebody with influence call my office in the morning ill have wendy set it up anyway i thought you were doing dick a companion piece you should want this she said tapping bunnys arm it makes her more american especially after today i could tell ken was pleased its a great thing hes doing bunny watched her trail after dick then turned to one of his assistants wheres rosemary i thought she was supposed to be here rosemary ben said she hasnt been served yet the assistant said thats funny bunny said frowning a detail out of place go call and see whats up why rosemary ben said walking out with bunny he cant lean on schaeffer all week wheres that going to get him murmansk wheres rosemary going to get him bunny looked at him stay out of this in the hall people huddled in groups smoking dick marshall posed for a few more pictures ben made a circle looking for ostermann and instead saw henderson leaning back against a fire extinguisher what are you doing here sure henderson said reaching into his pocket right here then in a lower voice take out a cigarette i thought you didnt want us to talk i thought you werent going to follow me ben said leaning forward for the light im just watching what things see whos watching you its a good place for it whod know i figure hed like to keep tabs i would i was him and its early now you got your light clearance come through yet on those names im working on it youre welcome he said louder nodding ben stood for a minute stymied dont ruin this he said henderson smiled what your unexpected demise im looking forward to it as long as i see who does it he moved off leaving ben to watch the crowd could he really be here someone on his way to the mens room the photographer who wasnt anybody when the hearings reconvened ben had dick next to him bunny on his other side why start with you bunny said to dick still preoccupied with the order of things im just glad to get it over with but theres no build here they come this time minot did look at them an unexpected anger at first ben thought it was directed at him the kaltenbach grudge but when carol hayes was called a fox contract player minots eyes were fixed on bunny gauging his reaction bunny clearly surprised shrugged back hes doing this wrong he said why her picture in the papers below the fold bunny said dismissive ben watched the newsreel cameras track her as she moved to the table motors whirring who is she priscilla lane diana lynn bunny said casting i mean here probably a schaeffer picture at fox but he just did that theres no build carol hayes the cameras like her bunny frowned somethings wrong he leaned across again to one of the publicity staff and whispered sending him out of the room and you talked to mr schaeffer about the script minot was saying i didnt want to she said you know you dont like to make trouble but i just didnt feel comfortable with some of the lines on the seventh take bunny said under his breath and why was that they didnt seem i dont think its like that in this country i mean my dad was a businessman and he just wouldnt have done that what happens in the picture ben thought at first that minot was heading somewhere with this but after a while saw that he was just treading water everything hayes said her fear of being used to promote an underlying message had been said after she stepped down another break bunny caught minot as he passed i dont understand what youre doing he said quietly a private conversation as people passed around them no not exactly what we agreed is it i dont like sloppy seconds either you people minot said an undisguised contempt look at that off to the side carol was smiling her face lit up by flashbulbs then why did you you want to protect your property that it and i get this so the surprise is on me live and learn whod you use him he jerked his finger at ben handy andy no he wouldnt have the balls one of your studio goons probably but ill tell you something the next surprise is on you i cant call her without the filethatll take a while to put together again but theres always another way a little whisper and theres no end to the shit they can stir up he turned his head toward the reporters you shouldnt have done it i dont know what youre talking about minot dropped his voice who do you think youre playing with you fix parking tickets you dont fix me not me i still dont no then maybe she did it herself such light fingers he said wriggling his it doesnt matter youre both fucked ken can i get a word in edgewise a voice behind them polly minot said rearranging his face stepping back you there all this time now dont run away ive been trying to get you all morning theyre running the column out front as the news in addition two stories and a picture thats a mighty good start minot said smiling mm im doing the color bunny you dont mind do you ill bring him back in a minute who else are you calling schaeffer you bet he looked at bunny and thats just the first day what was that about bunny said when they left light fingers i dont know ben said a little shaken back in the supply closet waiting to be caught but she wouldnt be called something for danny ive never seen him like that thats who he is bunnys face ashen just a minute ago hardened hes not going to do a thing about the consent decree then make it harder for him dont give him people bunny looked up well now i havent it seems this isnt your doing is it is that what you were but why would you he said talking to himself you know what hell do now he turned toward the door watching minot leave hell feed her to polly before we go into release henderson seemed to have disappeared now just another hat in the crowd but ostermann was there standing alone by a window looking out its usually gone by this time he said nodding to the fog not today no sun dark times eh you havent been taking any notes are you really going to write about this if he calls germans then its something for aufbau brecht at least i would think wouldnt you hed make an interesting witness its a farce ostermann nodded it always begins that way nothing to trouble about then each day a little more well thats not so serious either and then one day youre writing your piece he said one eye still looking for henderson a short man with wirerimmed glasses surrounded by lawyers was crossing the hall drawing photographers away from carol hayes schaeffer he guessed ostermann smiled just thinking out loud he looked at the crowd they dont see it its new to them but its the same a farce so say nothing and then its too late like us in the hearing room bunny was still talking to the lawyers at the witness table so ben was forced to take the open seat next to dick their shoulders touched as he sat down a slight brush then a quick drawing away and suddenly ben was aware of him as a body the height of his shoulders his bulk filling the suit hands placed on his knees waiting his tanned face oblivious to any change in the air around him ben invisible what had it been like had dick stood by the pools edge watching her legs open and close or had that scene been just for him the sounds the way she clenched him ben turned facing the long table something that only happened to you what everybody felt each time was it over someone else she hadnt loved still dannys wife the sound of the newsreel cameras made him look up minot was calling milton schaeffer the tone in his voice with its hint of blood sport almost gloating had made everyone sit up carol hayes even dick had just been there to set the stageschaeffer was actually a communist but as the cameras followed him bens attention shifted to them the familiar whirring sound suddenly distracting like someone whispering in his ear newsreel cameras minot shuffled through papers a promise of evidence to come as schaeffer approached the long table and was sworn in he seemed slighter than he had in the hall wiry and pale minot kept putting his papers in place letting a hush fall over the room before he pounced mr schaeffer are you now or have you ever been a member of the communist party no one had expected a direct jab at the opening and it might have worked caused the excitement minot had clearly been hoping for if schaeffer had been defiant or uncooperative or even evasive instead he answered minots questions with a resigned fatalism that seemed to diminish their importance yes he had been a member of the party no he had resigned in august after the signing of the nonaggression pact no he had not attended meetings since he knew the names of the national party officers known to everyone but not any of those in the local chapter dont know or dont want us to know minot said names werent used no names but they had faces youd recognize them if you saw them i suppose its been six or seven years you didnt stay friends it was a discussion group notwell just a discussion group what did you discuss political theory he still believed in the plight of the underprivileged but no longer felt the cp was an effective tool to help them his testimony was listless and damp like the fog outside waiting to be burned off minot had clearly been expecting something else and finally he saw that schaeffers answers easily given made him seem no more threatening than the bank clerk he resembled the cameramen looked disappointed not interested in the quieter drama schaeffer politely ending his career hes losing them bunny said are you seriously suggesting to this committee that for five years five yearsyou were part of an organization that owed its loyalty to a foreign power and this was a youthful indiscretion i have never been loyal to any country except the united states i am an american at no time during my association with the party was there any question of disloyalty when the party adopted a position that i felt was not in our interests i resigned and up until then they acted in our interests what i thought should be our interests yes should be a rude awakening then when you found out what the partys interests really were a smart fellow like you ought to have known dont you think or are you trying to sayits some defensethat you didnt know what you were doing i thought i did i thought i knew when i got married too things change people laughed grateful for a light second minot used his gavel mr schaeffer do you think these proceedings are a laughing matter schaeffer looked around not yet just a gentle poke to the side a tap but this got a laugh too i can assure you you wont be laughing when were finished this committee doesnt think subversion is a joke this country the rest was lost background noise as ben stopped listening again the laughter small as it was was taken by minot as an affront and ben saw that bunny was right he was losing the audience confusing them his confidence turning petulant even his staging was off he had kept the other witnesses in the room but that meant they were now only a few feet away from schaeffer avoiding eye contact their testimony suddenly personal everyone smaller one of the publicity assistants hurrying in squatted down next to bunny leaning over to whisper in his ear what bunny said out loud minot looked up then smiled to himself bunny left huddled with the assistant half the room watching what did he say ben asked dick dick shrugged something about lasner a summons from the studio bunny on call even here but when he came back ten minutes later his face was grim disturbed something more than a studio crisis ben looked at him waiting theyve called mr l bunny said ben took a minute thinking this through he can get it delayed he said bunny shook his head theyll tell the papers he asked which means he has something to hide does he dont be ridiculous the only reds he ever knew were fighting cowboys bastard bunny said looking toward minot to drag him into this minot noticing smiled again bunny left for another call then two more a small frenzy of activity back and forth i have to get to the studio he said the lawyers want to coach him hal too hal ben said he worked on convoy bloody picture we didnt even make money on it we didnt dick said i thought in second release yes the trades liked it they said i dick nobody could have done it better bunny said impatient his tone weary like rolling his eyes i have to get back before he could leave however minot had called a break and they were trapped by the crowd in the hall bunny schaeffer said extending his hand dont worry nobodys taking pictures bunny shook it im sorry milton you know what its like he looked around the hall i know what this is like anyway hows sol theyre calling him milton sol what for what for because i worked for him no hes doing a picture with stalin what for this wasnt my idea bunny i have to run milton bunny theyre not going to pick up my option not after this i can work quiet no credit i cant milton bunny said meeting his eyes i cant he glanced over schaeffers shoulders look sharp here comes judge hardy schaeffer moved away without bothering to turn as if minot were a scent hed picked up in the air you said you wouldnt call mr l bunny said his mouth clenched we both said things call it off the subpoenas been issued dismiss it you think the studios run this town dont you nobody elected the studios hes not a good enemy to make neither am i dont get yourself in a swivet you tell lasner to behave he cooperates everybodys fine he gets to be a patriot and i get to send a message to whom you think its still twenty years ago picture people can do anything they want what did comrade schaeffer say things change dont do this i mean it you mean it he made a face i appreciate the advice want some more professional youre flopping in there minot blinked then looked at him steadily thingsll pick up tomorrow ben decided to leave before minot had finished with schaeffer the testimony had grown repetitive used up once schaeffer had admitted to being a communist minot was left with the less exciting story of what hed actually done discussion groups and petitions and rallies no one remembered still a red in the industryhow many more he found hal in the cutting room finishing the last of the camp footage i thought you were with the lawyers ben said i was now im supposed to be thinking of anybody who could have beenyou know so i thought id get this done in case things get busy i hear dick did a little flag waving its that kind of occasion what did the lawyers tell you be polite dont volunteer make him work for it whatever thats going to be ben leaned toward the moviola didnt we already cut this i was just trying something what seeing how it would work without the artkino footage he said selfconscious trying to be casual how does it ben said quietly you dont want anybody saying he looked away its just in case you have to pick your fights you want this made he ran into lasner in the admin mens room a surprise since his office had its own bathroom lawyers its the only place i can get some peace lasner said to him in the mirror his face sagged slightly withdrawn the way it had looked during the street fight on gower trying to make sense of things so you were there whats he going to want keep himself in the papers for a while no from me ben joined him at the sink to go along treat him like a big shot thats what bunny says itll blow over whatll blow over i dont know a man comes eats in your house you make a party for him and then this so maybe bunny doesnt know what hes talking about either it worked with dick it was all right did i know i was hiring commies jesus christ milt schaeffer if thats what the russians got we dont have a thing to worry about hes not trying to make you look bad i thought you knew something about pictures he raised his hands framing you argue with him youre a commiesticking up for them same thing you dont argue yes sir youre an idiot for using milt in the first place either way hes a smart guy and youre a putz ben said nothing so thats what everybody thinks bunny you keep your head down be a putz he can make trouble for the studio lasner nodded conceding the point when did that happen ive been thinking about that when did we let that happen he wins either way ben looked at him suddenly back with ostermann a little bit at a time the next day a steady drizzle came with the morning fog blurring visibility everything beyond the next block only halfseen through a gray scrim bad weather anywhere else was just part of life here it became disturbing a form of disillusion wet palm fronds drooped pastel stucco walls streaked grime without the lighting effects of sunshine the city was shabby the realtors promises turned into streets of disappointment traffic barely moved the hearings would start late ben turned on the radio to cover the dull squish of the windshield wipers and found minot on the news an interview from the federal building predicting more revelations wheres the front line in this war not some ditch some atoll in the pacific its in everything we see and hear the values our children are being taught the commies dont fight where we can see them theyd rather sneak something in with the popcorn go to berlin ben thought theres a front line theremachine guns and checkpoints right out in the open talk to some of the dps the ones from the east watch how they scuttle away from the soviet soldiers an animal fear but minot never brought up the genuine horrors the show trials and mass executions communism was for him a purely domestic threat the russians the visible menace werent on trial milt schaeffer was whod left the party in assuming anyone really left danny apparently hadnt working for them according to henderson right up to the end but doing what playing both sides against each other or only deceiving one or had the loyalties become so tangled that he no longer knew ben grimaced seeing danny at the witness table facing the committee finally answering for whatever hed done except that he had already answered minot started with hal jasper at first ben thought bunnys lesson taken that minot was building his case then realized there was a pettier motivehe wanted to make lasner wait he had been the big draw earlier in the hall fay on his arm both smiling for reporters now wedged in the continental row with bunny and the lawyers he was just another witness with minot calling the shots mr jasper its our understanding that mr schaeffer requested you for convoy to murmansk were you aware of this no in writing theres a memo to that effect ben glanced over at bunny something that could only have come from him in more cooperative times can you think of any reason why he would do that no hal said again not giving him anything youd never worked together before no had you done any action pictures before convoy one or two what were their names do you remember hal looked puzzled wondering where this was going apache trail one or two others these were westerns yes not war movies and yet mr schaeffer requested you someone who had no experience with this kind of picture why do you think that was the process is the same youre still cutting action scenes i see posses convoys it makes no never mind hal said nothing waiting it couldnt have been for your political sympathies could it no minot smiled pleasantly just your western expertise id like to show you a photograph put it up here on a screen so we can all see it behind him a slide was projected hal fighting in gower street now that fellow there center right i think we can all agree thats you ben saw lasner shift in his seat restless like to tell us where this is outside continental and what were you doing there trying to get to work thats quite a commute you have there from the looks of it minot said getting a laugh now isnt it a fact mr jasper that the police were called in to break up a union riot isnt it a fact unless theres something wrong with my eyes the photograph shows you in that same riot fighting with a policeman in fact and isnt it a fact you were later treated for injuries at continental with howard steinpractically brought in together is my understanding thats the howard stein whose affiliation with the communist party has been under investigation for years that howard stein and thats his union outside in the picture and you in it throwing punches with the rest of them now he said pausing for effect i dont doubt that milton schaeffer a selfconfessed communist confessed right in this room in fact admired your skills with western movies but isnt it just possiblei cant help feeling theres a chance of thisthat he also liked to have people around who agreed with him politically requested people like that especially when he was about to make a few changes to the picture changes to make us feel a little better about the russians id just have to say this was possible now im not asking you to tell us which union you support or how you votedthats your business im just saying things like this he said pointing back to the screen might give somebody the impression you lean he broke off covering the mike with his hand as an aide whispered in his ear excuse me he said after the aide left now lets talk about convoy yesterday we heard how all those bundles for britain ended up going to the soviets instead was that already settled when you came on the picture or did mr schaeffer discuss it with you no no he didnt discuss it with you thats right well now thats interesting because we have testimony and well get it sworn in later that mr schaeffer actually reshot scenesa pretty expensive proposition im toldafter consulting with you do you recall that we didnt have enough reaction shots he took a few more thats all reaction shots of who brian hill thats the fellow playing the russian make his part bigger that the idea in that scene yes quite a bit bigger in fact thats where he talks about the russian people isnt it how theyre hungry because the nazis took over their farms now some of us were under the impression that all started a little earlier when the soviets did it forced them into collectives but were not here to give history lessons and neither was convoy to murmansk i guess just make the russians look like allaround good guys that was more the point wouldnt you say hal said nothing wouldnt you say minot repeated im not sure i understand the question well not so much a question more a general impression of the picture i thought schaeffer did a good job considering considering what he had to shoot it in a tank technically its a headache navy pictures i meant your overall impression of the story line what the movie was saying hal shrugged it was a uboat picture a war picture did mr schaeffer ask you to feature the russians when you edited scenes no but you did in this scene you cut to whoever has the dramatic moment who the audience would want to see and in this case theyd want to see lieutenant malinkov our friend from murmansk what the hell is this about lasner said his voice low but loud enough to be heard in the row fay put a hand on his arm shushing him were you aware at the time of mr schaeffers political affiliations no ive been told that the editor is the unsung hero on a picture the one who makes the real decisions what we see up there thats pretty much what you want us to see how you want us to feel about it you agree with that you can only work with what they shoot a modest man but mr schaeffer put a lot of trust in you from what i hear he gave you pretty much a free hand easier when somebody knows what youre after heart in the right place so to speak id like to return for a minute if i may to mr stein your comrade if i can use the word in that little dustup on gower street was that the first time youd met him no oh you knew him then ive met him i wouldnt say i knew him whered you meet i dont remember exactly somebodys house socially come now mr jasper it was a little closer to home than that wasnt it would you like to identify the name elaine seitzman for the committee shes my sister seitzmans her married name yes a housewife and a secretary isnt that right yes a paralegal secretary howard steins secretary for a while isnt that so her firm did some work for him once thats a lot of years ago got arrested with him in fact a public disturbance or maybe she was just on her way to work too he said smiling to the audience it seems to be an unlucky family that way she introduce you to howard stein she may have i dont remember i only met him to shake hands even though she was working for him her firm worked for him all right im not here to contradict you her firm she stay with them no she left after she got married but she kept working this time for the government care to tell us in what capacity as a paralegal i meant which branch of the government turns out it was the nlrb minot said picking up a note thats the national labor relations board for anyone here doesnt know is that where theyre recruiting now howard steins office ben noticed ostermann raising his head at this interested this was eight years ago hal said all right well bring things closer to the present day if you prefer you know the public records a useful thing memory can play tricks on us but when youve got something down in black and whiteim thinking now about a paid ad in the los angeles times open letter to president roosevelt with your name on it ring a bell organization called the motion picture european relief fund decent size i guess whole bunch of names on the letter would you like to tell the committee what the fund was for to help refugees get out of europe get them here in other words here cuba mexico whoever would take them these were jewish refugees not all not all what were you asking the president to do change ins regulations to allow more refugees in and did he do this no there was congressional opposition hal said looking directly at minot maybe they were a little uneasy seeing who was making the request those people died hal said simply even minot paused well now i doubt that was congresss intention they still died minot nodded i think everybody here knows that mr jasper we fought a war to stop it all of us but right now id like to look at that letter you were sending the president remember who was on the steering committee no you dont well like i said have something in black and white and it comes in handy let me refresh your memory he picked up a piece of paper quite a list but id like to draw your attention to the ss milton schaeffer howard stein he looked up maybe this is where you met him to shake hands what hals a red lasner said to bunny jesus christ this is the guy you said was going to help us was minot was reading more of the names gus pollock passed away sadly but im sure you know mr pollock wrote more than letters in fact he got a cowriter credit on convoy he paused for effect its a small world isnt it mr schaeffer mr stein mr pollock and of course yourself all in the same letter we could go on with this he said raising the paper but i think you get the point a small world but you and mr schaeffer never discussed any changes a small world but you didnt know mr stein from adam in that street brawl he shook his head its quite a memory lapse were talking about here he glanced at the aide why dont we recess now for a few minutes he looked at his watch say fifteen give it some thought mr jasper maybe something will come back to you there was a rush for the phone booths in the hall the sound of matches being struck we can go in here bunny said indicating a large room that had been set aside for witnesses and lawyers im not going to sit around here all day lasner said take it easy fay said its one day if he gets around to it were looking at lunch next then what forget it ill be at the studio tell him to call me when hes ready you cant bunny said what im under arrest you could be if you leave sit fay said i know you like this sit down before you break something they have coffee bunny said im awake lasner said so we just wait till hes good and ready to ask me what is milt schaeffer a commie he already said so so whats the news and what the hells this about hals sister whos she supposed to be rosa luxemburg who nobody he wants to play sheriff thats all lasner looked at him sheriffs are the good guys this isnt right a cutter for chrissake were supposed to protect our people hes got four lawyers sol ours all he has to do is be polite yes sir no sir thank you and its over thats our legal strategy sol all right all right ben watched him go over to hal lasner consoling and blustery hals shoulders sagging keep an eye on him will you bunny said to fay hes not happy because he has to roll over and play dead hes not good at that just dont let him pick a fight what do we win i have so much influence minot wants to embarrass the studio if sol doesnt but now he was distracted by one of the publicists with a small stack of phone messages continental not yet running by itself he listens to you fay said to ben sometimes she patted his upper arm a kind of reply then went to join lasner bunny was looking at the top message now breimer in casting hes going right through the studio everybody who worked on convoy you gave him schaeffer ben said quietly schaeffers at fox bunny said an automatic reply then looked up i didnt give him schaeffer they already had him as a party member your wonderful brother probably if you want to be technical about it you gave him the paperwork to set it up and now hes using it against the studio he wouldnt be if someone hadnt he broke off isnt it a little late in the day to be splitting hairs like this or is it all supposed to be my fault funny how things go missing maybe next time they should check the closet ben said nothing i still dont understand what she is to you who who does it matter she doesnt deserve this who does hal my god reaction shots he stopped as if his train of thought had run out all right i thought schaeffer would buy us a little peace in our time and now its biting us in the ass and now im the one putting out fires he held up the messages im just saying dont give him any more i dont have any more do you actually think there are communists at continental or did you find someone else on your brothers list his list ben said looking up whatever he was feeding minot if there are lets not keep our cards too close to the vest ive had enough surprises oh god liesls father he said spotting ostermann over bens shoulder down here with the field hands he thinks im ruining her her von sternberg or something imagine run interferenceive got to call breimer before he throws a fit he paused look blame who you like theres plenty enough to go around he said looking pointedly at ben but right now were circling the wagons i could use some help go keep an eye on mr l will you he trusts you i cant think why ostermann had been talking to polly his improbable new friend she writes down everything he said to ben amused everything he says her cicero but youre not still nothing for aufbau no whos on trial for once not the germans the comintern no the new deal i think a political exercise itll burn itself out ben said glancing toward the cameras in the hearing room not yet the start only across the room hal was now standing with his lawyers listening as he sipped coffee his face pale making his five oclock shadow even darker schaeffer who had requested him sat farther back in the room smoking looking at the rain so how do we stop it ostermann shook his head i dont know in books a brave man does it fights back but ive never seen that happen they went back to their same seats only bunny missing still on the phone schaeffer was on the other side of the aisle quietly wiping his glasses people talking around him when he glanced over presumably unfocused not really seeing anything ben felt it had been to look at him some reminder of danny whod fed minots files could he really ever have imagined schaeffer as someone dangerous one of the old comrades who needed watching ben sat up but he hadnt known him then schaeffer had left the party in before danny had arrived which meant danny had got the information from someone else his reports always checked out riordan had said if he said to look there was something to be found because hed been there too ben had assumed like the meeting with macdonald but not this time so who had told him the party didnt keep files to rummage through like minot you had to know be part of its secret world mr jasper i believe you testified that convoy to murmansk was the first time youd met mr schaeffer no no no i said it was the first time wed worked together he nodded apologetically im trying to be precise we appreciate that mr jasper minot said but irritated unable to spring some minor trap so you knew each other a little could you quantify a little for us mr jasper a few times more than once five times ten times to be precise minot said playing to the room hal raised his head not answering for a second as if he were taking aim more than once less than five somewhere in between this was at his home once and the others around around well well get to those later right now id like to go back to the meeting at his house it wasnt a meeting a party minot moved some papers in front of him maybe were not talking about the same occasion im referring to the evening of march you were one of the guests i believe that sounds right i cant be exact on the date the evening im referring to had people giving speeches for the european relief fund do the parties you attend usually include speeches it was a fundraiser and a party i see minot picked up a magazine are you aware that red channels lists the relief fund as one of their suspected communist front organizations no ben saw lasner take out a pad and begin to write a memo he must have forgotten trapped at the hearing and how had you come to be invited to this party i was a contributor so you gave some money to this organization and mr schaeffer invited you to his home this was in the nature of a thankyou partly i guess and the other part was to raise more money did they actually collect cash hal looked at him steadily checks mostly not just spare change then who else was at mr schaeffers party hal glanced quickly at the lawyers some code theyd been waiting for i dont remember other people from the relief fund i guess the ones in the letter you have but you dont remember which ones precisely minot said biting the last word was your wife there yes your sister no it was an industry event people in pictures so you remember their occupations but not who they were lasner squirmed in his seat jotting something down again his breathing audibly impatient minot pulled out a copy of the letter lets see mr schaeffer of course how about howard stein was he there another quick look to the lawyers i dont remember gus pollock i think so im not sure not sure ben friedman was he there writing checks friedman bens mind went to dannys list friedman but not ben hed remember his own name another friedman a voice saying it he looked away from the table trying to remember hearing it instead one of the newsreel cameramen was changing film the other camera still whirring ben friedman minot said again no alfred alfred friedman he jerked his head toward the cameras hearing the name then stared not moving afraid even a blink would make it go away newsreel a voice in a newsreel alfred friedman the camera panning across a group of men suits and uniforms minot was talking again but his voice had become a background sound like noises in the woods bens mind racing what did it mean a man in the group follow the logic his thoughts ran everywhere at once water rushing downward separating branching off until it was stopped blocked then backing onto itself if he knew friedman he knew the others who they must be follow the logic like gravity one step flowing down to another then a split a whole branch that led nowhere stopped at paseo miramar unless genia had been an accident after all something that didnt need to fit the cameras kept whirring but his mind was moving even faster in a panic now because while things snapped into place a dread was spreading through him where all the logic led danny doing something that could not be forgiven he felt himself growing warmer as if the body could literally burn with shame his brother someone ben hadnt really known at all what one of bunnys assistants whispered but ben shook his head nothing and faced forward again he tried to listen to minot something again about schaeffers party but kept hearing friedmans name in the newsreel assuming it was the same friedman he needed to be sure something more than instinct one foot then the other but he kept moving in leaps if he was right then the list wouldnt be enough bait theyd run to ground not take any risks now hed need to offer something more a direct threat exposure he glanced toward the press section pollys hand moving on a pad as she watched hal testify ostermann looked up his features suddenly liesls the fine stretch to the chin and ben met his eyes for a second then quickly went back to polly did he owe danny anything now was there ever a good reason for betrayal anyway how could you betray the dead this one would be for the stillliving assuming it was the same friedman he got up crouching the way people left the theater halfway through phone he said to the assistant the allpurpose excuse this time true in the hall he felt his pockets for change heading for the phone booths long distance he said getting the coins ready the call took a while to put through but only a few minutes once the connection was made afterward he sat in the booth his hand still on the receiver the first piece but not everything the water still running in too many directions even now when he thought he knew what danny had done his mind kept drifting back to the cherokee to police details instead of what he really wanted to know why he looked up across the hall bunny was standing in the witness room no longer on the phone not doing anything in fact just leaning against the wall and staring his chest moved in small heaves ben got up and went over directly in his sight line but bunny seemed unable to see anything until ben was in front of him then a quick blink startled his throat moving in spasms as if someone were choking him cutting off his air he swallowed constricted you all right he didnt answer just swallowed again his eyes talking now screaming somewhere mute whats wrong bunny looked down at the phone then back at ben hes gone he said a whisper all the sound he could manage jacks gone then nothing another swallow trying to breathe now that it was said when something to fill space last night this morning bunny said vague but less ragged ben looked at him not sure whether to touch his arm a gesture that might seem too intimate instead he nodded go they dont need you in there but bunny still didnt move mesmerized by his own news all the echoes of it they just called ben said trying to keep his attention they had to wait bunny said mostly to himself his eyes getting moist for the first time until they got the next of kin they have to do that tell them first they didnt want to wake her who his mother in oregon they had to tell her first hes been there all morning go ben said again really theres nothing you can do here anyway she wants the body shipped back she can do that ship it up there he hated it up there he looked at ben catching himself i have to see him before they do that ben nodded go i cant bunny said looking down at his hands an invalid displaying his paralysis i dont think i can drive ben looked toward the hearing room then gripped bunnys elbow come on in the car bunny said nothing staring blankly at the halfvisible streets as if the rain were in his head not something outside the window ben had to hunch over the wheel peering out watching for lights and corners is there anyone else besides the mother he said trying to draw him out but bunny didnt even turn his head me he said theyre going to ship him up there after that ben let him drift his eyes fixed out the side window they took washington all the way out through culver city past the white colonnades of mgm maybe next on minots list more stars than there are in heaven the rain stopped in venice leaving just patches of fog on the coast highway at the sunset turnoff ben thought of paseo miramar the sharp curves as slippery now as they had been when genia had driven up why an invitation to feuchtwangers but he didnt know her a convenient excuse for the other car though if anyone noticed but no one had as they got nearer the hospital road he could feel bunny stirring beside him sitting up straighter gathering himself he even glanced into the side rearview mirror a lastminute dressingroom gesture closer than blood how close was blood anyway more than obligation scraps of shared memories were he and danny even the same blood type onegative the universal donor another thing he hadnt known that didnt matter but ottos blood had binding danny in a kind of loyalty oath while ben had been somewhere else or was that just another excuse another out for danny what possible out could there be to have done what he did at least it wasnt in action bunny said suddenly they just send you the dog tags at least hes here they went straight to macdonalds room not bothering with the front desk but it had been emptied out the stripped bed not yet remade the personal things in the bedside cabinet already taken away ben thought of his mothers hospital room another body whisked away before anybody could say goodbye the white loneliness of it danny wouldnt know until a cable reached him an ocean away and by that time ben had arranged the burial all the family gone now except for the thin stream of flimsy vmail sheets the last blood tie but how close was blood where is he bunny said to the nurse whod hurried after them hesdownstairs theyre preparing the body hes going to be i know i want to see him were not supposed to i want to see him bunny said not any louder but in control ben remembered that first day at continental people making way as bunny walked by he waited in the room smoking on jacks balcony while bunny went downstairs no mention of how it had happened but people never liked to talk about that how easy it had been to make danny an accident convenient for everybody he touched the rail thinking of the cherokee why kill him if he were passing on the list unless he wasnt another danny fast one but not fast enough or unless they were just covering traces wiping every pawn off the board danny not important enough to be worth the risk of what he knew better if it died with him everyone safe he turned hearing bunny come back you okay yes fine bunny said his own voice again embarrassed to be asked thank you for coming a polite receivingline phrase as if the panic choking and the drive out had never happened its not easy ive done it what been with somebody after bunny walked closer to the bed i had a scene once in a picture my grandfather i think everybody upset in floods but its not like that is it theyre not really there just a body im sorry bunny bunny glanced up at this then let it in nodding he touched the bed frame there wasnt anybody here when it happened he was alone he stared at the bed for another minute did i tell you his playinghe had the lightest touch mr jenkins sorry to intrude a woman in a suit not a nurse some papers to sign she looked over at ben hesitant someone she hadnt expected not next of kin either and for a second less than a blink ben felt what it must be like to be bunny every quick disapproving eye movement trying to explain him papers bunny said yes for the shipment the additional charge the expense isnt covered in the monthly rate i pay to ship him im sorry i understood you were the responsible party my records say all expenses bunny looked at her a final twist in yes thats right all expenses yes he looked down at the bed again for a minute everyone just stood there not moving and yet it seemed to ben that he and the woman were disappearing wisps of fog the room itself receding so that bunny was completely alone ill be with you in a minute bunny finally said an executive dismissal then turned to ben youd better get back mr l will want watching i can wait no we have some things to do here he said did his mother give any instructions she said whatever you decide did she the navy blue then i think the worsted not the uniform where did you put his ties he turned to ben well be a while but how will you get back ill have the studio send a car he said in charge again it doesnt really matter now if anyone knows he stopped glancing at ben still its nobodys business ben met his eyes nobodys he said he started back down to the coast highway but had to pull over at the second curve unable to see through a new bank of thick fog he felt back in the hospital room everything white gauze and empty sheets bunny standing in a void but this white was moist air beginning to drift the other had been still an absence the dead are gone and yet we hold ona loyalty a debt to make up for something didnt he owe danny that much to let it die with him a crime that could only bring shame now paid for but who had decided that what do we owe the dead dress the body the blue worsted keep the memory intact what did he owe henderson willing to use him as bait there were all kinds of debts even finally one to yourself do the expedient thing or the crime would go on maybe taking him with it dannys name was a price but the dead never blamed you he sat for a few more minutes trying to think the list wasnt supposed to stop at dannys mailbox but nobody had moved yet playing safe he had to make them come for it something public a spotlight theyd have to put out another car was coming up the hill grinding slowly around the curves the sound muffled a little like the newsreel cameras for a second he was back in the hearing room and then he was looking across to the press section ostermann watching quietly and polly scribbling beside him he found lasner with the lawyers finishing lunch at ristorante rex the kind of place where they usually brought clients to celebrate deals all black enamel and art deco oceanliner trim today the mood was anxious lasner fidgeting impatient wheres bunny he said when ben took a seat something came up serious ben shook his head knowing lasner meant a studio problem hell be here later he said vaguely so will we by the looks of it lasner said glancing at his watch the goyim like a long lunch you should eat something yourself fay said talking to hal like that hes a commie his sisters a commie hal he couldnt wipe hals shoes nobody cares about hal one of the lawyers said an attempt to smooth things over i care about him lasner said i didnt mean that i just meant he wont be that way with you hell want to play it friendly while hes stabbing me in the back where fay said running her hand over it a calming smile you hit the studio you hit me i built the studio hes not hitting the studio sol the lawyer said patiently i told you hes making some noise in a day or two hell take it somewhere else already were getting calls from the exhibitors whats going on why all these people from continental you know we dependwe dont have our own theaters well neither will anybody else the way things are going the lawyer said they get nervous were the first people they say no to theyre going to fuck mayer some language thatll sound wonderful in there fay said he sends eddie mannix sol said ignoring her all the sudden theyre booking musicals again he paused you know how long i know hal his father was cutting for sennett sennett for chrissake before that nose wipe was even thought of well theyre thinking of him now the lawyer said and listening so lets all just take it easy you know what to do yeah i know lasner said still with a hint of defiance but ben could hear the nervous tremor under the bravado as wary as anyone brought before a judge i never knew milt schaeffer was a red im as surprised as anybody i would never have hired him continental doesnt hire reds were certainly going to be more careful from now on thanks to you congressman you want to see me hit my marks too they took studio cars the few blocks back whats with bunny lasner asked ben a little fire to put out you know everythings a crisis with him sometimes you have to step back see the whole thing thats what you should do step back fay said youre getting all excited you see hals face he said quietly why would you do that to him guy like that you know him he said to ben he try to sign you up for the party labor agitator yet where fort roach you see the way he looked the car pulled up to the curb theres polly ben said ill meet you inside that bitch lasner said wonderful fay said be sure to say that when youre on polly was surprised then skeptical what kind of drink to talk i have something for you what something you tried to peddle to ken youre not exactly flavor of the week there he didnt level with me hes not leveling with you either she looked up at this caught suspicion part of the air she breathed what do you mean six thirty she hesitated for a minute then started to turn dont waste my time im not ken ive been doing this a lot of years you have something for the column call my assistant it doesnt check out dont call twice i dont just print things they have to check out then well see not for the column the news page really just for me and to what do i owe the favor i want something from you ill bet itll be worth it one drink youll want to hear it what did you mean about ken thats what were going to talk about hes a friend of mine polly she looked at him whats this all about six thirty you pick the place you dont want the story at least you get the drink i could give it to kelly but i figure you could make a bigger noise a hundred twentythree papers a hundred twentyseven on the other hand he could use a break hes lucky hes still got a job there working for you on the sly not very nice of you she narrowed her eyes enjoying this well im not very nice thats why i thought of you lasner was already seated at the witness table when ben got to the hearing room this time the lawyers sat behind not flanking him a subtle shift to suggest that he wasnt on trial as schaeffer had been just there for a friendly exchange minot started with a formal appreciation for lasners giving up his valuable time to help the committee implying that hed offered to come no subpoenas necessary the approach was courteous minots way of signaling to the other studio heads what to expect his conciliatory tone something their people would notice and report back nobody was out to get anybodythey were after all on the same side now mr lasner you are the president of continental pictures how long have you held that title since nineteen fifteen i started the company and before that it was mesa pictures that was one there were a few others we combined them to make continental i see so a mighty oak from several acorns not just one he smiled either at the line itself or lasners obvious confusion over it you could say that and how long have you lived in this country how long all my life well not quite all your life since i was a kid and before that where were you born poland minot looked at a paper yes except then it wasnt poland was it where you were it was part of russia from what i hear in washington its going that way again hard to keep them out this as an aside to the committee but pitched to the audience so you were born in russia lasner sat up straighter his eyes now fixed on minot we thought of it as poland but not officially and after you left russia you came here and became a us citizen yes sir and worked your way to the position you have now a great american story its a great country lasner said and may i ask your religion lasner glared back at one of the lawyers a canheaskthis expression i dont practice a religion he said but you believe in god i hope your parents then what religion were they lasner looked at him steadily for a minute an assessment hebrew hebrew thats right why do you ask minot leaned forward as if he hadnt heard what why do you ask is this strictly a curiosity question or are you saying im not saying anything mr lasner just trying to establish your background for the committee i thought we were here to discuss communists one of the lawyers touched his back the way you pat a horse to slow down indeed we are now if you dont mind let me ask the questions i dont mind thats what youre here for but maybe i can save us both some time youre a busy man so am i i didnt know milt schaeffer was a communist when we hired him for convoy as a matter of fact from what we heard here yesterday he wasnt so im not sure what this is about he had been mr lasner im sure you remember that testimony too you mean its like having diabetesonce you get it it never goes away there was some laughter at this and minot tried to ride with it mr lasner is known for being a colorful figure in the industry he said to the audience then looked back to the witness table but i know he agrees these are serious matters you say you didnt know mr schaeffer had been a member of the communist party but you did hire him to direct a russianthemed picture is that correct it wasnt about russia when we hired him that came later why did you hire him then he was available and he works fast we had a deadline you hire somebody like wyler wed still be on the convoy this brought enough laughter to make minot bang his gavel mr lasner he said wearily all right why he knows his way around a set i liked his work and i like him he turned his head slightly toward the row where schaeffer was still sitting behind lasner the lawyers huddled there were no political considerations then what political considerations it was a picture now mr lasner minot said switching tack you may not think about politics but continentals a big place i dont imagine you do everything yourself who exactly decided to hire mr schaeffer the line producer wouldnt it be a thing like that it stops with me it doesnt matter who the line producer was you think i wouldnt know youre just trying to get me to say mr lasner im not trying to get you to do anything but answer the question no youre saying i didnt know what was going on in my own studio a bunch of commies come in and pull a fast one thats where youre going with this well nobody pulled anything nobody was a communist not that i knew of milt i dont know he says no under oath i believe him you make a big deal he requests hal everybody requests hal hes the best cutter in the business something youd know if he stopped hearing himself but only for a second rushing now and gus pollock you try to bring him in make it seem mr lasner wait a minute he took up one of his papers with notes passed away you said i hope it was just a mistake your staff didnt tell you how gus came home in a box a silver star you think he was working against this country but you dont mention that and whats all this business with hals sister were after the steno pool now minot banged his gavel again mr lasner youre out of order im out of order one of the lawyers rushed up to lasners table signaling at the same time to minot whose head had swiveled upward as if he were literally scenting a change in the air one of the cameras had moved closer its motor drowned by the buzzing in the public section minot nodded to the lawyer the witnesss counsel is requesting a recess we dont need a recess lasner said his voice louder lets get this over with minot banged again well recess for ten minutes he turned to the rest of the committee who looked disoriented by the unexpected outburst and shuffled some papers for the camera sols table was now surrounded by lawyers blocking him from sight are you crazy one lawyer said hes an antisemite lasner said still boiling you think i dont know when i see it i know it like air so what so what he stared at the lawyer you never met an antisemite before had to deal with one all my life i never elected one you didnt elect this one either now listen to me sol held up his hand im listening to you are you listening to him you dont want to put a stop to this thats not up to us who is it up to then fay talk to him fay put a hand on his shoulder you all right im great she made a half smile i know youre enjoying yourself gus pollock for chrissake comes home in a box fay the lawyer said again what can i tell you hes a grown man am i his mother if you ask me theyre with him she said pointing to the public section theres a way to do this the lawyer said what way lasner said wait for somebody else he looked at ben youre the one who showed me what happened were making a goddam picture what happens everybody waits who did he bring down here the country club no a jew business i know he said catching bens expression its not the same but how different you tell me what wait for somebody else ben looked at him then glanced quickly over to the press section everyone standing and talking but ostermann who sat still his eyes on the witness table seeing something new not if you can do it ben said finally ha why do you say that the lawyer said you dont have to ask me ben said to lasner youre going to do it anyway he paused he can hurt the studio more lasner said he turned to fay how many times i worried about that before it doesnt change neither do you you think its still gower gulch where do you think he gets all this from lasner said sweeping his hand to take in the room pictures he doesnt even know where he gets it but its pictures he looked at ben i know pictures then fight him with that ben said when they resumed minot was sitting up straight the papers in front of him stacked everything back in control mr lasner have you had enough time with counsel yes sir thank you minot looked up at this but played along good now if we can continue certainly but first id like to apologize if i expressed myself no apologies necessary mr lasner its just that i appreciate the importance of these hearings and i didnt want you to waste your time on were not wasting time mr lasner on convoy i mean for all the people saw it it wouldnt have done the russians much good anyway it was my understanding the movie was a success well that depends on whose accountants you talk to there was an amused murmur everyone in the press section now following closely minot referred to a paper mine said fifty thousand net with second release lasner said smoothly yeah we made our costs back im not saying that but wartime thats not hard to do everything gets an audience the military audience you mean minot said not even aware he was following lasner overseas they get it free part of the war effort the industry paid for the prints those pictures you used to see he said minot suddenly a gi again young the boys we didnt make a dime on them wouldnt your gross was in the home market and not enough of them wanted to convoy to murmansk minot said trying to be light but sounding forced not until second release and yet youre full of praise for mr schaeffereverybody who made it in fact it was a good picture you say that even though there were timing problems lasner said going somewhere else they put out a bogart early so all the sudden were up against that in the first run plus cover girl was stillyou know youre going to do tremendous business with a hayworth ben noticed that the names made the audience more attentive as if the stars themselves had entered the room mr lasner minot interrupted sensing this the fact remains that millions of people saw convoy to murmansk were not interested in the studios account books were interested in what the movie had to say how it was changed to say it now i can appreciate you want to make money i guess most of us do but were here to see how these people work how they get their message out when the rest of us are just going about our businessyou up there counting your money he broke off seeing lasners face grow tighter now i also appreciate that as head of the studio you want to take responsibility for everything that happens there but one man cant do it all these are people who know how to play on sympathies its not just what happens in the front office who decides this or that its what happens on the groundi guess wed say on the sound stage and what happens off what happens off social lifes an important part of the business wouldnt you say sometimes you want to know about a person you can tell by who he knows you mean like you coming to my house minot said nothing blindsided barely noticing the ripple of interest in the press section a new detour i know what you mean lasner said people listen to us a while ago he raised his hand slightly deflecting an argument my temper i know but they wouldnt think youd been to my house had dinner but maybe we have more in common than they think this country how we feel about it of course i dont know what it says about you and milt schaeffer i mean both of you being there at the same party mr lasner were not here to discuss my social just milts huh i thought maybe the two of you had talked you were the guest of honor the point was to meet you but there were a lot of people sometimes its like that you dont get to talk at least this time it wasnt a fundraiser unless you were raising funds i didnt know about lasner said playfully the scene his now as if the tables themselves had changed places mr lasner minot said stiffly can we get back to i was just making a point you said you can tell a lot who people know but see we cant really tell anything about you by the fact that you and milt were both there your point being so hal and milt were at the fund party does it mean anything they were both there those were very different occasions minot said defensive now ill bet ive been to milts parties youre lucky you get cream cheese on a ritz cracker everyone laughed even schaeffer a little color now in his cheeks minot waited it out mr lasner im just saying we dont even know if they talked you just said they were there is all minot stared at him trying to close down the volley with silence because if you dont know anything more than that theres no reason to bring it up is there its just like you and milt at the house minot covered his microphone and said something to the other committee members a quarterback running through plays mr lasner im not going to debate this with you the event we were discussing is part of a much larger web of association what like that letter in the paper among other things i was wondering about that i wanted to ask you mr lasner were asking the questions here im sitting here all morning i dont even get one he said facing away from minot to the rest of the committee one of whom leaned over and whispered to minot ask me what mr lasner that letter in the paper for the european relief fund you say milt signed it and hal gus pollock thats correct and you think that means something red channels has listed the fund as a suspected communist front organization whats red channels its a publication that mr lasner this is all beside the point not to me who are they to accuse me nobodys accusing you of anything no youre pretty quick telling us hal signed that letter so theyre all in it together hal and milt and but you dont say who else signed it take a look jack warner i remember selznick for sure even mayer i think but i cant swear to that i know they asked how because i signed it too and gave them money is that why you got me down here with a subpoena under oath because i gave money to save some jews before they were killed are you calling me a communist too all the cameras had now swiveled toward him the entire room pitched forward waiting whos red channels bring them here so we can take a look let them call me that to my face his voice kept rising then dropped or is that what youre doing calling me a communist mr lasner this isnt getting us anywhere no where are we going i thought you got me down here to tell me there were commies in the industry making trouble and all youve got is milt giving parties whos paying for all this by the way he threw his arm out expansive you got a budget on this thing or do the taxpayers just keep forking it over till you dig something up all right im under oath he raised his hand i am not a communist i dont even know any communists milt wants to think its a paradise over there in minsk let him i dont care i make pictures thats all that tell the american people what to think minot leaped in visibly angry now finally drawn out of public politeness nobody here has accused you of anything except possibly a political naivete so profound naivete whats that minot stopped flummoxed innocence he said a political innocence or indifference that allows people clever people to exploit now youre calling me stupid to exploit an industry without your being aware of it i dont know what youre talking about but i guess that makes two of us because you dont know what youre talking about either are we finished here he scraped back his seat getting ready to go startling the lawyers behind him because i am mr lasner with all due respect you are testifying before a committee of the united states government this kind ofgrandstanding will not be tolerated this is not a theater no a circus a congressman i expected better from you minot flushed as if hed been slapped you are out of order mr lasner he said furious his face twisting this is not continental pictures where you can strut around make people jump just because you say so this committee doesnt work for you lasner looked at him then stood up a move so abrupt that the committee started with alarm two lawyers jumped up to hold him but lasner brushed them away swatting flies all the calculated restraint gone now jabbing his finger into the air at minot thats just where youre wrong you do work for me i learned that in civics thats a class you take when you first get here from poland maybe you ought to take it you work for us we pay you we elect you once anyway and as far as im concerned youre off the lot sit down minot said rising himself both glaring at each other or what you going to put me in jail is that what happens when somebody stands up to you he turned to the room we should all watch this what happens when you stand up to these people maybe youll be next any of us anybody in pictures he looked back at minot a beat while the room waited even polly had stopped writing looking around the room disturbed what happens or do you think everyone will be too scared to stand up minot banged the gavel again even though the room was quiet mesmerized you are still under oath you want to know about convoy to murmansk lasner said almost shouting so worked up now that the committee seemed to draw back out of the way ill tell you want to know who changed it what commie me i asked them to change it want to know why i got a phone call from the president we need your help weve got an ally doesnt think were pulling our weight wed like to show them we know what theyre going through a picture would be a big help is there anything we can do asking me i had tears in my eyes hes calling me it was the proudest day of my life he looked around emotional shaking a little the proudest day and this whats the opposite i feelshame here not of this country ill never feel ashamed of this country im ashamed of you in it he said directly to minot im ashamed anyone listens to you im going to work you want to arrest me do it here because you wont get on the lot thats me at the gate stopping you he pointed to his chest and it was then that ben noticed the film of sweat on his forehead a white fleck of spittle in the corner of his mouth lasner leaned on the table with both hands under the heat of the camera lights almost vibrating with emotion the same sweat and tremor ben remembered from the train you want to make fun of me go ahead you think i strut around i do im proud of continental and im not letting you have it you think i dont know what you want he turned to the audience what he wants from all of us he wants to take over tell us what to make who to hire who to fire well i run the studio me you dont tell me who works there milt he said turning to him you looking for a job if he doesnt lock you up give me a call he turned back to minot i run continental not you go tell warner what to do if he has any sense hell throw you out too youre finished here if i can see it with my whats it naivete they can all see it i thought this was about politics about the good of the country and what is it just another pisher wants my job not my studio not my his hand went to his chest so fast that the room saw only the body slump forward but ben had been watching for it waiting so as he leaped out of his seat pushing past the lawyers he saw the hand clench grabbing suit cloth as if it could stop the pain by squeezing then the head hitting the edge of the table as he fell over there was a frozen moment of shock then screams gasps everyone standing beginning to surge toward him but ben was already there turning lasner over on his back reaching into his pocket oh my god one of the lawyers said where are his pills ben said searching not even aware hed said it aloud here fay dropping to her knees next to him clawing at her purse behind them a roar of noise give him air call an ambulance ben yelled to the circle around them grabbing the pills and shoving two into lasners mouth water a glass appeared out of the air and ben forced water between lasners lips waiting to hear him choke afraid the white sweaty face was beyond responding but there was a kind of hiccup a faint sign of life not yet gone ben undid the tie tearing the collar open as if the problem were air not his heart lasner had cut his head in the fall so now there was blood too seeping in a small stream inching toward fays nylons she was clutching lasners hand watching ben as he undid the collar then massaged lasners chest the rhythm a makeshift substitute for the heart a pretense that you could keep life going from the outside he bent down to lasners mouth listening for air give him room behind them the crowd tried to back up without really moving pressing against each other polly had wedged her way to the front oh she said distressed her hand at her mouth is he dead give him air ben said lasners eyelids fluttered open for a second taking in ben and fay the circle of faces then closed again did you get them down ben said to him try one more he pushed the pill between lasners lips swallow try lasner opened his mouth a little obedient and ben watched his throat move his face tightening with the strain the committee had now reached them minot pushing his way through he stood for a second looking down appalled and confused then stepped back when he felt the flashbulbs go off catching him looming over lasner an unintended boxing ring pose ben took out a handkerchief and wiped lasners forehead then held it against the cut to stanch the bleeding they need a minute to kick in he said to fay then grabbed a folded paper and started fanning lasners face forcing air toward him breathe she said to lasner sol can you hear me the ambulance is coming she tightened her hand on his now that lasner had responded the crowd grew louder with talk all of the sudden like that someone said snapping his fingers ben opened another button on lasners shirt fay glanced up at one of the studio people did anybody call rosen dr rosen bunny knows the number she turned to ben you knew about the pills what on the train he nodded its worse this time we have to get him to the hospital he felt lasners wrist its weak im not dead lasner said then winced the ambulance was there in a few minutes as the crew lifted lasner onto a stretcher more flashbulbs went off fay grabbed bens hand drawing him along with her lasner opened his eyes aware of the movement theyre here fay said just hold on lasner struggled to say something but managed only an indistinct sound dont try to talk fay said youve said enough lasner glanced at her and started to smile in the ambulance fay and ben in the back with him lasner began breathing more regularly his color better thats twice youre there he said to ben his voice scratchy but intelligible shh dont excite yourself fay said you see his face lasner said quite a finish ben said i told you he didnt know how to play it hes done dont talk crazy fay said he should fucking go out and shoot himself like claude rains ben laughed fay shot him a look but lasner pleased smiled and closed his eyes again what did you give him the doctor said as they brought the gurney into the emergency room ben handed him the pills two three the doctor nodded then said something to a nurse ordering an iv and after that nothing made sense medicine its own foreign language ben and fay were shunted aside into a waiting room the air stale with smoke ben opened a window fay sat down covering her eyes with her hand thank you she said and then neither of them spoke trying to slow things down all the urgency of the last half hour finally wheeled away somewhere else ben glanced around the room a pastel seascape on the wall and a stack of readers digest s on a coffee table no wonder people paced how bad was it on the train fay said finally ben shrugged not great but he got through it how many times can you do that she started to cry quietly and ben looked away giving her room what am i supposed to do a house that size after they moved lasner to a room ben and fay were allowed to sit with him a vigil until dr rosen arrived and put them in the hall while he conferred with the hospital doctors is he going to be all right fay said when he came back out to them that depends what you mean by all right hes going to live not like now he looked at her no studio he wont hell have to this time it went off he said pointing to lasners chest it goes again hes gone im sorry fay i dont mean to she waved this away and that would buy him what i dont know odds i cant answer that hell ask a few months sitting around is that all hes going to get anyway a month is a lot if its your last a year whats numbers dont go soft on me fay he said seeing her face begin to tremble youre the only one can talk to him she flicked the corner of her eye drying it wonderful bunny arrived when they were sitting with lasner awake now but not talking much preoccupied now he gets here lasner said but patted his hand affectionate sol i he didnt finish turning instead to fay putting a hand on her shoulder im going to be out a few days lasner said bunny nodded playing along but his eyes were examining lasner appraising without the pyramid fingers and ben watched him grow paler shaken and knew that lasner was dying the doctors assessment just something to comfort fay he didnt call rosemary like we thought lasner said talking business he might lets release the picture anyway fuck him lets talk about it when were talking about it now no youre not fay said playing nurse doctors orders look at you its not enough for one day what do the doctors say bunny said but fay didnt answer instead rolling her eyes toward the door what do they always say lasner said listen to them everybody should go live in laguna watch i dont take you there fay said you look tired close your eyes for a while dont leave he said a childs voice she put her hand on his forehead never she said softly ben stared at lasner hearing his words again an echo effect but not the way danny had said them meaning something else ill come out with you fay said dismissing them and for a second ben saw a twitch in bunnys face annoyed at their being lumped together lasner managed a half wave from the bed dont be scarce he said in the hall bunny huddled for a minute with fay presumably getting a medical report then joined ben at the elevators i turn my back for two hours he said there was nothing anybody could do even you he knew what he was doing mm putting himself in here and minots back tomorrow i dont think so with a grudge a little tantrum from mr l and you think hes all taken care of he will be bunny looked up sharply what do you mean read the papers tomorrow polly had suggested the formosa and when ben got there she was already settled in a red leather booth nursing a gibson i went ahead she said after he ordered talk about a day for it gives you a turn seeing that ive known sol a lot of years she looked up narrowing her eyes her hat the mesh veil thrown back for drinking was tilted slightly you were at the hospital how is he ben shrugged noncommittal they said stable stable could be dead i should probably be there in case but they just stick you in the waiting room anyway she said switching i have this meeting where youre going to give me a story and im going to do you a favor surprise me tell me youre not trying to get into somebodys pants she finished off the drink and raised her finger for another so what do you want want to hear the story first no first tell me what its going to cost minot fed you some material on rosemary i want you to kill it for good christ polly said picking up her fresh drink her pants thats not even a surprise it would be to her so why anyway how do you know he fed me anything because he did jump page stuff ive seen the file you can do better with you she looked at him now why is that you dont even like me do you i think youre a cunt she stopped sipping her drink then laughed into it almost spitting well that puts it right out there doesnt it it got your attention no i think you mean it so why are we here to do a little business youre lucky i dont throw this drink in your face she stared at him for a second all right what have you got you kill the rosemary story you going to tell me or just sit there and play with yourself my brother worked for minot a supplier trouble is his supplies were tainted he was also a communist a real one party member still active the communists have been setting minot up a lot of the stuff hes using he got from them some of the stuff he gave you too probably but you dont have to mention that minot had a commie working for him and didnt know it to undermine the hearings make him use bad information which could blow up in his face will unless somebody blows the whistle first polly said nothing just sat looking at him then raised the glass to her mouth her head shaking a little somebody like who brenda starr ben said opening his hand to her another silence and how do i back this up you have an exclusive interview with his brother on the record i can tell you how minots files were set up how they marked the information from him he ever give you any files direct ill show you how he sourced them i can fill you in about dannys party membership since germany how he gave minot stuff only another communist could know not exstill you want to back up further than that you can source riordan off the record but hell back me up about the files you can prove this documents if i have to but i wont look where its coming from his brother i know straight from him anybody comes after you theyre really coming after me ill give you an escape hatch but whos going to deny it the commies when im the source nobody else has this interested she looked into her drink thinking you didnt like your brother much huh ben looked away not much not now anyway that i know what he was if he hadnt died hed still be doing it setting minot up how do i know youre not setting me up for what look if you dont want it i can go somewhere else but youre so fond of me you know youre the first person i met out here union station and i have some dirt on your girlfriend ben shook his head not only that you hate communists everybody knows that so who better and its your town maybe you deserve each other but heres a chance to show what the commies are trying to do to it minot uses this net with all these holes in it and who gets away who wins look at you the allamerican canary no minots the allamerican too bad hes also a fool this would kens a friend of mine dont make me laugh she looked over at him bristling dont make me laugh ben said slower this time a leadin i was in that hearing room today know what i smelled blood you smelled it too didnt you hes finished there he made a fool of himself even before it comes out how the commies were using him lasners going to die and everybodys going to blame minot the whole town including you the big funeral piece one of the giants of old hollywood you can even throw in that fucking barn where demille started the old days with rex you wont even have to say minot bullied him to death everybody already thinks it theyll thank you for showing him up before he could go after anybody else you have a lot of friends in the industry its where you live hes just passing through see what he can get out of it and hes already on the floor bleeding he waited another minute while she digested this her eyes wide calculating you want to do the interview we should go to your office not sit in a bar tape it if you want on the record ive got some paperwork too so you wont be nervous about using any of it do you want it part one part one theres more but we dont want to throw everything out there right away its all page one milk it in fact thats

me out to dry and ill kill you myself so we lose the rosemary story theres just one little problem with that i gave it to kelly not all of it but enough to get him some space then pull it back that doesnt leave him with much they met each others eyes holding their glasses as if they were looking over cards dick marshall and liesl inside the romance pictures at her place by the pool exclusive she nodded slowly still looking at him i remember that train youre a quick study its an easy place to read yeah i guess she said finishing the drink union station and now here we are at the formosa they all go that way dont they all the stories here not all of them ben said polly worked for the afternoon paper so ben spent the morning waiting trying to keep busy when he started stacking papers and arranging them in piles he realized that all this methodical makework was simply a pretense putting things in order while his stomach jumped restless with nerves he checked the gun in the drawer somewhere miles away paper had streamed through inked drums and been baled thrown onto trucks theyd have to come now how long before they wondered what else ben would say bunny was already at the gate when ben went down to check on the afternoon delivery he glanced up briefly from the paper then went back reading handing ben another copy from the pile the phones been ringing he said an explanation lasner had made the front page with the picture of minot looming over him but so had polly the left lead minot duped by red informer staffer worked for commies says brother two columns with a jump to page eight the entire story polly had filed including the more to come bunny read through to the end then folded the page under his arm my what a big tongue it has he said minot had it coming bunny looked at him every time i think we understand each otherwe dont he turned ben following therell just be another one maybe worse its not going to stop it will for a while at least you kept liesl out of it family feeling its about danny not her she was married to him he paused if anybody remembers i gather you promised polly some pictures shes already been asking i didnt realize you were running publicity now i had to offer her bunny waved his hand save it im going to move up the release date before anybody remembers so a spread will come in handy by the pool wasnt it the pictures ready just the prints i can pull a booking at the egyptian not rosemarys bunny looked over no not rosemarys we havent booked that yet you can theres not going to be any trouble is that what this is all about the girlfriend not both of you double dunking you dont find that a little tawdry i just said like one of those loops where they leave their socks on ben just looked waiting as a matter of fact we havent booked it because were doing some retakes i think we can fix it no other reason no other reason now that youve chased all the storm clouds away what else are you going to do for us just so im ready mr jenkins a secretary came up to them the unions here about the musicians right there bunny said musicians i thought continental didnt do musicals we didnt have julie before shes good and we signed her cheap its worth a shot already head of the studio samll be happy well theres that too bunny said dismissive moving away he opened the paper again then shook his head no more stunts please he lied to you bunny handed ben the paper everybody lies to me mr l will be pleased anyway like a onetwo punch team arent you he looked up at him fay said you saved his life shes exaggerating i was just there hell be grateful bunny said his voice flat henderson turned up an hour later everywhere i look what do i see he said tossing the paper on bens desk you all over the page the paper had landed with the bottom half faceup a picture ben hadnt noticed before pushed below the fold by the minot story kaltenbach at a press conference in berlin surrounded by men in bulky suits i didnt know you guys read the papers ben said youve got a mouth for brains anybody ever tell you lets take a walk you can give me the lecture right here dont worry there isnt any more the bureau isnt going to come into it if thats what give me a preview tomorrows edition this is it thats not what it says we dont need any more once they see this theyll come running look how fast you got here henderson stared at him ben picked up the paper scanning the kaltenbach piece so he made it you didnt see it he denounced ostermann a real german would come back build a new germany ostermanns a cosmopolitan not even a german anymore they made him say it theyll make him say a lot of things drove himself to mexico funny isnt it since he couldnt drive couldnt he who told you that danny henderson motioned his head toward the door show me the lot ben took him past the sound stages to the new york street empty today the brownstone fronts as silent as a ghost town youre trying to get yourself killed henderson said that was the idea wasnt it the idea was to find your brothers mailman make him come after the list not after you when did you get all protective theyve already tried once we both knew how this was going to work not by going to the papers what are you worried about that im going to embarrass the bureau give away state secrets what state secrets thats right there is no list its classified henderson said evenly it has to stay that way it will you think id tell polly im that crazy henderson turned im not the one setting myself up as target practice look they know i have the letter but nobody moves still safe even with you hanging around but i go public theyve got to stop me come out where we can see them he opened his hand then you go to work theres talk of bringing you in henderson said slowly preventative custody to prevent what you talking out of turn thats why youre here i just said its been discussed people are nervous kind of thing nobody ends up looking good you forget i came to you ben said well lets just say you got to us anyway give it one more day theyll bite now were on the same side here arent we henderson had stopped looking at the street set theres nothing behind that right you look at those windows you think theres a room there its something how they do that ben waited you know its a funny thing people in the field ive seen it happen they work so many sides it gets confusing they dont know which side theyre on anymore i think something like that happened to your brother ben shook his head you didnt know him were alike henderson raised an eyebrow he knew it just wasnt the right side that was the hard part figuring that out henderson took this in thinking then started back im going to put a tail on you somebody could pick us off right now if he wanted what good would that do might make him work a little harder for it find a better spot ben glanced up at the set unless hes already found it after henderson left ben drifted back toward the western set some workers were trimming branches off the giant cottonwood the whine of their buzz saw drowning out the carpenters in the partial saloon all the noises a comfort now safety in other people beyond the cottonwood there was a stand of live oaks where posses tied up horses for the night and then the raised wooden sidewalk in front of the general store and the sheriffs office lined with hitching rails had the real towns been any more substantial thrown together in a few weeks the same dusty clapboard fronts and fading paint he was standing now in the street where gunfighters faced off hands hovering near their holsters he looked down to the corner halfexpecting someone to appear but it was too soon thered be some better plan from the top of the building someone with a rifle could take him with a single bullet one shot then glide away in the confusion as the carpenters raced out to the street but it wouldnt happen that way either a hired pachuco at the cherokee wasnt enough anymore how much did ben know what had he already told polly how far had the stain spread what henderson didnt seem to understand one reason ben had set it up this wayfirst theyd have to talk to him he was still at his desk waiting for the phone to ring as the production units closed down for the day he could hear people outside heading for their cars the line of idling motors at the gate the lot thinning out he tried to imagine the call wondered where the meeting would be set why not paseo miramar a sentimental choice but too public at this hour when the door opened no knock he jerked his head up every part of him alert i was wondering how long it would take you he said liesl hesitated still holding the doorknob i didnt think i was going to come at all she walked in and put the newspaper on his desk a presentation gesture exhibit a you got all dressed up she glanced down at the bareshouldered evening gown publicity she said offhand distracted for war bride in that more like dick marshalls bride hows that going or isnt it she stared at him thrown not expecting this i told you it didnt mean anything she said finally well neither did i she looked surprised again slightly lost is that what you think he met her eyes not moving go on say it what what you were going to say when you didnt think youd come bastard i was going to say what a bastard you are she said emotionless repeating lines to do this to him hes dead and this is the memory you want for him an informer so everyone knows she said pointing to the paper her voice stronger and now youre the good one it means so much to be better than him its true he was an informer thats not everything he was no worse she stopped dropping her hand to her side what do you mean worse treason what every russian wants to know what did henderson call it our new order of battle the list she said ignoring his tone you found out who they are he nodded it took a few calls of course some of them dont have phones theyre nowhere new mexico i guess like in the newsreel thats when it clicked i remembered friedman the livermore lab berkeley bingo in dannys newsreel at home maybe you watched it together what are you talking about what treason youre going to put this in the paper make it worse that depends on how you read it the communists will think hes quite a guy you do except for his love life but maybe that was just a geteven screw he didnt take her there you know the cherokee love nest that was your idea thats not what it was for party business party business you remember the party remember what she said confused you were in it too she said nothing you came here to talk didnt you lets talk dont worry im not running to minot with it and bunny will keep you miles away not even a hint of red no idea what danny was up to somebody else he duped he said looking at the paper but not over there youd have been a lot closer somebody he could trust doing what he was doing youd have to be one of them i should have got that right away anyone from the outside would have been too risky a death warrant youd have to be is that how you met she looked down shaking her head it was for him a card even she said her mouth suddenly crooked almost in a smile he couldnt too incriminating they werent so worried for me she looked up at him i threw it away a little ceremony a new place new start for both of us i thought it was anyway he lied about that too and not you everybody was a little like that isnt that what you said the first night we went to bed come to think of it the first lie one of them you think there were so many it wasin the past why bring it up again and i bought it and went around in circles for a while i didnt see a lot of things she stared at him something gets in your eye a little speck and you miss things i kept seeing you at genias table it kept coming back to you and id look somewhere else and then there we were drinking brandybrandyand i saw the glass and started seeing other things the paseo just visiting uncle lion if anyone had asked the balcony i remembered that in a clip girl your size you just need leverage the hospital he said dont leave me but i did i saw you there too stop it she said her voice edgy upset even then i thought i was justseeing things what could i prove if i wanted to it wasnt going to bring him back anyway but not after the list not after i saw that you should never have let me leave the house i suppose you didnt think id move to the cherokee right to the mail drop that must have been he stopped you should have kept me close he looked at her it would have been easy to do she met his eyes for a moment then looked away picking at the newspaper something to do so now its this im awhat a murderer thats what you think she held her arms out do you want to look maybe theres a gun in my dress no you just came to find out how much i told polly how far its gone and id tell you wouldnt i he nodded the dress helps stop give me a name a name i dont think you hired the kid at the cherokee a pachuco that had to be someone else give me the next guy who had the key i can tell henderson i got to him through kelly keep you out of it they have him they can roll up the rest you retire unless they turn on you but im betting they wont but you retire for good why would you do this if im its enough damage he said indicating the paper right now dannys a communist who made a fool out of minot some places that even makes him a hero but this is something else im not going to do it to him make him carry that mark around so let it stop here let the bureau have the others and theres your career to consider she raised her head about to speak but he cut her off no one else knew i had it and didnt know what it meant you saw that with henderson at the border why didnt anyone come after me even henderson was surprised one try at the cherokee and thennothing but by that time you knew it could stop therehenderson didnt know where to go with it you were safe no one else knew liesl her eyes opened wider at this unsettled no one else she repeated a little breathless catching up with it give me a name how can you believe this what because of us lets not do that again i thought he broke off tell me something though he waited for her to turn to him was any of it real a few lines she shaded her eyes with her hand a few he said nothing for a second letting it settle give me a name then lets talk about why the phone rang and her hand jerked away from her face a startled reflex they both went still looking down the second ring louder yes he said grabbing the receiver just to stop the noise the night operator sounding bored a message from miss eastman she wants to see you on sound stage four for a second he didnt respond as if he were still waiting to hear the sound out of synch miss eastman he said jarred looking across at liesl thats right sound stage four now he heard it still looking at liesl his stomach beginning to slide the floor itself seemed to move he placed the fingers of one hand on the desk to steady himself she just called the ad is there some problem i called as soon as no thank you he put the receiver back liesl was watching his face confused then alarmed what she said but he could only look at her the room still sliding everything wrong he picked up the receiver again get me carl at the gate will you he waited for the connection liesl still staring at him carl ben collier i want you to close the gate nobody goes off the lot not until i call back got that anybody asks say its orders he put the phone down now feeling eerily calm youre asking for me on sound stage four im asking she stopped as he reached into the drawer and took out the gun checking it stay here he said he went out the back of the building then swung behind the writers wing it didnt have to be sound stage itself just anywhere on the way he took a parallel route away from the exposed main road his eyes scanning side to side a few grips were unloading flats from a truck down by the western set but otherwise the lot was quiet the sun was almost gone the dreary plaster walls now a light apricot on the other side of the street the prop buildings hangar doors were still wide open spilling out bright light acres of tables and settees and mirrors stacked chairs all of it easy to hide behind if youd planned it that way he felt the gun in his hand what could he say if anyone saw slinking behind buildings with a gun but these werent real streets people carried harmless guns between sets all the time the door to sound stage was closed but not locked the red light off he opened it and stepped into a darkness so complete that he felt swallowed up in it like a stray crack of light he fumbled behind for a switch the utility lights flashed on not as bright as overhead stage lights but enough to see the set the woodframe backing and ramps for wheeling the cameras ben blinked disoriented for a second it was the nightclub in rosemarys picture the bar just where it had been but the dance floor repositioned down a short flight of stairs the tables dressed now in white cloth with center lamps swankier he stepped carefully toward the bar using the long mirror to check the space behind him liesl he said playing along he moved his arm in a slow circle the gun pointed ready liesl he said again his voice the only sound in the big space he stood for a second just listening quiet enough to hear a watch someone breathe but there was nothing then suddenly a creak a foot on wood and he turned to it not expecting the explosion the noise of the shot his hand burning a searing pain as his gun fell and he clutched his hand already smearing with blood he ducked an instinct to reach out for the gun on the floor then reared back when another shot went into the wood next to it the next one goes in your head a voice said coming out of the shadow at the end of the bar he waved his gun motioning ben back as he stepped forward finally reaching bens gun and kicking it aside dieter ben said still in pain clutching his hand did you think we were going to play with guns like cowboys who is faster dont be a child dieter ben said again trying to focus watching his hand run with blood what a trouble you are this family this time its not so easy to arrange bullets therell be questions he paused if they find you dumped somewhere off the lot another accident the thought darted in and out of his mind not yet ready for it still hazy with surprise i dont understand but even as he said it he did all the scenes coming back to him now with a different face a brandy glass dont leave me dieter also at the hospital more than just family ben tried to remember the sequenceracing for the doctor liesl where the nurses station just a minute or two all that would be needed concerned in dannys room dont leave me alone what dieter said everything snapping into place his hand throbbing just the first shot keep him talking who told you about genia dieter moved his head physically taken aback at such a moment thats what you want to know he said liesl told you liesl dieter said dismissive you told me not liesl ben said as if he hadnt heard you on the beach after salkas lunch a great favor to me to know that i had to act if she talked to you she would talk to others i was always secret only someone from those days would know and here she was talking towell ottos son maybe she thought it was all right but no discipline even ottos son something happened to her in the war i think so you killed her i had to he said easily once you told me so i thank you for that you know i have an idea that she knew what had to be done when i called her she came no questions the old discipline because she was a threat just knowing you ben said still stitching things together do you have any idea what we are doing here how important it is theyre making weapons so powerfulwell thats for another time i want to know why youll be dead what can it matter to you or do you think someones coming to save you texas rangers maybe the marshal he said drawing the word out sarcastic he shook his head no one is coming ben glanced around his gun had been kicked toward the door too far away something else a nightclub table to duck behind a bottle to smash any kind of weapon but what was real if he smashed the bottle would he have jagged glass or breakaway plasticine the stage telephone the fire alarm everything useful was behind him impossible to reach keep talking youre not going to kill me yet no not before you know how much i know it doesnt matter what you know youll be dead or how much i told polly dieter looked at him you dont want to kill her if you dont have to you dont want that kind of attention dieter sighed a mock concession so what did you tell her first you tell me what why you killed danny i want to know dieter shrugged i said its a difficult family always their own ideas he nodded to ben not in the beginning ottos son anything we needed but this place it changed him the life here liesl liesl you know a wife changes things in france i thought well its good he can get her out hell make her serious but it was the other way kino this stupid quatsch he makes she was ambitious for him no politics here its another country well what did she know about it so he has to hide it from her the work he does for me hide it of course what would she think her father slow down ben said her father that was the beginning they wanted someone close to hans he smiled him they worried about the conscience of germany what did he think who did he see so riordan talks to daniel they know each other from those movies he thinks daniels a good american well he was a good american but also a soninlaw close you understand so he comes to me what should i do and of course i see at once what a thing this is at first even suspiciouswhat if its a trap but no an opportunity to work with the fbi to have a man there not high up but still just how they make the files the organization even this is valuable they want to watch the german community good show them where to look imagine hans ostermanns soninlaw their man inside their spy well what was there to spy on even brecht daniel tells them about the girlfriend and of course thats all they can see after that they even follow him to new york where does he sleep at night how long does he stay quatsch but not you me i dont have girlfriends i dont go to new york i salute the flag im happy to be alive i think here its paradise my colleagues my numbers its all i need my numbers nothing else in my head its more interesting brechts secretary and some of those colleagues are at northridge yes some and i know what some of them do so thats one piece and of course they investigate us are we loyal can we be trusted look at my fbi file a german yes but now american its all in the file and danny knew what you were doing there was a loyalty there from otto he knew the fbi was watching the emigreshis family his friendswhy not protect them but not the other the work at the labs the weapons its so important to you this distinction he worked for us he was one of us but he didnt know you have to understand how this worked dieter said patiently wrapped up in his story now ben looked to the door again the fire alarm but hed be dead before he pulled the lever get dieter to take him off the lot wherever he was going to stage a disappearance there were still people outside he wouldnt want to be seen dragging a body to a car no one knew he continued just his piece daniel wasnt at livermore or cal tech not out in new mexico with the project he was here making these foolish reports making them look where there was nothing to see away from you i was a messenger thats all but nothing could come to me i had my security clearance but you couldnt risk the mail they still look it had to go somewhere else what did he think it was all the mail party matters a convenience for me i was always secret you see he understood that otherwise i wouldnt have been able to work but why help minot another opportunity to make them look somewhere else he had credibility do you know how valuable that is the bureau could vouch for him anything he said but minot was after communists but which ones hollywood he said his voice brushing it off circuses of no importance but think what it means minot asks the bureau to help him investigate verify theyre not supposed to do it but of course they do time and men all for this distraction they catch one they want more you see they were right more time more men so give them another but always the same kind of no importance to us party members howard stein milton schaeffer written off distractions the party here is never going to amount to anything its not a political force in this country a cover sometimes but now thats difficult so another use a small sacrifice old members people who left in forty some actives these people are of no consequence so daniel cooperates its useful to us and what about the people he gives them what about them he looked at ben another sentimentalist so youre alike that way why are we doing this to well whoever to ask such a thing no discipline not like before something changed for him here thats why you killed him you asked him to throw them somebody and he refused dieter smiled the idea itself unlikely no he started reading the mail and realized not immediately but then yes what we were doing what he was doing too dont forget ben saw him in the screening room running the newsreel over and over each time worse smothering so he decided to stop ben said the crucial point the one redemption dieter nodded and told me imagine the foolishness i should stop too not just stop give the bureau names in exchangefor what clean hands there are no clean hands foolish but dangerousall our work what else could i do how exactly how what is the point of this you know how was he unconscious when he went over it matters to you to know this yes on the head he said hitting his own i thought the fall would kill him a very strong head so you went to the hospital to make sure dont leave me a pillow a minute a long wait dieter said annoyed as if the inconvenience of it still rankled are you finished now how did you get out the cherokee you locked the dooryou had your own key you must haveso everybody would think hed been alone and then what i left dieter said simply the question not worth raising everyone was in the alley so i went out the front i had a story if anyone asked i was family and id been worried about him and now my god too late but nobody asked so one more how did you know i had the list did you miss a pickup dieter shook his head it was not so regular it was late in fact but you had to telephone first at the faculty lounge then even on the mountain whats so important i thought to call from the mountain and youre living there you saidliesl never mentioned that a worry so i listened and then had someone waiting another strong head it turns out but here we are so did you tell polly he tilted his head or are you just trying to buy time waiting for the marshal no marshal just us but you dont want to kill me here no carl has orders not to open the gate my orders so it would be a lot easier to have me drive you off the lot picked up by hendersons tail you dont want anyone finding bodies lying around more kino dieter said almost sneering and then the fight and you save yourself not with that fist anyway he nodded to bens hand you wont get through the gate change the orders call he jerked his head toward the phone behind ben what if there are no whatifs say one thing wrong and ill put a bullet in your head mine too if i have to so it ends here no need to explain anything ben looked at him thrown why make the call youd kill yourself you cant really believe in it anymore not after everything i did believe in it so thats something you dontbetray that just your own people and kill them what did that feel like killing danny all those years it will be easier to kill you you wouldnt keep out of this daniel he stopped i dont know why he changed i wont do that to my country foolishness what country we dont have a country not russia russia he said a hint of scorn no no country the future the rest ispolitics they want to scare themselves to death here look under your bed what do you see a communist no so give the fools a few communists but not the weapons you dont give weapons to children you cant put guns in their hands just yours he looked at dieter suddenly weary something seeping out of him with the blood do you listen to yourself anymore the future he shook his head it was a mistake you wasted your life on a mistake like my father dieter stared back surprised as if hed been struck and danny dieter said nothing for a moment then motioned the gun toward the phone make the call slow steps not too fast ben turned feeling dieter following behind a fire alarm lever he could pull but that would be a suicide move the bullet in his back before the lever was down overhead light switch but not the master switch a fuse box farther away the phone itself some kind of coded message out but dieter had already thought of that reaching around to pick up the receiver himself the gun close to ben he asked the switchboard for the front gate then handed the phone to ben carl mr kohler he said a name all the emigres still thought he used you can open the gate again but would carl hear the name change or simply recognize the voice and move on sorry for the inconvenience ben said but dieter was waving him to finish and hang up and carl didnt reply over there dieter said indicating the stage door the smaller one people used not the huge sliding wall for the sets activated by a button switch you cant hide a body in here ben said dieter pointed to one of the large black storage cases stacked by the wall move the light out of the way a flood lamp heavy lights he looked back to the nightclub set the floods already set up spotlights hanging in rows from the high rigging a boom set up for a mike the camera at the top of the ramp pointed down toward the dance floor lights camera action a phrase hed never actually heard on set all right people lets go okay jimmy action but never the full phrase why was he even thinking about this a case big enough for a body do something hes going to kill you lights already connected ready to go tomorrow action he flicked the switch on the lamp swerving to face dieter a blinding light in his eyes like a flashbulb that kept going so that he raised his arm against it an automatic response a second enough to let ben duck and roll away to his right into the set hidden by one of the tablecloths dont be stupid dieter yelled but the flash had disoriented him he headed toward the door the logical place for ben to have gone ben moved farther into the set a kind of desperate table hopping until he was under the platform for the band then out behind moving slowly counterclockwise lath and plaster dieter moved over to the flood lamp still bright and tilted it down beginning to search the tables a lighthouse sweep to the bar come out he yelled focused now on the bar an easy hiding place ben tried to remember where his gun had gone slithering across the floor toward the door exactly in dieters field of light he had now reached the camera platform across the dance floor the long shine of the mirror behind the bar dieter was still moving the light shafts reflecting off the mirror his back to ben but still between ben and the door ben heard the sound of his own breathing a ragged panting and tried to close his mouth holding it shut a vacuum quiet you could actually hear a footfall the faint mechanical turning of the lamp his whole body tensed with a feral alertness not like the war people yelling over all the noise shell explosions and the whistle of flying shrapnel war was about luck this was something else a hunt crouching with ears up waiting to hear a twig snap he looked behind the shadowy clutter of the sound stage cables and dolly tracks equipment that never appeared on screen the sound console a diversion he breathed out a little and slipped over to the panel trying to remember how it was operated no time he shoved a whole row of switches hoping for anything and got the squawk of feedback then ran in the other direction dieter swung the light around walking carefully now toward the sound pausing at the foot of the ramp to peer into the dark behind of the stage using the lamp as a kind of flashlight another sweep ben lifted himself up onto the platform the upper tier of the nightclub and crawled on his stomach toward the camera his sounds still masked by the screech coming out of the console dieter took another step wary as if the sound were a trap looking at each side of it not hearing the clicks on the platform as ben carefully unlocked the brakes on the camera wheels the whole heavy weight now free action ben rose slightly on one knee and pushed the camera to the edge of the ramp the rubber wheels gliding smoothly responsive the way they would during a shoot steady it was only after they had tipped down the ramp pulled by gravity that they wobbled with speed racing finally loud enough to make dieter turn and jerk away from a direct hit so that only his leg was caught the crash bringing him down but not crushing him knocking over the lamp which crashed too sputtering out ben rolled off the platform running hunched over across the club floor exposed now he heard a grunt dieter trying to pick himself up then a shot louder than the sound console he dropped flat heard the smash of bar bottles as the bullet struck real glass not breakaway he lunged again for the door the gun was here somewhere but no time to look instead he reached up for the hangar door switch and pushed the button then jumped away from it before dieter could fire again and moved along the wall toward the console and heaps of equipment another grunt as dieter got up lurching toward the door the obvious place sliding open now a loud clunking on its tracks where ben would try to rush out but ben burrowed deeper into the equipment pile every sound hidden by the door motor the console still squawking he moved farther back there had to be other exits not yet lit up as this one was the nightclub lights now spilling out in shafts onto the back lot he raised his head to see dieter standing in place turning side to side then reaching down to his leg evidently hurt by the falling camera the console would draw outside attention now the soundproof stage open to the night still aiming his gun at the door dieter started moving back to the panel to cut it off there would be a fumbling with switches just a few seconds but a distraction ben kept moving back picking his way over cables afraid of knocking into something an unexpected sound dieter was close enough now to hear even with the door still winching open it was dimmer here almost dark and then blank a temporary wall thrown up to divide the stage he followed it feeling for a door there must be another set behind another outside door his hand touched a knob he turned it carefully hoping no light would shoot in to give him away but the other stage was dark the floor empty of clutter nothing was being shot here he closed the door behind him and moved back to the outer wall suddenly the hangar door motor stopped presumably all the way open now the console feedback was lower too intermittent in a second dieter would find the panel switch every sound ben made audible again perfect for stalking he took another step and bumped into something waisthigh putting his hands out to steady himself prevent anything from crashing over a table some prop he moved his hands over it big a construction then like braille plaster rising out of the smooth surface in jagged clumps mountains japan continentals contribution to the war effort he tried to remember the layout how near it had been to a door an entire country lying on trestles waiting to be photographed what the bombers would see the console stopped ben looked up the quiet had become physical again something you could feel he heard dieter moving then saw the ceiling get lighter more lights in the nightclub dieter now obviously at the central switches near the stack of camera cases ben looked at japan nothing else on this part of the stage not even a spool of cable a few footsteps dieter exploring dont panic he ducked down and slipped between the trestles a hiding place but all dieter would have to do was shine a light underneath catch bens eyes he felt above him the whole frame was supported by slats lying across the trestles nailed in place to prevent wobbling the diorama itself was like an attic crawl spaceif you managed to climb into it you could lie on the slats off the floor japan over your head the spaces were irregular ben tried to wedge up into one but couldnt get through he tried to remember the shape where the loadbearing sections would be think of it as a box spring the springs clustered not even he moved toward the center where the plaster would rise highest allowing more wiggle room a mountain range if it worked anywhere it would work here he put his head through then grabbed two of the slats to pull the rest of him up his shirt caught then freed itself with a tug his feet were off the floor another push with his elbows then inching forward over the empty space onto another slat trying to distribute his weight slat space slat space his head bumped into wood of course thered be cross struts his feet were still dangling but he managed to draw them up a little so that only his toes dropped over the slat there was nowhere else to go his body suspended now his hands clutching hard to the slat on either side the injured hand was still throbbing and he tried to relax its grip maybe a bone had been smashed shooting out darts of pain but it wouldnt be much longer dieter would check the sound stage then inevitably be drawn back to the door and out the logical escape just try to stop breathing become literally part of the woodwork the floor beneath him got lighter dieter must have found more switches these would be the utility lights above the catwalks making the stage visible while the gaffers arranged the set lights on the rigging the light would come straight down through the open ceiling flat not strong enough to make shadows ben clenched his hand on the slat again keep still footsteps on the other side of the dividing wall a shout as if dieter were testing the echo effect over his head lights were shining down on the simulated hills it occurred to ben a surreal idea that his body was under hiroshima can you hear me the voice seemed nearer ben held his breath the slats might creak if he moved in the silence there was a sound so small it might be inside his head light as a bubble popping no a drip an invisible tap a single bead of water he looked down not invisible a red dot on the floor now another frantic he looked at his hand blood seeping a line moving down off the side then falling he relaxed his grip turning his hand the line changed course but kept flowing down another drip there was nowhere to move the hand without shifting his weight impossible but youd have to be on top of it to hear and now it fell on the previous drip muffled not like a fresh drop on the floor he stared at the hand willing it to stop its very foolish dieters voice again moving with him through the door flicking on more lights ben looked down a tiny puddle not a river but still dripping a little more quickly dieter had stopped probably trying to figure out the map another minute fascinated like any set visitor you know i have to do this he shouted finally its nothing to do with me his voice lower reasonable what everyone thought dropping bombs firing into streets years of it something that couldnt be helped you dont use the door he said loud again not sure where ben was hide and seek shall i tell you my plan its goodno bullets to explain he waited as if expecting an answer back ben stared at the blood these places they should clean up did you see the paint cans thinners a hazard one match well a few to make it all go at once the door locked its a good idea dont you think a pity a whole building for this and such a way to die to burn what they say will happen in hell its so terrible much easier a bullet quicker you decide one or the other are you listening another silence ben watching the droplets on the floor i know what youre thinking the fool leaves i make an alarm ben not such a fool its easy to disable im a good mechanic did you know that no alarm the door locked yes they see the light maybe but paint makes so much smoke you know most people die from smoke in a fire before they burn so by the time are you listening but it was dieter who suddenly paused hearing a noise indistinct behind him ben could see his feet move back to the partition door hello no answer dieter waited another minute to be sure then moved back toward the map so is it fire he said to the rafters ben went still watching the blood run along the floor a thin line but moving we dont have time with the barn door open he said a forced joviality before the horses get out another pause so ben saw his feet turn back to the nightclub and the equipment piles stepping carefully still listening the blood seemed to be following him almost at the edge of the trestles now leave even a fire would give him a chance dieter couldnt disable the sprinklers unless the heat didnt reach them in time high up designed to save the building not someone trapped in it dieter turned taking a last look around the stage and stopped he began walking back slowly coming directly toward ben shoes getting closer not stopping until they were at the trestles close to the blood but not yet touching it ben waited then he saw a finger reach down swiping at the blood and moving up again was he tasting it or was the look enough all hed have to do now was shoot through the plaster leaving bens body to hang unseen for days until someone followed the smell instead his face suddenly appeared crouched down so come out now ben looked at him gulping air why as you wish dieter said raising the gun every second a bargain maybe a chance ben began to wriggle back dropping his feet moving down to the floor and out from under the map the line of blood streaked as he pulled himself up now facing dieter the preservation instinct dieter said its wonderful yes why didnt you then burn down the studio such a colorful ending he shook his head its a question of attention something quiet he motioned him toward the dividing wall back to the nightclub a fire everyone wants to know questions theyre going to ask anyway there are always questions not always he said nudging him with the gun into the nightclub he swerved suddenly whos there he tilted his head listening youre hearing things ben said conscience a diversion he reached down to nurse his hand hurting again then looked up and stopped the wall phone its receiver dangling someone here he moved to his left so that dieter would face away from it stay a sound of movement rustling then a faint cling something touching metal keep him talking hadnt you better close the door the whole studio will hear the shot quiet dieter said listening security would come running dieter looked at him youre right theres not much time more footsteps somewhere a whisper then a hum of one of the studio carts passing outside night sounds air moving through the cottonwoods carpenters no posse coming dieter held the gun out before him theyll hear it yes i heard it too where do you think it came from shall i help them look but not there he nodded to one of the camera cases a thump unmistakable this time inside the sound stage dieter swung toward the bar come out im here liesl said coming up behind him he whirled around and froze taking in the gun in her hand the improbable gown the whole moment inexplicable liesl stop i can shoot get out of here you dont know yes it was you i know now so youd have to kill me too dont talk crazy put down the gun where did you by the door she said simply someone dropped it she looked at ben he started to move toward her but dieter stopped him with the gun no we finish this what do you want liesl said everyone shoots you wont yes i can do it its loaded i checked i took the safety off they taught me for war bride i shoot a soldier whos trying to rape me its my secret so i know how move away from him she said to ben he took a hesitant step but dieter grabbed his upper arm holding him gun still raised no liesl said its enough dieter its the end now not him too she stepped forward to maneuver him away from ben not him too you dont know what youre doing yes now i do her voice trembled a little not as steely my god do you know what i said to him to daniel when he asked me what to do i said go ask dieter hell know what to do the sensible thing i sent him to you and now what you want to shoot me for that a man who was unfaithful to you she shook her head that little lies but for you big lies to everyone he didnt betray me with herwith you she nodded at ben let him go i cant do that dieter said calmly what do you think this is its real now not acting but for a second ben felt the gun still pointed at him that they had merged she was still moving glancing up quickly as if she were hitting marks positioning them for a take under her key go you dont want to see this dieter raised the gun higher to bens head ill shoot she said her voice not as steady still moving no shall i tell you what will happen i have to shoot him its not so nice to see that its better to leave now you wont shoot me my father was right you never listen now he said then clicked back the hammer on his gun go she yelled to ben but all he heard was the explosion in his ear as his body jerked for a second he wasnt sure whether he had ducked or whether this is what it felt like to be shot pushed away by the blast but it was dieter who was staggering the gun no longer at bens head his hand clutching his chest get away liesl yelled ben dived to the floor rolling to the side dieter stood holding himself his eyes disbelieving and turned the gun toward ben again determined to finish ben saw the hand come up the red patch on the chest a sheen of sweat still not dead they stared at each other the only people there then suddenly with a whoosh of air dieter was crumpling one of the overhead lights smashing down on him a terrible thud as the heavy weight hit his body pinning it to the floor ben heard footsteps running on the catwalk liesls name being shouted but his eyes were fixed on dieter gun hand sprawling on the floor the heavy block of metal sliding halfway off his chest his head already open leaking blood he bent over and took the gun from dieters hand not yet trusting death then looked up at liesl she was still holding the gun her hand shaking now eyes blinking behind her someone was climbing down the catwalk ladder is he ben said nothing his head still pounding everything around him slow she looked up to the empty spot in the rigging i tried to move him faster she said vaguely to no one in particular darling you got there bunny said visible now a soft reassurance are you all right she handed him the gun so now ive done this bunny took the gun looking at it suddenly queasy he put one hand to his mouth collecting himself seeing dieters head in the pool of blood then the gun again his eyes darting he breathed out whose he said to ben yours ben nodded from the bureau bunny began wiping it with a handkerchief so itll want explaining you must have left it lying around on your desk so he he turned to liesl go and change before anyone comes you were doing lines in your trailer waiting for him you know how people wander when they visit he held her arms all right im sorry you had to she was staring at dieters body we were fond of each other she said quietly all my life bunny glanced at her alarmed at the trance quality of her voice then held her arms tighter almost a shake well thats what makes it worse isnt it these accidents accidents ben said darling now bunny said to her before the keystones ill be there in a few minutes just stay calm its over he looked at ben giving orders to the gate nobody gives the gate orders was that supposed to be a signal never mind off you go he said to liesl itll hit you now so be careful he looked at her gown something simple a blouse and a skirt all right he was moving to dieter placing liesls gun in his hand she came over to ben touching his bloody hand then moving hers up to his forehead brushing it so she said a whole conversation please bunny said come with him i cant do this alone she said to ben then left slipping out onto the dark lot get rid of that bunny said nodding to dieters gun still in bens hand he looked down at dieters body are you finished now ben didnt answer staring seeing the police photo again the same twisted body same dark blood around the head soon even a crowd around it finished what had he expected to feel this void i found him i know but now there was not even that to keep danny with him no hold bunny twisted something on the metal frame his hand still wrapped in a handkerchief i had a hell of a time with these bolts accident ben said just what were always afraid of bunny said coolly arranging dieters body you should see the insurance premiums he looked up gauging the falls trajectory people dont know they think the equipment of course visitors hes shot he has a bullet in him freakish wasnt it the crash setting that off people who carry guns should keep the safety on you think theyll believe that why not bunny said its what happened he looked at ben isnt it youre covering up a now you listen to me liesls not going to be explaining anything is that understood i mean really understood this time she was never here you came looking people get lost on the lot at night when they dont know where theyre going he paused you might thank me the gun was pointing at you and here we are i have to tell the bureau about dieter it can lead them to the next i dont care what you tell them as long as nothing leads here its an accident in tomorrows papers theyll have to live with that make them he said looking at ben then away shes valuable to the studio anything else here needs taking care of some blood under the japan map a camera got loose down the ramp i saw naturally one of the new ones did she come to find you liesl she was worried we found each other carl called to check on the orders he gave ben another look your hand he said noticing it you better get over to the infirmary patch it up think how you got it will you that makes sense maybe you cut it trying to get the light off him in your haste its got a bullet in it how do we explain that the doctor its the studio infirmary bunny said then held his look ill fix it sunset they had set up bleachers for fans down one side of the long temple entrance to the egyptian and put the cameras and reporters behind a rope down the other the red carpet between the line of studio cars seemed to stretch all the way back to highland the spillover crowd craning necks to look into back windows hoping for glimpses there were searchlights and live radio feeds and an a party scheduled at the grove signs that the premiere itself marked a shift at continental the old modest openings something now out of the gower gulch era ben looked at the giant posters behind the floodlit palmsliesl with her head tilted up her eyes fixed on the gi who was taking her home the real liesl was in a soft offwhite gown and a fox cape and her appearance had drawn oohs from the kids on the sidewalk he watched her on the red carpet surrounded by studio people first greeting the audience waving then turning to tell the reporters how thrilling it all was and wasnt it the air was bright with flashing lights something new the rhythm built up car after car gown after gown heady just to be part of it her escorts were in uniform to represent all the forceseveryones dream war bride dick would follow later another squealing entrance and another interview the soldiers were a nice touch bunny said as they watched from the side you can feel it cant you its going to happen look at them he nodded to the reporters surging around her but keeping a distance some invisible royal line not pushing microphones in her face even polly speaking to her now on the radio seemed respectful paying court ben thought of rosemary at lasners party surrounded everyone smiling her moment whats it costing you ben said dont keep books how much is air time worth mr l never understood that either these people havent even seen the picture and look at them he said still fixed on the reception it just comes to her they all have it that instinct did you bunny didnt answer you dont know her she could walk away from it tomorrow no one ever does bunny said turning no one he took out a cigarette youve been scarce ive been meaning to talk to you come have a smoke he drew them away from the temple courtyard into the lobby waving away some ushers who darted over i wanted you to hear it from me were not picking up rosemarys option why the pictures doing nothing you dumped it now youre an expert on distribution too we didnt dump it its last year so put her in something this year bunny took a drag on his cigarette look i dont know what she is to you but youre a big boy now thats the way it is you know what this is all about youre going to let him tell you who to hire hes finished hes embarrassed hes calling off the hearings for now he may even be in a little trouble next election but hes still in office hell regroup when this starts up again continentals going to be absolutely clean no associations not even relatives or close friends if theyre alive bunny said nothing at first squinting through the smoke reluctant to cross a line thats right if theyre alive they looked at each other for a minute with the weary familiarity of an old couple stuck together by everything that had happened too tired to untangle it hal tells me the pictures finished some dubbing youll be thinking what next they were wondering at fort roach they called you all by themselves bunny stuck the cigarette into the sand of the standing ashtray theyre winding down the exhibitors dont want any more information films the training films ben shrugged my separation papersll come through any day but bunny was going somewhere else theyve agreed to a limited distribution the nuremberg picture didnt do what they hoped this would be the last anyway how limited ben said alert listening to code limited strictly speaking we dont have to distribute at all theres no agreement sol agreed well mr l is still head of the studio bunny looked up keep your socks on you cant do this ben said his throat suddenly tight dump it not this one he saw the pan shot of the guards faces the slow walk into the camp evidence im not dumping it and youre leading with your chin anybody ever tell you not to do that here lasner on the train clutching himself never weak show them what you really want bunny finished i really want this ben said his voice steady its important to whom the dead the survivors it occurred to ben that he had become a believer in images their power to change things even though of course they didnt show the faces maybe thats all it was a record too late but at least it was there the dead are never avenged all we can do is leave markers i said limited major cities after christmas dont worry youll get your credit its not about that bunny raised a disbelieving eyebrow sol wants this picture so you keep saying and i wouldnt want to disappoint him he knows what the exhibitors are like but if we can sell it as what do you want want bunny said raising both eyebrows now im not a pawnshop its a picture not a watch i said id do what i could he paused what id like though is a little favor from you ben waited i hear youve been spending a lot of time at cedars little chats he likes to tell stories ben said carefully wondering where this was going the old days my father funny how that happens he never used to dwell on the past he looked up at ben i know mr l pretty well he getsenthusiastic hes likely to think things can happen that cant happen that people can do thingsand they cant really they dont know enough theyd be in over their heads they could learn not on this job youre ahead of yourself sol hasnt offered me anything then its a good time to move along before it comes up fort roach wherever you dont want to disappoint mr l either how would i do that by having to say no the jobs filled ben gave a quick half smile you really want this he said an echo bunny looked up at him i already have it now take yourself out of it thats not up to me or you sols still head of the studio bunny shook his head not anymore but thats something well keep to ourselves shall we feelings being what they are acting head is fine with me mr l can live with that as long as he does lets make it easier on everybody and whats the favor go away why for fay fay ben said surprised theres a lot you dont know about running a studio the first thingill bet its never even occurred to youis who owns it sol owns it ben said suddenly not sure not all of it not enough you know that rex still has his original eight percent hes very excited about the television deal sam owns a piece too did you know and im happy to say he feels very confident about the direction were taking so does new york very panicky they get when theres a health problem they like a certain stability that leaves sol or rather fay i have enough voting stock to do it without herim already running the studio which seems to escape you but it would be much nicer with one happy family not taking sides squabbling over something that isnt going to happen anyway another direct look at ben some deathbed whim fays been lovely to me id like it to be her idea too sols idea not something that was forced on them in a proxy fight and it wouldnt be if you werent here you really want this ben said quietly its not a lot to ask considering do you think think of all the favors ill have to do for polly now because of you dont do me well its not just you is it pollys a girl who hates being stood up vindictive really she still thinks youre holding out on her but we dont want her going after you opening things up looking into accidents ive got seventeen writers and id still rather just let things lie as they are think of all the people involved luckily polly likes access to studio heads shes not one to hold a grudge when theres so much else she might be doing and of course if youre not here to put her in a temperout of sight out of mind she wont be out of minots mind oh theyll make up well at least go back to their corners they need each other when alls said and done always a point a little gobetween work and before you know it its lunch at chasens and off we go its you they wont forgive theres nothing you can do for them only for you for fay really no point in having any unpleasantness especially when its done youre sure maybe you underestimate me no i did not anymore why do you think were having this chat at all this time we need to understand each other lou he said voice raised eyes over bens shoulders good to see you you know lou katz from abe lastfogels office nice to meet you jesus this is some night waitll you see it i hear i hear listen we should talk sometime about julie who does a musical for two hundred dollars a week i mean its wonderful what youre doing a production like that at continental but shes wonderful too bunny nodded so lets keep her happy monday okay we keep the steps but we can do something on the front end just dont plead poverty not the morris office what its for her shes still in some crappy efficiency on la brea not after this zanuck never saw it well sam pilcer hes got an eye you know ben collier hes producing a documentary for us the end of the war footage you wont believe he looked at ben we think its an important picture san pietro in that class awards even jesus at continental hows sol i hear soso that was something though wasnt it what he pulled with that fuck minot like something out of the movies bunny said flatly the others were moving in now filling the lobby liesl was posing with the servicemen two on each side her father looking slightly lost had arrived with salka she was beaming reminded perhaps of the old opening nights at the ufa palast but no one in the bleachers paid any attention only polly recognized them nodding to ostermann her neighbor at the hearing now someone she mentioned in her columns the conscience of germany there was talk of a nobel shed heard behind her kelly was holding her mike doing a remote check when he looked up he caught bens eye for a minute an odd questioning the sound stage accident mixed up with the cherokee somehow a scent nobody was following ben an inexplicable connection but kelly had moved on to another beat no longer doing cagney and dick marshall was getting out of his car the story hed come for ben went in sitting in one of the back continental rows watching the rest of the audience kissing and waving across aisles a party bunny hurried down front with rex and sam and some men from the front office talking as he went lasner on the carpet at grand central little brian jenkins quick as a bunny then liesl came in between the army and the navy and the lights started to dim it was the kind of company audience that applauded the credits little salutes to their friends imre tabor ten years out of budapest had directed and epstein had done the music and simco the photography all europeans but whatever edge they may once have brought had been smoothed out maybe forgotten it was a studio picture bright every eyebrow in place ben wondered for a second what might have happened to kaltenbach if hed stayed got lucky with exit visa shepherding dannys story through rewrites a vehicle for dick stranger things had happened on the screen a process shot of ruins dissolved to a studio interior the family waiting for the allied liberation then liesls first appearance riding a bicycle hair blowing applause her face in closeup young fearless the one danny must have known in a second a retreating german soldier would grab the bicycle force her into the doorway struggle with her until she got his gun shot him the scene that would come in handy in real life holding the gun steady in the nightclub set standing over dieter on the floor ben standing there too are you finished now bunny had said danny finally avenged but how could you ever be finished with murder an endless accounting there was always more reasons and once you did know what did you do not all deaths are alike liesl was heaving distraught racing to safety now the advancing gi who would discover her deliver her and then come to call the war as continental saw it not the rest of it not what ben had seen he glanced down toward bunny there were a hundred ways he could interfere keep the faces off the screen would it matter what was it worth to them already gone had it mattered to danny dieter finally lying in a pool of his own blood but it had to somehow to us what if we never saw the faces stayed in the dark he felt the hand on his shoulder just as the screen liesl shot the gun making him jump an apologetic publicist drawing him quietly out to the lobby a waiting phone hes asking for you fay said i know youre in the middle is he i dont know he keeps coming back an ox but you called i have a feeling thats all she said her voice small afraid ill be right there the same hospital smell as he walked in sharp disinfectant cutting through air thick with blood and waste the same as dannys hospital all of them the linoleum in the corridor just mopped glared in the overhead light fay was sitting in the room with paulette goddard waiting together maybe as theyd once waited in casting offices to show their beautiful legs now they both looked drawn sober their usual sparkle muted the way his mother might have waited for otto if she had been there if any of them had they squeezed his hand a silent hello sol was lying half propped up eyes closed his skin gray thin hair pasted down with sweat a plastic tube hissed oxygen in his nose and a bottle hung next to him dripping fluid through an iv his face looked slack old the corners of his mouth white with dried saliva hows her picture he said opening his eyes a little the audience likes it sol grunted theyre on the payroll how are you ben said coming over to the bed resting his hand im signing up with arthur murray ill teach you for free fay said sol smiled let me talk to ben for a minute why dont you and paulette get something to eat like birds a celery stick they call it a meal paulette came over and tapped his nose you want me to get fat she said fondly fat he smiled at her another pound wouldnt hurt well be outside fay said to ben she nodded silently to a buzzer on the nightstand if you need me go eat sol said he waited until they left theyre good girls you know they go way back ben nodded how are you feeling his hand still on the sheet seeing ottos bed again but there hadnt been one no hospital room a bullet somewhere no one waiting outside i feel like shit lasner said dont bother with the pills next time he closed his eyes drifting a little you know on the train the way you were it reminded me my first trip out here looking at everything i didnt know what to expect a desert for asthma now he opened his eyes fully lifting his head i want to talk to you minot called off the hearings ben said heading him away yeah he said pleased then sank back against the pillows and then who all these years we made something great here from nothing he looked out as if there might be marquee lights not just dull hospital windows its all going to fall apart now isnt it no its going to change at my age same thing that union business he said another thought on gower street for chrissake to see something like that on gower clubs he was quiet for a minute thinking we had the audience now i dont know you know what i think it was the war everything made money you didnt have to think about the audience maybe they want something else whatever you gave them you think they dont change but how do you go through something like that and not change hows your picture done well put it out after christmas a weak smile first crosby and the nuns then the dead jews he looked at ben so we did that i want to talk to you he said again i have to make some decisions you just have to rest lasner waved his hand i still get tired im tired all the time now you notice they dont send me home i couldnt have nurses there so what do they know i dont know he paused nothing he said answering himself so maybe the only way im getting out of here is in a box dont talk that way you dont have kids you have to think about things whos going to take over keep things going you remember on the train even then i had an idea somebody moves like that keeps his mouth shut you dont always say whats up here he pointed to his head thats like me and ottos kid christ in the blood sol they even give you awhats it mos even the government for chrissake you know what im saying to you what im thinking i cant sol ben said simply lasner waved his hand again fay helps youd be surprised what she knows and maybe im not out of here so fast either who knows you pick things up me and fay want it new york goes along believe me thats how it works ben looked away embarrassed and reached for the water glass on the table the way it used to work here he said drink a little lasner took a sip theres no surprise here he said dont tell me that i see you watching everything figuring it out you know what im saying ben looked at him feeling suddenly winded caught be my son something no one had ever asked him before otto and danny one life passing to the other he felt as if he were actually being touched a stroking along his skin chosen for something already decided no longer in sols hands and for a second he wondered if it were possible bunnys hold fragile enough to loosen would new york really say no to fay would sam a dying mans wishes a fight he might be able to win if he really wanted to but even as he imagined it happening shuffling people in his head he knew that things had already been arranged in a new order any attempt to upset them as futile as lasners grandstanding in the hearing room sol had already lost the studio the point now was to salvage the rest weve always been straight with each other havent we he said somebody says that theyre going to start pulling something sol said ben shook his head you want to do the right thing for the studio call bunny hell be good at it hes a pansy no ben said not flinching hes you he got everything from you he can do it and you cant not like him its all he cares about pictures like you hes got the instinct for pictures maybe but look with minot just roll over so whos going to fight the next one him theres always somebody coming after the studio you want somebodys going to fight you would i saw you do it for hal ben shook his head again i dont even know who the bad guys are anymore lasner made a face impatient its just this business with your brother whatever the hell he was up to its not like that you dont know whats right something like that happens with family thats just it i think everybodys like him now maybe that was the war too i think were all inbetween somewhere gray pictures were never good at inbetween what gray im offering you the studio lasner said his voice rising a gift so priceless any hesitation seemed crazy offer it to bunny sol he can fight hes tougher than i am youre tough enough to say no to this you dont want this what do you want he looked around the hospital room what did he want he thought of watching liesl in the pool of wearing dannys clothes a life that didnt belong to him i dont know yet he said not this just like that lasner said opening his fingers the whole goddam world meaning it ben realized the rest just something vague east of gower i want the picture to come out i want that theres some problem with that lasner said suddenly alert no no bunny wants to give it a big release he paused talk to him hed appreciate it i think coming from you personal like you did you know what it means to me that you asked he looked down ill probably regret it lasner leaned his head back into the pillow thats what he said too otto when he took a powder for germany yet christ what a family if he had stayed here think where hed be today at cedars ben thought the odd transference happening again listening to the oxygen thinking about his credits wondering sol closed his eyes id better go stay a little lasner said reaching his hand out to anchor bens dont leave me ben felt the hand still warm but light as if it were disappearing think about it lasner said you dont want to decide too quick something like this okay ben said both of them saving face he glanced out the window feeling claustrophobic another hospital room his mother had held on to him too danny now solottowhoever he was one more loss how many people could you lose before there was no one left he stayed like that for a while watching sols face almost expecting the shallow breathing to stop both of them at an end you could hear the footsteps outside rubbersoled nurses answering calls just like the ones outside dannys room dieter waiting in the hall picturing it over and over in his head making the final cut not all deaths are alike then even the footsteps stopped the hospital asleep how long should he stay fay would want to be here he slid his hand out from under a silent goodbye sol opened his eyes again what do you want he said still puzzled a real question ben stood there for a second then patted sols hand i want you to get some rest he said because it was better not to say anything else war bride would be over now so he headed straight to the grove the afterparty was even more lavish than the premiere fake palm trees this time but an orchestra and passing trays of champagne glasses liesl was being photographed yet again hundreds of pictures tonight alone primitive peoples thought one could rob the soul i wonder what her mother would have said ostermann said making conversation but stiff all this your own child youre well i havent seen you since dieters funeral an endless afternoon in pasadena all the emigres long tributes from faculty members flowers from continental henderson deep in the back just to see who came shes a success ben said nodding toward the photographers maybe it takes her mind off things its a difficult time for her she was his favorite always spoiling her ben thought of her looking down the gun still in her hand another thing that had never happened the camera bolt loose in the rigging nobodys fault i wish id known him better ben said a polite phrase now surreal ive been wonderingyou dont mind when you asked me about the hospital daniel why did you want to know ben shrugged loose ends i was remembering that day and then i couldnt like a crossword you cant finish it bothered me thats all ah ostermann said looking at him blankly a translation he didnt quite get dont mention it to liesl i think it still upsets her thinking about it yes but you know one has to be sensible it was a mercy so much brain damage all the doctors said he would have beenwhat who knows but not himself still her husband and your brother ostermann said slowly wanting to say something then deciding to hold back instead ah liesl salkas looking for you she said kissing him on the cheek ben could smell her perfume something new her hair was shiny lit up and he thought of paulette on the train the same glow movie stars she turned to face him suddenly awkward how have you been congratulations he said taking in the party you moved from that place she said ignoring this im bunking in with hal until the pictures out then im going back he said a decision just made but clear as if someone had turned on a light work for the newsreel back to germany wherever they send me he said suddenly filling up with it the whole world east of gower where it wouldnt matter what polly thought whether minot held a grudge if you knew things you shouldnt know where everyone else lived youre leaving here liesl said the pictures finished theres no reason to stay maybe its better ostermann said then selfconscious began to back away well ill find salka what did he mean ben said watching him go he doesnt understand the newspaper what you said about daniel how you could do it i cant explain you know its one of those things we cant talk about danny was spying on him but to tell a newspaperits confusing to him people always made excuses for danny maybe we all need that someone to make excuses she bit her lower lip why are you leaving too many people to avoid its easier to get out of the way she said nothing for a minute taking this in you cant even look at me anymore i always thought a secret it makes people closer but its the opposite thats all were going to see now when we look at each other what happened lets not talk about it it didnt happen remember thats why you never come to the house anymore i didnt think youd want to see me after everything the things i said in the office he looked over to her i made a mistake im sorry but that doesnt count for much does it it doesnt matter yes it does to think that you must have he stopped meeting her eyes im sorry no dont be sorry not about anything he was still for a second then looked away uncomfortable i have to go not like this come with me a minute she began pulling him away from the club floor the partys for you for them no one will notice come they went down the side hall to the parking lot entrance outside the same scent of orange trees the row of palms outlined beyond the cars weve been here before he said the memory of it tangible yes and then up with dieter and all the time he she broke off and reached up putting her hand behind his neck what are you doing he said feeling her breath we cant leave it like this i know you why you said those things you know what i remember you said was any of it real so bitter you already knew the answer but its wrong it was real i never lied to you you just pretended i was someone else maybe i did too she looked down always the same always putting him there he wasnt youre in love with him what a boy you are she said moving her hand across the back of his head smoothing his hair you think its like war bride love forever but how can it be like that nothing is like that you know when we first left home left germany i thought its all finished for me everything but then vienna france all right its somewhere new not the same but i can live here i think its like that not the same another place but you can live there for a while and you dont forget it its something special to you somewhere you lived he looked at her silent his skin alive with her again as long as it lasts she smiled weakly her hand moving to the side of his face its not enough for you a place you can live there was no one else there nobody was like you the way it felt it was different when i was next to you the way we used to lie there it wasnt somebody else how could it be it was you and now it isnt no she said softly not anymore she leaned into him putting her head down liesl just stay for a minute like this like before he felt her against him as natural as his own skin and for a second he was weightless not holding on to anything falling all he would have to do was lift her head another second passed suspended then he leaned down kissed her hair and stepped back it cant be like before not now she looked away then nodded i know i just dont want to forget the way it is now thats not how it always was maybe i want you to remember too somedayi dont know well be in a room somewhere setting a scene her voice caught up in it years from now an accident and you see me i want you to think i used to live there once it was nice he stood for a minute unable to move in the scene with her ill remember he said finally she opened her mouth to speak and then stopped out of lines instead she nodded then kissed him lightly on the cheek a goodbye lets not say any more then she said no he said watching her turn and move to the door secrets didnt bring you closer he thought of all the things hed never say now things only he would know how he went over that day in the hospital in his mind working out its choreography who was where until finally he thought he knew and then asked ostermann to make sure that dieter had always been with him never alone that only she had been in the room that all deaths were not alike that some secrets had to be kept that she was the only place hed ever lived he heard the band music through the door no one would miss him he drove to the egyptian to catch the late showing the picture had already started so he slipped into a back row a scene hed already been in liesl looking up at him luminous catching all the light i dont care she said eyes darting her face soft with love she leaned forward to kiss the gi and the audience seemed to lean forward with her no sound not even a gum wrapper i dont care everyone in the scene now wanting her thinking she was wonderful authors note s tardust is a work of fiction not history and readers familiar with the period will see that liberties a few chronological have been taken with events that inspired some of its scenes labor unrest in hollywood actually began before the war was over in early but reached its most violent stage in the fall as in the street brawl here an information film about the nuremberg trials that justice be done was released in october but no feature film about the death camps themselves was ever made or so far as i know contemplated a rough documentary compilation of captured newsreels about the camps we accuse was released in may minots hearings are meant to be a premature trial run a preview of huacs assault on hollywood in but even in representative rankin had announced the committees intention to investigate hollywood one of the most dangerous plots ever instigated for the overthrow of this government and california state senator tenneys fourteen thousand files had been compiled during the war and were certainly in place then jack warner did indeed become a friendly witness but for reasons of his own not those suggested here no studio head in fact ever stood up to the committee after a meeting in november at the waldorfastoria hotel some fifty studio executives issued the anticommunist waldorf statement effectively starting a blacklist that would last for a decade sol lasners principled stand here is imagined something that might have happened in the movies

at joseph kanons istanbul passage available from atria books excerpt from istanbul passage copyright by joseph kanon kanon joseph stardust bebek the first attempt had to be called off it had taken days to arrange the boat and the safe house and then just a few hours before the pickup the wind started a poyraz howling down from the northeast scooping up water as it swept across the black sea the bosphorus waves usually no higher than boat wakes by the time they reached the shuttered yalis along the shore now churned and smashed against the landing docks from the quay leon could barely make out the asian side strings of faint lights hidden behind a scrim of driving rain who would risk it even the workhorse ferries would be thrown off schedule never mind a bribed fishing boat he imagined the fisherman calculating his chances a violent sea sightless hoping the sudden shape forty meters away wasnt a lumbering freighter impossible to dodge or another day safe in port securing ropes and drinking plum brandy by the castiron stove who could blame him only a fool went to sea in a storm the passenger could wait days of planning called by the weather how much longer mihai said pulling his coat tighter they were parked just below rumeli hisari watching the moored boats tossing pulling against their ties give it another half hour if hes late and im not here hes not late mihai said dismissive he glanced over hes that important i dont know im just the delivery boy its freezing mihai said turning on the motor this time of year leon smiled in istanbuls dream of itself it was always summer ladies eating sherbets in garden pavilions caiques floating by the city shivered through winters with braziers and sweaters somehow surprised that it had turned cold at all mihai ran the heater for a few minutes then switched it off burrowing turtlelike into his coat so come with me but no questions leon rubbed his hand across the window condensation clearing it theres no risk to you wonderful something new you couldnt do this yourself hes coming out of constancia for all i know he only speaks romanian then what sign language but you mihai waved this off hell be german one of your new friends you dont have to do this its a small favor ill get it back he lit a cigarette so that for a second leon could see his grizzled face and the wiry saltandpepper hair on his head now more salt than pepper when they had met it had been dark and wavy styled like the bucharest dandy hed once been known in all the cafes on the calea victoriei besides to see the rats leaving he said brooding they wouldnt let us out now look at them you did what you could a palestinian passport free to come and go in bucharest to beg for funds leasing creaky boats a last lifeline until that was taken away too mihai drew on the cigarette staring at the water running down the windshield so how is it with you he said finally you look tired leon shrugged not answering why are you doing this he turned to face him the wars over yes nobody told me no they want to start another one nobody i know be careful you dont get to like it you start enjoying it his voice trailed off rough with smoke the accent still balkan even now then its not about anything anymore a habit like these he said holding out his cigarette you get a taste for it leon looked at him and you nothing changes for us were still saving jews he made a wry face now from our friends no visas for palestine where should they go poland and im helping you talk to a nazi a wonderful world why a nazi why all this some poor

whoever he is id better call make sure theres a cafe mihai leaned forward to start the car again ill pull around no stay here i dont want the car i see you run across the road in the rain get wet then you run back again wet to a waiting car that will be less suspicious if anyone is watching he put the car in gear its your car leon said thats all you think they havent seen it by now have they youd know he said a question always assume yes he made a turn across the road pulling up in front of the cafe so do the expected thing stay dry tell me something if he had come your package was i going to drive him towherever hes staying no mihai nodded better he motioned his head to the side window make the call before they wonder there were four men playing dominoes and sipping tea from tulip glasses when they looked up he became what he wanted them to seea ferengi caught in the rain shaking water from his hat needing a phone and he flushed a little pulse of excitement a taste for it had mihai seen it somehow the way it felt getting away with something the planning the slipping away tonight hed taken the tram to the last stop in bebek and walked up to the clinic a trip hed made over and over if hed been followed theyd stay parked a block away from the clinic gates and wait relieved to be snug out of the rain knowing where he was but just past the big oleander bushes hed headed for the garden side gate doubling back to the bosphorus road where mihai was waiting feeling suddenly free almost exhilarated no one would have seen him in the dark if they were there theyd be smoking bored thinking he was inside this other life just walking to the car was all his own the phone was on the wall near the wc no sounds in the room but the click of tiles and the hiss of boiling water so the token seemed to clang going in a ferengi speaking english the men would say if anyone asked tommy at home luckily not out to dinner ah i was hoping youd call he said a genial club voice with the clink of ice at the back of it youre after that report i know i know and my steno never showed trouble with the boats typical isnt it first hint of weather and the ferries leon imagined his round face at the other end the jaw line filling in fleshy i can have it for you tomorrow all right i mean the contracts all right were just waiting for the quotas ive had american tobacco on the phone half the day so youre all in the same boat on this one all we need now are the signatures at commercial corp the wartime agency that was tommys cover at the consulate thats all right im stuck here at the clinic anyway just wanted to check if it was on its way no tomorrow now sorry about this let me make it up to you buy you a drink at the park an off note this late im in bebek ill get a head start an order then dont worry ill roll you home their standard joke leons apartment building just down the hill from the park hotel before aya pasa made its wide curve give me an hour from bebek surprised an edge now take a look outside itll be a crawl in this just save a me stool the domino players were looking down pretending not to listen but what would they have made of it anyway leon ordered a tea a way of thanking the barman for the phone the glass was warm in his hand and he realized he was cold everywhere else the wet beginning to seep through his shoes and now the park everyone looking and not looking tommys oldboy voice getting louder with each drink rain check he said to mihai getting into the car you free tomorrow mihai nodded somethings up were having a drink at the park very exciting the tobacco business leon smiled it used to be in fact it had been sleepy as routine and predictable as a book of hours agents bought the cured latakia leaf and he arranged the shipments then took the train to ankara to get the export permits leave haydarpasa at six arrive the next morning at ten thats how it had started carrying things on the train for tommy papers they couldnt put in the diplomatic pouch something for the war effort no money involved then an american helping out not just standing around at the club getting drunk with socony and liggett amp myers and western electric the men interchangeable lucky businessmen sitting out the war tommy asked him to help commercial corp buy up chromium so the germans wouldnt get it and suddenly he was in the war after all the peculiar one that played out over dinner at abdullahs or those consulate receptions where the sides lined up on either end of the room cocktail wars what surprised him later when he knew more was how many others were in it too tracking shipping through the straits collecting gossip turning a commercial attache who needed the money everyone spinning webs watching each other the turkish emniyet watching them nothing sleepy anymore ill drop you home youll want to change no just back to the village i want to go to the clinic just look in mihai waited until they were almost there how is she the same leon said his voice neutral and then there was nothing to say still hed asked anna was still alive to him a presence not just someone in obstbaums clinic who had retreated into herself gone somewhere behind her own eyes people used to ask all the time painful questions at the club an awkward concern at the office but gradually they began to forget she was still there out of sight out of mind except leons a wound that wouldnt close any day she might come back just as quickly as she had gone away someone had to be there waiting you know what i think mihai said what sometimes i think you do this for her to prove something i dont know what leon was quiet not answering do you still talk to her mihai said finally yes tell her we got a boat out shell like that past the british patrols so far otherwise wed be in cyprus tell her three hundred we saved three hundred he took the same side street back the same garden entrance hed expected to have to ring but the door was unlocked and he frowned annoyed the staff had been so careless but no one was trying to get out and who would want to get in the clinic was really a kind of nursing home a place to be out of the way dr obstbaum had been one of the german refugees welcomed by ataturk in the thirties to help the new republic get up on its feet the ones who could afford it had moved to bebek or closer in ortakoy where hillsides covered in fir trees and lindens may have reminded them of home or maybe lemminglike they had simply followed the first settler most of the clinics medical staff was still german which leon had thought might help her own language something she would understand if she was still listening but of course the nurses the people who bathed her and fed her and chattered around her were turkish so in the end he realized it didnt matter and now he worried that she was more isolated than ever dr obstbaum himself encouraged leon to talk we have no idea what she hears this form of melancholia it may be a matter of responding not awareness her brain hasnt shut down otherwise she wouldnt be breathing or have any motor functions the idea is to keep up the level of activity over time maybe it grows so music does she hear it i dont know but the brain does somewhere something functions not disturbing music but things she knew had played at home lovely notes to fill the silence in her if she heard them most of the time i think im talking to myself leon had said everyone here talks to himself obstbaum had said a puckish joke one of lifes great pleasures evidently you at least are being asked its late the nurse said in turkish a hushed whisper her eyes glancing down to the water dripping from his coat is she asleep ill just say goodnight im sorry about but the nurse was already opening the door brusque the clients whims no business of hers hed sit and talk the way he always did and shed have to check back again another round but it was a private clinic and he was paying anna was lying in bed the room shadowy only a dim nightlight on when he touched her hand she opened her eyes but looked at him without recognition it was the disconcerting thing the way her eyes took in what was happening around her without responding having her hair brushed people moving across the room things happened far away just little blurs of movement how are you feeling he said warm enough theres a terrible storm he nodded toward the french windows the sound of rain on the glass she didnt say anything but he no longer expected her to even her hand didnt touch back when he talked he answered for her silent responses to keep things going sometimes sitting next to her hed actually hear her voice in his head a ghost conversation even worse than talking to himself but this is nice isnt it he said indicating the room cozy gemutlich as if a change of language would matter he let her hand go and sat down in the chair when they first met shed never seemed to stop talking bubbling over switching from german to english as if one language couldnt contain it everything she had to say and her eyes had been everywhere ahead of the words sometimes waiting for them to catch up lighting up her face the odd thing was that the face was still her own stopped in time the wonderful skin the soft line of her cheek everything just the way it always had been aging itself put off while she was away only the eyes were different vacant i saw mihai tonight he sends his love he said they got a boat through people are getting out again something that might register what she cared about dont try to startle her obstbaum had said just ordinary things domestic matters but how did obstbaum know had he been to where she lived now did it matter to her that fatma had been ill sent her sister to do the cleaning three hundred he said so they must be operating again mossad who else could it be a boat that big he stopped the last thing he should have said a reminder obstbaum thought it had happened then when the bratianu sank corpses bobbing in the water children her brain turning away from it drawing a curtain obstbaum had even suggested she be put in a garden room not a front one facing the bosphorus where ships passed all day each one a possible reminder leon had gone along with him everyone in istanbul wanted to see the water in ottoman times there had been laws about builders blocking the view so a garden room was cheaper and it was pleasant looking toward the hillside cypresses and umbrella pines and a judas tree that dropped pink blossoms in the spring a fortune back home but something he could manage here and not a boat in sight i thought i might need romanian they bring someone out but they dont tell you who they want me to babysit i got georgs old landlord to find me a room out near aksaray theyll never think to look in a muslim neighborhood and then the weather started up he caught himself hearing the sound of his voice saying names out loud telling her what he didnt want anyone to know all the slipping away and doublebacking for nothing it occurred to him one more irony that since she had gone away they could finally talk to each other all the things they couldnt say before other peoples secrets now safe to talk about some things anyway now there were other drawers you didnt open things you didnt say your parents are dead we havent heard but they must be theyre not on any lists you cant imagine what it was like how many the pictures i see a woman just for the sex it used to feel wrong and now i wait for it not like us something different i dont think youre ever coming back i cant say it cant say it to you but i think its true i dont know why this happened to us what i did what you did better to keep those drawers closed i ran into gus hoover soconys sending him home you still cant get a boat though so what do you think theyre putting him on the clipper hell of a lot of money but i guess theyve got it to spend can you see reynolds doing it for me not that i want to go but you always wanted to didnt you see new york he paused leaving time for an answer maybe when youre better we cant really move you now like this and i can take care of you here he motioned his hand to the room you could get better here he paused again maybe if youd try obstbaum says it isnt a question of that but what if it is you could try everything could be the way it was better the wars over all the terrible things knowing as he said it that they werent over people still in camps boats still being turned around everything she had gone away to escape still happening what was there to come back for him the drawer he shouldnt open was it my fault another casualty of the war obstbaum had said but what if she had left the world to leave him something only she knew and wasnt coming back to answer not ever gus would fly home all the others and he would still be here talking to himself while she stared at the garden you have to be patient obstbaum had said the mind is like an eggshell it can withstand tremendous pressure but if it cracks its not so easy to put it back together a humpty dumpty explanation as good as any other but it was leon who was sitting here his world that had been cracked open i have to go soon tommy wants to have a drink at the park on a night like this not that rain ever kept tommy from a drink still you know what occurred to me he wants to bring me inside run my own operation i mean a job like this tonight its not messenger work anymore thered be money in it its about time he babbling filling time do you have everything you need he got up and went over to the bed putting his hand on the dark hair fanning out beneath her lightly just grazing it because there was something unreal about physical contact now touching someone who wasnt there and there was always a moment when he flinched apprehensive expecting her to reach up and snatch at his hand finally mad he passed the back of his hand over her forehead a soothing motion and she closed her eyes to it looking for a second the way she used to after they made love drifting get some sleep he said quietly ill be back but not tomorrow in the beginning hed come every night a kind of vigil but then days slid by filled with other things because the worst part was that without even wanting to hed begun to leave her too outside he walked through the village to the shore road glancing at parked cars but he wouldnt see them would he not if they were any good after a while you developed an instinct the turkish police had been clumsy when anna worked with mihai theyd park someone in the lobby of the continental where mossad had its office a bored policeman in a business suit who must have thought himself invisible behind the cigarette smoke the work had been open arranging visas for the weekly train to baghdad the overland route to palestine just a trickle of refugees but legal the police watched anna go to the red crescent offices watched her check the manifest lists at sirkeci watched the transfer to haydarpasa a pattern so familiar they never thought to look anywhere else when the illegal work began mihais boats they were still following anna to sirkeci still smoking in the lobby later her work became a cover for leon too it was the jewish wife working for mossad who needed watching not her american husband once hed been playing tennis at the sumer palas in tarabya when a man he assumed to be police wanted a quiet word his wife no doubt well meaning but her activities were attracting attention turkey was a neutral country they were its guests it was a husbands duty to watch over his household nobody wanted to be embarrassed not the rj reynolds company not the turkish government leon remembered standing speechless in front of the old hotel staring at the famous hydrangea bushes a silence the man took for alarm trying not to smile to savor the unexpected gift anna suspect not him but that had been the locals the emniyet the security police were something else never obvious part of the air everyone breathed playing the home advantage when macfarland had been station head he was convinced theyd planted somebody inside which would mean they might know about leon too even unofficial off the books tommy didnt just pull the money out of his pocket where would they find him miscellaneous expenses jobs tommy wanted to freelance out like tonight the square was empty no tram in sight just two women huddled under umbrellas waiting for a dolmus and then improbably there was a single taxi maybe out here on a run from taksim leon stopped it glancing over his shoulder as he got in half expecting to see headlights turning on a car starting up but no one followed he looked out back only a thin line of traffic everyone chased inside by the rain in arnavutkoy a car pulled in behind then went off again leaving them alone no one unless the taxi was emniyet but then the driver started to complain about something the details lost in the swoosh of the windshield wipers and leon gave that up too so much for instinct maybe he hadnt had to do any of it sneak out of the clinic meet mihai in the road maybe no one watched anymore maybe mihai was right it had become a habit tommy had already had a few by the time leon got to the park his face red cheeks shining with it his broad shoulders still had the strong lines of someone whod once played for penn but the rest of him had gone slack pudgy from years of sitting and extra helpings christ youre soaking whatd you do walk here take the chill off mehmet how about two more of the same well have them over there he said lifting himself off the stool with a little grunt and heading for a small table against the woodpaneled wall there were more people than leon had expected probably hotel guests who didnt want to go out but still plenty of empty tables the long outside terrace with its view of the stamboul headland had been closed for weeks leon remembered them both full waiters with trays darting in and out like birds people talking over each other looking around to see who was there what the stork must be like sorry about tonight tommy said didnt know myself till i got the message there wont be any problem about the place will there no ive got it for the month i didnt know how long hed the month how much is that going to run us its in laleli cheap you can afford it laleli where the fucks that on the asian side leon smiled how long have you been here tommy shrugged this off and what do we do with it after we move him you could take your women there nice and private yeah just us and the fleas ah here we are he said as the drinks arrived thank you mehmet he raised his glass blue skies and clear sailing leon raised his glass and took a sip cold and crisp a whiff of juniper mehmet put down a silver bowl of pistachios and backed away christ imagine what hes heard tommy said watching him go all these years maybe he doesnt listen they all listen the question is who for besides us tommy ignored this they used to say every waiter in this room got paid twice and sometimes more at the same time remember the one used to send little love notes to von papen then turn around feed the same thing to the brits he shook his head amused six months he pulls this off you have to hand it to him what good did it do anybody ever say anything at the park that you wanted to know tommy smiled you live in hope you live in hope anyway that wasnt the point was it point was to know what they were saying what they werent saying might be useful to somebody who could put the pieces together you think there was somebody like that christ i hope so otherwise he let it go ill tell you something though it was fun too this place goddam threering circus everybody same room packy macfarland over there and that kraut who kept pretending he was in the navy right next to him navy and the jap tashima remember him with the glasses a spit of fucking tojo at first i thought it was him and mehmets listening to all of them the good old days tommy looked up caught by his tone come on tommy its a little early for last rites at the park mehmets still listening god knows who else for what its worth tommy shook his head its finished this place leon looked around feeling the drink a little well the germans are gone and tojo thats what we wanted to happen right i mean the whole place neutral city in a war everybodys got an interest turks coming in staying out whats everybody up to now what now its just going to be turks youve still got me meeting boats leon said finishing his glass were still here not for long what do you mean tommy looked away then raised his hand to signal for another round youre going home leon guessed we need to talk thats why were having the drink not a new job tommy nodded theyre rolling up the operation dont react which operation here all of us well most you washington you know september they handed us over to the war department couldnt get rid of bill fast enough i guess what g wanted all along r ampa went to state whole unit now theyre research intelligence office of but the field whats the war department going to do with field officers wars over tell that to the russians leon said thats europe not here christ leon you didnt think wed just keep going here forever did you after the war he said his tone slightly defensive ah mehmet making room for the new drinks some banter leon didnt hear as he watched tommys face the red cheeks moving as he talked knowing it was coming arranging his own transfer taking care of business a desk at the war department or something closer to the mayflower bar he looked down at the fresh drink his stomach queasy now what back to the desk at reynolds days without edge when does this happen end of the month just like that what about me you i thought youd be glad its over you never wanted i had to talk you into it remember though i have to say you took right to it best i had you know that dont you that i always thought that he moved his hand as if he were about to put it on leons but stopped i could put in a word for you i mean knowing turkish thats something but theyre closing the shop here everything back to g and you dont want to join the army do you he looked over the brim of his glass its time to go home leon owis already packed up everybodys going home i havent been back to the states in what ten years now you dont want to stay here whats here my life get reynolds to transfer you back be a big shot in the tobacco business would they an office in a long corridor of offices sharing a secretary not his own corner overlooking taksim a house in raleigh with a small yard not the flat on aya pasa looking all the way to the sea of marmara anna where he shook his head i dont want to move anna shes doing so well now real progress a move now the lie effortless one of the reasons hed been the best shed do even better in the states if you ask me they could do something for her there hospitals here he stopped you look all funny what is it the money the money leon snorted what you pay thats not enough to notice just enough to make a difference its the drink i guess he said pushing it away im beat all the waiting around he looked up feeling tommy staring at him alert behind the glassy eyes i never did it for money you know i know i appreciate that im surprised were pulling out thats all be a little dull pushing paper at the office want to push some more theyre going to need somebody at western electric middle east account the whole territory guy in charge now is leaving for washington so i hear you had someone at western too now now like to keep your bets all over the table dont you separate drawers separate secrets safer that way youll be running out of covers soon no more lendlease no more owi western electric even the guy in the tobacco business what guy leon smiled im going to miss you i guess when do you go

and he got these how that i couldnt say fell off a truck maybe things do want another leon shook his head id better go start being invisible here finish this well since im paying leon stood up some evening tomorrow then one more and youre a free man leon looked at him disconcerted by the phrase who is he tommy hell answer to john as in johann german as in john doe he glanced up no funny business okay let washington ask the questions just do your piece therell be a bonus in it if i can talk them into it i dont care about that thats right good of the country still think of it as i dont know for
